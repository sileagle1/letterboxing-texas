                        Does anyone have information about a box that was in Veterans Park in Arlington Texas?  We are going there tomorrow and can't find the box listed on either website.
 
Thanks,

Mike,
 
We should all be lucky 
enough sometime in our life to have someone feel about us like you felt about 
Parker.  I am so sorry for your terrible loss.
