                        OK, I did it!  I planted my first box.  Of course as soon as I did I started second guessing myself.  I'll get better at this, I'm sure.

                        Is anyone in the Austin area interested in meeting up for lunch on Saturday?  I’m staying with family in Cedar Park so something on the northern side of town would work best.   Regards,Open Space
