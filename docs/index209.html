                        Do you still have a copy of the directions for Duck Creek#2? Couldn't find
them in the letterboxing basement. Has someone confirmed that the box is
definitely missing?

Does anyone know if the 3 letterboxes listed in the basement for El 
Paso are MIA? 
Will be in El Paso for a week and hoping to get a chance to look for 
them.
