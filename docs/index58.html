                        It would definitely be a bad idea to use a baby bear for bear stew.   They are too sweet and you just can't have that much sugar In a stew!

                        Maybe you could cut your recipe and use a Baby Bear.  I know where you can find one and you could use the TX Traveling Circus as bait.
