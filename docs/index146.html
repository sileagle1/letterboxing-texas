Thanks to all who 
helped with my dual listing LBNA/AQ question.  I just fixed the boxes on 
LBNA, so clues to "A Box of Legos"  and "Eye Spy Houston" should be much 
easier to find.  MO5

Thanks for the 
compliment, Lore.  If the stamp is cool it is mostly because it is of one 
very cool Long Tall Texan.  It was carved with much admiration for said 
person.  MO5
