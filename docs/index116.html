                        Welcome, welcome. You can catch frogs and hunt for letterboxes at the same time. I almost brought home a turtle on my tour bus excursion, but I felt that the turtle had done nothing (besides poop) to...

                        Texas Tour Bus 2 has been sitting out in the West Texas sun under a 
piece of tin for a few days now.  Why hasn't Desert Warrior or El Lobo 
found it yet?  Just wondering.
