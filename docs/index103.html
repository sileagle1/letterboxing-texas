Silver 
Eagle,
 
I think the park you 
have chosen looks great.  That is a beautiful part of Texas, and I have 
heard nothing but good things about the LCRA parks.  Can't wait until

I took Dewberry's advice and decided to use the Krylon fusion paint on my letterboxes instead of camo tape. I went to our local Home Depot and Lowe's and neither of them carry Krylon paints, so...
