We went trout fishing up north this weekend and of course had to 
place two new boxes.  Look under my Kantexan boxes in Eastern 
Oklahoma in Gore for the first two of my "Lost Texan" series....

                        Today I tried to check on "Picnic in the Park" in Landa Park.  I say 
tried, because it wasn't there.  I will mark it as "missing" on the
