                        Check out the box we planted today at the Fort Worth Stock Show and Rodeo.  I hope you all have a chance to visit this year--we always have a blast.

                        I took advantage of a Scout Campout this weekend to replace my Texana 
Titmouse box at Lake Texana SP.  It has a new stamp and new name 
(Titmouse 2), so consider it a new find.
