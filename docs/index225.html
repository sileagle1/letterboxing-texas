                        The Birds of a Feather Family decided to drive to the Sam Houston National Forest near Montgomery, Tx this cold and wet day.  The raindrops were beautiful hanging from the pine needles.

No snow here in southeast (TX-LA border) Texas. 
Just the dreaded rain. ALL WEEK. The local TV channel is calling for the chance

                        My thoughts on kids' activities is to have an

ages.
