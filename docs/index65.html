                        Chrispy, maybe everyone's too busy finding Easter eggs to look for the tour bus, so, if you're back home soon, maybe you'll be still have a chance!  Just plan on a little detour north of the lake...

                        Who knows, Chrispy? No one has claimed picking up the bus yet, so maybe it will still be available by the time you return. Have fun in Puerto Rico.
