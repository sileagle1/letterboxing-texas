                        I agree! There are so many unique places I might have missed if it weren't for a letterbox, most recent would be Barney Smith's Toilet Seat Art Museum in San Antonio. Barney (91) is incredible!Happy...

                        The other day somebody in my family was reading an article in a TX magazine about Grapevine and asked me what county it was in.  I surprised them by correctly answering Tarrant.  They asked "How...
