<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333399">I have to tell you
guys the truth – I was very upset about the Gryphon box being missing - more
so than any other box we’ve lost.  We had absolutely no hopes of
actually catching dear GG, but we loved the idea of possibly making contact
with him/her through a humorous box.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333399">So when we first checked
on it and found it missing, <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Stillwater</st1:place></st1:city>
and I searched all the surrounding bushes, hoping it had just been misplaced.
When I finally had to admit it was gone, my LSS tried to cheer me up by saying
he was positive GG had snabbed it and was chortling somewhere about foiling our
plans. Barefoot Lucy had another entertaining thought: that GG had taken it and
would re-hide it somewhere! This actually DID cheer me up! I would love to
think we had engaged him/her in playing!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333399">But it kept nagging at
me -so yesterday evening, after successfully finding Cadenza’s “No
Directions Needed” box ( really great stamp &amp; location, BTW), I asked
Stillwater if he would help me look through the bushes and pond one more time
for the Gryphon Bait box. I know he thought it was a doomed expedition, but he
humored me. (That’s what good LSS’s do, isn’t it?)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333399">Well, I’ll cut

<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:#333399">Here’s the weird
part – there were no other stamps other than ours &amp; Tx2Chics, but it
was in an entirely different place than the original spot. The box has a Velcro
strap to attach to the branches of the bushes, but it was strapped onto the
base of a bush and was sitting on the ground. The tiny plastic baggie was
missing, but the log and stamp seem undamaged. Instead of over the 2<sup>nd</sup>
drainpipe, it was kind of close to the 1<sup>st</sup> drainpipe – several
feet away. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

I have been musing over this for awhile, but can’t figure it out. Our
best guess is that perhaps a Noxer stumbled upon it and opened it up, looked at
it &amp; just didn’t know where to put it back? It truly wasn’t in
a spot where folks would normally look or linger, but LSS thinks that perhaps
kids found it, showed their parents and were encouraged to put it back, but
goofed slightly? (I think he has way too much faith in most kids and most
parents!)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

<div>This is fantastic news (that the clever Gryphon Bait LB was found)! Yep! I doubled checked to make sure I had it back at the 2nd drainpipe and it was velcroed, hanging from the branch not on the ground, so obviously someone did mess with it. But I am perplexed too - if it were our GG friend, why wouldn't he stamp it before moving it? The mystery shrouding GG continues.

<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #333399; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">But it kept nagging at me -so yesterday evening, after successfully finding Cadenzas No Directions Needed box ( really great stamp &amp; location, BTW), I asked Stillwater if he would help me look through the bushes and pond one more time for the Gryphon Bait box. I know he thought it was a doomed expedition, but he humored me. (Thats what good LSSs do, isnt it?)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #333399; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Well, Ill cut to the chase  we FOUND it!!!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><font color="#333399" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: #333399; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">Heres the weird part  there were no other stamps other than ours &amp; Tx2Chics, but it was in an entirely different place than the original spot. The box has a Velcro strap to attach to the branches of the bushes, but it was strapped onto the base of a bush and was sitting on the ground. The tiny plastic baggie was missing, but the log and stamp seem undamaged. Instead of over the 2<sup>nd</sup> drainpipe, it was kind of close to the 1<sup>st</sup> drainpipe  several feet away. <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>

Our best guess is that perhaps a Noxer stumbled upon it and opened it up, looked at it &amp; just didnt know where to put it back? It truly wasnt in a spot where folks would normally look or linger, but LSS thinks that perhaps kids found it, showed their parents and were encouraged to put it back, but goofed slightly? (I think he has way too much faith in most kids and most parents!)<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
