                    <div class="plaintext-content">Even though a perfect hiding place probably doesn't exist, all <br/>
letterboxers strive to find the best one they can when placing a <br/>
box.  But what constitutes the perfect hiding place?  For me, ideally <br/>
it would be a place easy to get to but not likely to be visited by <br/>
noxers; safe from weather, critters and evil plants; and near a <br/>
secluded bench or place to sit while stamping with no bugs.  But even <br/>
if this place could be found, there is no guarantee it would stay <br/>
that way since the environment is constantly changing and a box is <br/>
only hidden as well as the last finder left it.  Therefore, I'm <br/>
afraid luck plays a bigger part in box longevity than we would like.  <br/>
It is still important to find the best hiding spot you can, but <br/>
without a little luck, your box still might not make it.<br/>
<br/>
My first placed box (Zube Zephyr) is the perfect example of the "luck <br/>
factor".  I did find a secluded spot rarely, if ever, visited by <br/>
noxers, but it was still found by several Geocachers before TX <br/>
Letterboxers finally arrived.  Luckily it survived.  I also concealed <br/>
it behind a log on the ground thinking that would protect it further, <br/>
not realizing the nearby creek was prone to flooding.  Sure enough, a <br/>
flood came and washed the box away, but by sheer chance a letterboxer <br/>
visited the next day and found it floating in the creek nearby.  They <br/>
salvaged the contents that were still relatively dry thanks to <br/>
ziplock bags and rehid the box.  Another lucky break.  I now have the <br/>
box wrapped in camo tape and strapped to the back of a tree 4 feet <br/>
above ground near the original spot.  I figured it needed all the <br/>
protection I could give it since it has probably used up all its luck <br/>
quota.<br/>
<br/>
When I first started placing boxes, I used full size tupperware <br/>
without camo and usually hid them beneath trees covered with sticks <br/>
not too far off trail.  My assumption was that if I covered it so <br/>
well that even I couldn't see it, that would be good enough.  I <br/>
learned the hard way that critters, weather and future finders would <br/>
eventually leave the box exposed, so I revised my strategy.  I <br/>
started hiding further off trail, putting them on the back side of <br/>
trees and covering them with rocks instead of sticks when possible.  <br/>
I wanted the box to remain covered longer (rocks), but to remain <br/>
somewhat hidden even if no longer covered.  I also started hiding <br/>
mainly microboxes since they are easier to hide and less intrusive.  <br/>
Once I found out about camo tape, I started using that, too.  Now I <br/>
have even started using paper clip hooks to hang the micro higher off <br/>
the ground.  My favorite hiding place, though hard to find, is a rock <br/>
wall.  If hidden within, especially on the back side, a box is <br/>
protected from weather, critters and noxers for a long time.  Trees <br/>
die, sticks decay, but rocks last!<br/>

Well I have another one go missing. I thought I had the perfect place <br/>
to put it. In the library. I made a book box called The Adventures of <br/>
Adams Trails. I just planted it two weeks ago with permission of the <br/>
Library Administrator. Today I went by to check on it. They were <br/>
reorganizing the library and sure enough, no body had seen it. There <br/>
are a lot of books go missing from the library but I am really <br/>
disapointed with this one. They said, in their rearranging, they would <br/>
keep an eye out for it but for now IT IS MISSING. DON'T LOOK FOR IT. <br/>
IT IS NOT THERE. I am in the process of making another one but I sure <br/>
did like that one. <br/>

<div>...as you said, Silver Eagle, they're only as good as the last 
finders left them.  I also prefer rocks, back sides of trees a little 
off-trail, and natural spots that aren't likely to be visible to casual 
passers-by; I pile on small pieces of log or bark on top of the 
rock, use camo tape and boxes that are as small as the particular stamp and 
logbook will allow, and check as often as possible on most of my boxes - and 
still too often find them sitting out on the wrong side of the tree, uncovered, 
left exposed to anyone passing by, with the covering rocks and bark and logs 
lying nearby.  Now, sometimes that might be the work of critters strong 
enough to move a rock or floodwaters that floated off the covering (the rock, 
too?), but I think more often it's carelessness by a finder (maybe not a 
letterboxer) who didn't think about the consequences of failing to recover 
well.  We really do have to protect each other's boxes by always putting 
them back as carefully as we can, maybe even hiding them better than they were 
before (and I've more often than not found this to be exactly the case - the box 
is hidden better than I hid it, and I even have to look to find it!)
