<div><span class="718564602-18062007">On a 
positive note - what a GREAT weekend.  I think we got 5 letterboxes in and 
around Rio Rancho NM.  But that was not the object of the weekend.  
The dog show was.  And we have not cleaned up like this since the 2005 
national finals.</span></div>

<div><span class="718564602-18062007">Saturday, Sammy took her class, then won best bitch for the point.  
In the final she won best of opposite against a fine looking male.  3 
ribbons.  And off to the letterboxes.</span></div>

<div><span class="718564602-18062007">Sunday - she won her class, then won best bitch for the point.  In 
the final she won BEST OF BREED.  4 ribbons.  We did a few Geocaches 
(GASP! he said the G-word again) on the way home, but no 
letterboxes.</span></div>

<div><span class="718564602-18062007">My 
son tried to call me today.  For father's day I expect.  At about 0500 
Sunday morning.  I was not up, the cell phone was off!  He is at 
NTC.  I tried to call him at noon.  It rang and rang - I was about to 
give up when he answered.  There was a roar of a diesel engine and the 
squeak and clatter of tracks.  Above the noise he shouted "I don't know who 
you are but I am in convoy with my Bradley right now - 
goodbye".</span></div>

hung up with a smile on my face.  Wish I could take just one more ride in 
an armored vehicle headed into battle.  I expect most of you don't

    ... with two new passengers. Alright anybody west of San Antonio, <br/>&gt; 
    or <br/>&gt; anyone wanting a serious road trip. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We didn't 
    want to make you folks drive all the way to Alpine, but <br/>&gt; we <br/>&gt; 
    wanted it close enough that we could check on it if no one comes <br/>&gt; to 
    <br/>&gt; get it for a while, so we drove it on up to the interstate (about 
    <br/>&gt; 80 <br/>&gt; miles from here).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Kent, Tx. Kent is 
    located in west Texas along I-10 about equal <br/>&gt; distance from El Paso 
    or Odessa - roughly 150 miles one-way from <br/>&gt; either place... that's 
    about 400 miles west of San Antonio on I-10 <br/>&gt; for any of you 
    attendidn the meet and greet, that don't mind a day-<br/>&gt; trip.<br/>&gt; 
    <br/>&gt; Just a note*** when I type in Kent, Tx on google maps, it points 
    <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; arrow to some other part of the state, so to be clear. 
    Kent is at <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; intersection of I-10, U.S. Hwy 80, State 
    Hwy 118, &amp; FM 2424, on <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; Missouri Pacific Railroad 
    36 miles E of Van Horn in southeastern <br/>&gt; Culberson County. It was 
    founded before 1892 and was originally <br/>&gt; known <br/>&gt; as Antelope. 
    <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Alrighty, so Clues already: Once in Kent locate the ruins 
    of the <br/>&gt; old <br/>&gt; schoolhouse on the south side of the interstate 
    (the feeder roads <br/>&gt; are <br/>&gt; 2-way out here, so you can drive 
    there easily). <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; From the Northwest corner of the outside of 
    the school ruins walk <br/>&gt; 35 <br/>&gt; steps south by south-west (220 
    degrees) to a large pile of small <br/>&gt; white rocks. from the center of 
    this pile of rocks, walk 3 steps <br/>&gt; north by northwest (310 degrees). 
    The texas Tour Bus 2 is under a <br/>&gt; mangled up piece of rusty tin, and 
    a small chunk of concrete.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ALSO, I planted a traditional 
    box there too, but I'm not gonna <br/>&gt; list <br/>&gt; it for another week, 
    so whoever goes for the bus should be first <br/>&gt; finder... Antelope 
    letterbox. Kent was originally known as <br/>&gt; Antelope, <br/>&gt; so go 
    figure... Clues: from the center of the same pile of white <br/>&gt; rocks, 
    walk 5 steps south (180 degrees) to a square piece of <br/>&gt; concrete 
    <br/>&gt; (about 18 inches square and 5 or 6 inches tall) that has a hole in 
    <br/>&gt; the center where a post once was. The center hole (and the <br/>&gt; 
    letterbox) <br/>&gt; are covered by a small rock. Happy Hunting.<br/>&gt; 
    <br/>&gt; BTW I really enjoyed the stamps of the folks on the bus, and Cold 
    <br/>&gt; Front and I really stepped up our carving for our additions to the 
    <br/>&gt; bus, so I hope you like them. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Warm Front<br/>&gt; 
    <br/>&gt; PS we are having an incredible hail storm as I write this. <br/>&gt; 
    Mothball <br/>&gt; sized hail has completely blanketed the ground and dropped 
    the <br/>&gt; temperature 25 degrees in 15 minutes... amazing, but the cat is 
    <br/>&gt; scared to death.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
