<div>I received the gift of friendship this year.  On the night before 
Christmas Eve, Cancan threw a wonderful Christmas letterboxing bash where at 
least 20 of us gathered to exchange Christmas stamp images into little booklets 
that fit into Christmas ornaments that Cancan had made for each of us.  In 
October, I was in Houston accompanying my Mom to MD Anderson because her cancer 
has returned.  I got away to Telge park, to pick up a few Wedding Guests, 
and had just begun to stamp in my first box when I heard my name called!  
It was Dewberry and Mother of Five, who invited me to join them for lunch, where 
we talked and laughed about anything and everything but cancer – a wonderful 
surprise gift.  I got funny, clever emails all year long from clever, funny 
people.  I am realizing that one of the reasons I love this letterboxing 
“club” is that is doesn’t ask anything from me, it only gives.  I am not 
required to give the educational program “next month”, or single-handedly bring 
food for 40 to the next “meeting”.  I can just know that I belong to a 
great group of people who keep giving me gifts all year long.  Merry 
Christmas and Happy New Year to you all!  Love, Bell Motel</div>

My trail name, phoenix8, is about the decision to use 2008 to overcome a really rough 2007, which included a painful and unexpected divorce. I laid out a survival plan; part of it included getting outdoors more. Letterboxing became a catalyst for that.  There was a lot of solace to be found in a pretty trail or a good find. <br/>
<br/>
Time has passed, and what a blessing to be where I am now in this journey. Enjoy the rest of the holidays with your friends and families - you may not realize it, but this community and the boxes you've placed have been part of a healing process for me. Needless to say, I'm grateful.<br/>

<p>I got a letterboxing partner! I gave a special girl only two presents this 
year - her own stamp and a ring. <br/><br/>My trail name, phoenix8, is about the 
decision to use 2008 to overcome a really rough 2007, which included a painful 
and unexpected divorce. I laid out a survival plan; part of it included getting 
outdoors more. Letterboxing became a catalyst for that. There was a lot of 
solace to be found in a pretty trail or a good find. <br/><br/>Time has passed, 
and what a blessing to be where I am now in this journey. Enjoy the rest of the 
holidays with your friends and families - you may not realize it, but this 
community and the boxes you've placed have been part of a healing process for 
me. Needless to say, I'm grateful.<br/><br/>Michael<br/>phoenix8</p></div><!-- end group email --></div></div></div></body></html>

On the night before Christmas Eve, Cancan threw a wonderful Christmas letterboxing bash where at least 20 of us gathered to exchange Christmas stamp images into little booklets that fit into Christmas ornaments that Cancan had made for each of us. In October, I was in Houston accompanying my Mom to MD Anderson because her cancer has returned. I got away to Telge park, to pick up a few Wedding Guests, and had just begun to stamp in my first box when I heard my name called! It was Dewberry and Mother of Five, who invited me to join them for lunch, where we talked and laughed about anything and everything but cancer " a wonderful surprise gift. I got funny, clever emails all year long from clever, funny people. I am realizing that one of the reasons I love this letterboxing “club” is that is doesn’t ask anything from me, it only gives. I am not required to give the educational program “next month”, or single-handedly bring food for 40 to the next “meeting”. I can just know that I belong to a great group of people who keep giving me gifts all year long. Merry Christmas and Happy New Year to you all!
