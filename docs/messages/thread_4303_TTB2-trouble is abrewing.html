<br/>
We didn't tell him that we saw Pancho Juan down by the fishing pier and again at the little store nearby.  Still though, I'm pretty sure he knows trouble is astir -maybe he heard the stories other campers told about what must have been Zydeco Joe partaking of the all-you-can-eat crawdads just down the road this evening.<br/>
<br/>
I can't help thinking tomorrow is gonna shape up to be an interesting day if someone doesn't hurry on out here to this park to claim the TTB2.<br/>
<br/>
Stew in the dutch oven and fire in the pit with my two favorite fellas.  Letterboxing on the agenda for tomorrow, if I can force myself out of my hammock..  Life in LucyLand is pretty darned good, for the moment anyway.<br/>
