wanted to join you all, but as good Houstonians we spent the day at <br>
the rodeo.  We did spend Sunday in Sam Houson NF searching for the <br>
elusive Blue Northern, and thanks to tips from Baby Bear and Birds of <br>
a feather we found it this time!  My parents were here visiting from <br>
Michigan...it was their first time Letterboxing.  My dad was so taken <br>
with it that he came home and looked up clues from Houston to <br>
Detroit...they are going to hunt boxes all the way back north!  <br>
Letterboxing has two new fans.  Baby Bear...your box was alive and <br>
well...just thought you would like to know.  Ruth  (mother of four)<br>
