                    <html><body><div>It turned out cold for today's gathering, but thankfully rainfree!  And even still, not as cold as it was on the last scheduled date.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I set out today with Lightning and his buddy, David, to show up at RSP at about 10 a.m.,  JBK was the first to join me at the park, and was actually waiting there for us to show up.  I had only met her once before, at the date of the original Rusk Redoux, but it seemed like we had known each other forever, and somehow, we are both convinced we must have done - we did, after all, grow up in the same town albeit a few years apart.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Next to arrive was JKC - who is actually three people!  They have gotten Tyler kick-started with boxes.  I haven't yet figured out why Tyler is a virtual wasteland letterboxing-wise, but it hasn't ever seen much activity - a little, but not a lot!  Anyway, JKC has gotten started planting Tyler up.  The "C" of JKC is also a scout, so he and Lightning had something in common.  He soon took off with Lightning and David, BIG dog Gidget in tow. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox showed up along in there somewhere - he was the support crew with the prime objective of maintaining the fire for the day, and a fine job he did!  "J" of JKC ventured off to help out with the fire and they seemed to hit it off pretty well.  When Fearless Fox wasn't busy stoking the fire, he found a corner and read, taking a break only long enough to recarve his personal stamp.  He sort of hated he had been unsociable, but the book he is reading has had him engaged.  
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>While JBK and "K" of JKC and I were busy talking, Tx Dragonfly showed up, bringing another dog, Cricket.  The boys took her off and played with her too,  Now if y'all remember, TxDragonfly planted the Lions Club Duo in Temple - the one that Lightning and I went to find.  I had felt at the time that she must have conspired with a man there to distract letterboxers away from her boxes, because the man so seriously misdirected us from where we needed to be that we walked wayyy further than we had to!  Well, I must say I have now decided the man must have been acting alone because she is just too nice to enter such a conspiracy.  She has now moved to Tyler with her husband and she has some really good ideas about places to plant boxes - again, we may be seeing the advent of Tyler letterboxing! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>JKC decided they would venture out to find some boxes before lunch, and the rest of us retired to the fire area instead of continuing to stand out in the wind talking each other's ears off.  Soon after we moved, my mother, Trailcat, and her husband, as yet to be properly named, showed up and the stamping and exchanging began again.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gryzzled Gryphon made his appearance about lunchtime, as did Lucy Locket.  Lucy said Blue Butterfly was shortly behind her, but when she FINALLY showed up, she reported that she got sidetracked.  We waited on her anyway and rounded out our group when she arrived.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We ate lunch - all excellent - and settled in for more conversation and a good time for all.  No one particuarly wanted to venture out to find boxes, but wanted to stay by Fearless Fox's fire.  That was fine too, and we all hung out until everyone eventually drifted on home.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There wasn't much boxing done, but it was great to see everyone and to make a few new friends!  On to Somerville...</div>
