&gt; I think this a great idea.  I propose that Ruby should drive the bus and Janet can greet all the passengers.  MO5<br/>

&gt;     If we tried to carve "self portraits" I'd have to get IRA Boxer's ghost to do mine because he did an amazing job of those murder suspects down at Mercer. But characters... we have ghosts, bears, army men, clowns, boots, barefeet, mothers of many, cartoon characters, quilters, butterflies, gryzzled things, grannys, eagles, kokopelis, lions, mothers, a dog or two, and on and on and on. It could be fun to see how people define themselves - either portraits or characterizations would work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   My one and only suggestion for this box would be to limit the size of stamps so more can fit as it travels around - I'd suggest max of 3" x 3"?<br/>
