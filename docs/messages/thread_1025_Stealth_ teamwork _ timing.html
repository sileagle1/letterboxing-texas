All the Harriet the Spys, Nancy Drews and Trixie Beldens out there <br/>
(and I guess the Hardy Boys)--speak up!<br/>
<br/>
I say go for it if that's where you want to put a box.  There's a <br/>
preserve in Harris County only open once a month where I plan to put <br/>
a box (guide not needed), but haven't been able to time the <br/>
placement correctly.  I knew this would mean very few finders, and <br/>
of course even fewer would be able to make your spot.<br/>
<br/>
As long as it's not somewhere that is a place of national security <br/>
importance. . .I'm nutty, but not interested in breaking those laws!<br/>

&gt; Okay friends, it's my turn to chime in with a comment and a <br/>
question. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My comment:  I've read the various responses and appreciate <br/>
everyone's<br/>
&gt; diverse viewpoints.  Much of my boxing is done on the fly, between <br/>
home<br/>
&gt; and MS where Navigator's mom lives. (She always asks if we have <br/>
found<br/>
&gt; "any of those little plastic boxes" lately.) At this time, my <br/>
logbook<br/>
&gt; reading consists of a quick scan of previous entries, noting who <br/>
has<br/>
&gt; been there or not more than reading the personal notes.  And for <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; same reason, I rarely leave more than name, date and home town. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; My question:  For a couple of months or more I have been toying <br/>
with the<br/>
&gt; idea of a box in a remote location that is only accessible to the <br/>
public<br/>
&gt; once a month.  When this area is accessible, it is with a guide. <br/>
Because<br/>
&gt; of this I think it would be next to impossible for a lone adult to <br/>
get<br/>
&gt; the box, log in and replace the box. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Stealth, teamwork and timing. any takers?  The box is made.  I can <br/>
put<br/>
&gt; it there or in a more traditional location.  Your ideas please.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
