                    <html><body><div>If I've sent you the scout series link in the last two days, don't go rushing to find the girl scout boxes quite yet.  I'm so glad I gave Boots Tex my cell number because he just called me to say that She Rocks! was out in the open and emptied.  Everything was there, but the lock 'n lock container was sealed up nicely and the contents were all right there with it.  I'd also given the clues to my Girl Scout leader friend and her daughter, but I seriously doubt they went to find it and left it like that (I know the Cub Scout half of their family much better, and I know THEY know how to hide the box properly).  I'm assuming a muggle found it, and I am thankful they left it nice and neat.

<div>I'm going to completely change the location of that particular box because TexasLuvBug lost one in the very near vicinity after not too long a stay last summer.  Lightning was really attached to the place, so I went with it even though I had my doubts.  No sense in risking it though, not if ours was muggled in two days.
