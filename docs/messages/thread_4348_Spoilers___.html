                    <html><body><p>Good Morning!</p><div><br/></div><div>I've been going over stuff for the gathering in March, particularly working on PT's on AQ and adding my personal notes there so I don't have to keep up with them on paper until gathering time. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>Chalk it up to getting older or not paying attention, but I keep hitting the "Comments" button instead of the "Personal Notes" button, and twice so far the answer to the PT has been given in the comments. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>I realize I just oughta pay closer attention to what buttons I hit and then not read if I hit the wrong one, but it's kind of like when you are playing cards with someone who isn't very good at holding their cards - you have to work real hard to NOT look at their cards once you notice you can see 'em. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>The only thing I can figure is that folks are using the comments to confirm with the owner whether they have the right answer. Is that what's going on?</div><div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>
