                    <html><body><div>Whew!  I just got in from Arkansas, where I got to attend TAG - The Arkansas Gathering!  I had thought I wouldn't get to go, but other plans fell through and Fearless Fox was able to get free, it was Spring Break, so off to Arkansas we went... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I do like to think that I learn something new every single day of my life, and for the most part I do, and I learned several things this weekend - 1) Communication is a good thing.  2) Racing trumps nature lovers in the general population, 3) and perhaps most importantly, short clues doesn't equate to short hikes!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We left Thursday evening after I got off work with intentions of meeting up with the advance party of FF's and Lightning's hiking party - sometime close to midnight in the middle of Ouachita National Forest.  They were planning to continue their efforts to complete the Eagle Rock Loop Trail and through hike for a couple days and one fellow had taken two of the three boys on ahead to do a little fishing first and to make a food and water drop.  Fearless Fox and Lightning graciously waited for me  A scant bit of direction, a couple of road numbers eeked out, and we (Fearless Fox) were certain where we were to meet up with the rest.  There are a few things to know about Ouachita National Forest, if you've never been there.  1) There are NO cell phone signals, and if you DO happen to get one it is still highly unlikely the other party will have one.  2) It is very dark in Ouachita National Forest after the sun goes down.  3) The road signs are deliberately understated - no blaring neon signs to disrupt from the forest-y type of ambiance they have going out there.  4) The forestry service's definition of a parking lot in no way relates to what you find in front of Walmart, or even in front of a convenience store, or even what runs up between the street and your garage.  A parking lot in forestry terms is a wide spot in the roadway, and sometimes the wide spot is even turned perpindicular to the road and tucked into the woods. 5) Paving costs money and allows cars to drive fast.  Shale is the preferred road covering of forests. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We felt we were making excellent time and managed to hit Glenwood, AR remarkably early.  From Glenwood on, we knew we would have to carefully navigate to connect with our party.  Meanwhile, flashes of lightning occurred just often enough to make us doubt our eyes, until finally I had to say it - "Do you see lightning?"  Fearless Fox's response "It's just an airport".  Hmmm, airport I thought.  In the middle of the mountains in the middle of nowhere is an airport large enough to have beacon lights at 10 
p.m.  I went with it, knowing that was what he really wanted to believe.  Can't say I blamed him - he was looking forward to having to pitch his hammock in a matter of an hour and he didn't want to think of doing it in the rain.  I allowed the delusion to continue as long as I could in good conscience do, but when the light slashed across the sky in front of us, I said "And I guess that was the Concord coming in for a landing?"  My sarcasm was not appreciated whatsoever, and he finally admitted it was lightning.  As I hung my arm out the window, I asked him if it was starting to rain, or if he was spitting over the cab of the truck.  Again, he didn't appreciate my sarcasm.  Twice is enough for me, so I tucked it in my pocket and resolved to be more helpful.  I suggested we pull in under a gas station shelter and repack the gear so the backpacks and other soakable stuff could be shifted to the cab of the truck.  Poor Lightning (not the uh-oh lightning, but our son, Lightning) was asleep as we threw backpacks in on top of him, but thankfully he slept right through it.  The ensuing rain made it very difficult to read those forestry service road sings, but by driving slowly and turning our headlights toward every questionable sign, we eventually made it to the road where we were to actually turn in to the forest.  Then things got tricky.  Thankfully, we've by now spent quite a bit of time in Ouachita, so we both had a reasonably good feel for it and were able to make some educated guesses that served us well.  However, the deeper we got the slower we had to go and the more difficult it was to determine if we had been traveling the right amount of time as compared to distance.  The rain let up and the wind set in.  The wind is more the enemy of a hammock camper than rain is.  I could almost feel Fearless Fox's growing enthusiasm for pitching his hammock in the dark, semi-wet, windy cool night!  I felt kind of bad for him - because my goal was to part company with them first thing Friday morning, my plan had been to sleep in the truck the whole time.  No prob - dry and free from wind!  We finally reached a point that we knew and we realized we had driven nearly all the way across the forest from north to south, and we were at a place that was certainly beyond our rendezvous point.  We turned around and headed back the other way, trying to figure out where we had missed it.  We went even more slowly, pulling in to even the most unlikely of turn-ins (bear in mind, we WERE on mountain roads after a recent rain, a fact that was NOT lost on me!).  Finally, our headlights caught a glint of chrome and as we squinted into the woods we thought we could even make out the coals of a campfire.  YES!  We had found the parking lot!  Now we have no idea how we missed it, but we did.  There were four cars, including our friend's parked there, and he had been keeping the fire stoke so we could see it until he had finally resigned himself to having to worry about meeting up in the morning.  We all stood around the dying fire and thought of a few things we could've done to make it easier to find them.  Amazing how well precise communication works.  Thankfully, the owners of the other cars weren't there, so the noise we made in arriving didn't wake anyone up.  Michael had the tent set up for the boys that had gone with him and we rousted Lightning from under the backpacks and hustled him into the tent too.  Michael had not found the rain to be too pleasant in the hammock, so had opted to sleep in his own car, and Fearless Fox contemplated just using Michael's hammock or putting up his own, but instead decided that I might get scared sleeping in the truck, so he took the driver's seat to my shotgun. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All was well and the skies were sunny when we arose the next morning and the guys had pop tarts and other trail delicacies as they scrambled about getting their last minute pack adjustments made - after that meal it would be freeze-dried pouches and other lightweight culinary wonders until today, Sunday.  I sat around in a chair by the fire watching them and making suggestions, which seemed to be predominantly ignored.  They decided at the last minute that they wanted to plant a box along the way, so I broke out my carving stuff and shivered and carved on the bed of the truck while they did their thing.  My friend had give me a huge medicine bottle to try out (the container, not the medicine), so I used that to pack up the box and handed it to one of the boys to carry.  Fearless Fox and I drove to their end point and dropped a vehicle off there rather than planning to come back to the beginning to get it.  By the time we got back, the boys were jumping around and playing in their backpacks, and trying to see if they could fall into the cold Little Missouri River.  By that time, I was fading into the woodwork and was not the Mom, so I left it to the adult guys to decide whether that was all really that wise or not.  If I couldn't trust 'em to make that kind of a decision BEFORE they set out, how could I trust 'em to do it while they were out?  They sent me on my way with marching orders to drop some extra water at their first night stop.  Michael told me "exactly" where he had already dropped water.  Listening to his instructions, I was skeptical, but I am, after all, a letterboxer and well able to follow directions, so I left happily on my way with the assumption I could figure out what he meant when I got there,  Wrong!  I looked around for about 15 minutes, but I was anxious to get on about my way too, so I opted to set my own drop instead of wasting more time looking for his.  I scouted about and found a good hiding place, then I wrote letterboxers-style clues for my husband, using cryptic language only he could interpret, and I tucked them into a tiny plastic baggied and wrote his name and the date he was expected to arrive there, and I hooked them onto the trailhead post.  While most of the time hikers are pretty good about leaving other hikers' drops alone, this was very near the trailhead and there were folks other than hikers that might venture around the area. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My goal for the next 48 hours was to find a few boxes around Hot Springs, then head over to North Little Rock for TAG, The Arkansas Gathering, hosted by Shiloh.  When I mentioned to Silver Eagle that it looked good for me to go to that gathering, he told me he had met Shiloh at the Mini-Meese Meet and was pretty impressed with him.  Silver Eagle's recommendation was enough to seal the deal for me - I was gonna be there!  I drove straight from the rendezvous place to Hot Springs, procrastinating on making a decision what to do first.  My hesitation proved to be ill-advised.  I should've booked a room first and then hunted boxes, but I opted to reverse that.  I went first out to Lake Catherine State Park and who do you think I ran into but our own Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket!  We walked together to Baby Bear's box, Chip and then Lucy went on ahead to plant another box.  I talked to Blue Butterfly for a bit while she waited to give LL time to hide, then I went back to my car with intentions of heading out to Lake Ouachita State Park to find a couple.  Well - Hot Springs is a big horse race town AND had a big St Pat's race, so town was packed and traffic was horrendous.  By the time I made a couple of laps and a few hotel inquiries, I had wasted a lot of daylight only to find that all I could get was a suite for $200 a night.  I had wanted to be central to both Little Rock and ONF, but decided I could probably find a hotel in Little Rock and just leave from there a little earlier this morning when I had to go.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to Little Rock and, as is my custom in a new town, I made a pass around it to see what was where.  I found it nearly impossible to find a Walmart - in a town in ARKANSAS.  I liked to have never spotted my key locations I like to nail down - eating places, Walmart, Hobby Lobby along with any sites with boxes.  I found Little Rock to be terribly confusing - if you've seen the Harry Potter movies, you know that at Hogwartz the staircases all move - well I SWEAR the highways in Little Rock do the same!  I'm going to have to visit again and see if I have better luck navigating.  I finally set about to getting a place to stay and I settled in for the night and I awoke Saturday morning with the sun through the curtains, ready to go letterboxing!  I got my stuff together (I had been strewn about the night before, carving for my Cub Scout project).  I repacked everything grabbed my clue notebook and headed out.  As turned out to be the custom of the weekend, I had difficulty finding the place, but when I did, I knew I was in the right place.  I can't quite tell you how I recognized a letterboxing gathering, except that it seems sort of like an incongruous group of people hanging out together without any apparent purpose.  If you look more closely, you will likely see stamping in going on and ink pads and rubber stamps and whatever else, but no one ever really looks that closely!  Sure enough, I parked and got myself and began walking toward the pavilion.  Everyone there turned and looked at me and I recognized - NO ONE!  It's been a long time since I've been to a gathering and recognized NO ONE!  I spotted Shiloh and said "You must be Shiloh".  This was an astute guess on my part, since his sig stamp indicates he has dark hair and a beard, and since everyone else there were women, and none of them had beards.  I was privileged to meet Purple Ladybuy, who is hosting a gather for Team New Hampshire during their April visit, and Webfoot, our go-to girl for PZKut!  I sat down and began exchanging, when who should show up but our own Atoy Adventurers - they had been able to come along at the last minute!  Lucy Locket and Blue Butterfly also showed up and our whole East Texas contingency was there.  It sure was nice to see us Texans pull out the stops to offer a little support to a lonesome boxer in Arkansas! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After sitting around awhile, I decided I would head off to find some boxes.  I asked Shiloh whether I would need to drive to the Covered Bridge box - and he chortled and said "Well it's on the other side of the interstate..." Realize - we were in a huge park which extends OVER the interstate to continue.  It really isn't like I was asking to play in the road!  Anyway, he implied that it would be quite a distance and that for that reason, I probably did want to drive.  I find this fact ironic right now. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Covered Bridge box was easy enough to find and the clues to Burns Park Tree Sprite kicked off from there.  I struck out, thinking I could make short work of the boxes in Burn Park since they were all basically in the same area.  The fact that the clues were nice and short was encouraging too.  But alas, I was led right down the garden path!  While Shiloh's clues are very accurate, he pointedly doesn't give distances and such.  I, being used to boxes that start with noted landmarks right away, found myself frustrated and doubting myself.  More than once I doubled back to see if I had overlooked anything.  Finally the clues became perfectly clear and I found the box.  The second set of clues picked up from there and I set out, fully expecting that I would be feeling my way along again.  No disappointment there - I had to go quite a distance again before I started seeing landmarks!  By then LL and BB had caught up with me and I had the distinct pleasure of boxing with them yet again.   After quite a strenuous and time intensive walk, we had found four stamps and then had to find our cars.  Blue Butterfly led the way and led us right to it.  YEA BB!  Yes, these boxes weren't what we had expected, but what a beautiful walk Shiloh took us along!  We met back up at the pavilion and talked about our long hike and the beautiful park and so forth.  Four stamps were four hard-earned stamps.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It turned out to be a great gathering  I hope there will be more Arkansas boxers to come out and play with Shiloh (the very few other boxers there seem to be pretty low-key), but in the meantime, I'm sure glad a few of us Texans made a showing to let him know we're looking out for him!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I finally went back to my hotel and slept very hard last night, awaking to the fact that it was time to put our gear back together and head on out!  I backtracked my way in to our ending point, only to find the van gone and no sign of the guys.  That's a bit gut-wrenching, especially when I was showing up exactly at the earliest time they expected to be there.  I asked around and had some men go into the guys bathroom to ask about them, but no one spoke up and claimed to be them.  I also asked at the "parking lot" if anyone had seen the van and they all looked at me as though I had asked them if they had witnessed an alien abduction.  Still no cell phone signal, or I could've called one of them.  I finally decided to throw my stuff out on a nearby table and do a little carving and wait.  Sure enough, a few minutes later they drove in to the parking lot (this was a real parking lot - one with stripes and everything), and I learned that they had actually arrived there the night before - the hike went very well.  I sent them off to shower, carved a bit more, than loaded them up and we all came home - dropping a box in an unpopulated county on the way.  More on that LATER!

 like an incongruous group of people hanging out together without any apparent purpose.  If you look more closely, you will likely see stamping in going on and ink pads and rubber stamps and whatever else, but no one ever really looks that closely!  Sure enough, I parked and got myself and began walking toward the pavilion.  Everyone there turned and looked at me and I recognized - NO ONE!  It's been a long time since I've been to a gathering and recognized NO ONE!  I spotted Shiloh and said "You must be Shiloh".  This was an astute guess on my part, since his sig stamp indicates he has dark hair and a beard, and since everyone else there were women, and none of them had beards.  I was privileged to meet Purple Ladybuy, who is hosting a gather for Team New Hampshire during their April visit, and Webfoot, our go-to girl for PZKut!  I sat down and began exchanging, when who should show up but our own Atoy Adventurers - they had
 been able to come along at the last minute!  Lucy Locket and Blue Butterfly also showed up and our whole East Texas contingency was there.  It sure was nice to see us Texans pull out the stops to offer a little support to a lonesome boxer in Arkansas! </div> <div> </div> <div>After sitting around awhile, I decided I would head off to find some boxes.  I asked Shiloh whether I would need to drive to the Covered Bridge box - and he chortled and said "Well it's on the other side of the interstate..<wbr/>." Realize - we were in a huge park which extends OVER the interstate to continue.  It really isn't like I was asking to play in the road!  Anyway, he implied that it would be quite a distance and that for that reason, I probably did want to drive.  I find this fact ironic right now. </div> <div> </div> <div>The Covered Bridge box was easy enough to find and the clues to Burns Park Tree Sprite kicked off from there.  I
 struck out, thinking I could make short work of the boxes in Burn Park since they were all basically in the same area.  The fact that the clues were nice and short was encouraging too.  But alas, I was led right down the garden path!  While Shiloh's clues are very accurate, he pointedly doesn't give distances and such.  I, being used to boxes that start with noted landmarks right away, found myself frustrated and doubting myself.  More than once I doubled back to see if I had overlooked anything.  Finally the clues became perfectly clear and I found the box.  The second set of clues picked up from there and I set out, fully expecting that I would be feeling my way along again.  No disappointment there - I had to go quite a distance again before I started seeing landmarks!  By then LL and BB had caught up with me and I had the distinct pleasure of boxing with them yet again.   After quite a strenuous and time intensive
 walk, we had found four stamps and then had to find our cars.  Blue Butterfly led the way and led us right to it.  YEA BB!  Yes, these boxes weren't what we had expected, but what a beautiful walk Shiloh took us along!  We met back up at the pavilion and talked about our long hike and the beautiful park and so forth.  Four stamps were four hard-earned stamps. </div> <div> </div> <div>It turned out to be a great gathering  I hope there will be more Arkansas boxers to come out and play with Shiloh (the very few other boxers there seem to be pretty low-key), but in the meantime, I'm sure glad a few of us Texans made a showing to let him know we're looking out for him! </div> <div> </div> <div>I finally went back to my hotel and slept very hard last night, awaking to the fact that it was time to put our gear back together and head on out!  I backtracked my way in to our ending point, only to find the van gone and no sign of the
 guys.  That's a bit gut-wrenching, especially when I was showing up exactly at the earliest time they expected to be there.  I asked around and had some men go into the guys bathroom to ask about them, but no one spoke up and claimed to be them.  I also asked at the "parking lot" if anyone had seen the van and they all looked at me as though I had asked them if they had witnessed an alien abduction.  Still no cell phone signal, or I could've called one of them.  I finally decided to throw my stuff out on a nearby table and do a little carving and wait.  Sure enough, a few minutes later they drove in to the parking lot (this was a real parking lot - one with stripes and everything), and I learned that they had actually arrived there the night before - the hike went very well.  I sent them off to shower, carved a bit more, than loaded them up and we all came home - dropping a box in an unpopulated county on the way.  More on that
