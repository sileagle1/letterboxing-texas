                    <div class="plaintext-content">     I went to Tyler State Park last Sunday with my LSS (who has a <br/>
potential job offer in the area - we would have to move and were <br/>
checking the area out), and my dog, Cricket.<br/>
     We found Tyler State Park, Campfire, and My Heart Belongs In <br/>
Texas.<br/>
     I believe that Barefoot Lucy (My Heart Belongs In Texas) found <br/>
the perfect opportunity to get back at me for placing the elderly <br/>
gentleman who threw her off the trail when she was looking for my <br/>
Lions Park duo.<br/>
     She must have talked the park maintenance people into blocking <br/>
off the route (with low black fencing) that we were suppose to take <br/>
and moving the sign that said which way to go... having us start <br/>
from the wrong trail.  We laborously tried to make the clues fit... <br/>
the parts about the creek leave more interpretation when all the <br/>
water is dried up, (wondering if she left out some big landmarks to <br/>
make things harder), and checked every dead scary looking tree we <br/>
could find.  We also had multiple interpretations of "a large hole" <br/>
(in a rock, between rocks, in the ground, where there's a <br/>
waterfall,...).<br/>
     After backtracking several times and scouring the area's trees, <br/>
I was ready to throw in the towel.  I knew that there was another <br/>
path leading back to where we started, so decided that we should go <br/>
that way and check things out... just maybe...<br/>
Well, things clicked perfectly when we (finally) headed in that <br/>
direction.  I was very happy to find that box!  After we got to the <br/>
end of the path, we realized what had happened, and I thought it was <br/>
very funny that it just so happened to be Barefoot Lucy's box.  :)  <br/>
I thought the fence meant that you shouldn't go that way, but it <br/>
turned out that it was easy to step over.  The correct path starts <br/>
behind the cabin GG.   <br/>
     BTW, the sign for the trail points left and right.  I believe <br/>
that it use to be between the 2 starting points.  It is now to the <br/>
right of the path that is on the right.  I'm wondering now if you <br/>
can find any path if you go to the right of the sign... <br/>
     We were starving when we finished this one (that we didn't <br/>
think would take very long - fatal mistake), and had to raid the <br/>
park store to hold us over so we could find the other 2 boxes in the <br/>
park.<br/>
     It is a gorgeous park, by the way, has miles of trails, and <br/>
would be a great place to do some camping.<br/>

<div>Seriously, it's been awhile since I've checked that box and we've had some pretty harsh circumstances around here - things very likely could've changed!  I need to go check my Tiger Wild box soon, so I'll check that one at the same time.  Glad you found it all the same!

<div>I went to Tyler State Park last Sunday with my LSS (who has a <br/>potential job offer in the area - we would have to move and were <br/>checking the area out), and my dog, Cricket.<br/>We found Tyler State Park, Campfire, and My Heart Belongs In <br/>Texas.<br/>I believe that Barefoot Lucy (My Heart Belongs In Texas) found <br/>the perfect opportunity to get back at me for placing the elderly <br/>gentleman who threw her off the trail when she was looking for my <br/>Lions Park duo.<br/>She must have talked the park maintenance people into blocking <br/>off the route (with low black fencing) that we were suppose to take <br/>and moving the sign that said which way to go... having us start <br/>from the wrong trail. We laborously tried to make the clues fit... <br/>the parts about the creek leave more interpretation when all the <br/>water is dried up, (wondering if she left out some big landmarks to <br/>make things harder), and checked every dead scary looking tree we <br/>could find. We also had multiple interpretations of "a large hole" <br/>(in a rock, between rocks, in the ground, where there's a <br/>waterfall,..<wbr/>.).<br/>After backtracking several times and scouring the area's trees, <br/>I was ready to throw in the towel. I knew that there was another <br/>path leading back to where we started, so decided that we should go <br/>that way and check things out... just maybe...<br/>Well, things clicked perfectly when we (finally) headed in that <br/>direction. I was very happy to find that box! After we got to the <br/>end of the path, we realized what had happened, and I thought it was <br/>very funny that it just so happened to be Barefoot Lucy's box. :) <br/>I thought the fence meant that you shouldn't go that way, but it <br/>turned out that it was easy to step over. The correct path starts <br/>behind the cabin GG. <br/>BTW, the sign for the trail points left and right. I believe <br/>that it use to be between the 2 starting points. It is now to the <br/>right of the path that is on the right. I'm wondering now if you <br/>can find any path if you go to the right of the sign... <br/>We were starving when we finished this one (that we didn't <br/>think would take very long - fatal mistake), and had to raid the <br/>park store to hold us over so we could find the other 2 boxes in the <br/>park.<br/>It is a gorgeous park, by the way, has miles of trails, and <br/>would be a great place to do some camping.<br/><br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/>
