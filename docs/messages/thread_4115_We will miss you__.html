&gt; Hi y'all,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm going to have to respectively decline going to the Tomato Fest. The doctor wants me in the hospital next Tuesday for the consolidation chemotherapy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, this is what I am going to ask. Post everything after the festival. I have no problem living vicariously through others. I love reading about your exploits, good and bad.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, squish a tomato for me, have fun and don't forget the sunscreen and umbrellas to keep the hot sun from making you look like a tomato. I wouldn't want anyone to mistaken for a tomato and squished into sauce (or gravy as the Italians call it).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Janet<br/>
