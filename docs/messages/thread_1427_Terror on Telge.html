<div>I just wanted to say how much I enjoyed meeting 
everyone yesterday...and seeing all the amazing carving in the travelling boxes 
Teamking brought.  My kids were really amazed when I told them that I had 
met Silver Eagle and Baby Bear in person...they wanted to know if I had asked 
for their autographs!  Can't wait until the Texas gathering, and since I 
have vowed not to become mother of six we should be able to make it this 
year!  -Mother of Five</div></body></html>

crazy, then running around the forest before it got dark.  I did <br/>
notice, while driving by the park Sunday, more people with clues in <br/>
their hands wandering around in the field across the creek.  Great <br/>
to visit with all that came, and wish we would have had more time to <br/>
chat.   Take care<br/>

of the woods, and it was fun to put faces, names, and personal stamps <br/>
together.  Special thanks to those of you who did all the dirty work <br/>
of putting this gathering together.  Hope to see everyone again!<br/>
