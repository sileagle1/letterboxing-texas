crazy, then running around the forest before it got dark.  I did <br>
notice, while driving by the park Sunday, more people with clues in <br>

to visit with all that came, and wish we would have had more time to <br>

Terrors of Telge Gathering this weekend.  It was fun for us to see the <br>
carvings of letterboxers that we don't usually get to see in our neck <br>
of the woods, and it was fun to put faces, names, and personal stamps <br>
together.  Special thanks to those of you who did all the dirty work <br>
of putting this gathering together.  Hope to see everyone again!<br>
