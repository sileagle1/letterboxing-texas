                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too wanted to add a BIG THANK YOU to Baby Bear and Silver Eagle <br>
for an awesome event. Thank you to EVERYONE for awesome food -- and <br>
lots of letterboxing ideas to a newbie like me!!! I learned SO MUCH. <br>
I am sad I missed Mo5 and Puddle Splasher -- they were there and <br>
gone before I got a chance to talk to them -- and I can't wait to <br>
see them again. THANK YOU to Batty Girl for staying late to exchange <br>
with me and THANK YOU to Baileys Bumch for sharing the couture <br>
before the left..............EVERYONE WAS SO NICE!!!<br>
<br>
I wanted to again let you all know that I am TxTaTas because I LOVE <br>
SAVE THE TaTaTas tee shirts (www.savethetatas.com)- and the PINK <br>
RIBBON is my favorite charity -- as there was some confusion/chatter <br>
over my name --- originally while doing this --- with my GS Troop -- <br>
I never knew I would have to introduce myself as such -- But I loke <br>
my name and stamp -- and just wanted everyone to know where it came <br>
from and why! I am glad it drew such interest -- and know you can <br>
all go buy shirts and support my cause ;)...... I wore the one that <br>
said Texas TaTas -- but still wore a name tag lol <br>
<br>
I had so much fun -- and I feel like I have made some AWESOME <br>
friends from the trip! You guys ROCK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My little girl <br>
loved it too -- and a special THANK you to Baby Bear for getting her <br>
into it..... you guys are so nice. I must say I chatted with Baby <br>
Bears wife for a bit -- and I DID NOT KNOW SHE HAD A STAMP! -- This <br>
is my next mission -- I want her exchange!<br>
<br>
Mr. GG and Barefoot Lucy -- I finally met you guys -- and that was <br>
#1 on my list! Now to catch Mo5 and Puddle Splasher -- lol <br>
<br>
Sandi Box --- I am so coming home for coffee -- so get ready. <br>
<br>
AND A SPECIAL THANK YOU to FROGKISSES, TxPOKEY and Mother's Love for <br>
letting me tag along --- I love being a part of your family!<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all in Denton -- Batty Girl -- I need lessons on <br>
those LTC's --- I am interested -- since I "owe" you one!!<br>
<br>
THANK YOU ALL FOR A GREAT WEEKEND AWAY FROM REGULAR LIFE -- it was <br>
so much fun - especially finding while you were missing at midnight <br>
not once but twice - as we had to go back for a missing cell phone. <br>
<br>
I LOVE TEXAS LETTERBOXERS!!!!!! AND you guys made me feel so <br>
welcome..............I love my new letterboxing friends......<br>
<br>
Hope to see you on the trails..............and I am still curious <br>
who planted the Green purse St. Cootie -- It was my first cootie -- <br>
first flea -- and my husband was convinced I needed to go to the <br>
vet -- via out cell conversations........ He really shoudl learn <br>
which way is north.....<br>
<br>
THANK YOU ALL AGAIN --- <br>
