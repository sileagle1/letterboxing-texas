                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will be leaving the "Jingle Bells" box out until February 1st, at <br/>
which time it will be replaced with a St. Patrick's Day box. Today, I <br/>
also placed a Valentine Box, "Be My Valentine", in the same park, Arbor <br/>
Hills Nature Center in Plano on Parker Blvd. (just off the tollway <br/>
north of Dallas). By the way, "Jingle Bells" was recently reported <br/>
as "attempted" however I found it safe and sound right where it should <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
While hiding the new box today, I checked on another box I have hidden <br/>
there, "Welcome to the World Baby Girls". The trail where it was <br/>
located, had recently been closed and they had filled the trail with <br/>
logs and branches to keep people from using it. Obviously, I had to <br/>
work my way through the branches to retrieve my box, but I was able to <br/>
hide it on another trail very close to its original location. So if you <br/>
already have those clues printed out, you will definitely want to print <br/>
out the newly edited clues.<br/>
<br/>
I took the opportunity to hike around many of the trails in the park <br/>
today, and it is amazing how pretty and extensive those trails are. <br/>
Hopefully others will feel compelled to plant some boxes in that park. <br/>
It's just a really nice place to walk and enjoy nature... right in an <br/>
urban location!<br/>
