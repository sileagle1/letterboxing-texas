                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi guys - <br/>
   Cold Front and I are still around and doing fine. I proposed on<br/>
Valentine's Day (yes, with a letterbox), and we're going to be married<br/>
in an old adobe church in the Terlingua ghost town next August 23rd.<br/>
I changed my major from Education (science teacher) to Geology (an<br/>
actual science) in hopes of getting a higher paying job when I finally<br/>
graduate, but geology classes are MUCH tougher than education courses,<br/>
so I keep my head in the books (and the science labs) most of the<br/>
time, and we're staying close to Alpine in an effort to save some<br/>
money. I have 3 lab sciences this semester, and work at the library,<br/>
and in the technical services department fixing computers, and Cold<br/>
Front has 3 part-time jobs, so we don't see each other much; much less<br/>
have time for letterboxing, but we still count it among our favorite<br/>
hobbies. We each carved a stamp for a box that Astro D put together<br/>
for Lionsmane (it was his 1000 find, so you may have seen his name in<br/>
a logbook even if you don't know him). I think it's called "road trip"<br/>
and it's out near Taos NM. We also managed to find 2 or 3 stamps while<br/>
we were in Vegas for my nieces wedding last month.  My best friend is<br/>
getting married in April (Austin), and my nephew is getting married 2<br/>
weeks before we do next August (Houston) so we may get a couple<br/>
chances for letterboxing while traveling to and from all these weddings. <br/>
Anyways, just checking in. I hope all is well with those I know, and a<br/>
quick hello to those I don't. I'll try not to let another year pass<br/>
before checking in again.<br/>
