would be able to make them, but luckily I pulled it off.  The day <br/>
started early since I had a 90 minute drive and wanted to get a few <br/>
boxes along the LST before the first Event, so I was up at 5:30 and off <br/>
by 6:00.  I met Baby Bear on the trail and then we headed to the Red <br/>
Barn Retreat for world famous cinnamon rolls by Boots Tex.  They <br/>
definitely lived up to their reputation and I only wish I could have <br/>
eaten more (I did take one for the road).  Boots &amp; Lone Star Quilter <br/>
were great hosts and it was nice to see their Retreat.  It was also <br/>
great to meet more of their family who happened to be in town.<br/>
<br/>
Next it was on to Double Lake to find a few boxes and place mine before <br/>
the next Event started.  It rained a little, but not enough to stop us, <br/>
and soon it was time for lunch.  Everyone was already at the pavilion <br/>
eating hot dogs and it was great to see old friends again and meet a <br/>
few new ones.  There were many boxes hidden around the pavilion, and <br/>
more boxes in the park to find, so no rest for the weary.  The weather <br/>
turned nice and the Dogwoods were blooming, so it was a great afternoon <br/>
of boxing.<br/>
<br/>
I had a great time and want to thank Dewberry, Boots Tex &amp; Lone Star <br/>
Quilter for everything they did.  What a nice way to spend a Sunday!<br/>
<br/>
I have created 2 albums with a few pictures from each Event in the <br/>
Photos section.  Feel free to add any of your pictures.<br/>
