<div>I had a great time at 
the OZ event yesterday, and wanted to say thanks to everyone who came.  I 
was so happy when SE and BB arrived, it wouldn't have been the same without 
them.  Thanks so much to everyone who ran around grabbing up boxes when the 
rain started, and a special thanks to Mr. Dewberry and Baby Bear for picking up 
the "Over the Rainbow" trail.  Daddy of Five didn't know I had snuck the 
bricks out of the flowerbed, so you all grabbing them from me saved me from 
having to explain how something else from the house had disappeared because of 
letterboxing.  It was great to see everyone, and I'm really looking forward 
to the event in March!  MO5</div>

daughter's soccer game, but did get to see the second half.<br/>

I had a blast!  It was so fun to put together names and faces.  There<br/>
were lots of great surprises and once again I was struck by how<br/>
friendly Texas letterboxers are.   <br/>
<br/>
I look forward to seeing you all again, especially if there's more<br/>
time to chat.  Would love to have another mini gather sometime.  We<br/>
can meet at a Panera sometime, something very casual, to socialize and<br/>
hang out.  <br/>
<br/>
I have the OM schedule, and the Saturday of the March gather is the<br/>
dress-rehearsal.  I'll need to be around for that, so will plan on<br/>
getting to the gather either by myself or with the family in the early<br/>
afternoon.  So count me in too!<br/>

it. I couldn't tear myself away from the gathering yesterday to go find <br/>
boxes, but Dewberry and Mo5 took me out on the trails for some boxes <br/>
yesterday after we left El Cuca (or wherever we were)! Then my LSS and <br/>
I went out again this morning to find a few more boxes. I love the <br/>
trails at the Arboretum as well as the yellow trail in Memorial Park. <br/>
However, I think the boxes in Houston need to be marked "extreme boxes" <br/>
on AQ because of the humidity (at least this weekend). Thank you all so <br/>
much for such a fabulous event. The kids were all so fun and cute, and <br/>
it was just cool meeting some new boxers and seeing my old pals again! <br/>
It was a really great event! On the way home, I had the big Texas map <br/>
out plotting my trip to Bastrop next March.<br/>
