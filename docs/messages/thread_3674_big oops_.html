Yikes, maybe call them and tell them what you did and let them decide <br>
if it stays or goes. Just contact them so you won't worry.<br>

                    <html><body><div dir="ltr"><div>First of all - pull the clues!  That's how they track down boxes, other than stumbling upon them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then - try to find someone to pull the box itself so it won't be stumbled upon.  I'm betting there is a kind local who would be glad to help you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't mean to scare you, but NPS can be very aggressive about pursuing unauthorized placements.  There ARE occasions when they allow boxes to be placed, but they want to approve them and the location beforehand and you have to fill out paperwork.  I'm on the webmaster team for LBNA and we get messages more often than I care to think from NPS rangers requesting contact information for "offending" boxers.  LBNA doesn't have that information - thankfully - and suggests that they contact the placer directly through the Contact Placer feature.  We also immediately archive offending boxes and contact the placer ourselves.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wouldn't contact them.  Your box probably hasn't been planted long enough to catch their eye, so very likely they will not ever know, and even if they do contact you, you can use your sweetest email voice and plead off on the fact that once you realized it was NPS, you made every effort to correct the situation without being told.  BUT - pull the clues and find someone to grab your box right away.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are at least two members of this list who have first-hand experience with the good ol' NPS staff - and one of their boxes wasn't even actually on NPS land after all was said and done!<br/></div>
<div>In the grand scheme of things, this is a blip, not a blast.  Don't be scared - but do take care of it so it doesn't become a big deal.</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>
