Hey Lucy-<br>
<br>
I'd be interested in getting some patches if you decide to get some <br>
made. Maybe about 2 or 3 of them, depending on the price. And even if <br>
you DID think you wanted to put F counts on them- I'd be too <br>
embarrassed to have mine on there! I do live in those sparsely <br>
populated box areas and haven't had much chance to travel to find <br>
more. I know- I need to get carving and increase the box numbers in <br>
my area first!! "If you plant them, they will come..."<br>

 How about putting the year on the patches?  Indicating perhaps the
year(s) you’ve attended the Texas Letterboxing event... or perhaps just
to indicate the years in which you were a letterboxing enthusiast?  <br/>
<br/>
F counts (or P’s, or whatever) would just be cumbersome, especially for
people like Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, for whom we’d either have to
write the number in microscopically small fonts to fit it all on, or make
especially big patches.  :P  How about, and I’m just thinking
out loud here, putting a count of Placed Letterboxes that subsequently vanished
into thin air, washed away in floods, got financed by Enron, destroyed by WMDs,
invaded by insects or trampled by wildebeest.  That could indicate, in a
way, just how far you’ll go to place a letterbox ANYWHERE.  LOL!<br/>

I am all for just a generic patch because if there is a year on them <br>
and someone will be responsible for an inventory of outdated <br>
patches, right? To be cost effective we would have to have a bulk <br>
order, and sell them out every year. It would be dangerous to have <br>
someone stuck with outdated patches. More random synapses....:0<br>

I work for Petsmart for the comparatively low stress and relative freedom it allows (in exchange for not nearly enough money.)  Of course, anything is less stress than working for American Airlines like I used to! <br/>
<br/>
As Carie78504 mentions, though, the problem with putting the years on the patches is problematic because you get your best savings by buying the exact same patch design in bulk.  I was wondering if it would be feasible to order the patches with a space left open on them?  Could you then embroider the year on them afterwards? I think a lot of that kind of thing is done with computers, and is even done at little kiosks at the mall, right?  Or did I see them at Sam’s Warehouses?  To be honest, I don’t know much about the process, and this may not be possible at all... or even desirable by any large number of Texas Letterboxers.  Just thinking loudly.<br/>

</font><font face="Times New Roman">Uh, just had an idea.  How about putting the year on the patches?  Indicating perhaps the year(s) you’ve attended the Texas Letterboxing event... or perhaps just to indicate the years in which you were a letterboxing enthusiast?  <br/>
<br/>
F counts (or P’s, or whatever) would just be cumbersome, especially for people like Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, for whom we’d either have to write the number in microscopically small fonts to fit it all on, or make especially big patches.  :P  How about, and I’m just thinking out loud here, putting a count of Placed Letterboxes that subsequently vanished into thin air, washed away in floods, got financed by Enron, destroyed by WMDs, invaded by insects or trampled by wildebeest.  That could indicate, in a way, just how far you’ll go to place a letterbox ANYWHERE.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
Of course, the simplest idea is USUALLY the best... like one simple patch.  (I’m just tossing random synapse firings out at you all.)<br/>

Inserting my two cents.  <br>
     Although the year on the patch gives it a distingushing kick, <br>
denoting your boxing almamater; it would bring the need for past <br>
years for us elders.  Being an out of stater it's my non bias <br>
opinion to leave them generic, bulk orders are cheaper and peolpe <br>
can buy a few and use them as they may.  I'm pretty sure you are <br>
charged by the stitch after the set up fee.  I think patches (LbNA) <br>
make great FF prizes and think it would be nice to suprize someone <br>
with a TX patch.  FPX # patches are already available on the main <br>
list, if you really need to add "flare" to your boxing attire. <br>

Okay, you guys really DO scare me sometimes!  And<br>
today has been especially scary!!  Starting with<br>
krohm's post this morning and ending with Steve's<br>
above - oh MY!<br>
<br>
Here's the scoop on patches...at least as I have it<br>
right now:<br>
<br>
I've run through several patch places I know of,<br>
including my latest favorite, and it appears that<br>
basically you can't get less than 50 anywhere, and 50<br>
is only slightly less expensive for the lot than 100<br>
is.  The cost per patch if we order 50 will be about<br>
$3.60 per person, whereas it will be about $1.90 if we<br>
order 100.  I say, let's order 100, unless I start<br>
getting a rash of orders to force our quantity upward<br>
of 100 (we're standing right about 50 right now - I'll<br>
post the list tomorrow since I left it at work).  How<br>
it works is this:  they charge you based on quantity<br>
and % of the patch that is stitched.  Personally, I<br>
like 100% stitched - they look finer.  But if someone<br>
has an issue with the price, I'll look at going with<br>
75% stitched.  And if anyone is considering using them<br>
for exchanges and FF prizes, as Steve suggested, the<br>
price may be a consideration (by the way, I kind of<br>
like that idea myself!).  <br>
<br>
I figure postage will be roughly .50 per patch (I<br>
haven't worked it out that far yet).  Of course, if<br>
you are planning on going to the gathering and would<br>
be willing to wait, I could just bring them to the<br>
gathering to save postage.<br>
<br>
I'll post the artwork on the group in the files<br>
section for y'all to see, but basically it looks like,<br>
well, the logo on the group homepage.  Imagine that!<br>

Whatever you end up doing is fine with me, but here's my vote: <br>
1. Order 100 patches so price is lower<br>
2. 100% stitched<br>
3. I'd be happy to wait to receive them at Brazos Bend<br>
4. CelticLions order=12 patches<br>
<br>
You're a sweetheart to take this on in addition to your job, family &<br>

PS - If you have a hard time getting up to an order of 100, let me know - we<br>

patches that allows the patch to be removed from a garment and then stuck 
back on to allow for laundering without affecting the patch.   It will 
stick over and over again.  It is usually available at Hobby Lobby, 
Michaels, and Joanns.  I have used this many times and it works 
great.  If it starts to lose it's stickiness, all you have to do is apply a 
bit more.  </font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, the year on the patches would be a great thing.<br>
Besides, "2005" on Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's<br>
patches could stand for the year or the number of<br>
boxes they've found and placed... :)<br>
<br>
Something we could do is leave a space on the patches<br>
so that folks could have their own F and/or P count<br>
embroidered on the patch.<br>
<br>
A space would allow folks to put the exact number of<br>
Fs or Ps they had at the end of 2005! This would make<br>
the patch a yearly count instead of having to wait for<br>
increments of 100 finds to get a new patch. A great<br>
way for us Texans to do it since boxes are not as<br>
quickly found as somewhere like CT or Dartmoor where<br>
100 boxes can be found in a single week of frantic<br>
hunting. Also great for the kids, as they would get an<br>
annual positive reward for their efforts, and we would<br>
all have a great yearly souvenier.<br>
<br>
Just my musings after spending the last 24 hours<br>
dealing with airports and getting bumped off a flight<br>
until this morning.<br>
<br>
Groggy, but glad to be home,<br>

intended on getting them ordered in time to take them<br>
to the gathering, but life crept in and pushed<br>
everything out of the way for a little while.  I'll be<br>
ordering them shortly though, and I'll post the list<br>
of who wants how many soon.  I'm still trying to catch<br>
up on several things that fell by the wayside while I<br>
tended to other matters, so it may be a few days<br>
before that list gets up and posted.<br>

Sorry y'all!<br>
