I know Baby Bear had a situation report just before Halloween and the Box of Bones letterbox was fine at that time.  I guess Mr. Bones could have been hanging out and chose Halloween to take a swim in the creek.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have it on good authority that the "Box of Bones" was not floating in the water as of last Saturday afternoon, which was after Mike the Geocacher found the wet box.  The informant also volunteered that, in his opinion, the found box was a part of the Mr Bones series, as suggested by MO5.  If anyone wants the box back, you might implore of the resident bear to retrieve it for you.  I asked, but he seems to be thinking that I'm setting a trap for him in order to get the necessary ingredients for my stew.  The thought couldn't be farther from the truth, but if he agrees to get the box, would you be so kind as to tell me what day he might be doing so?<br/>
