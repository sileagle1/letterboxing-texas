<div>Whoo Hoo! I love those Texas snowmen the kids build that are more dried grass than snow! It's just part of the "Texas thang". We had a little snow a couple days ago in McKinney, but as soon as the sun came up, it turned to rain. No chance to build a snowman, but it was fun to wake up to it. It's really cold here right now (30 degrees) but I'm heading out to replace a couple of logbooks - if the trails aren't too muddy.</div>
<div>Enjoy your Sugar Land snow!</div>
