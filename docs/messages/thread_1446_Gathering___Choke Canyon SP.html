<div>Choke Canyon State Park (Calliham Unit) gets my vote.   There are a couple of boxes in the park and another few in the area.  Choke Canyon has great fishing and boating.  Not as many hiking trails as some of the park,  but it does have it's share.  There is primitive camping as well as cabins and RV camping sites  (some of these are my former front yard about 25 years ago, before the park).  There is the "Kitchen" that is a fantastic group picnic area.  It has an actual kitchen with stove/oven and refrigerator.  If we decide to go for Choke, I'll get my act in gear and plant more there.  Busy Bee, you up for a challenge of planting boxes at Choke/Three Rivers?</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, I'm up for it, and would vote for either Choke Canyon or Goliad <br/>
State Park. Actually there is one LB at Choke Canyone that I don't <br/>
think ever made it to the database. My DIL planted it on a birding <br/>
trail, but the lb.org database was all messed up for a few days when <br/>
she was trying to post the clues. I don't think she ever got back to <br/>
it. The trail she hid it on, has various kinds/styles of birdhouses <br/>
in the trees all along the trail....including HUGE ones that I <br/>
assume are for owls. There is at least one geocache there too - <br/>
maybe more, I don't know. <br/>
<br/>
As for Goliad, I absolutely LOVE the history of that area. There are <br/>
several state park areas...Mission La Bahia with a museum attached <br/>
and interesting ruins on the grounds....Presidio La Bahia with more <br/>
historical structures....and the new archeleogical excavation-in-<br/>
progress of Mission Rosario. There is also the historical town <br/>
square and all those huge oak trees, including the old hanging tree. <br/>
The area figured quite largely in the 'Ox-Cart War', too. Fannin <br/>
Battlefield is nearby. <br/>
<br/>
Adding my 2 cents to Calico Rose's...<br/>
