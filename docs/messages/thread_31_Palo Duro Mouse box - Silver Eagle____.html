<br/>
A great trip to Palo Duro Canyon over the weekend!  The weather was <br/>
excellent and the day was beautiful to find your box.  Your box is <br/>
in great shape and we were the 3rd to find it.  Was hoping to be the <br/>
first!  Loved your stamp!  Thank YOU!<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>
Ciao,<br/>
