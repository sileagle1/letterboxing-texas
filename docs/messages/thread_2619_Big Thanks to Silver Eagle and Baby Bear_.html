<div><font size="2">I've decided, for me, the Gathering definitely needs to be four days! One day to travel, plant my box and take my clues to a copy shop; the second day for having fun at the gathering - just hanging around the pavilion meeting everyone and eating all the goodies; day three for finding all the new boxes hidden during the event, then day four for a leisurely trip home with plenty of time for boxing on the way home. I only had time to find three boxes at the event and two on the way home the next day. Of course, that just means I HAVE to come back before long. Lake Somerville is such a nice place, and we had so much fun meeting everyone and doing all those exchanges. Like Boots and Lone Star Q, I loved playing the trivia game and hearing all the stories that went along with it. I would like to thank Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for bringing it all together, and also everyone who could find the time to come. It was another great gathering and I'm already looking forward to our FIFTH annual gathering.</font></div>

great time we had at the gathering. We are new at this letterboxing <br>
thing so did not know what to expect but we were not disapointed. The <br>
other boxers were very friendly and patience with us. Thanks for <br>
those who gave the lessons on carving stamps and making books. We <br>
learned a lot but know it will take a lot of practice before we can <br>
come close to the quality that you showed us. Thanks again and we had <br>
fun. All 6 of us Adams Trails group. --- In <br>
