Each box has a unique perspective brought by the person who placed it. Sometimes it's wonderfully written clues, sometimes a magnificently carved stamp or handmade logbook. Sometimes it's an amazing hiding place. Then there are those "blue diamond" type boxes that seem to combine the best of everything. Just remember that whoever placed that box took the time and trouble and offered their creative talents just for your enjoyment - so do exactly that.... take
 time to enjoy and appreciate each box. Unless you hear the bugle call of an army of mosquitos descending upon you (or a hunger bear), take time to look at the stamps that are already in a logbook and write a brief message.  In other words, take time to smell the roses!</font></div> <div><font size="2">Puddle Splasher</font></div> <div> </div> <div></div></div> <div> </div> <blockquote style="BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid"> <div style="FONT: 10pt Arial">----- Original Message ----- </div> <div style="BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial"><b>From:</b> <a href="mailto:barefootlucy@gmail.com" title="barefootlucy@gmail.com">Barefoot Lucy</a> </div> <div style="FONT: 10pt arial"><b>To: </b><a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com" title="letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a></div> <div style="FONT: 10pt arial"><b>Sent:</b> 6/21/2007 9:51:44 AM </div> <div style="FONT: 10pt arial"><b>Subject:</b>

head-light.  It is on an elastic band.  It runs on 3 AAA 
batteries.  It has 4 modes - spotlight, floodlight, combined spot/flood 
lights, and red light.  It is lighter and more compact than the AA 
mini-mag-lights.  And - it has an on-off switch that isn't likely to be 
turned on accidentally unless you sit on it just right.  Throw one in your 
pack (with a set of spare batteries) and it is all you will need.  More 
than enough light for hiking at night - keeps both hands free - runs 50 hours on 
one set of batteries - the spotlight is good enough to signal for rescue - and 
you can use the red light for working when you don't want to be 
seen.</span></font></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">My 
suggestions....  lets see....</font></span></div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#1.  Take plenty of water.  If you ask around you will get 
people to tell you stories from being uncomfortable getting back to the car all 
the way to getting sick and wondering if they were going to make it back to the 
car.  You can go a few days without food.  But you may not make a few 
hours without water.  I would rather dump water at the end of the trip then 
to wish I had water 1/2 way through the trip.  I have found the easiest way 
to carry water and gear is a good Camel-Bak.  I started off with the cheap 
ones from wal-mart.  Out-grew it in about 1 outing.  I eventually 
ended up getting several true Camel-Baks.  I like the military 
models.  They are rugged and tough - but a bit heavier than the 
light-weight civilian models.  But then again - I hike a 
lot.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#2.  Get a cheap GPS - and use it.  It can save you time.  
It can save your life!  If you are a techie - get a good GPS.  One 
with maps in it.  Its a whole other subject, but I wrote an E-mail on 
selecting a GPS unit - I may still have it if someone wants to see 
it.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#3.  Mark the location of your car in the GPS before you 
start.  There have been a few times when a letterbox hunt led me in a 
circle, and I was able to get back to the car in 10 minutes instead of 1.5 hours 
going back down the trail.  And in bad weather of if you get lost the GPS 
can get you back to your car.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#4.  When planning to hunt letterboxes, use Google Earth.  Read 
the clues and plot it as much as possible so you know what you are headed 
into.  In fact, then I am letterboxing in a strange city, I plot all the 
driving directions to the final parking point, then program it into the vehicle 
GPS.  Then I just search for the nearest letterbox and let the GPS direct 
my driving.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div><span class="081573411-22062007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#5.  STAY ALERT on the trail.  There may be bad animals or bad 
people out there.  But if you are alert you will not be surprised.  
Your brain is your most important weapon.  Use it.</font></span></div><!-- Converted from text/plain format --><br/>
