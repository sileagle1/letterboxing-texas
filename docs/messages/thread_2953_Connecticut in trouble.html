                    <html><body><div>This has turned out to be something upward of 50 boxes, and most of them being boxes that had very recently been reported found.  So there are very few that are iffy (maybe they were there before, maybe they were already missing) - the stolen boxes were almost entirely active, available boxes.  And I'm sure there are still quite a few they haven't yet discovered to be gone.  I've been reading up on it, and it appears the boxes are going missing from high box populated areas, specifically: Harkness State Park, Bluff Point, UCONN Avery Point, Waterford, Groton, and Gilette's Castle.  I think I also read Rocky Point was hit.   Is your box in any of those areas, PS?
<br/> </div>
<div>I have to agree with you about getting used to the meanness.  News articles pop up on my desktop periodically throughout the day and I often read them while I'm on hold or waiting on conference calls, or whatever.  I see so many things come across about missing kids, missing moms, kids abusing other kids, parents torturing kids - I finally turned the news services off because I couldn't stand to read them anymore.  I don't want to reach the day when I'm not horrified by things like that.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What scares me most about this massive theft is that means someone is willfully deliberately destroying the property of others and for what reason?  Now our CT friends are going out to try to find what's there and what's not, and some of them want to catch the folks in the act.  I worry about them and their safety as they do this.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I might mention that we should keep this discussion off the national lists.  It's been out there for a day or two, but the culprit is very likely reading the boards and getting the attention he likely wants by reading about himself.
