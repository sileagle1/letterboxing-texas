                    <div class="plaintext-content">So I get this excited can barely understand fast paced talker on my<br/>
phone.  After thinking about the conversation, this is what I hear.<br/>
<br/>
"Stacy..we need to get in our cars NOW and go to Wills Point."  OMG! I<br/>
say.  The bus The bus!"<br/>
<br/>
Turns out Texas Pokey saw the post 4 minutes after it was posted.  I<br/>
throw the kids in the car.  Yes I buckled up Tadpole in his car seat.<br/>
 Luckily the diaper bag was packed and the car was full of gas.  I<br/>
head towards Txtatas to get hernot knowing if she is going with us<br/>
yet.  Hee hee.  Second call from TP that TT cannot go this time.  Darn<br/>
It!!<br/>
<br/>
I make a U-turn and race for the freeway.  After hitting the drive<br/>
thru for the older boys, I race for Lake Tawakoni SP.  I had to put<br/>
the cruise control on to control my speed down the I20.  Going 70mph<br/>
never seemed so slow.  Thank goodness I was there not that long ago<br/>
and still remember how to get there.  If you know meI have no memory<br/>
of where places are located or how to get home from them.  My<br/>
instructions from TP are "if you get there before metackle anyone in<br/>
our way to the bus."  Hmmm..should be interesting.<br/>
<br/>
Upon arrival to the park I jump from the car, scan the parking lot to<br/>
see if I recognize any cars from Bastrop.  Nopethank goodness.  No<br/>
tackling necessary.  TP pulls in next to me within minutes of my<br/>
arrival.  I leave my kids and the baby at the car and the rest of us<br/>
just about run down the trail.  After walking and sinking in poison<br/>
ivy/oak I we make it to the tree.<br/>
<br/>
SO AT 4:12 THE TEXAS TOUR BUS 2 has been busjacked.<br/>

<p>So I get this excited can barely understand fast paced talker on my<br/>phone. After thinking about the conversation, this is what I hear.<br/><br/>"Stacy..we need to get in our cars NOW and go to Wills Point." OMG! I<br/>say. The bus The bus!"<br/><br/>Turns out Texas Pokey saw the post 4 minutes after it was posted. I<br/>throw the kids in the car. Yes I buckled up Tadpole in his car seat.<br/>Luckily the diaper bag was packed and the car was full of gas. I<br/>head towards Txtatas to get hernot knowing if she is going with us<br/>yet. Hee hee. Second call from TP that TT cannot go this time. Darn<br/>It!!<br/><br/>I make a U-turn and race for the freeway. After hitting the drive<br/>thru for the older boys, I race for Lake Tawakoni SP. I had to put<br/>the cruise control on to control my speed down the I20. Going 70mph<br/>never seemed so slow. Thank goodness I was there not that long ago<br/>and still remember how to get there. If you know meI have no memory<br/>of where places are located or how to get home from them. My<br/>instructions from TP are "if you get there before metackle anyone in<br/>our way to the bus." Hmmm..should be interesting.<br/><br/>Upon arrival to the park I jump from the car, scan the parking lot to<br/>see if I recognize any cars from Bastrop. Nopethank goodness. No<br/>tackling necessary. TP pulls in next to me within minutes of my<br/>arrival. I leave my kids and the baby at the car and the rest of us<br/>just about run down the trail. After walking and sinking in poison<br/>ivy/oak I we make it to the tree.<br/><br/>SO AT 4:12 THE TEXAS TOUR BUS 2 has been busjacked.<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>
