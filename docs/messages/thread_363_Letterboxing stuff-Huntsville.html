There hobby/craft stores just down I-45 in Conroe.<br/>
You got Walmart and a few $ stores up there.<br/>

&gt;Hey All,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm looking for good places in the Huntsville area to buy letterboxing<br/>
&gt;stuff. Most of mine got left back home when I came here for college<br/>
&gt;(tragic, isn't it?) anyhow, any points in the right direction or good<br/>
&gt;letterboxes in my general area would be really helpful!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
