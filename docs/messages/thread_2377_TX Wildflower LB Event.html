<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/<br>
<br>
The Event webpage with links to campsites and cities is at:<br>

<br>
I highly recommend making camping reservations soon. Baby Bear and I<br>
will be camping in Cedar Elm camping area starting Friday, 3/2/07, and<br>
we hope many of you will stop by that night for relaxed conversation<br>
before the frenzy of the Event starts. We will have a campfire and<br>
maybe we can talk Barefoot Lucy into bringing her homemade Irish<br>
Cream. We will add more details later, especially about food. Since<br>
so many attend Events these days, we may just have everyone bring their<br>
own. The pavilion will hold 100, so I hope we fill it up!<br>
