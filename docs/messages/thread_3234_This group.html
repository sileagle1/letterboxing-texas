<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I agree with 
sandibox.  I joined this group over 4 years ago, and through this group I 
have learned a lot about letterboxing and about our crazy bunch of Texas 
letterboxers.  It is a good place to ask questions, get to know others, and 
stop by for a laugh.  For me there is a real sense of community on this 
list, and heck, you will have a much better chance of a good read like a story 
from Barefoot Lucy here.  Plus, if you are planning a trip and need some 
advice, our resident travel agent Silver Eagle will be here, not AQ.  I 
love this list.  MO5</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I might suggest that you go to the "messages" site on the <br>
letterboxingtexas group, and go back to the oldest messages and start <br>
enjoying reading through some of them. It will give you a real sense of <br>
the history of this group. This group is "owned and moderated" by a <br>
couple of the original letterboxers in the state and started just <br>
before the first annual statewide event in Texas about five years ago. <br>
It's a very friendly site and the members strive to keep it that way. <br>
Although Texas is a vast state, the annual state events have been well <br>
attended over the years and some real friendships have developed (at <br>
the Events as well as mini-meets and over the internet).<br>
In fact, we've had visitors from Rhode Island (Wanda), Tennessee <br>
(MoWizLiz), California (HummerLady?), Louisiana, Oklahoma, New York and <br>
other states attend our events which makes them all the more fun! In <br>
fact, when we've learned that a boxer was going to be visiting the <br>
state, we've been known to throw together a mini-meet in their honor... <br>
like when MoWizLiz and Dewberry visited the Dallas/Ft Worth area a few <br>
months ago.<br>
<br>
Whereas most  of the "talk" on this list is letterboxing related, we <br>
have been known to get off the subject a wee bit from time to time, <br>
usually with some good spirited bantering. There was once a subject of <br>
what "stuff" we each had stored in our closets (baby food jars etc) <br>
that we just couldn't get rid of... that actually stemmed from a <br>
discussion of letterboxing supplies taking over our houses, but soon <br>
left the "letterboxing track" and took on a life of its own. It was a <br>
lot of fun... plus revealing the junk you have shoved in your closets <br>
is a good way to get to know each other better!<br>
<br>
In other words, welcome to the list, KNSs, and enjoy the fun. It's a <br>
nice group of people.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a lot of "regionalism" for lack of a better word in <br>
letterboxing.   In different sections of the country, people have <br>
different approaches to hiding, clue writing, cooties, exchanges, <br>
travelers and more.  People are more or less hardcore about different <br>
aspects, etc.  For instance, here, we for the most part don't mess with <br>
cooties or fleas, although plenty of gatherings in other areas are <br>
crawling with them.  It's one of the things that I think is interesting <br>
about letterboxing in different states--you get inspired and intrigued <br>
by different ways of doing things.  <br>
<br>
This extends a lot to which websites are used.  I much prefer the <br>
mapping abilities of AQ, but a lot of Texas letterboxers don't use AQ <br>
at all.  But, then Eli was here recently visiting from Atlanta, he <br>
forgot to check letterboxing.org, because everyone in his area uses AQ <br>
and people often don't list their clues on letterboxing.org any more.  <br>
It didn't occur to him that there would be clues only listed there.<br>
<br>
In general, I have a love-hate relationship with yahoo groups.  But, <br>
then, I often have that same relationship with the boards at AQ. <br>
