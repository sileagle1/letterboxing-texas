<p>To The Friday Night Crew.</p>
<p>Last Friday night Martin (WB5LJO) suggested a restaurant to me. Moni took me 
there today for Father's Day. I liked it, so much so that it is worth reporting 
to you-all. </p>
<p>The place?</p>
<p>Chicago's Street Food.</p>
<p>2400 N. Mesa St, Ste D.</p>
<p>NO WEB SITE - but I have a copy of the menu. Maybe Moni should talk them into 
some web work..... Or maybe GOOGLE just didn't find them. Anyway......</p>
<p>Upon entering the door, the initial search is always for the right signs. 
They are there, the unlicensed possession bla bla bla..... Good to Go. There is 
a bar of a sorts in there, but no 51-% signs in sight. So we continued on 
in.</p>
<p>The atmosphere - it's as if you were sitting on the patio of a sidewalk caf 
inside the city. Lit, but dim, like the sun isn't coming down between the 
buildings. The music wasn't loud, but was noticeable. Blues and Jazz, what 
Chicago music is known for.</p>
<p>For an appetizer, we each started out with a CUP of Chile. CUP - is a 
misnomer. It is a small BOWL, 6" in diameter and 3" deep. I like Chile, glad I 
didn't ask for the BOWL! Beef, pork, and ground beef with a touch of beans. 
Smothered in Cheddar cheese and chopped raw onion. Just like I remember it from 
Chicago.</p>
<p>For the main course, Moni had the Dick ButKus Burger, (Famous Chicago Bear 
player </p></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Butkus"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><span lang="EN">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Butkus</span></font></font></u></a></span><span lang="EN">) Big slab of ground beef, with caramelized onions and cheese melted on 
top, served on a Chicago style Kaiser roll. Fries or a house salad on the side 
for no extra charge. The onions and cheese was just like I remember it.
<p>For my main course, I was tempted to have the Wrigley Field Hot Dog. It is 
named after the baseball field where the Chicago Cubs play (</p></span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><span lang="EN">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrigley_Field</span></font></font></u></a><span lang="EN">). But I was hungry, and Moni pointed out that we had hot dogs Friday 
night. So I picked the Hancock Italian Beef sandwich. It is named after the John 
Hancock Center (</span><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock_Center"><u><font color="#0000ff"><font color="#0000ff"><span lang="EN">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Hancock_Center</span></font></font></u></a><span lang="EN">) in downtown Chicago. It was as good as ANY Roast Beef Sandwich I ever 
had in Chicago! The beef was a little dry, but they offer it dipped. It was 
served with a small dish of ajure sauce. I poured <span class="616580104-16062008">s</span>ome of that over the beef and it was perfect. 
Being a cheater, I took the French Fries. Was I ever GLAD! Crispy fried and VERY 
HOT! A little salt and catsup and it was like when I was a kid!
<p>The Wrigley Field Hot Dog sounds like the AUTHENTIC version, Vienna Sausage, 
and all the right fixings, including the special salt, sport peppers and pickle 
spear. NEXT TIME - THE WRIGLEY FIELD HOT DOG FOR ME !!!!!</p>
<p>For desert we split a piece of cheese cake. Even that was good, lots of 
cream-cheese, and just sweet enough with a nice firm graham cracker crust.</p>
<p>Truth, the only bad thing in the whole place was the coffee. Well - coffee 
can be bad anywhere. New kid - didn't know the machine. But they didn't charge 
us for it either.</p>
<p>I was so impressed that I had a 30 minute chat with the manager after we ate. 
The discussion with the manager turned in to a "Do you remember this place in 
Chicago" game. The man has been there, or he studies well. He welcomes the 
evening business. If we have a group of more than 4-6, he says call ahead a few 
hours before and he will reserve us a place. </p>
<p>I recommend we go there some Friday night. How about - NEXT Friday night? It 
will likely be Mike-Moni-Reiner-Paul. Anyone else it welcome, but that is the 
usual 3rd Friday group.</p>
<p>Oh - and best of all - Those of you who know Freddie - KC5WPH.... His 
daughter works there!</p>
<p>What say you - Friday night crew?</p></span></div>

<div>Hey, just wanted y'all to know. I'm having surgery on Monday at noon 
      (cst). Begging for prayers, well wishes, happy thoughts, for my family 
      (who has to put up with me), my doctor (well, that doesn't need an 
      explanation) and me (cuz I'm a big baby).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is the third hernia surgery since February 2007. This surgeon 
      said that the second hernia (which he is fixing again) was probably caused 
      by the first hernia. When they were fixing the first hernia, they probably 
      cut me by accident.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, while I'm laying back, drooling on myself, y'all box on. Write 
      lots, cuz I'll continue to live vicariously through you.</div>
