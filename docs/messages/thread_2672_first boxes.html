<div>Congrats on finding your first box!  I still remember the thrill of 
finding my first letterbox, Mercer Monarch.  One of my friends and I went 
out to Mercer Arboretum one afternoon with clues in hand.  Of course, we 
went the wrong way and the wrong way again, but eventually found the box.  
We have pictures of us pointing to where the box is located, opening the box, 
looking at the logbook etc...then we realized that we didn't have a stamp, a 
logbook of our own, NOTHING with us!  So...we had to come back at a later 
date with "supplies" to letterbox!  I designed/drew the images for 
our stamps for the both of us and sent the images to a friend in Colorado 
who owns a laser stamp company, and after they arrived, was set to go. The 
friend lost interest, so I went back to Mercer by myself to officially stamp 
in!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I quickly became addicted and the competitive person that I am, decided 
that I needed to find as many boxes as fast as I could!  Some of the next 
few were Java Joy, Dodge the Dillo and Temporary Inversion, followed by LB 
Retriever, which, by the way, had a really cool dog at the LB location that I 
wish could have taken  home with me!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope you and your family continue to have fun on your letterboxing 
adventures!!</div>

the only letterbox in San Jacinto County at that time, just 5 miles <br/>
from our house.  We didn't actually find it, we were just along for <br/>
the ride: LSQ's brother, El Lobo and his wife Star Seeker from West <br/>
Texas came to visit us for Thanksgiving, 2005 and told us about this <br/>
interesting new hobby they had read about called Letterboxing.  So, <br/>
after eating our Thanksgiving meal, we went as a group to find the <br/>
Big Creek Bug.  EL and SS had their stamps all carved and ready to <br/>
go, so they stamped into their first found box.  We had to go home <br/>
and make some stamps before we could stamp in, which we did.  Then, <br/>
we went to The Woodlands and found Runs for Chocolate's Runner <br/>
Series boxes and that was great fun, too.  We loved her trail name.  <br/>
By the way, Silver Eagle, whatever happened to Big Creek Bug? I see <br/>
it's not listed on LbNA and neither is Baby Bear's box, Beer Belly <br/>
Bob, out at Big Creek.<br/>

<br/>
Finch Arboretum - by Ian - 08/31/2002 - Spokane, WA<br/>
<br/>
As luck would have it, there was a Hitchhiker in the box called <br/>
Hitch, so I actually got 2 finds my first time out.  We had no <br/>
supplies with us so could not stamp in, but luckily the box had <br/>
postcards with the stamp image on them so I was able to take one and <br/>
glue it into my logbook that I later purchased.  Also by luck, the HH <br/>
had good instructions on what to do since we were clueless, and I <br/>
brought it back to TX with me.  Unfortunately, there were no boxes <br/>
near me to place it in, so this forced me to plant my first box (Zube <br/>
Zephyr) so Baby Bear could then take the HH.  Of course this forced <br/>
him to place a box, which got both of us started placing for each <br/>
other.  I am convinced that if we had not found that first box, we <br/>
might never have continued letterboxing.  And if it had not contained <br/>
a HH, I don't think we would have started placing boxes as soon as we <br/>
did.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and my first box in TX was:<br/>
<br/>
Star Gazer - by Baby Bear - 11/30/2002 - Brazos Bend SP<br/>
It also contained a HH (Texas Traveler).<br/>
<br/>

many of us<br/>
&gt; credit Silver Eagle or Baby Bear for our first boxes, and if they <br/>
weren't<br/>
&gt; our very first planters, they were certainly among the first five.  <br/>
I think<br/>

&gt; I think it would be interesting for each of us to take a moment and <br/>
note<br/>

was:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mine:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Tejas-Baby Bear-September 1, 2003<br/>
&gt; Spanish Flag-Silver Eagle-September 1, 2003<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And actually, the box I referred to in a post earlier today as the <br/>
box that<br/>
&gt; was found wet this weekend - WAS Tejas, our first box to find.  I <br/>
got a lot<br/>
&gt; of pleasure from showing my young boxer friend our log entries in <br/>
that box -<br/>
&gt; three of us had store-boughts and one of us drew an image in - and <br/>
telling<br/>
&gt; her that it was our first.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Both of those boxes were planted on 1/30/03 (Spanish Flag was <br/>
actually<br/>
&gt; planted a month earlier, but was replaced on 1/30), and aside from <br/>
Baby Bear<br/>
&gt; and Silver Eagle each finding the other's box, we were the first <br/>
finders -<br/>
&gt; those two boxes waited 7 months for us to come along!<br/>

in Spokane, Washington on 8/31/2002.   My first find in Texas was his <br/>
box, Zube Zephyr on 9/21/2002.   The next 4 finds were in Colorado <br/>
(as Texas had few boxes at the time), and my first placed box would <br/>
actually be put in Louisiana, "Cypress Bend" on 11/08/2002.  As many <br/>
of you have probably done, I carved this stamp with the name spelled <br/>
out.  Only problem was the image was not reversed, so when stamped it <br/>
was a reverse.  So I guess it became my first and second carved <br/>
stamps!  I don't believe it was ever found before it went missing.   <br/>
My 1st Texas box was "Texas Birth" at Washington-on-the-Brazos.  The <br/>
original went missing fairly quickly, but was replaced with a new <br/>
stamp in it's current location.  My oldest original stamp is at <br/>
Stephen F. Austin S.R.A., "Father of Texas".  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As luck would have it, there was a Hitchhiker in the box called <br/>
&gt; Hitch, so I actually got 2 finds my first time out.  We had no <br/>
&gt; supplies with us so could not stamp in, but luckily the box had <br/>
&gt; postcards with the stamp image on them so I was able to take one <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; glue it into my logbook that I later purchased.  Also by luck, the <br/>
HH <br/>
&gt; had good instructions on what to do since we were clueless, and I <br/>
&gt; brought it back to TX with me.  Unfortunately, there were no boxes <br/>
&gt; near me to place it in, so this forced me to plant my first box <br/>
(Zube <br/>
&gt; Zephyr) so Baby Bear could then take the HH.  Of course this forced <br/>
&gt; him to place a box, which got both of us started placing for each <br/>
&gt; other.  I am convinced that if we had not found that first box, we <br/>
