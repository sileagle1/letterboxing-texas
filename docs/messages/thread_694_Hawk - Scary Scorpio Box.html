Hey Hawk, we are on spring break -- so I took the kids to Jesse Jones <br>
and we went and found the Scary Scorpio box, which is in great <br>
shape.  The little village was not open, but we actually had more <br>
fun, because we were the only ones out there, the kids had so much <br>
fun.  My son wanted to live there.  lol  Next to that big tree and <br>
vine is a hole in the ground - a pretty good size one.  and there <br>
were some strange tracks around that area, AND there were a couple of <br>
eaten corn cobs (I guess it got them from that corn cob shed in the <br>
village) man I just wanted to get that box, do are stamps  -- I was <br>
kind of nervous about putting the box back.  My 10 yo daughter was <br>
with us -- matter of fact she was the one that found the tree, I <br>
thought it was the tree right by the trail.  ANYWAY, she put it back <br>
and I went with her to make sure she covered it up and it got back in <br>
the same place, but she was the brave one, mainly because she did not <br>
notice the hole.  Usually my husband is with us and he takes care of <br>
that stuff.<br>
<br>
We had fun and you stamp was great -- you do such a great job at <br>
carving, remarkable.!!!  THANKS   ANITA<br>
