<div>Read my sad tale of woe and heed the moral of 
the story:</div>
<div>  </div>
<div>You may recall a few months ago I reported 
that a geocache had been placed right on top of one of my letterboxes, <em><u>In 
the Tree: Meghan's Bird</u></em>.  This letterbox is one of 3 I'd carved 
and placed with my granddaughters, and was a special box in a very pretty park 
in Grapevine where it enjoyed many visitors.  The geocache is a great big 
honking blue-lid box that really doesn't fit the hole.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I attempted to communicate with the geocacher 
to see if he realized my little letterbox was already in that same location and 
would be willing to move his geocache.  He finally did respond, but refused 
to move the geocache, since he like the spot, too.  Well, today I 
discovered that the geocache has consumed the letterbox.  When I looked for 
the box, it was gone, but when I looked <u>inside</u> the huge geocache, there 
was my box, but inside was only a plastic letter 
<strong><u>K</u></strong>.  No stamp.  Rummaging through the contents 
of the geocache I found the logbook (hooray!), sort of rumpled but intact, and 
even my plastic bag that protected both the stamp and logbook was in there among 
the toys, although empty and somewhat the worse for wear.  I reclaimed the 
empty letterbox, the logbook and bag, leaving the geocache to call that 
hole in the tree home even though the little bird had been there for two 
years, happily and safely, until the geocache moved in on it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The little bird isn't gone for good. The 
other letterbox I had in the same park, <em><u>In the Creek: Lauren's Turtle 
2, </u></em>had also gone missing, as has <em><u>In the Pond: Allie's 
Duck</u></em> from the Bedford Boys Ranch Park.  All 3 letterboxes will 
soon be replaced with new stamps, new logbooks, new boxcs, and a new home.  
But it's a sad story, even so, that the geocache consumed the tiny bird.  
They just couldn't get along in the same home, apparently.  </div>
<div><u><strong><em></em></strong></u> </div>
<div><u><strong><em>Moral:</em></strong></u>  
Don't trust a Great Honking Geocache to share a hole in a tree with your tiny 
bird letterbox.</div>

<div>Well, I've already carved a new stamp for that box, as well as new stamps 
for Lauren's turtle and Allie's duck, and am just waiting for an opportunity to 
plant them in a new location, so watch for it!  I'm sorry I couldn't find a 
better place in the same park for these boxes, but I hope you'll make a trip 
there anyway to enjoy all the spring flowers in the botanic gardens and walk 
through the woods - it's a great little park in the center of Grapevine!
