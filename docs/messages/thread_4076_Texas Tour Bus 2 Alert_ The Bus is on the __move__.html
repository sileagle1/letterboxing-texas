<p>Well we've had a wonderful visit with the TTB2 at our house. We had so much fun looking at the stamps and reading the log book, it is really an awesome box. They turned out to be pleasant guests at Easter, helped bake cakes for 2 birthday parties and also helped out with cleaning trash up in the neighborhood for Earth Day. I also had them do some gardening in my yard to keep them busy. But after almost 3 weeks, it was time to kick them out and send them on their way. Since we had such a nice visit I decided to carve a caricature of the bus in rubber. <br/>
<br/>
After saying goodbye, they piled into their bus and started putt-putting up the North Central Expressway. I quietly tailed them to the Dayspring Nature Preserve in Allen, TX (622 Rainforest Ln) where they started driving on the sidewalk on the left of the playground, swerving around children and scaring moms. I ran after them, heading right at the split and went 50 steps to a point where there are two trees opposite one another on each side of the path and turned to the right to see them setting up camp on the left side of a tree with 3 trunks. I decided to park my memorial letterbox right under them and asked them to leave it be for future letterboxers to find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure they are looking for a new family to host them for May Day and Cinco de Mayo so if you are looking for some house guests, have fun searching for that bunch of free loaders. <br/>

<p>Chickens aren't known for their manners are they? That may cause the behavior to deteriorate... I'm glad you get to keep your head! I know I am rather attached to mine and can't imagine it would be easy to part with.</p>
