                    <html><body><div>Hello to all,</div> <div> </div> <div>Thank you all so much for the wonderful and warm welcome you have offered me and my family.  We are really having a great time and I think of you already as some of the best friends I have never yet met.  We were sorry to miss the gathering after all, since we were hoping to make it, but I don't intend to miss it next time it is at all close enough to be a reasonable trip for us (I realize that may be a few years, as it moves around to different locations).  </div> <div> </div> <div>I'm especially excited to share the news that my sister has finally joined the crowd and is carving stamps like crazy.  You can take my word for it that a stamp left by "Josephine" will be fun to see and neat -- she is much more artistic than I will ever be. (Although I do think that mine are getting a little better each time I try a new one, so maybe there is cause for hope.)</div> <div> </div> <div>Although we
 have been reading about letterboxing and wanting to do it for quite awhile, according to the dates in my logbook we have actually only been really actively trying it out since this year, only just a few months, and we have only placed/found just a few.  Therefore, I am going to go ahead and do away with our dear friend autumn.wind, who is not working out as well as I had hoped.  I didn't even realize what would bother me about her, until we met!  : )</div> <div> </div> <div>So, good bye now to her, and please make the introduction of my new and final name (to go along with the new and final stamp I mentioned earlier), Ashby.  Stay tuned for a new email to come later, that will reflect this name change.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Looking forward to a long and happy time together and to getting to meet you all as time goes on.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks!</div> <div> </div> <div>ashby</div> <div> </div><p>
