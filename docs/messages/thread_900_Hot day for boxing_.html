<div>We went out to Tomball today with great plans of finding all 3 
boxes in Burroughs park.  However the heat and 3 toddlers with their minds 
on nothing but the swimming pool (plus 7 other kids who didn't complain quite as 
much as the toddlers!) Limited us to only the True North? box...found alive and 
well.  Actually, thinking about what a circus my sister in law and I are 
when we go boxing with all the kids it is a miracle we have never been 
caught.  I guess people are too scared of that many kids in one place to 
notice what we are doing!  Anyway, we somehow managed to plant a new box in 
the park today...Harry's Headache.  So all you Harry Potter fans (and I 
know you are out there) brush up on your HP trivia, and I will try my best to 
post the clues tonight.  By the way, for those that searched for the May 
The Force Be With You box, Teamking found it, so its really there.  We have 
2 more in the series to plant, will try to do it Friday afternoon.  -Mother 
of Five</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, the reason we made the Harry box is becaus I am getting sick of my<br/>
9 year old asking me "how many days until Harry comes out?"...so he wrote<br/>
the questions for the clues to keep him occupied for a while.  He said he<br/>
was making them so that you would have to read the books to answer the<br/>
questions, "not just sit and watch the movies".  The "True North" box in the<br/>
same park was a big hit with the 7 and up crowd today, we let them do it<br/>
totally on their own, and just followed along.  They loved using the<br/>
compass!  We will be sure to have the Star Wars series complete for him when<br/>
he gets back.  We loved your Inversion box, by the way.-Mother of Five<br/>
