<div>Now that's a great Thanksgiving story! It embodies the true spirit of the Texas pioneer women. Too ill to run, but still manages to buy not TWO, but THREE pair of boots on Black Friday! Way to go, RfC - you're my hero!</div>

<div>My Thanksgiving weekend involved having all four of my wisdom teeth pulled.  The day before Thanksgiving.<wbr/>..what was I thinking?  Talk about a great weight loss program- it was really difficult trying to eat all of the tasty treats on Thanksgiving day, so I just gave up and fell asleep on the couch at my in-laws house!  The down side is that I signed up for the TXU Turkey Trot 10K in Houston and the dentist told me that I couldn't do it.  Bummer!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Friday morning I braved the malls ( couldn't find anyone who wanted to go with me!) and bought three pairs of boots at Macy's awesome sale, and two pair of pants for our upcoming trip to Italy.  My husband, who had been out running, decided to catch up with me at the mall and was amazed at all of my "Christmas shopping" until he found out it was all for me...</div>
