                    <div class="plaintext-content">SoccerChik and I haven't done much letterboxing since we returned <br/>
from Portland, and since I love boxing in cooler weather, we decided <br/>
today was too nice to pass up.  And the TX Tour Bus was just sitting <br/>
at Telge waiting for someone to wander by and grab it.  So we called <br/>
Pug Momma to see if she was game... she always is... and off we went.<br/>
<br/>
Our first stop was at Telge Park, where we found the TTB stranded on <br/>
the side of the road.  We didn't want that poor bus full of <br/>
passengers to freeze tonight, so we helped them back to our car.  <br/>
Then we found the seven new boxes that had been planted at Telge <br/>
since our visit last year and checked on my boxes.  All the finds <br/>
were in good shape, except my Vlad to Meet you box had been taken out <br/>
of its hidey hole by a critter and was laying out in the open about <br/>
10 feet away.  Glad I took the time to check on it!<br/>
<br/>
It was lunch-time, so we headed off toward Tomball, and stopped at <br/>
Los Cucos for some delicious Mexican food and their fantastic salsa. <br/>
(Runs For Chocolate, are you listening?)  We were so full when we <br/>
left that we all wanted to curl up and take a nap, but we soldiered <br/>
on to Burroughs Park.  There are quite a few boxes from The Great <br/>
Book Adventure that we'd never found.  The trails there still have <br/>
quite a bit of damage from Ike, and several times we had to climb <br/>
over downed trees to reach the letterboxes.  Most of the boxes we <br/>
found ranged from damp to down-right soggy. It is interesting to note <br/>
that lock-in-locks were slighly damp, but any other type of container <br/>
was pretty wet. I'll send updates to each of the planters, but if you <br/>
have boxes there, you might consider checking on them.  There are <br/>
still about 10 boxes in the Tomball area we haven't found, so if next <br/>
weekend is as nice as today, we might head back over there and do <br/>
some maintenance if possible.  I also want to plant another letterbox <br/>
in my "Thanksgiving in Plymouth" series, and one at a cool little <br/>
store we visited in downtown Tomball.<br/>
<br/>
Found:<br/>
1 TTB<br/>
12 Letterboxes<br/>
1 tick at Telge Park - beware!<br/>
<br/>
We had a great time.  Thanks to everyone who plants letterboxes for <br/>
us to find!<br/>

<div>Before my test, SJZ and I went shopping for dishes, which I had promised her back in August for her birthday.  Everywhere we went, we passed by parks and places that I knew boxes to be, but sadly, I had left my stack of Longview/Kilgore clues at home,  I actually had to move them to get my keys this morning just so I wouldn't forget them, but still I managed to leave them behind.  Thankfully, I'll be up that way pretty often since she has moved to that area and I'll be wanting to visit Trail Whale (and SJZ and RXKaffee)...</div>

<div>Interesting note about Lock &amp; Locks...</div>
