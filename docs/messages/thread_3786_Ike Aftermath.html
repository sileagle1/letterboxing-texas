                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear you are ok, and I agree with you about the heavy heart, <br/>
but also the pride in the people of Houston and surrounding areas.  <br/>
My in-laws live on Tiki Island and their house has major damage, but <br/>
is still there.  I went with them yesterday to help get some things <br/>
and pile the debris on the edge of the property.  The stairs were <br/>
gone so I had to climb up my extension ladder that we brought.  They <br/>
are not able to climb the ladder so it was a challenge for me to find <br/>
and get the correct items they were requesting, especially clothes <br/>
for my Mother in-law (no, not those shoes, the other black ones).  <br/>
The destruction on the island was depressing, so I can only imagine <br/>
what it is like on Galveston and other areas harder hit.  I'm sure <br/>
they will be staying with us for at least a month until their house <br/>
is habitable again.<br/>
<br/>
Another interesting thing I noticed after Ike was that when I finally <br/>
got power after 5 days and had a chance to check email, I had twice <br/>
as many people asking how Silver Eagle was than the "real" me.  <br/>
Instead of assuming my alter ego has more friends than me, I choose <br/>
to rationalize that the letterboxing community is just a great group!<br/>
Take care everyone.<br/>

&gt; We are here and safe, albeit with a heavy heart for all those who <br/>
suffered and continue to suffer because of Ike.  Now I have been <br/>
through a hurricane, I say give me a good old blizzard any old day.  <br/>
That being said, I saw again during this storm why I would never want <br/>
to live any place else on earth than right here in Houston.  The way <br/>
people have come together to help each other is amazing.  My heart <br/>
breaks when I see what has happened to Galveston and most especially <br/>
Bolivar, which I consider to be the most peaceful spot on earth.  My <br/>
neighbors have a woman who has spent her entire life on Bolivar <br/>
staying with them right now, she has lost her home, her business, the <br/>
ability to visit her parents' graves, everything.  I continue to feel <br/>
guilty every time I flush the toilet or turn on the lights in my <br/>
house.  The devastation this storm has left behind is unbelievable, <br/>
and I think we are just beginning to see the effects.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A big thank you to Lucy Lockett for checking on us, it made me so <br/>
happy to see your text message!  If I had any idea how to use my <br/>
phone (or any battery left) I would have answered you right away.  I <br/>
hope you are all safe and sound right now.  I am so thankful to be a <br/>
part of such a kind group of people.  -MO5 (plus every kid in the <br/>
neighborhood who can't play video games and has joined in the whiffle <br/>
ball game in my front yard!)<br/>
