                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been box'n and lurking since September of last year and have <br>
enjoyed every minute of my new hobby.  Thanks to all of you whose <br>
boxes I've been priviledged to find thus far.  They've always <br>
inspired me to go for that "next box" anxious to find another great <br>
stamp or amazing location.  <br>
<br>
The excitement of my first few finds was thrilling but I think I've <br>
come to appreciate lately the simplicity of this past-time.  You <br>
plant, I plant, we re-hide well and appreciate each other's work at a <br>
pace that is comfortable for anyone who wants to participate.  I used <br>
to wonder about people who enjoy fishing.  I couldn't understand how <br>
they could appreciate something so still, quiet and bor-r-r-r-ing.  <br>
I'm getting older I guess `cause I think I'm getting it <br>
now.......It's the time spent not the number of fish caught.  <br>
<br>
By way of introduction I run a part-time medical transcription <br>
business out of our home and am a stay-at-home, homeschooling mother <br>
to our teen-age son who will graduate the end of this coming school <br>
year.  I'm already planning and have clues printed for the Waco boxes <br>
as hopefully he'll be attending Baylor after that.  My husband's not <br>
much into boxing now as he's much too busy but he loves being <br>
outdoors so I'm thinking after retirement and things slow down for <br>
him we'll be enjoying searching for boxes together.<br>
<br>
A couple of times lately I've gone boxing with my mother, various <br>
friends and other relatives but mostly I head out with my almost 7-<br>
year-old neice, Baby Dur.  She enjoys going "hiking" as she calls it <br>
but doesn't much care for the heat.  We'll get back in full swing as <br>
a team when the weather cools some but I go out whenever I get the <br>
opportunity with or without her.  <br>
<br>
Because of gas prices the way they are and the fact that there are <br>
minimal boxes in my area I've decided to try my hand at carving and <br>
planting thus the primary reason for introducing myself as I've <br>
planted 4 in the area recently (Sunnyvale, Dallas, and Richardson) <br>
and have more carved and ready to plant so be watching for new boxes <br>
on this side of Dallas.  Feedback as to reliability and accuracy of <br>
clues for these first few boxes at least would be appreciated.<br>
<br>
Looking forward to meeting you on the trails!<br>
<br>
Mthr21<br>
<br>
P.S. If you decide to travel to this area to find boxes and have a <br>
box just itchin' to be planted please bring it with you.  It would be <br>
much appreciated and I would be more than happy to keep an eye on it <br>
for you.<br>

We visited Baylor in April and though we were pressed for time I did <br>
manage to find two of your on-campus boxes. Looking forward to more <br>
leisurely visits in the future with more time to letterbox.  <br>
<br>
Great stamps by the way!<br>
