<br/>
He had a severe heart attack this week and is still hospitalized undergoing a kidney stone removal today.  It never rains but what it pours.  <br/>
<br/>
Neil's parents are very ill and HE has been taking care of them and working way too many hours on top of it.<br/>

I am sure she will need all our prayers at this time.<br/>

My father, Easterbelle's husband had a heart attack. He went into a coma. After 13 days stuck in a hospital in Alaska we were able to medivack him to Austin on my son's grandslammer's 10th birthday. Only to find he would never pull through:-(. We laid my daddy to rest 12 days ago. I kick and scream every night.  I miss him so much!!  My boys lost their dad 6 years ago, and now have lost the one man who was their world  they are only 7 and 10  Please know your friends are in my thoughts.  </div><div>Princess S</div><div>Ps I don't mind the contacts, but please go through me and not Easterbelle.
