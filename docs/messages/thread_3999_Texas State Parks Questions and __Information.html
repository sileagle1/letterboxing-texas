<div></div>
<div>If it turns out the other Lucy hasn't gotten a chance to remove her box, you might get her to write you a note giving you permission to claim it on her behalf and takeher notewith you. I think that would be a good way to demonstrate our cooperative nature on each other's behalf for the sake of being responsible in their parks. What do you think?</div>
<div></div>
<div>If we were to go at this systematically, I think it would probably be a good idea to work on getting all the boxes in each park legal at one timeso that none are left hanging out at risk if the rangers want to get all regulatory on the "non-compliant" planters.</div>

<p>The state park nearest me is Lake Livingston State Park. Oddly enough, I've never placed a box there. I think it's a good place to start because, a few weeks ago, the park ranger contacted Lucy Locket to tell her that they were doing some clearing and that her box might be in danger, so she went and removed it (I think).<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Okay well.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I just talked to the park superintendent at Tyler State Park. He was aware of letterboxing and said "they" had had a discussion about it two or three years ago, but because it was so unknown they opted not to treat it separately, but to lump it together with geocaching. I told him there were a few fundamental differences, but that for their purposes, I could see that rationale. He didn't seem to care to get into the whole philosophical thing, so I didn't push for it. He did say that in his years at the park, only two people had ever inquired about letterboxing - me and a reporter. And he referred the reporter to the geocaching website.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The conversation was going very well, so I went ahead and told him I already had a box there, and it had been there for nearly five years, since before the policy was even a thought. I told him that as we have developed a clearer awareness of the policy, I decided I wanted to get my box "legal", to which he laughed and said they appreciate that. Because of the direction the conversation was going (as in, he was going to look up the website as soon as we hung up), I told him there were two other boxes there and that I had been in touch with the placer to offer my assistance in getting their boxes registered as well. </div>
<div></div>
<div>He emailed me the form and told me we could handle all of it by email. He said his staff was not very well-versed on either geocaching or letterboxing, so they wouldn't really have any idea what I was asking about if I were to try to talk to them and he wasn't there. </div>
<div></div>
<div>He seemed to me to be understanding of our use of the park. I dropped a few keywords like LNT andenvironmentally responsible and cooperative. His experience with geocachers was apparently very positive and it seems he expects the same from us. </div>
<div></div>
<div>So - I'm filling out permits and will email them back to him, then I'll head up there on Sunday afternoon to see about getting the boxes in good order, if they aren't already.</div>

<p>The other Lucy's box isn't listed anymore, so I guess she removed it, but there are other boxes there (per LbNA) by 7 different placers, including Quetzel (NorthStars daughter, coincidentally, pretty sure that one is gone), the Frye Team and Tall Texan (haven't heard from the last two in a long time. I'm leaning toward being a little cautious at first, and just trying one new box to see what kind of feeling I get from the ranger's reaction to my request. I don't think I want to hit him with that many requests at once.<span class="q"><br/>

I've got the permit applications prepared and now I just have to scan them back in and email them to him (they are in Word format, but they require a signature). Let's see if he has any comments or criticisms about the placements of the boxes I'm filing for. In other words, let's make sure there aren't any hidden landmines before you jump in.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Needless to say, even if the park is friendly to boxing, we still need to bear in mind that our placements can always be turned down if they aren't well chosen or if they feel their park is becoming over-populated. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I imagine we can do a database in the group homepage to show what parks have been contacted and who to contact regarding box placements. I'm going to get home later this evening and clean his form up a bit, then post it to the group. </div>

<div>But yeah, it looks like it will be a good place to plant!</div>

<p>Thanks.. i'm glad you found out about tyler state park!.. i'm guessing this means it will probaly be ok for me to put mine there too then!.. do you think when a list gets made of state parks that are ok or not wiht letterboxing an e-mail address/ contact name could be put by each parks name! to make it easier for people to contact them for future boxes etc!?<br/>
or could you let me know the e-mail address so i can ask about mine whne i'm ready to place them!?<span class="q"><br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>

</p><div><span class="e" id="q_11ffc88ca652fe46_2">&gt; Okay well.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I just talked to the park superintendent at Tyler State Park. He was aware<br/>&gt; of letterboxing and said "they" had had a discussion about it two or three<br/>
&gt; years ago, but because it was so unknown they opted not to treat it<br/>&gt; separately, but to lump it together with geocaching. I told him there were<br/>&gt; a few fundamental differences, but that for their purposes, I could see that<br/>
&gt; rationale. He didn't seem to care to get into the whole philosophical<br/>&gt; thing, so I didn't push for it. He did say that in his years at the park,<br/>&gt; only two people had ever inquired about letterboxing - me and a reporter.<br/>
&gt; And he referred the reporter to the geocaching website.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The conversation was going very well, so I went ahead and told him I already<br/>&gt; had a box there, and it had been there for nearly five years, since before<br/>
&gt; the policy was even a thought. I told him that as we have developed a<br/>&gt; clearer awareness of the policy, I decided I wanted to get my box "legal",<br/>&gt; to which he laughed and said they appreciate that. Because of the direction<br/>
&gt; the conversation was going (as in, he was going to look up the website as<br/>&gt; soon as we hung up), I told him there were two other boxes there and that I<br/>&gt; had been in touch with the placer to offer my assistance in getting their<br/>
&gt; boxes registered as well.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; He emailed me the form and told me we could handle all of it by email. He<br/>&gt; said his staff was not very well-versed on either geocaching or<br/>&gt; letterboxing, so they wouldn't really have any idea what I was asking about<br/>
&gt; if I were to try to talk to them and he wasn't there.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; He seemed to me to be understanding of our use of the park. I dropped a few<br/>&gt; keywords like LNT and environmentally responsible and cooperative. His<br/>
&gt; experience with geocachers was apparently very positive and it seems he<br/>&gt; expects the same from us.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So - I'm filling out permits and will email them back to him, then I'll head<br/>&gt; up there on Sunday afternoon to see about getting the boxes in good order,<br/>
&gt; if they aren't already.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/></span></div>&gt; On 3/11/09, Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter &lt;janet@...&gt;<span class="q"><br/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The other Lucy's box isn't listed anymore, so I guess she removed it,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; being responsible in their parks. What do you think?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; If we were to go at this systematically, I think it would probably be a<br/>&gt; &gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; idea to work on getting all the boxes in each park legal at one time so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; none are left hanging out at risk if the rangers want to get all<br/>&gt; &gt; regulatory<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the "non-compliant" planters.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thoughts?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it. Depending on how the conversation goes, I may even tell him<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already have a box there and I want to get legal. I think we can<br/>&gt; &gt; justify<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our late entry into the process by pointing out that they have<br/>&gt; &gt; focused<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entirely on geocaching, so that we letterboxers have been somewhat<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unaware.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The risk of dwelling too much on it with him is that he may get<br/>&gt; &gt; curious<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look for other boxes. I think I should probably contact the placers<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other boxes in TSP and let them know what I'm doing so they'll have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advance<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notice that their boxes may draw attention.<br/>

I think the lack of consistency on the part of the parks has made it more difficult to try to decide how to step, and for my part, I've just avoided planting any more boxes in state parks while I mused over it. </div>
<div></div>
<div>The real sticking point for me, and for many of us I think, has been the renewal thing. Easy enough to apply for a permit - another story when it comes to doing the renewal. If all parks are willing tohonor renewals by email, it puts a whole different face on the issue. Heck - Tyler is apparently even willing to do the permit application by email. He may not be so willing for new boxes, but he surely was glad to handle it by email for my existing box. What I recognized would be a problem was if I had to talk to HIM and only him because his staff wasn't up to speed. That would limit the times I could go and get permitted if I had to do it face-to-face. He saw the issue there as well and was willing to be flexible enough to make it work. I guess it's just going to be a matter of figuring out which parks are going to be jerky and avoiding them and conversely, making a point to be friendly with the parks that welcome us. </div>
<div></div>
<div>What I really never saw coming was that a geocacher would create such a problem and force the issue. Not that it couldn't have just as easily been a nutcase letterboxer - we had one a couple of years ago that was pulling boxes because she didn't like the locations and I could easily see her using the policy to justify her actions. <br/>
