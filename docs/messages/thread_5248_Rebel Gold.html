We have a mystery box that has been out for almost 2 1/2 years called Rebel Gold.  It has been listed on both LbNA and AQ as a "Mystery Box".  I'm thinking no one looks for mystery boxes anymore, since it has only two finds, both in its first month of existence. Therefore, I have moved it (not literally, but electronically) out of the mystery county and into Walker County in order to let more people at least know about it.  Although it's still sort of a mystery (really more of a puzzle), at least it will show up on searches for Walker County now, and since that's where TALE11 will be held, I wanted more people to be aware of it.
