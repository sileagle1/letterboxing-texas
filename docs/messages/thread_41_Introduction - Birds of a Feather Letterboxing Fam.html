<div>Birds of a Feather Family Introduction</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We live in the Houston area.  My wife, Jackie, and I moved to the Houston area from Iowa in 1985.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>Jackie was introduced to the idea in Sept 2003 by a friend who had the FamilyFun magazine article. She and our kids got excited and they decided they wanted to have their own stamps.  She also decided that she wanted to introduce it to my daughter's Cadette Girl Scout Troop.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So she began planning for a Halloween trip for the Girl Scouts to the Hodge's Bend Cemetery for the letterbox placed there and a latter trip to Silver Eagle's Sugar Land letterbox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The next day I stopped to visit with a friend at work.  I happened to mention that my wife was excited about this Questing or Letterboxing thing.  Turns out that my friend is Silver Eagle.  He was excited to find out that others were getting involved. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A small gathering was quickly planned for the first weekend of October between Silver Eagle and the Girl Scout Troop plus my son.  He met with them and helped to introduce them to letterboxing and then they went to find the Sugar Land Letterbox their first letterbox.</div></div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were trying to come up with a Family Letterboxing name when my son mentioned that all our personal stamps had a bird.  So we became the Birds of a Feather family.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We placed our first two letterboxes in the Rio Grande Valley at the beginning of Jan 2004 on our annual visit to the Valley.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our family letterboxing website is at <a href="http://www.geocities.com/birdsofafeather_lbox/"><b>http://www.geocities.com/birdsofafeather_lbox</b></a>.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I and the kids are planning to attend the Texas Letterboxing Event in March. We are looking forward to meeting other letterboxers.</div>
