Dear Silver Eagle, Babybear, and the rest of the "old" gang.  How <br>
about planning another outing like last year's.  Bastrop State Park <br>
was great, and the two "Kissin' Fishies" have been away from <br>
letterboxing for too long.  We're planning on resuming the hobby <br>
ASAP.  Spent most of the day today printing out the million and a <br>
half new clues.  Hawk's cypher clues are the craziest we've yet <br>
seen.  The computer crashed a half dozen times with the spell check <br>
on.  My wife thinks he's a "wild-man".<br>

    Well Fishes yall have a lot to catch up on, Welcome back.  First <br>
off the yearly gathering is already planned and will be held at the <br>
Brazos State Park.  Details on the gathering can be found in the <br>
links section I believe and it is going to be awsome.  Bring plenty <br>
of ink cause exchanges are going to take awhile.  I'll be going in <br>
from New Orleans and will be bringing a fellow boxer from Georgia,  <br>
a few other LA boxers are undesided.<br>
<br>
    Second tell the wife that Hawk is more like a "wild woman";o). <br>
