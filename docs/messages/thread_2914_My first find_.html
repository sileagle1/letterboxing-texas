<div>
<div>You did just the right thing by reporting the wet logbooks to the owners of the boxes, as well as doing your best on the trail to clean out the box/replace the baggies. Sometimes if the owners don't live near their boxes, they might ask if you'd mind doing a little maintenance for them, and that's entirely up to you. I try to carry a generic logbook with me (just white artist paper with punched holes and brads) which I can add to the box if their logbooks are damp, full or missing until the owner can get back to the box and do their own maintenance. A few months ago, Viewfinder and I were passing through the Johnson City/Fredricksburg area at the end of the day and found one of Baby Bears' boxes. It had not been sealed properly by the previous finders and the logbook was pretty wet. Since the sun was going down and our motel was only a short distance away, we took the box with us back to the motel and dried it with the blow dryer, cleaned out the box and had it safely back in it's hiding spot before nine the next morning. The only time I feel comfortable doing that (removing it) is when I'm pretty sure I can have it back in it's location before the next finder may come along.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's considered very nice letterboxing etiquette to let the owners of a box know you've located their box and to give them a short report as to the condition. However, although it's nice when the owner responds to your email, it's not necessary. You never know what's going on in their lives - they may be on vacation or just too busy at that particular time to respond. So all you can do is exactly what you did! Good job.</div>

<br/>
You didn't mention the type of container, but positioning it upside <br/>
down is almost always a mistake.  Right side up, the cover normally <br/>
acts as a roof, and rain falls off the edge and doesn't get in even <br/>
if the seal is defective.  But upside down the lid often behaves as a <br/>
cup, holding water against the seal until it leaks in even if the <br/>
seal is better than most.  Expecting water to come back out of the <br/>
box appears to be a lost cause, based on experience.<br/>

&gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has three boxes (Frye Team's "The Jig", Silver <br/>
&gt; Eagle's "Livingston <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Largemouth", and Baby Bear's "Udder Madness") was closed off <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; some <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of construction.  Then I tried to get to Will's <br/>
&gt; World's "Drip, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Drip, Drop" and the parking lot he took me to was absolutely <br/>
full <br/>
&gt; &gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cars.  I am not yet comfortable with being discreet around that <br/>
&gt; &gt; many <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people so I didn't even try to look for it.  But other then <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; had <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a blast.  This could really become an obsession with me.  Look <br/>
&gt; out <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, I'm gunning for you!  ;-)  Now I <br/>
need <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; figure out a box that I can plant somewhere and then watch out!<br/>

<div>Baby Bear saved one of my HH's when he found it soaked  in a letterbox 
where apparently Katrina had caused some flooding.  He rescued the HH stamp 
and the original logbook, replaced the logbook for me, and sent it on its way to 
a new location -- and returned the original logbook to me, which I greatly 
appreciated!  We LBers do have to watch out for each other, and what goes 
around, comes around.  Thanks, BB (my hero!).</div>
