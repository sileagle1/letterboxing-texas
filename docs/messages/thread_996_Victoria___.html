enough to get through high school and get the heck out of there.<br>
Seriously, it's a nice town, just not much to do.  My step-mother lives<br>
there and we visit her on holidays.  My most recent trip was over Easter<br>
where the most exciting part of my trip was letterboxing.  Found Lost<br>
Moi and Duck pond, even managed to drop off a hitchhiker I'd brought<br>
with me from a recent trip to Colorado. NEVER even came close to finding<br>
Box Kite, and after traipsing through the park carrying my 1yo and<br>
having my 5yo drill me with about 100 questions in 100 degree heat...I<br>
was really upset....but, the park was really neat it wasn't there when I<br>
was in HS wish it was though, seems like a great place to hang out.<br>

Monkeytoes,<br>
I am so glad to see that Maggies Meat Market is still in business.  I<br>
had been wondering about it.  They have absolutely THE BEST banana<br>
pudding I have ever eaten!<br>
<br>
Have you tried the tamales from Ventura's on Rio Grande, just west of<br>
DeTar?  How about Halepaska's for pastries?<br>
<br>
I haven't tried the other places you mentioned.  I was in Victoria<br>
Thursday and ate at Hunan's for lunch...my favorite chinese place in<br>
town.<br>
<br>
Thanks for a very good page about Victoria.  I think it is a beautiful<br>
city.  I nearly always come in on Vine St. just to look at the old<br>
homes.<br>

How do you know so much about Victoria?  Maggie's actually had a <br>
fire a few months ago.  They were closed for repairs until just <br>
recently.  They did a little remodelling while they were at it and <br>
now everything is back to normal.<br>
<br>
Excellent suggestion on Hallepaska's.  I'll have to add it on there <br>
as a breakfast option.  I have tried Ventura's, but La Hacienda puts <br>
them to shame.<br>
<br>
For Oriental cuisine, we go to Dragon Palace in the HEB shopping <br>
center on Navarro.  I'll have to add that too for more variety.<br>
<br>
If you like the old homes, you should take the historical driving <br>
tour.  I'm not sure where the actuall starting point is, but you <br>
can't miss the signs driving through Old Victoria.  I'll find out <br>
where to stop and list that, too.<br>
