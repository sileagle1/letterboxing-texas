                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry for the late reply.  Yes, we live in Washington State near Redmond.  Our parents and siblings live in Texas so we come to visit at least once and year.  We are planning a trip to Texas during the first week in April.  In addition to boxing in Dallas, we are planning an overnight road trip down to Waco and Mexia.  Since we watch for new Texas boxes just as closely as we watch for new Washington boxes, I thought it would be nice to join in with y'all.:)  Just so you don't think of us as being too Yankee-fied and out of place, Mr Wheeler was born in and we were both raised in Dallas.<br>
