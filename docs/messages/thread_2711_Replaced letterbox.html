reported missing and we went by and confirmed it on our way back from <br>
Austin, so today I replaced it with a new box, The Dodson Flag 2, at a <br>
different location in the park.  I think the old location was too <br>
close to the path and Independence Hall.  On the way, I planted a new <br>
box in Montgomery County called Father of our Flag. (It has a little <br>
gift in it for the first finder).<br>
