<div>A rowdy bunch of rascals were picked up today by the local authorities. They were charged with aggravated riding of a pump jack located at a historical marker. Their bus was towed to Rusk and the riders of that bus were hauled to the Cherokee County jail to await sentence. An anonymous spokesman from law enforcement said that the sentence for these rascals would probably be some sort of community service. He went on to state that they had been looking for some rascals to clean up in Pioneer Park in Nacogdoches this coming Saturday. He also said that he thought this group might be just what they were looking for. So stay tuned for more information about this group who call themselves the TTB 2 (whatever that means)</div><br/><br/></div></div></td></tr></table><br/>
