                    <html><body><p>My step daughter asked me to take her on a college visitation: Discover ASU. Yes, San Angelo. I had to work in Livingston on Friday. So after some time spent on our letterboxing web sites, I had a plan. </p>
<p>Got two boxes between Livingston and Huntsville. Then drove on to Thrall to pick up my favorite high school senior. We left and stopped in Llano and got 3 boxes there. Bluebonnetts and prickly pear cactus growing next to each other! What more can this desert rat ask for? Then on to San Angelo. Stopped in Brady but couldn't find the box there. Bummer. </p>
<p>Saturday morning we "discovered" ASU. Then while she did things with her friends, I took myself around San Angelo and found 3 more boxes....including Peachy Keen's that was recently a topic of dicussion. Thanks for the first finders "certificate"! </p>
<p>Today after church we are headed back back to our parts of the state with a stop in Eden. I have never turned over to rock to find a letterbox and found that said letterbox in buried in an ant bed! But with a long stick I knocked it out of place and got all the ants off and logged in!</p>
<p>Can't wait to take her back for registration this summer. Have already mapped out a plant!</p>
