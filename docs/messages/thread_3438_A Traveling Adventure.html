                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Friday, March 14th, I flew from California to Nashville, Tennessee <br>
to attend a conference for 5 days.  I had researched clues for a <br>
number of letterboxes in the Nashville area and found that there was <br>
one planted in the Gaylord Opryland Hotel where the conference was <br>
being held and where I was also staying.  I had made arrangements <br>
with the planter of the box to meet for an exchange.  She actually <br>
works at the hotel but is only there Monday through Friday so I had <br>
to wait until Monday to meet her.  In the meantime I tried to find <br>
the letterbox and I knew I was in the right area of the garden but <br>
there was no box so on Monday I hunted her down in the area she was <br>
working and she told me that one of her co-workers had removed it <br>
from it's hiding place temporarily.  She told her co-worker to put it <br>
back because she had some people that were going to be looking for <br>
it. It was put back that morning so off I went to try again and sure <br>
enough, it was there.  Also, I had checked AQ the day before for any <br>
updates since I had a problem locating the letterbox over the weekend <br>
and I found out that the planter had added a second letterbox in the <br>
garden and that the clues to find it were written in the back of the <br>
logbook of the 1st letterbox.  After I found the 1st box I began to <br>
wander around to find a secluded area in the garden to stamp in when <br>
a woman came up behind me and asked what I was doing.  She caught me <br>
off guard and all I could say was ah, ah, ah. She then told me she <br>
had just stamped in and she was searching for the 2nd box.  What a <br>
surprise to find another letterboxer in the hotel garden looking for <br>
letterboxes too.  Not only is she a letterboxer but she was also <br>
attending the same conference that I was attending.  We did an <br>
exchange. I stamped in the 1st letterbox and put it back in it's <br>
hiding place, and my new friend and I went off in search of the 2nd <br>
box.  We were successful. YEAH!<br>
<br>
The next day I had some time to go off site in search of more <br>
Nashville letterboxes.  I went to a park that was supposed to have 2 <br>
boxes hidden.  I found the 1st box quite easily.  The hardest part <br>
was finding the park.  After stamping in I continued down the <br>
concrete path towards the 2nd box which was hidden off of the <br>
concrete path and down a muddy dirt path.  When I reached the <br>
location of the letterbox I found the dryest area I could and laid <br>
everything out thinking that this off the main trail mud road would <br>
be safe.  WRONG!!  I was right in the middle of stamping in when <br>
along comes a Mother and her 4 sons down the mud trail.  The Mother <br>
walks straight up to me and says "hello".  I said hello back and she <br>
then tells me that she just put a Hitchhiker in the box.  What a <br>
small world.  I've heard other letterboxers tell stories of running <br>
into other boxers out on the trail but I really never expected it to <br>
happen to me.  I now have 3 new letterboxing friends. Actually, it's <br>
4 as I also met the husband of "twokitties". <br>
<br>
Here's a shout out to "twokitties", "DS", and "The Fielder Family".  <br>
It was great to meet all of you and I hope we meet up again on the <br>
letterboxing trails and thank you for making my trip to Nashville so <br>
memorable.  <br>
