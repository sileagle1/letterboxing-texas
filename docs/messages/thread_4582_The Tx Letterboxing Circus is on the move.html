<br/>
The circus folks talked me into going into San Antonio today to letterbox with them... I wasn't to sure this was such a good idea because its hard to be conspecuious with a large zany crowd that is sure to be seen. We stoped at Comanche Lookout Park and they decided to stay for a while in San Antonio when word got out to them that the Barnum and Baily circus had just finished up a show in town and they might be able to recruet a few new acts from their cast. They started arguing about where they would find the other circus folks and I got tired of listening to them so I left them there at the lookout park right at the trailhead sign. They sure do argue a lot! but I had more boxing to do and it was already getting hot outside.<br/>
