waiting for Mimz to call me and let me know how things are<br/>
going down in Bastrop. I had a little surgical thing done<br/>
to my face yesterday so didn't think I had better go out into<br/>
the woods this early and get dust in it. But darn it will <br/>
be healed enough by next week end, or it had better be.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Thanks, she's entertaining me. The medicine makes her a little loopy. We just looked at Mike's puppy pics. I'm slowly making dinner. We are trying a low cal chicken recipe.<br/><br/>Chicken breasts, 4<br/>1 12oz can diet orange soda<br/>1/4 c soy sauce<br/>Put in pan, cook for 1 hour till tender<br/>Enjoy!<br/><br/>With it we are having fried rice. I found a recipe that's just rice, egg, oil, gr onions and soy sauce. I don't need all the chopped veggies, since we are having steamed veggies to go with it.<br/><br/>All this fun, I don't know how I'm going to keep the excitement from bubbling out, hee hee.<br/><br/>I hope your face feels better (now that just sounds weird), I don't blame you for not wanting to go out. As many staff infection patients as we get, it makes me real nervous about open wounds and dirt. There will be other events, but there is only one You!<br/><br/>Janet, BF (off to chop and dice)<br/><br/><b><i>jackie_martell &lt;jackie_martell@msn.com&gt;</i></b>
