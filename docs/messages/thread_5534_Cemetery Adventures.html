                    <html><body><p><span></span></p>While hiding some of my new boxes last month in some old cemeteries, which are usually deserted, I actually met the caretakers for each of them.   One had two gentlemen walking around during the time I was hiding my box.  They did not see the hide, but on my way back they asked if they could help me find someone's stone.   I told them I loved old cemeteries and was just exploring.  They then told me where the oldest grave was and that they keep the place up.   The second was at Dixon Prairie Cemetery.  I pulled up and two men were talking.  One drove away but the other waited for me to get out.   He told me the history of the cemetery, and that his grandfather was one of the first to be buried there.   He was out trying to plant new trees in the graveyard.    Really fun to get to talk to both these people and get some personal history. </body></html>
