<div> </div>
<div>Lightning and Fearless Fox had to get up really early to go rub chickens, so I started my day on a slow note - nice for a change!  Fearless Fox had taken the whole stinking coffee pot with him, so I was forced to go out to breakfast JUST so I could get a cup of coffee.  I ventured out with a book I just got from Calico Rose - Why Stop? - and found a restaurant and settled in for a little reading, a deep cup of coffee, and a plate of cholesterol. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox returned home around 1:00 sans Lightning (stayed with a friend) and with barbecued chicken for lunch.  We snarfed it down and headed off to a Dad and Lad staff meeting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The day was so glorious we rode with the windows down and sang camp songs all the way to Henderson.  Getting in the mood you know!  Got to our meeting and I took my LB backpack in and plopped down at the training table and got back to carving.  I had come prepared with all my gear because I knew I would have to explain letterboxing to the other staff members since it is the piece that ties the even together - we are doing the requisite shooting sports (bb guns, archery, and sling shots) and then we are doing letterboxing, Leave No Trace, logbook making, and Map and Compass.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Everyone was pretty enthusiastic, but sadly enough I didn't think in advance to suggest everyone come up with trail names.  I probably should've suggested it, because now I'm going to be making up names for everyone, at least in my head.  One of the women there already has a nickname in my cell phone - Dingy Woman from Alto - so named after a particularly long and tediously inane phone conversation with her.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My friend, She Who Reads (y'all remember her - otherwise known by variations that amount to "my-friend-who-drags-me-into-everything") was leading the meeting and I made the mistake of sitting beside her.  She kept using me for an example - grabbing my arm, patting my back, otherwise startling me.  She clearly didn't realize how omenously close she came to causing damage to either my thumbs or hers, what with me sitting there with sharp knives and all.  Thankfully no blood was shed.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>After the meeting, which left us all pumped up and excited to be staffing Dad and Lad (really - we love staffing camps!), we (I) decided there was nothing to do but box our way home.  Conveniently, I had even downloaded some clues!  Fearless Fox was not a bit surprised by this, which disappointed me because I so wanted that to be a surprise for him (mmmhmmm).  We went first to Lake Forest Park in Henderson to check my Catchin Any? box, which someone had reported something about the ink pad.  First of all, I surely don't remember leaving an ink pad in that box, so if someone else remembers differently, I would appreciate knowing that.  Secondly, it didn't matter how it got there (whether me, or the stamp pad fairy, or some wandering varmint), I didn't want it to stay in there.  Memories of messy stamp pads stick in my head.  Sure enough, there WAS an ink pad, but there is no more.  It's always fun to visit an old box and see how it has been in place long enough to have settled itself into position, just as if it belonged there.   I was right there in the same park as two other boxes - Blue Butterfly's Merry-Go-Round and Atoy Adventurer's Butterflies in the Park.  I had previously found Butterflies in the Park, so I went first for MerryGoRound.  As always a nice box with a great hiding place by Blue Butterfly!  I was a little disappointed that Lightning wasn't with me because he almost always is when I find a BB box, but it sure was nice that Fearless Fox was into just hanging out with me today and lollygagging through a few boxes.  We sat on the log and talked and took our time stamping in, and finally moved along.  We moved along to go re-find AA's box, but alas, it wasn't in the place where we had previously found it, so I'm thinking it might not be there.  That's a bummer!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We ambled on down the road to a little picnic area, where we found Joe Roughneck by Blue Butterfly.  We wound up roaming around behind the picnic area for awhile and discovered some leftover pieces of something very large.  Ya never know what you'll find if you just peek behind...this little park is a case in point, as is New Birmingham in Rusk.  Always, always look beyond the mowed area of rest stops and also behind historical markers.  You just never know...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was approaching time for us to pick Lightning up and we were still well out of Jacksonville, so we drove further out yet and went and found JBK's Explosion at New London.  I knew this particular box was going to be especially poignant since Antony's grandmother was NOT one of the kids killed there, but only because she was home sick from school that day.  The cemetery is huge for a town its size and the gravestones told their own stories.  The added benefit was that there were some cool features I had learned about in other cemeteries and I got to tell FF all about them.  He was impressed with my newfound cemetery knowledge, although he wasn't exactly sure what I should do with that knowledge.  I even demonstrated my ability to distract and delude, as someone else showed up at the cemetery about the time we did and seemed bent on going to the same part of the cemetery as us.  He kept thinking they were letterboxers, but they weren't carrying anything and they were very - clean.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now this is interesting - when we approached the box, it was laying right out in the open, as though someone had cleaned the area, but didn't want to discard the box.  And this gets interestinger - there was another box laying on the ground in plain view about 8-10 feet from JBK's box.  It was clearly a letterbox not a geocache, and the only discernible stamp was TaterTexas', with a note from him as well.  There was nothing identifying it, no clue for it on either website, and it was in poor shape.  I debated what to do and finally brought it home with me because I couldn't leave it sitting out and I couldn't rehide it because I didn't know where.  I thought about hiding it somewhere of my own choosing, but not knowing who the planter was, I have no way of telling them where it is.  I got home and emailed TT to see if he might recall a little something about it.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm thinking we might have driven by JBK's feuding neighbors today - although I didn't think they were in the New London area in her telling.  As we topped a hill, there were two couples - one on each side of the road and each couple walking toward homes on their side of the road.  They kept glancing over their shoulders scowling at each other.  On our way back from the box, there were two sheriff's cars, one at each house.  I was really bummed I didn't have a sign on a trailer as JBK suggested she might begin to take along as part of her letterboxing equipment!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well - I'm on to carving some more.  It sounds as if our attendance is going to be even higher than expected, so I'm turning up the heat!  <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
