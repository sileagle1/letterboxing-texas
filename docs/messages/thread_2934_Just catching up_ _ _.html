</p><div>I've been away from the computer for two weeks. Longest two weeks of my life. I had a CT Scan about 3 weeks ago and called my Dr. on July 3 to get the results. As I was getting the results from my family doc, I told him I was feeling sick to my stomach and that I had called in sick to work (he is our company doc also). So, he contacted my surgeon and the surgeon issued the command of "Go to the hospital, I'm admitting you". So, on our great countries birthday, I was being operated on. It took about 6 hours. When I came to, I looked at the clock and told the guy his clock was wrong that it wasn't 4:30, because I went into surgery around 10 am or so. He informed it was right and that I was in ICU recovering. That was just wrong. I freaked out and asked him what was wrong with me. He then told me that on holidays there is no recovery. I think he used me for entertainment for the next 30 minutes. Bad nurse.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am still recovering, but we all know that I don't really 'work' at work anyway, so I came back tonight.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My orders from both doctors is to walk, walk, and then walk some more. When I get the staples out of my stomach, I will get to add swimming to that. I'm ready, bring it on. I've been laying by the pool and putting my feet in, it's just not the same.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When the pain goes away, I'll be able to bend and walk on uneven ground. I hope I'll get to finally get back out there and find a box or two. It's been a long time since I've had the adventure.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I enjoyed reading the almost 300 posts that y'all have written in the last two weeks. It took me 3 hours. Thanks for helping my comeback to work go easy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Welcome to all the new people. It sounds like your having fun. I'll live vicariously through y'all till I can get out there.</div>
