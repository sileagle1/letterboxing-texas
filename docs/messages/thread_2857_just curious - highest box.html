<br>
Oh, there's no maybe about it.  I can absolutely guarantee mine is <br>
the highest box in the Lower 49, unless someone has one aboard an <br>
airliner!<br>
<br>
I wanted to put the "elevation change" for the hike in the <br>
appropriate field on the AQ listing, but AQ only allows four digits.  <br>
I complained to GT about that, but couldn't convince him to enable a <br>
5th digit -- which of course would permit any elevation change <br>
possible on the planet.<br>
