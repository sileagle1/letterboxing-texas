    I suspect that not many people even know that Austin has a zoo. I
    haven't heard of it being mentioned for quite a few years now and I
    have not seen the sign for it in a while. They really fly below the
    radar in terms of getting their message out!  As far as I know,
    there are no listed letterboxes out there - yet.<br/>
<br/>
    Thanks for reminding us that Austin has a zoo.<br/>

                    <html><body><div>A few years ago now, there was a discussion on Newboxers, I think, about zoo boxes. I found it interesting because I had tried to plant two different boxes at two different times in the Tyler Zoo, only to find them gone in no time at all. The first one was my first plant, so looking back I wasn't terribly surprised since first boxes disappearing isn't too unusual, but the second box was after I had a few successful ones under my belt and still, it disappeared before I even had a chance to list it.<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>The concensus of the discussion was that zoos are so immaculately kept as a matter of safety for the animals, that it is very difficult to establish a box on the inside of a zoo (parking lots, no problem).</div>
<div><br/></div><div>The Ellen Trout Zoo in Lufkin does indeed have a box or two (or did a few years ago) that stayed for quite awhile. That zoo isn't nearly as pristine as many zoos, which I think adds immensely to its charm, and also allows a box to survive. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>So - if you decide to go for it, you might keep in mind that it probably needs to be small, well-camo'd, and well away from any of the animal enclosures. </div><div><br/></div><div>BarefootLucy</div>
