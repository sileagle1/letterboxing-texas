                    <div class="plaintext-content">Started out the day at 6 am from The Woodlands, and along with my <br>
navigator today, JR, we headed to Cypress.  Our first stop was AD <br>
Dyess Park where we picked up Snow Dog and The Quill Pen.  We then<br>
went to the Coles Crossing Community Center and saved a turtle.  To <br>
get to the trail, you walk past a pond which is next to a busy <br>
street.  There is a sidewalk between the pond and the street and <br>
there was a turtle between the sidewalk and the busy street.  JR and <br>
I started pushing the turtle back to the pond.  This was an <br>
interesting endeavor since I had JR's leash in one hand, the clue in <br>
the other and my lb kit over my shoulder.  We got the turtle to the <br>
edge of the pond and when it fell in he flipped over and landed on <br>
his back.  Now I am trying to keep JR out of the pond and trying to <br>
get the turtle turned over as it is drifting away from me.  I <br>
finally stepped in the pond with one foot and managed to turn the <br>
turtle over.  I am sure that it was a hilarious sight to watch.  We <br>
then looked for Gas Chamber and could not locate it.  We then<br>
made it to Telge Park and located Park Angel, Legend of Sleepy <br>
Hollow, Jordan's Birthday LB, and A True Goblin - Terrors of Telge.  <br>
After finding these four it started pouring rain, so we headed back <br>
to the car. Within about 10 minutes the rain subsided, so we went to <br>
a Harris County Pocket Park and picked up the Fire in the Hold box.  <br>
After another hard rain, we decided to head back to my parents for <br>
the day.<br>
