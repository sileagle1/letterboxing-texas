with anything for a long time, you're going to have natural peaks and<br>
valleys in your participation.  Depending on other things in your<br>
life, your time and interest in letterboxing will wax and wane.<br>
<br>
I have become somewhat disillusioned with a lot of urban letterboxing.<br>
 Too often, placements are rather haphazard, with no compelling reason<br>
for the box.  And personally, I can't believe how often the City of<br>
Houston seems to re-landscape some of these parks!  As most of my more<br>
urban boxes go missing, they probably won't be replaced unless there's<br>
a very compelling reason for them to be in a certain spot.<br>
<br>
The boxes that I enjoy best involve a nice walk.  Being outside and<br>
sharing our love of hiking with our kids is one reason why we got<br>
started letterboxing in the first place.<br>
<br>
We did some hiking over Thanksgiving break where I didn't even bring<br>
letterbox clues (shocking, I know), and we did a bit of letterboxing<br>
too, but the focus was on enjoying our break, our time together, and<br>
having a great time outdoors (as much as the weather allowed).  The<br>
way it works best for my family is to find balance and do a little<br>
something that each of us wants to do.  And that definitely means<br>
fewer boxes are on the to-do list than perhaps once would have been.  <br>
<br>
And that we spent an hour skipping stones & climbing boulders at a<br>
creek in Pflugerville rather than going on to find more boxes in the<br>
next town.<br>
<br>
But, when we do go letterboxing, we usually have a good time.  We had<br>
the best time as a family finding Mother of Five's latest...Which came<br>
first?  I definitely recommend that one as a boredom-buster!  <br>
