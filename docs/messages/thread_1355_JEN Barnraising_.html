<div>Ok, I am trying to get my plans together for the Barnraising!!  We are 
not going to be able to head out until Saturday am and will probably stay at 
Cleburne State Park because we need a screened shelter since our tent went caput 
the last time we were camping!!  So....  What is the plan?  I 
vote for a late afternoon/dinner gathering on Saturday to exchange food, clues, 
and recipes and then people could still look for boxes Sunday..  Or maybe 
an early supper so there is still light?  I don't know!!  What was 
your plan?  I don't want to over ride anything!  :)</div>

about this?  Who is planning on staying Saturday<br>
night?  If just about everyone IS planning on staying<br>
Saturday, I think a 4 p.m. supper would be great!<br>
<br>
I think that would free up anyone who doesn't want to<br>
rush down Friday night, and it would give everyone an<br>
opportunity to get their boxes planted in a leisurely<br>
manner, enjoying the scenery as they go.  <br>
<br>
I had orginally wanted to plan it so that it could be<br>
a one day thing if need be, but that may be a moot<br>
point if everyone is planning on being there for two<br>
days, or three, anyway.<br>

<div>We are coming from Houston, and due to health concerns, can't camp, so we will be staying at the Super8 in Waxahachie. We were planning on arriving Friday night, so we can get in a full day on Sat. We will have to leave by 2:00 pm, at the latest, on Sunday. If we have a 4 p.m. dinner on Saturday, I would change my reservation and come in on Saturday instead. Whatever the group decides is fine with me. </div>
