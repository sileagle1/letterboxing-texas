                    <div class="plaintext-content">My navigator, JR, and I started out about 8:30 am and drove to Red <br>
River County to plant TSS large mammal - Texas Longhorn in Borgata.  <br>
We were successful and this county now has its first box.   Next we<br>
decided to visit "the second largest Eiffel Tower in the second <br>
largest Paris."  This Eiffel Tower is equipped with its own bright <br>
red cowboy hat.  As I was looking for the Texas Passport Series #2 - <br>
Paris box, I found a yellowjacket (or rather he found me) and he <br>
decided that he did not like my hand where it was and decided to <br>
tell me about it.  Not to be out done, I did continue my search (I <br>
am not allergic to them, but it still hurt).  I finally found my <br>
treasure and returned to my car to stamp in.  As I was walking to <br>
the car, I realized that something was crawling on my hurting <br>
hand...fire ants.  They were all over the box.  I quickly<br>
threw the box on the ground trying to get the ants off.  It wasnt <br>
working.  So, I decided to go ahead and open the box...the ants were <br>
coming from inside the box which was full of them, a piece of paper <br>
with another boxer's signature, and nothing else...no logbook, no <br>
stamp...I was beyond myself...here I had gotten stung and eaten by <br>
fireants and yellow jackets and NO logbook...NO stamp...I returned <br>
to the location to see if maybe I could find the contents, but to no <br>
avail..they were gone.  Not sure what happened, just knew my hand <br>
hurt.  However, I continued on with my day.  My next stop was in <br>
Honey Grove which is located in Fannin County.  This county also did <br>
not previously have a letterbox...however now it does.  You can find <br>
TSS Food - Chili located in Honey Grove. Our next stop was Pecan <br>
Gap, in Delta County,  to place, what else....TSS Nut - Pecan.  <br>
Another virgin county gone off the map.   Well by my count, that <br>
leaves only one more county in the Northeast region without a <br>
box...yep you guessed, JR and I were on our way to Tira in Hopkins <br>
County.  As we left Tira, we spotted a sign for Cooper Lake State<br>
Park Doctors Creek Unit, and decided to head that way...what a <br>
beautiful ride right next to the lake.  We planted the TSS Small <br>
Mammal - Armadillo in this park.   So, now the North East Texas <br>
Region has no more virgin counties.  Next we had gotten wind that <br>
there was a box in Sulphur Springs, so we headed that way..only to <br>
realize that it was at a rest area at exit 143, which was actually <br>
Mt Vernon (we went within a mile of this exit on our way to Red <br>
River County).  So we went back to the rest area and found the <br>
Walkin' the Dawg box.  By this point, JR and I were really winding <br>
down, but we knew we were close to one more drive-by box which we <br>
had attempted a few months ago and couldnt find.  After re-checking <br>
on the clues, we realized that it had been found just a couple of <br>
days ago.  So off we went to Greenville to find the Forest Park <br>
box...which we did and finally got to stamp that box. From there, we <br>
decided to call it a day and head home.  <br>
<br>
By the way, if you are bored of my sitereps..you will be happy to <br>
know that I only have 2 more days available for letterboxing this <br>
summer until I have to return to work  :)<br>

Next we<br/>&gt; decided to visit "the second largest Eiffel Tower in the second <br/>&gt; largest Paris." This Eiffel Tower is equipped with its own bright <br/>&gt; red cowboy hat. As I was looking for the Texas Passport Series #2 -<br/><br/>&gt; Paris box, I found a yellowjacket (or rather he found me) and he <br/>&gt; decided that he did not like my hand where it was and decided to <br/>&gt;
 tell me about it. Not to be out done, I did continue my search (I <br/>&gt; am not allergic to them, but it still hurt). I finally found my <br/>&gt; treasure and returned to my car to stamp in. As I was walking to <br/>&gt; the car, I realized that something was crawling on my hurting <br/>&gt; hand...fire ants. They were all over the box. I quickly<br/>&gt; threw the box on the ground trying to get the ants off. It wasnt <br/>&gt; working. So, I decided to go ahead and open the box...the ants <br/>were <br/>&gt; coming from inside the box which was full of them, a piece of paper <br/>&gt; with another boxer's signature, and nothing else...no logbook, no <br/>&gt; stamp...I was beyond myself...here I had gotten stung and eaten by <br/>&gt; fireants and yellow jackets and NO logbook...NO stamp...I returned <br/>&gt; to the location to see if maybe I could find the contents, but to <br/>no <br/>&gt; avail..they were gone. Not sure what happened, just knew my hand <br/>&gt; hurt. However,
 I continued on with my day. My next stop was in <br/>&gt; Honey Grove which is located in Fannin County. This county also <br/>did <br/>&gt; not previously have a letterbox...<wbr>however now it does. You can <br/>find <br/>&gt; TSS Food - Chili located in Honey Grove. Our next stop was Pecan <br/>&gt; Gap, in Delta County, to place, what else....TSS Nut - Pecan. <br/>&gt; Another virgin county gone off the map. Well by my count, that <br/>&gt; leaves only one more county in the Northeast region without a <br/>&gt; box...yep you guessed, JR and I were on our way to Tira in Hopkins <br/>&gt; County. As we left Tira, we spotted a sign for Cooper Lake State<br/>&gt; Park Doctors Creek Unit, and decided to head that way...what a <br/>&gt; beautiful ride right next to the lake. We planted the TSS Small <br/>&gt; Mammal - Armadillo in this park. So, now the North East Texas <br/>&gt; Region has no more virgin counties. Next we had gotten wind that <br/>&gt; there was a box in Sulphur Springs,
 so we headed that way..only to <br/>&gt; realize that it was at a rest area at exit 143, which was actually <br/>&gt; Mt Vernon (we went within a mile of this exit on our way to Red <br/>&gt; River County). So we went back to the rest area and found the <br/>&gt; Walkin' the Dawg box. By this point, JR and I were really winding <br/>&gt; down, but we knew we were close to one more drive-by box which we <br/>&gt; had attempted a few months ago and couldnt find.
