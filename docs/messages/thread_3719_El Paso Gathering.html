                    <div class="plaintext-content">A Gathering in El Paso hosted by Mike is a great idea and I would <br>
love to come if I get the chance.  Not only are there several boxes <br>
to find, there would most likely be quite a few new boxes added, <br>
making El Paso an even more desired location for other letterboxers <br>
in the future.  Also, since El Paso is closer to many western states, <br>
you could probably draw a few boxers from there, too.  I know <br>
Lionsmane and Astro D of New Mexico have come at least as far as  <br>
Central TX, so West TX would be close for them.  Mike, you could join <br>
the Southwest LB Group: <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/LetterboxingSouthwest/ and even the <br>
Southern California LB Group:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing-socal/ to generate <br>
interest after picking the place and date.  <br>
<br>
As far as date goes, late fall sounds good.  In fact, since most <br>
schools are off the whole week of Thanksgiving, a good date for the <br>
Event might be the weekend before Thanksgiving.  This would give <br>
people the time to attend the Event and then do other things in the <br>
area before heading back home for Thanksgiving.  And there are many <br>
fun and interesting things to see and do out that way.  I highly <br>
recommend Guadalupe Mountains NP, Carlsbad Caverns NP, Davis <br>
Mountains SP (great stargazing at McDonald Observatory nearby)and Big <br>
Bend NP.  Also, depending on where you are coming from, you could <br>
visit many places on the way and back.  Basically, you could combine <br>
a Letterboxing Event with a mini-vacation.<br>
<br>
Mike, I bet if you set it up, people will come.  Go for it!<br>

  Tent areas are separated.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To anyone coming this way, I will 
  provide info on the best way to <br/>attack the<br/>&gt; boxes, hiking maps, the 
  best camping spot, restaurants, stores, <br/>loan you my<br/>&gt; water jugs and 
  generator, and act as a hike guide if you ask. If <br/>you find<br/>&gt; 
  yourself coming through El Paso, do plan on a full day or two. It <br/>will be 
  worth<br/>&gt; it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; When my son gets home on mid-tour there are 
  two things he will do. <br/>One is visit<br/>&gt; with Parker for a last time. 
  The other is to go to Fabens and have <br/>a 2-pound<br/>&gt; T-Bone. I will 
  think of most of you while I am digging into my <br/>steak!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  And we will do a few ARMY-MAN hikes too. After all - thats what he 
  <br/>is.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike - KD9KC.<br/>&gt; El Paso, Tx.<br/>&gt;
