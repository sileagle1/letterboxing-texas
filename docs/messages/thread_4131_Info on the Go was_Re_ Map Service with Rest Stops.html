<div>I do have to tell you, I take my lunch at noon and my dinner at 5. Other than that, I am pretty much just driving the nurses crazy. They are afraid, very afraid. I took my friend Ivy for a walk last night. Scared on the nurses. hehe. I dressed the I.V. tree in one of my dresses,wig and glasses. She was one tall lady.</div>
