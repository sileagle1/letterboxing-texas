                    <html><body><p>Good to see you, Mother's Love!<br/><br/>Could very well be. We have a Red Box kiosk in Walmart, but not a Blockbuster one anywhere in town that I know of. I can see Brookshire Bros might be able to handle one.<br/><br/>
We hardly ever rent movies - we usually buy. We have enough on our plates without having to remember when to take movies back and make a stop specifically at Blockbuster, so by the time we get it back to the store, it costs $7-10. We can bide our time and buy it for that, or less! <br/>
<br/>I can sure see that the Kiosk idea is a far more forward way of approaching movie rentals. At $1 a day, and in Walmart or the grocery store, the cost to rent would go wayyyy down and the convenience factor would go wayyyy up. <br/>
<br/>But - I doubt a kiosk is gonna have the movies my guys like - they are sci-fi afficionados. They went to Hastings in Tyler the other day to spend a gift card and couldn't find any sci-fi movies they didn't already have....I, on the other hand, am NOT a sci-fi fan and really don't often watch movies, so it's a lot easier for me to find something to watch.<br/>
