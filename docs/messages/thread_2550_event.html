<div>I think Barefoot Lucy was right - we'll need a list on the event page so we don't have 40 bluebonnet stamps - <em>especially</em> since you already have one in a nearby park! I would love to do a Rudbeckia (yellow coneflower, brown eyed Susan?).</div>

Even if we can't have 40 bluebonnets, can we please have 2 Black-<br/>

We are planning to come up for the event.  This will be our first <br/>
one (my kids love the little bit of letterboxing we have been able <br/>
to do).  Can you please give me an overview of what will be going on <br/>
during the whole day, i.e.  an idea of the overall time schedule, <br/>
what will be going on (I heard chili somewhere?).  Any tidbit will <br/>
be most welcomed!<br/>

&gt; You don't have to, but it would be appropriate given the theme of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; Event. I already have a Bluebonnet box in a nearby park, but <br/>
others <br/>
&gt; would be welcome. I'm planning on placing a box as part of my <br/>
Literary <br/>
&gt; Series with the word flowers in the title, but probably won't do <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; until Friday before the Event. We will have a place for everyone <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; put their handwritten clues for boxes placed during the Event <br/>
weekend <br/>
&gt; so others can copy them down. If ya'll want to avoid duplicating <br/>
&gt; wildflowers, I can start a list of who is placing what flower. Do <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; want to do that or just be surprised?<br/>

&gt; PS,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even if we can't have 40 bluebonnets, can we please have 2 Black-<br/>
&gt; Eyed Susans? I already have a stamp carved from the State Flowers <br/>
&gt; postal ring. (Someone else already had Texas, so I took my birth <br/>
&gt; state, Maryland, whose state flower is the Black-Eyed Susan). <br/>
&gt; Instead of mailing the actual stamp, we sent 4x6 cards with the <br/>
&gt; stamped image... so the box is here and ready to plant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
