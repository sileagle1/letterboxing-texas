Even if we can't have 40 bluebonnets, can we please have 2 Black-<br>

Instead of mailing the actual stamp, we sent 4x6 cards with the <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
We are planning to come up for the event.  This will be our first <br>
one (my kids love the little bit of letterboxing we have been able <br>
to do).  Can you please give me an overview of what will be going on <br>
during the whole day, i.e.  an idea of the overall time schedule, <br>
what will be going on (I heard chili somewhere?).  Any tidbit will <br>
be most welcomed!<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Khaly <br>

personal traveler.  Just an idea.  We're really looking to seeing <br>
everyone at the event.  It may be a little early for bluebonnets, <br>
but with all the rain, there should be lots of wildflowers of all <br>
kinds.<br>
