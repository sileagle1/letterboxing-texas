My husband and I were in Austin and Johnson City area last weekend for <br>
a meeting, but of course took advantage of the chance to enjoy the <br>
wildflowers, walk in the woods, and find LBs!  We discovered Oakwood <br>
Cemetery in Austin (what a great place just off I35 in the middle of <br>
the city, but so quiet, huge old trees and ancient tombstones, and a <br>
beatiful stamp! Clever hiding place, too, Gingercat)  Saturday we hiked <br>
around in Pedernales Falls SP and found these LBs:  Pedernales Possum <br>
(cool stamp, Silver Eagle!), Ziggy Gifts (tricky to follow the trail <br>
and clues, but we were rewarded by being First Finder!  My first time <br>
ever to be FF! Thanks, Baby Bear - I love the gold sticker!); and Shrek <br>
(easy find, especially after BB's tricky trail - thanks, MollyGrue).  <br>
Then we made a detour to LBJ SP at Stonewall for another of BB's LB's, <br>
Scooby-Doo, where we also saw about 18 deer in the park, before driving <br>
back through the hills and wildflowers (really beautiful near Marble <br>
Falls around Inks Lake, where we saw more deer) and on toward Ft. Worth <br>
and Keller.  So many other LBs to find along or near that route, but no <br>
more time this trip.  Next drive....  Viewfinder (Benny, tx2chic).  <br>
