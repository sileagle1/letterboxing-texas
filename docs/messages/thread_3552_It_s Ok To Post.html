message here; too bad it doesn't work with my kids :)<br>
<br>
I now realize that my last post may have implied that y'all should not <br>
post so much, but I want to assure you that is not the case and to <br>
encourage you to post as much as you want.  I was simply trying to give <br>
options for how to handle them.<br>
<br>
So, to get things started again, how about this:  Since one of the <br>
great things about letterboxing is that it takes you to places you <br>
never heard of or have never been, what is the best such place you have <br>
been taken to?<br>
