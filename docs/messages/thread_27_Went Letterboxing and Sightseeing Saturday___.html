We left early, about 8:30, and headed to Rockport, making a quick <br>
stop in Papalote so she could find my Lonesome Luke letterbox.... <br>
and so I could check on it again, since I don't have very good luck <br>
with keeping letterboxes at that site. It was alive and well.<br>
<br>
We drove to Goose Island, where we found Silver Eagle's 'Texas <br>
Bonefish'. There were some really interesting bushes scattered all <br>
along the trail that had gorgeous bright red berries. Really pretty. <br>
<br>
Then we went to the Big Tree so Susan could find the 'Big Tree' <br>
letterbox (Silver Eagle), and to the old Lamar Cemetery where Susan <br>
found my 'Rest in Peace #3'. Leaving the cemetery, we met a couple <br>
from WI who we talked to for a few minutes. Susan asked if they were <br>
winter Texans, and the woman asked how she knew. Susan said it was <br>
her accent. The woman thought she didn't have an accent - LOL! Susan <br>
and I assured her she did! ;) Then Susan and I pointed the finger at <br>
each other for being able to hear a strong 'Texas twang' in each <br>
other. :)<br>
<br>
In/Near Rockport, we searched for WOW MOM's two letterboxes, 'I Love <br>
You' and 'X Marks the Spot', but couldn't find either one. I knew <br>
there had been trouble with 'X', but didn't find out until later <br>
when I emailed WOWMOM that they were both gone. <br>
<br>
We did find Baby Bear's Gulf Wader though, in great shape, and <br>
enjoyed looking around the area, making a note to visit there again <br>
in the late spring or in summer when the flowers, plants, vines and <br>
trees as well as wildlife ought to be very bountiful. There were <br>
some of the less flashy wildflowers starting to bloom... some yellow <br>
daisies and baby blue eyes.<br>
