<br/>
<br/>Let me emphasize that the document is NOT a finished document.  I want to submit it for the review of any interested members.  I've posed some thoughts and questions off the top of my head, and I've also included what appears to be the latest official permit application.
<br/>
<br/>Once we finish hashing this out and knowing what we want, I'll make a last edit of the file and post it under a different file name.  I think it would be helpful for each of us to use as we approach state parks, and it would also be helpful to post back to the group when one of us has approached a specific park. 
<br/>
<br/>So - discuss amongst ourselves...or not.</p></body></html>

or could you let me know the e-mail address so i can ask about mine whne i'm ready to place them!?<br>

</p><div>You've been an example in this, Mike, and have said before that we need 
  to get on board if we hope to stay active in state parks.  I think the 
  lack of consistency on the part of the parks has made it more difficult to try 
  to decide how to step, and for my part, I've just avoided planting any more 
  boxes in state parks while I mused over it.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The real sticking point for me, and for many of us I think, has been the 
  renewal thing.  Easy enough to apply for a permit - another story when it 
  comes to doing the renewal.  If all parks are willing to honor 
  renewals by email, it puts a whole different face on the issue.  Heck - 
  Tyler is apparently even willing to do the permit application by email.  
  He may not be so willing for new boxes, but he surely was glad to handle it by 
  email for my existing box.  What I recognized would be a problem was if I 
  had to talk to HIM and only him because his staff wasn't up to speed.  
  That would limit the times I could go and get permitted if I had to do it 
  face-to-face.  He saw the issue there as well and was willing to be 
  flexible enough to make it work.  I guess it's just going to be a matter 
  of figuring out which parks are going to be jerky and avoiding them and 
  conversely, making a point to be friendly with the parks that welcome 
  us.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What I really never saw coming was that a geocacher would create such a 
  problem and force the issue.  Not that it couldn't have just as easily 
  been a nutcase letterboxer - we had one a couple of years ago that was pulling 
  boxes because she didn't like the locations and I could easily see her using 
  the policy to justify her actions.  <br/></div>-- <br/>Barefoot
