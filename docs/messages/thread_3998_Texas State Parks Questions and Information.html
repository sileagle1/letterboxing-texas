&gt; I went and checked to see who else had boxes in Tyler State Park and it<br/>
&gt; turns out NorthStars has two there, and that's it besides mine.  And they<br/>
&gt; haven't logged on in quite awhile.  I wrote to them anyway, and I'll follow<br/>
&gt; their wishes if they write back.  If they don't though, I'll pull their<br/>
&gt; boxes, file permits for them, and officially adopt them.  If they jump back<br/>
&gt; in at a later time, I'll deed them back their boxes AND the permits.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If it turns out the other Lucy hasn't gotten a chance to remove her box, you<br/>
&gt; might get her to write you a note giving you permission to claim it on her<br/>
&gt; behalf and take her note with you.  I think that would be a good way to<br/>
&gt; demonstrate our cooperative nature on each other's behalf for the sake of<br/>
&gt; being responsible in their parks.  What do you think?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we were to go at this systematically, I think it would probably be a good<br/>
&gt; idea to work on getting all the boxes in each park legal at one time so that<br/>
&gt; none are left hanging out at risk if the rangers want to get all regulatory<br/>
&gt; on the "non-compliant" planters.<br/>

&gt; Okay well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just talked to the park superintendent at Tyler State Park.  He was aware<br/>
&gt; of letterboxing and said "they" had had a discussion about it two or three<br/>
&gt; years ago, but because it was so unknown they opted not to treat it<br/>
&gt; separately, but to lump it together with geocaching.  I told him there were<br/>
&gt; a few fundamental differences, but that for their purposes, I could see that<br/>
&gt; rationale.  He didn't seem to care to get into the whole philosophical<br/>
&gt; thing, so I didn't push for it.  He did say that in his years at the park,<br/>
&gt; only two people had ever inquired about letterboxing - me and a reporter.<br/>
&gt; And he referred the reporter to the geocaching website.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The conversation was going very well, so I went ahead and told him I already<br/>
&gt; had a box there, and it had been there for nearly five years, since before<br/>
&gt; the policy was even a thought.  I told him that as we have developed a<br/>
&gt; clearer awareness of the policy, I decided I wanted to get my box "legal",<br/>
&gt; to which he laughed and said they appreciate that.  Because of the direction<br/>
&gt; the conversation was going (as in, he was going to look up the website as<br/>
&gt; soon as we hung up), I told him there were two other boxes there and that I<br/>
&gt; had been in touch with the placer to offer my assistance in getting their<br/>
&gt; boxes registered as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He emailed me the form and told me we could handle all of it by email.  He<br/>
&gt; said his staff was not very well-versed on either geocaching or<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, so they wouldn't really have any idea what I was asking about<br/>
&gt; if I were to try to talk to them and he wasn't there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He seemed to me to be understanding of our use of the park.  I dropped a few<br/>
&gt; keywords like LNT and environmentally responsible and cooperative.  His<br/>
&gt; experience with geocachers was apparently very positive and it seems he<br/>
&gt; expects the same from us.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - I'm filling out permits and will email them back to him, then I'll head<br/>
&gt; up there on Sunday afternoon to see about getting the boxes in good order,<br/>
&gt; if they aren't already.<br/>

&gt; &gt; one new box to see what kind of feeling I get from the ranger's reaction to<br/>
&gt; &gt; my request. I don't think I want to hit him with that many requests at once.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I went and checked to see who else had boxes in Tyler State Park and it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; turns out NorthStars has two there, and that's it besides mine. And they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; haven't logged on in quite awhile. I wrote to them anyway, and I'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; follow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their wishes if they write back. If they don't though, I'll pull their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes, file permits for them, and officially adopt them. If they jump<br/>
&gt; &gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in at a later time, I'll deed them back their boxes AND the permits.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If it turns out the other Lucy hasn't gotten a chance to remove her box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; might get her to write you a note giving you permission to claim it on<br/>
&gt; &gt; her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; behalf and take her note with you. I think that would be a good way to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; demonstrate our cooperative nature on each other's behalf for the sake of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; being responsible in their parks. What do you think?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If we were to go at this systematically, I think it would probably be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; idea to work on getting all the boxes in each park legal at one time so<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; none are left hanging out at risk if the rangers want to get all<br/>
&gt; &gt; regulatory<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the "non-compliant" planters.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The state park nearest me is Lake Livingston State Park. Oddly enough,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've never placed a box there. I think it's a good place to start<br/>
&gt; &gt; because, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few weeks ago, the park ranger contacted Lucy Locket to tell her that<br/>
&gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were doing some clearing and that her box might be in danger, so she<br/>
&gt; &gt; went<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and removed it (I think).<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That's cool. One of our nearby scout troops has a cool process they<br/>
&gt; &gt; use<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluate outings and activities - after they've done something, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kudos and Crud time at their next regular meeting and each boy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; leader<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has a chance to say what he saw good and bad. I hope that anyone that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chooses to use this document will contribute their comments, good and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bad,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so we can make it really good. It would be nice to eventually get an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaluation of some sort done on any park where there are letterboxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope to get up to Tyler State Park on Sunday to get my box up there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permitted. I've got a call in to the park super to get a copy of<br/>
&gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permit sent to me in advance. I'm hoping he will talk to me on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; phone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about it. Depending on how the conversation goes, I may even tell him<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already have a box there and I want to get legal. I think we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; justify<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our late entry into the process by pointing out that they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; focused<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entirely on geocaching, so that we letterboxers have been somewhat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; unaware.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The risk of dwelling too much on it with him is that he may get<br/>
&gt; &gt; curious<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look for other boxes. I think I should probably contact the placers<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other boxes in TSP and let them know what I'm doing so they'll have<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notice that their boxes may draw attention.<br/>

<p>
</p><div>You've been an example in this, Mike, and have said before that we need 
  to get on board if we hope to stay active in state parks.  I think the 
  lack of consistency on the part of the parks has made it more difficult to try 
  to decide how to step, and for my part, I've just avoided planting any more 
  boxes in state parks while I mused over it.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The real sticking point for me, and for many of us I think, has been the 
  renewal thing.  Easy enough to apply for a permit - another story when it 
  comes to doing the renewal.  If all parks are willing to honor 
  renewals by email, it puts a whole different face on the issue.  Heck - 
  Tyler is apparently even willing to do the permit application by email.  
  He may not be so willing for new boxes, but he surely was glad to handle it by 
  email for my existing box.  What I recognized would be a problem was if I 
  had to talk to HIM and only him because his staff wasn't up to speed.  
  That would limit the times I could go and get permitted if I had to do it 
  face-to-face.  He saw the issue there as well and was willing to be 
  flexible enough to make it work.  I guess it's just going to be a matter 
  of figuring out which parks are going to be jerky and avoiding them and 
  conversely, making a point to be friendly with the parks that welcome 
  us.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What I really never saw coming was that a geocacher would create such a 
  problem and force the issue.  Not that it couldn't have just as easily 
  been a nutcase letterboxer - we had one a couple of years ago that was pulling 
  boxes because she didn't like the locations and I could easily see her using 
  the policy to justify her actions.  <br/></div>-- <br/>Barefoot

&gt; For my way of thinking, it is better to just talk it over and work within the<br/>

&gt; You've been an example in this, Mike, and have said before that we need to get<br/>
&gt; on board if we hope to stay active in state parks.  I think the lack of<br/>
&gt; consistency on the part of the parks has made it more difficult to try to decide<br/>
&gt; how to step, and for my part, I've just avoided planting any more boxes in state<br/>
&gt; parks while I mused over it.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The real sticking point for me, and for many of us I think, has been the renewal<br/>
&gt; thing.  Easy enough to apply for a permit - another story when it comes to doing<br/>
&gt; the renewal.  If all parks are willing to honor renewals by email, it puts a<br/>
&gt; whole different face on the issue.  Heck - Tyler is apparently even willing to<br/>
&gt; do the permit application by email.  He may not be so willing for new boxes, but<br/>
&gt; he surely was glad to handle it by email for my existing box.  What I recognized<br/>
&gt; would be a problem was if I had to talk to HIM and only him because his staff<br/>
&gt; wasn't up to speed.  That would limit the times I could go and get permitted if<br/>
&gt; I had to do it face-to-face.  He saw the issue there as well and was willing to<br/>
&gt; be flexible enough to make it work.  I guess it's just going to be a matter of<br/>
&gt; figuring out which parks are going to be jerky and avoiding them and conversely,<br/>
&gt; making a point to be friendly with the parks that welcome us.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; What I really never saw coming was that a geocacher would create such a problem<br/>
&gt; and force the issue.  Not that it couldn't have just as easily been a nutcase<br/>
&gt; letterboxer - we had one a couple of years ago that was pulling boxes because<br/>
&gt; she didn't like the locations and I could easily see her using the policy to<br/>
&gt; justify her actions.  <br/>
