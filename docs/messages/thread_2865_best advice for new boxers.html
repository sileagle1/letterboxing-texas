<div>I have been thinking a 
lot about this question, trying to decide what my best advice would 
be.  Since we only get one *cough*dewberry*cough* I think I would 
say......(drumroll, please).....</div>
<div>Participate on the 
list.  Ask questions.  Take the opportunities offered through the list 
and gatherings to get to know other letterboxers.  I have made some 
wonderful friendships that started out with the commonality of letterboxing, and 
have now grown and become really rewarding friendships to me.  It is funny 
how you discover how many other things you might have in common with other 
letterboxers, and how much they have to share.  Now, back to my never 
ending pile of laundry.  MO5</div></body></html>
