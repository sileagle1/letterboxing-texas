I think there's a lot of truth in that (any box that requires a hike,<br>
a long drive or some mental agility gets a LOT fewer finders), but I<br>
would urge people to continue to plant in out-of-the-way neat Texas<br>
spots.  I can't get to all of them, but I really appreciate it when<br>
I'm led to an interesting grave, a spot of historical import, or just<br>
some weird, quirky little slice of ground that I wouldn't have visited<br>
without a letterbox there.  These are some of my favorite finds.<br>
<br>
Just because a box gets fewer finders does not mean that it's not<br>
extra beloved by those who do get the chance to find it.<br>

<div><font size="2">I agree 100% with Dewberry. I recently hid a series of five boxes in an area that is not necessarily populated with letterboxers (just off 380 in Sister Grove Park between Greenville and McKinney at Lake Lavon), and to my knowledge they have not yet been visited. In fact, I knew when I placed them, that they wouldn't be flooded with visitors, but that's okay. My philosophy is, I've found a neat trail which will provide a letterboxer (or letterboxing family) with a nice safe hike on a pretty trail. They can take a picnic and spend a couple of hours finding five boxes and exploring a new area. To me, it really doesn't matter if my boxes are found by two people or fifty two people as long as I offer a nice experience. (Actually, my most visited boxes are in the Botanical Gardens in FW, They've probably had over 80 visitors, and I've already replaced their logbooks twice. I'm surprised that those boxes are still there! I think when you plant a box in an area that potentially has many visitors, you have to be prepared for a lot of maintenance on those boxes.</font></div>

I always thought of letterboxers as being more "active" (hikers, rock-climbers, campers, etc.) and less "take a short-cut" types. I love the drives, the hikes, etc. One of my boxes, ESOT: Brown Pelican, has only two logged finds in 10 months. I just had to hide it at Pelican Bay, but I knew it would suffer loneliness as a result. Witch Hazel is out in Azle, too, but has only 3 finds in a year. And it's practically a drive by. I think because the clues were a poem and not cut and dried clues, it suffered. Strangely enough, those boxes are just a few miles up the road from the Fort Worth Nature Center, and those boxes get hit a lot.<div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>I say "Hooray!" to all of the clever clues, interesting spots, out of the way nooks and crannies!!<div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>And I have to disagree about lonely boxes not suffering. When we go to the trouble to carve, make logbooks, and especially tape up those Lock-N-Locks, we want them to be found! It's fantastic to check on a box and see that the logbook is almost full. It makes ya feel like ya "done good".</div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>And that brings me to my last bit: what's to be done about listed "attempted finds" that weren't actually attempts? In the case of Witch Hazel (if I'm not mistaken) the last attempted find was someone going out and seeing that the place was too crowded for a decent search. I think when folks see that the last log was an attempt, they are more likely to pass that box up on a LB outing. I know I've been guilty of that.</div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>Stargazer</div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div><br/><div><blockquote type="cite"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="border-collapse: separate; border-spacing: 0px 0px; color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-family: Helvetica; font-size: 20px; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; letter-spacing: normal; line-height: normal; text-align: auto; -khtml-text-decorations-in-effect: none; text-indent: 0px; -apple-text-size-adjust: auto; text-transform: none; orphans: 2; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; "><br/><span style="color: white;; color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255); "></span></span></span></blockquote></div><br/></div></div></body></html>

<div><font size="2">My thought on listing a box as an "attempt" is that a box shouldn't be reported as an attempt unless the person looking for it is possitive that they were looking in the right spot and the box is missing. In fact, I think they should make an effort to contact the placer and verify that they were in the right spot before marking it as an "attempt". What does a person have to gain by marking a box as an "attempt" anyway? I especially don't think a box should be marked as attempted if it's a mystery box, because chances are good that you haven't solved the puzzle correctly. Case in point: your (Stargazer's) box: Twisters in Texas. On a recent trip home from Archer City, I looked for this box. I got down to the final couple of clues, and couldn't quite figure it out. The sun was setting and I decided that I'd just have to save that one for another day.  Is that an attempt? Not in my book, because I never quite figured out exactly where it was supposed to be, although I'm sure I had to be within a few feet of it!</font></div>

<p>It's a strange phenomenon, if you ask me.  I always thought of letterboxers as being more "active" (hikers, rock-climbers, campers, etc.) and less "take a short-cut" types.  I love the drives, the hikes, etc.  One of my boxes, ESOT: Brown Pelican, has only two logged finds in 10 months.  I just had to hide it at Pelican Bay, but I knew it would suffer loneliness as a result.  Witch Hazel is out in Azle, too, but has only 3 finds in a year.  And it's practically a drive by.  I think because the clues were a poem and not cut and dried clues, it suffered.  Strangely enough, those boxes are just a few miles up the road from the Fort Worth Nature Center, and those boxes get hit a lot.

<div>I say "Hooray!" to all of the clever clues, interesting spots, out of the way nooks and crannies!!  
<div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div>
<div>And I have to disagree about lonely boxes not suffering.  When we go to the trouble to carve, make logbooks, and especially tape up those Lock-N-Locks, we want them to be found!  It's fantastic to check on a box and see that the logbook is almost full.  It makes ya feel like ya "done good".</div>
<div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div>
<div>And that brings me to my last bit: what's to be done about listed "attempted finds" that weren't actually attempts?  In the case of Witch Hazel (if I'm not mistaken) the last attempted find was someone going out and seeing that the place was too crowded for a decent search.  I think when folks see that the last log was an attempt, they are more likely to pass that box up on a LB outing.  I know I've been guilty of that.  </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hang in there, Stargazer.  The pelican and Witch Hazel are on our<br>
list.  As are another 150 boxes in the area and that doesn't even get<br>
us into Dallas...  Honestly, if I can get my guest room clean early<br>
this week, Z and I were planning on heading that way on Thursday or<br>
Friday.  Don't count on anything but we have plans!  Lots of them! <br>
And they involve lots of different boxes.  :)<br>
<br>
One thing about letterboxing that I've learned is that you really<br>
can't 100% count on the information that you get from the clue.  Yes,<br>
you need to follow a clue to the letter.  Trust me on this.  It can<br>
turn a half hour hike into a 2 hour adventure.  But you can't take the<br>
missing and attempt information at face value.  I know of 2 boxes that<br>
have been removed from active status because of flooding and major<br>
construction, yet DH rides through this area regularly and we think<br>
the boxes may have survived.  The cool part is that he has finally<br>
agreed to take the clues with him on his next ride to investigate.  We<br>
still try to find the ones that are listed as unknown or missing. <br>
Why?  Because half the fun is knowing that the person before you<br>
wasn't paying enough attention or maybe some random person found the<br>
box down stream, looked it up online, found the clue and then took the<br>
time to put it back where it belongs.<br>
<br>
All I know is that I have to return to one spot sometime this week to<br>
see if I can find a box Z didn't see, because his hand was in the<br>
right hole.  And Saturday, we returned to a box that we had spent 30<br>
minutes looking for Wednesday only to discover we had been looking<br>
behind the wrong tree.  Sometimes, all it takes it a good nights sleep<br>
and a new perspective and then the box kinda jumps out and bites you.<br>

time is limited.  We have a place to be and a certain number of hours to 
get there.  Letterboxing isn't the reason for the trip.  If I can grab 
3 known good ones along I-20, or I can spend that same amount of time searching 
for one that was attempted (and I do not find it), which do you think I am going 
to do.</span></font></div>

not on dog show trips.  If it is a LOOOOOONG dog show like the nationals, 
there is usually one day off in the middle.  We often letterbox.geocache
