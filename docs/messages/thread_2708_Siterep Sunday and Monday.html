First of all I want to let everyone know that I am not much of a <br/>
writer, so bear with me on this :)  Easter Sunday, my puggle <br/>
(pug/beagle mix 1 year old puppy) navigator, JR, and I had about 3 <br/>
hours to kill, so we decided to take off and catch some local boxes <br/>
that we hadnt found yet.  We started in Rusk at Hogg Park and found <br/>
the Native born Texas Governor Series box.  It was a beautiful stamp <br/>
and the location was one of my favorite walks in Rusk.  From here we <br/>
went to ID Fairchild Forest to pick up Baby Bear and Silver Eagle's <br/>
boxes.  The directions were great and we found the boxes with only <br/>
one minor problem.  I am an even five feet tall and Baby Bear <br/>
referenced in his clue to "hop" over a creek...the problem was that <br/>
the creek was about five feet wide..LOL..so we went upstream a <br/>
little and found a place we could cross and then proceeded to the <br/>
box with no problem. We still had a couple of hours, so we then <br/>
decided to drive to Palestine to the Davey Dogwood Park and find <br/>
Baby Bear, Silver Eagle, and Barefoot Lucy's boxes.  The park was <br/>
beautiful, but we missed the blooming dogwoods.  Thanks to SE and <br/>
BB's invaluable directions, we were able to find all 3 boxes.  We <br/>
stil had some time to kill, and looked at the clues for the box in <br/>
Tennessee Colony by BL, but after reading about the possibility of <br/>
alligators, and not want to lose my puppy, I decided that it would <br/>
have to wait until I had someone else along with me to help keep an <br/>
eye on everything.  So having looked for 6 boxes and finding 6 <br/>
boxes, we decided to make it a day and then headed home.<br/>
<br/>
Day 2 - Monday<br/>
I was off from work today, and got up early (5:30 am) and decided <br/>
that I would take off for Troup to find the Go Tigers box.  When I <br/>
got there I realized that my great, great grandparents are buried in <br/>
this same cemetery, so it was really a thrill to find this box.  <br/>

<br/>got there I realized that my great, great grandparents are buried in <br/>this same cemetery, so it was really a thrill to find this box. <br/>From here I went to my dentist appointment..YUK. After having a <br/>couple of cavities filled (1 1/2 hours), and the left side of my 
<br/>face numb, I went back to Rusk to pick up my navigator again. We <br/>headed off towards Athens. (side note...on the way we saw a little <br/>feud going on between a couple of neighbors...one of them had a sign <br/>in his front yard that read "My neighbor is a thief, just like 
<br/>jeffrey dahmer, he kills pets."...i don't think any comment is <br/>needed for that) We picked up the Texas Passport #1 box at the E Tx <br/>Arboretum which is beautiful and then proceeded to the Cain Center <br/>
in and picked up Candi Cain (still not sure what disc golf is) Now <br/>on to Gun Barrel City to City Hall (no I didnt fight city hall) I <br/>knew I was in trouble when i re-read the clue and it said that the <br/>box was in an awning above the door, did i mention i am only five 
<br/>feet tall? well with some strong mcgyver skills, i managed to <br/>retrieve the box, but then there was the matter of replacing it, <br/>which was not easy either, but with JR on my shoulders he got it <br/>back up there..LOL. While we were there we also retrieved Have Fun 
<br/>Matte'<br/>Our journey took us to Mabank next where I ran into couple of new <br/>species that are kin to Pinus pretendis...they are Roadus pretendus <br/>and Parkus pretendus...but still managed to use my letterboxing 
<br/>skills to find the Boxing is a Circus box. The next stop was Kemp <br/>to probably my favorite find of the trip...the Kemp Calaboose was a <br/>really neat site and stamp to go along with it. From here we made <br/>our way to Terrell to find Nana's Hummingbird (great directions and 
<br/>beautiful stamp) and then on to Greenville. This was a neat <br/>little "series" of boxes, and all 4 were placed in neat locations. <br/>We didnt find the Forest Park box, but the other 3 were all right <br/>where they should be. By now it was about 6:30 and we decided to 
<br/>head home. When we got to Tyler, we still had about 30 minutes of <br/>light left, so we did manage to find the Starrville Stagecoach box <br/>in Winona...again really great stamp and location. So Day 2, we <br/>attempted 13 boxes and found 12...so great trip. By the way, I 
<br/>realized somewhere around Athens that JR was really good at reading <br/>maps and at finding the locations of the boxes, but he had a lot of <br/>difficulty actually reading the names of the towns and the clues, so <br/>
I guess I should teach him to read the next time he navigates...LOL<br/>Also the bluebonnets along the way were phenomenal (my big word for <br/>the day) Thanks to all the boxers who placed the above boxes for a <br/>wonderful adventure

<br/>got there I realized that my great, great grandparents are buried in <br/>this same cemetery, so it was really a thrill to find this box. <br/>From here I went to my dentist appointment..YUK. After having a <br/>couple of cavities filled (1 1/2 hours), and the left side of my 
<br/>face numb, I went back to Rusk to pick up my navigator again. We <br/>headed off towards Athens. (side note...on the way we saw a little <br/>feud going on between a couple of neighbors...one of them had a sign <br/>in his front yard that read "My neighbor is a thief, just like 
<br/>jeffrey dahmer, he kills pets."...i don't think any comment is <br/>needed for that) We picked up the Texas Passport #1 box at the E Tx <br/>Arboretum which is beautiful and then proceeded to the Cain Center <br/>
in and picked up Candi Cain (still not sure what disc golf is) Now <br/>on to Gun Barrel City to City Hall (no I didnt fight city hall) I <br/>knew I was in trouble when i re-read the clue and it said that the <br/>box was in an awning above the door, did i mention i am only five 
<br/>feet tall? well with some strong mcgyver skills, i managed to <br/>retrieve the box, but then there was the matter of replacing it, <br/>which was not easy either, but with JR on my shoulders he got it <br/>back up there..LOL. While we were there we also retrieved Have Fun 
<br/>Matte'<br/>Our journey took us to Mabank next where I ran into couple of new <br/>species that are kin to Pinus pretendis...they are Roadus pretendus <br/>and Parkus pretendus...but still managed to use my letterboxing 
<br/>skills to find the Boxing is a Circus box. The next stop was Kemp <br/>to probably my favorite find of the trip...the Kemp Calaboose was a <br/>really neat site and stamp to go along with it. From here we made <br/>our way to Terrell to find Nana's Hummingbird (great directions and 
<br/>beautiful stamp) and then on to Greenville. This was a neat <br/>little "series" of boxes, and all 4 were placed in neat locations. <br/>We didnt find the Forest Park box, but the other 3 were all right <br/>where they should be. By now it was about 6:30 and we decided to 
<br/>head home. When we got to Tyler, we still had about 30 minutes of <br/>light left, so we did manage to find the Starrville Stagecoach box <br/>in Winona...again really great stamp and location. So Day 2, we <br/>attempted 13 boxes and found 12...so great trip. By the way, I 
<br/>realized somewhere around Athens that JR was really good at reading <br/>maps and at finding the locations of the boxes, but he had a lot of <br/>difficulty actually reading the names of the towns and the clues, so <br/>
I guess I should teach him to read the next time he navigates...LOL<br/>Also the bluebonnets along the way were phenomenal (my big word for <br/>the day) Thanks to all the boxers who placed the above boxes for a <br/>wonderful adventure

          Day 1 - Sunday<br/>
First of all I want to let everyone know that I am not much of a <br/>
writer, so bear with me on this :) Easter Sunday, my puggle <br/>
(pug/beagle mix 1 year old puppy) navigator, JR, and I had about 3 <br/>
hours to kill, so we decided to take off and catch some local boxes <br/>
that we hadnt found yet. We started in Rusk at Hogg Park and found <br/>
the Native born Texas Governor Series box. It was a beautiful stamp <br/>
and the location was one of my favorite walks in Rusk. From here we <br/>
went to ID Fairchild Forest to pick up Baby Bear and Silver Eagle's <br/>
boxes. The directions were great and we found the boxes with only <br/>
one minor problem. I am an even five feet tall and Baby Bear <br/>
referenced in his clue to "hop" over a creek...the problem was that <br/>
the creek was about five feet wide..LOL..so we went upstream a <br/>
little and found a place we could cross and then proceeded to the <br/>
box with no problem. We still had a couple of hours, so we then <br/>
decided to drive to Palestine to the Davey Dogwood Park and find <br/>
Baby Bear, Silver Eagle, and Barefoot Lucy's boxes. The park was <br/>
beautiful, but we missed the blooming dogwoods. Thanks to SE and <br/>
BB's invaluable directions, we were able to find all 3 boxes. We <br/>
stil had some time to kill, and looked at the clues for the box in <br/>
Tennessee Colony by BL, but after reading about the possibility of <br/>
alligators, and not want to lose my puppy, I decided that it would <br/>
have to wait until I had someone else along with me to help keep an <br/>

        I don't know how you manage to make the time you do - you covered some miles, especially on Monday!<br/>
<br/>
  The only time I time I ever boxed with our dog, I wound up being dragged around the woods at Jim Hogg State Historical Site for an hour before I had to seek medical treatment for my dislocated shoulder!  I'm impressed that not only does your dog NOT yank your arm out of socket, but can even navigate.  Impressive! <br/>
<br/>
  Now you see - you missed an opportunity to instigate a little trouble and move on because you could've placed a sign in the neighbor's yard (and if there were two, pick one) griping about the first neighbor.  Guess it wouldn't have been any fun if you couldn't have watched the fallout though...oh well! <br/>
