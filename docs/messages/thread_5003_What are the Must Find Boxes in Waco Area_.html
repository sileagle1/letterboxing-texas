                    <div class="plaintext-content">"Quiet Angel Revisited" by Travelin' T's is the current Box of the Week on AQ, so I would say that it would be a "Must Find".  "The Czech Stop" in West is a great box, not sure of its status.<br>

                    <html><body><p>Several years ago, I thoroughly boxed Waco.  They were all great boxes and I really enjoyed getting to know the city itself while I boxed (I enjoyed the first weekend there so much, I went back the next weekend).  Last summer I went back to go boxing and took my grandson, Trail Whale.  As I started planning the trip, I realized that virtually every letterbox I had gotten way back when was no longer there and there was a whole new crop of them!  I'll post my sitrep that I sent to Boots, who had advised me on that trip before I went, but I just want to say - I am so eager to get back that way!  For one thing, I want to take D'vir to look at Baylor (yes, we're to the point of college-shopping with him), but for another - I just can't get enough of Waco.<br/><br/>But off the subject altogether, since when does a Jeep need shoes?  I would've thought a Jeep would be tough enough that it would laugh at the idea of shoes!<br/><br/>BarefootLucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy"</p></body></html>
