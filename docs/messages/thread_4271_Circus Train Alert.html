                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, LB Bozo finally was able to roust the entire circus crew out of bed at the same time. He has been griping and cajoling and complaining for the last month about getting on the road, but just couldn't seem to get everyone up before the clowns went back to sleep and the monkey was loose yet again. After all their troubles with the INS were taken care of by that nice attorney lady, everyone seemed to relax into the casual, laid-back Austin scene.<br/>
Oh, there were things to attend to. That bear had time to see a dentist about getting his teeth cleaned, and boy did they need it. Talk about bad breath!<br/>
All the acrobats took turns with the chiropractor. They said they needed massage therapy, but all day at the spa for a month?!?<br/>
Then of course there was football. All those ring masters and ring master wannabe's insisted on leading the band at half time. ESPN was appalled and immediately cut to commercial.<br/>
At any rate, they left this morning. Said they were headed north. The bearded lady and the human cannonball had been watching old time TV and saw several episodes of The Lone Ranger. I think they convinced everyone to head to that museum to find out who that masked man really was.<br/>
Bozo just sent me some photos from his new IPhone of where they were able to stop for the night. He said they all felt pretty safe there now that All Hallow's Eve is past and those ghosty-types are back in their coffins. Especially that Ira Boxer ghost and that new one Oddie or some such. They were actually pretty scared of being abducted to the Telge Park place, which is another reason, I think, that they were reluctant to get going.<br/>
Anyway, Bozo wrote that they found a cozy spot not far from the parking lot of that museum in that wacky town to the north. Something about a 1st Street Cemetery and a double line of Boys in Gray pointing the way. He said it was nicely fenced off from the madding crowd. Apparently they all trooped down a little street just the right size for the trained dog bandwagon. They even found some spices for pumpkin pie that Bearded Lady wants to bake. The animal trainer was excited to see some lions nearby. When Bozo saw a white marble spittoon indicating the land was free, he herded everyone to the right. Just left of a tall dead tree they found a warm and dry place to bed down for the night. Charlotte and Herman said they wouldn't mind if the whole group bedded down there for a night or two, as long as the dancing dog didn't howl at the moon and the elephants, however colorful, didn't unpack their trunks.<br/>
I put Bozo's pics sent from his IPhone in the photo section for y'all to view, since I don't know how to transfer them to this email. If you look real close I think you can just see him peeking out from behind that stone.<br/>
