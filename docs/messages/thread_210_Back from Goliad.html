in the park and then it was on to the boxes.  We saw dozens of <br>
damselflies, butterflies, frogs, giant mutated grasshoppers, and <br>
only a few mosquitos.  The second bridge along the nature path is <br>
closed for hurricane repairs so there is no longer a "loop".  You <br>
can still get to Busy Bee's boxes, though.  When the trail splits <br>
just go to the right, all the way around to the other side of the <br>
bridge.  Then you'll have to double back to where you started from.  <br>
It's not too far.<br>
<br>
Here's the what and the how...<br>
<br>
Silver Eagle's "Mexico Flag"<br>
Busy Bee's "Echinacea", and "Twin Dragonflies"<br>
Baby Bear's "Remember Goliad"<br>
<br>
All boxes were fine and dry.  Baby Bear's looked like it had been <br>
wet at one time, but was okay today.  I put the whole box on a <br>
ziploc just in case.<br>
<br>
I haven't been to the missions since I was a kid.  Here it is some <br>
15 years or more later and I still remember everything.  Thanks for <br>
the boxes and the remembrance.<br>
