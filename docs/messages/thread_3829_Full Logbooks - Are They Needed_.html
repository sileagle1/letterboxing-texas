the logbook?  In other words, is stamping into the letterbox logbook <br>
as important to you as getting the stamp image into your logbook?  <br>
Life in the letterboxing world would be much simpler if we did not <br>
use physical logbooks since they will always fill up given enough <br>
time, and they usually get wet or damaged, causing us to make long <br>
treks to replace them or depend on the kindness of others.  The <br>
stamp, however, usually lasts much longer and could even get wet <br>
without too much damage.  Now I admit it is fun to see the logs that <br>
do make it back to me, but many of the boxes I place are so far away <br>
that I don't have any realistic hope of ever seeing the log again.  <br>
So in most cases I would prefer to see some kind of online log of a <br>
visit or an email, since that is more immediate and personal.  I <br>
guess I'm just curious:  how upset would you be if you found a <br>
letterbox with no logbook, but instead prompted you to log your visit <br>
online?<br>

As to why UT generates letterboxers and A&M doesn't, I'm sure there <br>
is an Aggie joke that would explain it!<br>

your stamping in to see who else has been there... and to see each<br>
others stamps! and if you do ever get a full log book returned to you<br>
then thats just a bonus!.. but i loke to see who else as visited the<br>
box and whne etc! thats the fun of the log books to me!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I too like the log books. I also like making books so for me there is<br>
equal pleasure in creating a stamp and creating a book, but then again<br>
I'm all about making stuff. I've also noticed sometimes there will be<br>
a dozen stamps in some books but only a handful of finds for that LB<br>
on AQ. As far as carrying extra log books, what a great idea. I've<br>
been packing extra ziplocks when I head out, and I've replaced a few<br>
torn ones. Throwing in a few blank logbooks in my bag would be just as<br>
easy for me.<br>

</div>
<div class="gmail_quote">******************************</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Awww BootsTex, you ARE a famous letterboxer!</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Silver Eagle, I know what you mean about it being easier not having to worry with a box's logbook, but I think omitting the logbook would change the dynamics of the game completely!</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Let me throw a couple of ideas out:</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">1) Many traditionalist letterboxers don't record their finds online.  They leave a note in the logbook as a surprise for the placer to discover.  I have to confess - I am seriously considering adopting this approach myself, which would mean I would have to get better at writing notes in logbooks.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">2) When I am letterboxing with someone else who isn't a letterboxer, I often find myself pushing the box's logbook at them to go through, and then wind up telling funny stories about the people behind the stamps in the logbook.  I enjoy thinking about all of y'all while I'm letterboxing, and introducing y'all to them through the logbook.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">3) One of my personal precepts is leaving a legacy, and I like to think that part of my letterboxing legacy is in the stamps I leave behind in boxes.  There are times I am sorely tempted NOT to write my little ditty because it takes so long and I usually manage not to have a writing pen with me so it's a pain in the rear to dig one out of some remote pocket of my backpack, but then I realize it sort of describes my philosophy toward life, and if someone were to find only one box that I had been to visit, and I had slouched on writing my ditty, they might not know that one little thing about me.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">4) And what about those boxers who have gone before us?  The logbook is where we now find records of Ruby Tuesday and the Celtic Lions, and Boxer In TRAINing.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">I know an online logbook would stay nice and clean and it wouldn't get ruined or destroyed and it wouldn't disappear, but you can't touch it and turn the pages and see the difference in ink or see how families tried really hard to stamp together on one page.  It doesn't have an earthy aroma when you open the ziploc because 1) there is no ziploc and 2) there is no earth.  I realize some of those imperfections create more difficulty for the placer, but as far as I am concerned as a placer, it is well worth it.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">And another reason I would prefer a paper log to an online one - I spend wayyyy too much time on the computer anyway between work and other endeavours, so I try really hard to stay OFF the computer as it relates to letterboxing, which is a big reason I don't use AQ very much - it tempts me too much to sit in my chair instead of slipping into my boots.  I am far less likely to flip through an online logbook because it would seem like a waste of time, whereas I will most definitely take time on the trail to browse through.  </div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Do you remember virtual LB's - in the beginning?  You would solve them, and at the end was a scanned-in stamped image you could print out and put in your logbook?  How often do you find those anymore?  The stamped images are, by and large, a thing of the past with virtual boxing, so that virtual boxing is pretty much just puzzle solving.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Or how about relating it to the lost art of storytelling?  When stories had to be passed verbally from one generation to another, the younger generation was diligent to listen so they could in turn pass the stories down and the older generation told stories with pride and care.  When the stories became mass-printed, there was a disconnect between the teller and the learner, and the stories didn't hold their same meaning.  Taking the box logbook away is sort of like saying "I'll tell the story once so it can be written down and printed, and then I'll just hand you a copy of it for you to read for yourself."  Much less personal...Okay, this analogy is working really well in my mind, but I'm having a hard time conveying it.  </div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Anyway, Silver Eagle, I would still go find your boxes if you decided to quit using logbooks, but I wouldn't enjoy them as much, and I would probably not get around to logging online, although I would probably still send you an email.</div>

Totally agree with a YES vote for real logbooks!<br>
<br>
We love to travel around the country finding letterboxes and enjoy looking at the logbooks.  It's always fun to see the stamps and notes left by other letterboxers, especially those that we have met.  Right now we're spending a week in South & North Carolina and we've reported back to our Great Lakes regional group on who else we have seen logged in from our region, and that has prompted a funny story and a honeymoon reminisce.  I doubt we'd take the time to look on-line, but we do flip through the books on the trail to see the stamps and read the comments.<br>

I will say, though, that I did experience a situation where it was <br>
nice not to have them.  There is a Sound of Music series in Ohio <br>
(great series).  All done by the same person, and all of the boxes <br>
are fairly close together.  Most of the boxes were micros and had no <br>
logbooks.  The last one was a larger box and had a logbook.  For the <br>
planter, all the small boxes made the series easier to hide in that <br>
particular area.  Not having 7 micro logs that fill up quicker <br>
should make the series easier to maintain.  From my end, I didn't <br>
really need to look at 8 nearly identical books (most people try, <br>
and succeed in finding, most of the series together since they are <br>
closely spaced).  Also, I was boxing with another adult and 2 kids.  <br>
We don't usual box as a group, so we can't have a group stamp, and <br>
having to all stamp into 8 boxes in quick succession wouldn't have <br>
been very quick, or honestly, very enjoyable.  So I was very happy <br>
that only the last box had a log.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, what if that last box went missing.  And what <br>
about those boxers that don't manage to find the last box...  <br>
