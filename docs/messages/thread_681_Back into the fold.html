Hi to all from Wes and Grace (Kissin' Fishies).  We've been out of <br/>
the letterboxing groove for several months and finally got back into <br/>
it.  Wow, what a change.  It seems like there are hundreds of us <br/>
LB'ers in the local area.  We will be at the Brazos Bend get-together <br/>
and have reserved a camping site.  For anyone that would like to stop <br/>
by the the ol' camp site, we'll be happy to share a beverage.  In <br/>
keeping with the "Wild West" theme for the event, Mr. Howdy will be <br/>
camping with us and will be on guard duty at our camp site.  Here's a <br/>
clue for you to pick up a "traveller":  Just ask one of us, What's <br/>
Mr. Howdy's first name?" !!!!!<br/>
<br/>
We printed out the Wild West pamphlet, and want to thank all the <br/>
people who have done so much to make this event so much bigger than <br/>
last years.  It looks like everyone is going to have a great time.  <br/>
Hope the weather is as nice as yesterday was.<br/>
<br/>
Warm Regards,<br/>
Wes &amp; Grace<br/>
"Kissin' Fishies"<br/>
(and "Mr. Howdy")<br/>
