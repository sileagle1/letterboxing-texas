                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a general question to ask: Does the name of a box affect <br>
whether you want to find it or not?  I planted a box called "To Hell <br>
and Back" and, at the same time, Lone Star Quilter planted one <br>
called "Square Dance".  They are in the same park, about 100 yards or <br>
less apart.  You have to pass my box on a paved sidewalk to get to <br>
hers and yet, her box has been reported found 5 times, but mine only <br>
twice.  I just find this interesting and was wondering if I should <br>
change the name of the box?  It is a tribute to Audie Murphy's <br>
Congressional Medal of Honor and the name comes from the title of his <br>
book and a movie by the same name, "To Hell and Back".  It is hidden <br>
only a few paces from the grave of Audie Murphey's great grandfather, <br>
John Berry, in a beautiful park that was once Berry's farm. Any advice?<br>

Well!  You know I have something to say about this...LOL!<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if the name affects the finding of the box or not.  If <br>
there were no mention of Audie Murphy in the clues, it might give <br>
parents pause when they consider whether or not to take the kiddos <br>
along.  But the clues to this box specifically gives the historical <br>
significance of the box and I think it is a WONDERFUL box!  So much <br>
detail in the stamp...such an appropriate and deserving subject...such <br>
a wonderful spot.<br>
<br>
It kinda makes me wonder if it's gone missing?  I'll go check tomorrow <br>
and make sure that all is well with it.<br>
<br>
Or...there could be a lotta quilters out there!  Maybe they don't <br>
realize your box is so close...they are probably so "focused" on the <br>
Quilt Series boxes?<br>
<br>
I'll update you tomorrow on the status of the box and make a note of <br>
the finders.<br>

                    <html><body><div>How about this?  LSQ's box is the very first in the list for Georgetown - Hell and Back is dead last.  If you were a new boxer or a casual boxer, and you wanted to look to see if there were any in Georgetown, would you intuitively know to look at ALL the boxes and see which were in close proximity to one another?  Or would you start at the top and work your way down?  Or might you take the first five and try them?  I know it took me awhile to get with the program and read the clues ahead of time so I could better organize my searches.

<div> </div>
<div>And another thing - I might take from the box title that it is really, really hard - I'll have to go to hell and back to get that box.  Of course, that's a foolish conclusion to arrive at, but if you were casually reading the titles and trying to decide which boxes to go for, that might have some influence.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Do you know anything about the people who have found yours and the folks who have found hers?  Hard core boxers?  Family folks?  New people just trying it out?  Maybe you can figure it out if you can profile the finders of each.
