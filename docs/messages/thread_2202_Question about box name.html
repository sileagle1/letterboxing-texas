                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a general question to ask: Does the name of a box affect <br/>
whether you want to find it or not?  I planted a box called "To Hell <br/>
and Back" and, at the same time, Lone Star Quilter planted one <br/>
called "Square Dance".  They are in the same park, about 100 yards or <br/>
less apart.  You have to pass my box on a paved sidewalk to get to <br/>
hers and yet, her box has been reported found 5 times, but mine only <br/>
twice.  I just find this interesting and was wondering if I should <br/>
change the name of the box?  It is a tribute to Audie Murphy's <br/>
Congressional Medal of Honor and the name comes from the title of his <br/>
book and a movie by the same name, "To Hell and Back".  It is hidden <br/>
only a few paces from the grave of Audie Murphey's great grandfather, <br/>
John Berry, in a beautiful park that was once Berry's farm. Any advice?<br/>

<br/>
Well!  You know I have something to say about this...LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure if the name affects the finding of the box or not.  If <br/>
there were no mention of Audie Murphy in the clues, it might give <br/>
parents pause when they consider whether or not to take the kiddos <br/>
along.  But the clues to this box specifically gives the historical <br/>
significance of the box and I think it is a WONDERFUL box!  So much <br/>
detail in the stamp...such an appropriate and deserving subject...such <br/>
a wonderful spot.<br/>
<br/>
It kinda makes me wonder if it's gone missing?  I'll go check tomorrow <br/>
and make sure that all is well with it.<br/>
<br/>
Or...there could be a lotta quilters out there!  Maybe they don't <br/>
realize your box is so close...they are probably so "focused" on the <br/>
Quilt Series boxes?<br/>
<br/>
I'll update you tomorrow on the status of the box and make a note of <br/>
the finders.<br/>
