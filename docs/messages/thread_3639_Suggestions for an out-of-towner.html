<br>
I'll be in San Antonio later this month and was hoping to grab a local<br>
box or two.  I was looking for suggestions or recommendations since<br>
I'm not familiar with the city and won't have access to a car.  I'll<br>
be staying a block from the Riverwalk and a few blocks from the Alamo,<br>
so if anyone has any suggestions for me, please let me know (off list<br>
is fine).<br>
<br>
Thanks so much!<br>

Since no one's replied, I'll give it a shot.  You probably shouldn't go <br>
out letterboxing alone.  But if you can find someone to go with you <br>
(sorry I'm not living in San Antonio or I'd volunteer), without a car <br>
your best bet would be to print out some clues that look interesting.  <br>
Then mapquest them to see where they're at and once in San Antonio, get <br>
some VIA city bus route maps and figure out which ones you can get to <br>
by bus.  I think there's a bus that goes up Broadway from downtown and <br>
you could walk to Barney's Toilet Seat Museum for the box there.  <br>
Meeting Barney would be a really treat; he's such a neat, sweet old <br>
guy.  Most of the boxes that I've read about are in various city <br>
parks.  I don't remember seeing any that are near the Alamo.  That area <br>
is always too active with people that I wouldn't place a box there! <br>
<br>
Hope this helps. <br>
