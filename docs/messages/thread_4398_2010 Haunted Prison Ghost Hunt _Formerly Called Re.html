&gt; Coffee Mug and Granny Butterfly are not going to be able to come this time either due to scheduling and the weather that is keeping folks from leaving there any sooner.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My son and his wife have had company now that I realize, from mid December when his sister in law came until his father in law, mother in law and the dog came. They were to stay 2 months but looks like now more like 2 1/2.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are just not going to make it to Texas this spring but will miss all the beautiful flowers I saw last year in Feb and Mar.<br/>
