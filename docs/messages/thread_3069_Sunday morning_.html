	Sunday morning.  I was GOING to go shoot the match this morning. But<br>
it is raining.  I have lots of experience shooting in the rain - 20 years of<br>
military you know.  And I have lots of experience cleaning gear after laying<br>
in the mud while shooting in the rain.  <grin>  Nothing like the smell of<br>
damp LBE!<br>
<br>
	I hear thunder rolling in the east over the mountains.  The El Paso<br>
radar shows me there is a cell right over NE and the Ft. Bliss rifle range<br>
now.  Not a lot of rain, but enough to show on radar.  Enough to make the<br>
ground wet.  Enough to make mud.<br>
<br>
	Just talked to a shooter living near the range.  It is raining<br>
pretty good over there, and he says the clouds seem to be stalled overhead.<br>
Not a good sign.<br>
<br>
	Ya know what?  I don't have to do that anymore.  And nobody can make<br>
me.  I got nothing to prove to nobody.  My gear is all nice and clean, and<br>
clean its gunna stay.  My rifle is dry and nicely oiled.  Dry and nicely<br>
oiled its gunna stay.  After a hike yesterday, my legs are a bit shaky<br>
anyway.<br>
<br>
	Maybe next month.  We need the rain out here.<br>
<br>
	Looks like a good day to decide on a stamp for Hudspeth County.  I<br>
can have it done and in my hands by Wednesday.  Letterbox COULD be hidden by<br>
Saturday!  We will see.<br>
<br>
	Y-all enjoy your day.<br>
