Sure enough box #5, the finale, is missing.  Based on the location I chose to believe that a critter made off with it.  If you haven't been to visit yet, this box is 1.75 miles from the trailhead and probably over a 1/4 mile from the closest real trail.<br/>

I have marked that box as unavailable until I can get a replacement out there.<br/>
