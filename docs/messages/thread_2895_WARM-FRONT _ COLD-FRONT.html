Been a busy week.  I have been meaning to send an E-mail to you but I just<br/>
got buried in stuff.<br/>
<br/>
If the Camel-Baks didn't arrive today, they should be there tomorrow<br/>
(Saturday).<br/>
<br/>
Lemme know how you like them, or if you have any questions.<br/>
<br/>
For COLD-FRONT's Camel-Bak, study the straps carefully - looking for the<br/>
Velcro closures used to roll up the extra strap length.  You may need to<br/>
lengthen the straps a bit, but from what you say it may be you need to<br/>
shorten them.  Just get them adjusted, then roll the extra up and Velcro it<br/>
like you find it now.<br/>
<br/>
I HATE straps dangling and catching on bushes etc.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting to hear......<br/>
