Been a busy week.  I have been meaning to send an E-mail to you but I just<br>
got buried in stuff.<br>
<br>
If the Camel-Baks didn't arrive today, they should be there tomorrow<br>
(Saturday).<br>
<br>
Lemme know how you like them, or if you have any questions.<br>
<br>
For COLD-FRONT's Camel-Bak, study the straps carefully - looking for the<br>
Velcro closures used to roll up the extra strap length.  You may need to<br>
lengthen the straps a bit, but from what you say it may be you need to<br>
shorten them.  Just get them adjusted, then roll the extra up and Velcro it<br>
like you find it now.<br>
<br>
I HATE straps dangling and catching on bushes etc.<br>
<br>
Waiting to hear......<br>

We'll figure the Camel-Baks out, and then we'll take them down to Big <br>
