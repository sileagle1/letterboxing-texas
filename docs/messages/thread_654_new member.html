</p><div>Hi, all. I just joined the group and wanted to "introduce" myself. I am a Texan who has been displaced to Connecticut for the past four years. Last summer, I got involved in a letterbox program in CT set up by the CT State Forestry Department. They had hidden letterboxes in each of their 30 State Forests and posted the clues on their website. If you located five of the boxes, you would earn a patch and if you located all 30, you were awarded a hiking stick. By the time I located my first letterbox, I was hooked and within 5 weeks, I had traveled the four corners of this very small state and hiked many miles throughout their gorgeous forests and had located all thirty boxes. Of course, that was just the beginning. Since then I have located boxes hidden along the Appalachian Trail, in Revolutionary War Cemeteries, and various other interesting locations. When I have traveled home to Texas, my sister and I spent as much time as possible seeking out more boxes. She has now found over 60 boxes in NorthTexas, and when she visited me last fall, we had a great adventure letterboxing in Maine, following moose prints on a trail through the woods in the rain. Later this week I am going to be accompanying my husband on a business trip to the San Diego area (business for him, fun for me). I have already printed out a backpack full of clue sheets for that area including one on the Pacific Crest Trail! I am extremely excited to be moving back to Texas in June, and I can't wait to join you all soon in letterboxing fun!</div>

<div>We were an Air Force family and moved from Texas to New York state to Alabama, back to NY, Ohio, Texas, Colorado, Virginia, to Florida (as well as my husband spending a couple of tours in Vietnam) before retiring back in Texas. My older daughter was still in junior high school when we landed back in Texas. Although I felt a little guilty for pulling up roots and moving them every couple of years or so, my daughters agree that they loved moving around the country and meeting new people. I think it gave them a lot of confidence knowing that they'll do just fine wherever they are.</div>

<p>We did just the opposite, we moved one of our teenage sons from a<br/>small community north of Ann Arbor Michigan to Austin Texas. He has<br/>absolutely bloomed here just like this last wildflower season. Don't<br/>worry...our experience has been that Texas is full of warm and<br/>friendly people and I don't doubt that you and your family will<br/>experience the same.
