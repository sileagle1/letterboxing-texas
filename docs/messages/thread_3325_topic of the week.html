<div>I've been thinking 
about this all day, and I guess my boxing life is less chaotic than my regular 
life, nothing too astounding has happened to us.  The worst thing that ever 
happened was when we arrived at Enchanted Rock about 2 1/2 years ago when the 
now 3 year old was a baby, only to realize that my trusty Kelty Kid Carrier was 
in Houston.  However, since my car is ALWAYS full of junk, I was able to 
fashion a baby sling out of an old beach towel and some clothesline.  We 
made it to the top without aching arms.</div>

<div>I will say, I am not 
scared of snakes (ok, I am scared of cottonmouths, but not other snakes), but I 
am cautious of them   I almost always see them on the trails, because 
I am always on the lookout.  If you know where they are, you generally 
don't have to worry (unless one has hitched a ride on a nearby bus!)
