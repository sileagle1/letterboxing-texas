<br/>2) Just having virus software doesn't mean you're covered - make sure you regularly update your virus definitions - or better, have your computer automatically go out and get updates. Even if you have your computer automatically getting them, check occasionally to make sure it is happening. Some viruses go in and turn off automatic updates, or even turn off your virus scanning software. <br/>
<br/>3) Don't open email from people you don't know.<br/><br/>4) If you use a program like Outlook, turn off Preview Pane. This gives you one more opportunity to delete instead of open.<br/><br/>5) Don't open email without a subject line. If you have a friend who habitually sends without a subject line, get 'em. Tell 'em you don't read their email because you don't know if they haven't been hacked and are sending you a bug.<br/>
<br/>6) Don't open files you aren't expecting to receive, especially if they look "weird". If you are in doubt, send an email or call the sender and ask them if they sent you the file. I send dozens, if not more, files out from my job every day. When I talk to someone on the phone, I tell them "I'm going to send you an Adobe file that will tell you...."<br/>
<br/>7) Be wary of free gaming or music sites. Font sites and any type of site that specializes in "free" anything are also suspect. In fact, I cleaned a virus off a computer at work today that came from a coupon download site. The user saw some great coupons, got greedy, downloaded the "special software", and next thing I knew, she was calling me asking why her computer wasn't doing what she wanted it to do...<br/>
<br/>8) Make sure every computer you use has virus software. If you're like me, you often forward things around from one computer to another. Every computer my email touches has the potential to attach an unwanted virus.<br/>
<br/>9) Instead of using Outlook, use a web-based email account if you can. I no longer use my Outlook-based email and have gone entirely to yahoo and google for two reasons 1) I can get my email anywhere, and 2) they have their own virus scans.<br/>
<br/>10) Just like Windows is, Outlook and Internet Explorer are both more subject to being targeted by viruses than other products. Every hacker wants to take a shot at Microsoft. For a browser, try Firefox or Opera. <br/>
<br/>You can do all of this, and still get tagged. It just happens. It's a nuisance, but no one should hold it against you. BUT - it's important for all of us to take some precautions so we minimize the risk of sharing with each other in ways we prefer not to share.<br/>
<br/>By the way, this is exactly the reason we have the group set to not allow attachments on group messages. <br/><br/>Back to our regularly scheduled programming!<br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

Also, be cautious about opening videos and links in Facebook.   I was hacked a couple of months ago, and I'm pretty sure that's where it came from.  If you google "facebook virus" you will find information on several different viruses targeted at facebook users.<br/>
