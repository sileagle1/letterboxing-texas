                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently received an email from a letterboxer about my Willow Warbler microbox in Willow Oak Recreation Area in far east TX saying he had good news and bad news.  The good news was that he found the box, which had been reported missing for 3 years, but the bad news was that it was now "One with the tree".  I had hidden this box in a small, multi-trunk tree and I guess 3 years of growth with no finders removing the box caused the tree to trap and crush it.  I think the stamp and log are still there, just very wet and hard to get.  I never thought about this potential down-side of planting within a tree.<br>
<br>
When I planted this box, the park was actually closed because Hurricane Rita had damaged the bridge leading into the park.  Baby Bear and I were able to cross on foot and enter the park anyway, since I had carved the stamp specifically for that park.  Evidently the bridge is now fixed and the park is open, making the box more accessible, but in my opinion, not as much fun to find.<br>

It's a very fast grower. We went over to Woodville yesterday and checked on my governor box in a cemetery there. A piece of metal had become "one with the tree" about head high at some point and made a perfect shelf for the box to sit on, so that's where I placed it. Yesterday, I could barely reach it, so I suppose the tree is growing and lifting the box higher and higher. The box is still in good condition, but may now be unavailable to the vertically challenged.<br>

The good news was that he found the box, which had been reported missing for 3 years, but the bad news was that it was now "One with the tree". I had hidden this box in a small, multi-trunk tree and I guess 3 years of growth with no finders removing the box caused the tree to trap and crush it. I think the stamp and log are still there, just very wet and hard to get. I never thought about this potential down-side of planting within a tree.<br>

Baby Bear and I were able to cross on foot and enter the park anyway, since I had carved the stamp specifically for that park. Evidently the bridge is now fixed and the park is open, making the box more accessible, but in my opinion, not as much fun to find.<br>

&gt; I had never considered that possibility either, but I do have a crepe myrtle below the sattelite dish on my roof that I have to constantly trim so it doesn't block the signal.
