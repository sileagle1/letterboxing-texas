                    <html><body><div>Well - we finally settled down long enough today for me to shoot off a message to say how much I enjoyed seeing everyone at the Eustace event yesterday!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The heat had broken just enough to make sitting under the trees comfortable for the day.  It was very enjoyable to be able to sit and visit with everyone for a little while, then to break away and go find some boxes.   Lightning disappeared to the swimming area for the day and Fearless Fox wasn't far away from it himself.  We got to meet several new boxers, or boxers that were new to us.  Cancan and her son, Timonius, drove up from Austin, as did Bloomin Grandma Jo and her LSS.  Aymz and her family drove in two waves from Hurst.  Atoy Adventurers were out en force, as were Adams Trails.  Paw Trekker convinced her dad to bring her over, and he and Fearless Fox went on a mid-morning hike of about three miles (her dad is FF's hiking buddy I sometimes refer to) and then huddled over some scout stuff while Paw Trekker got involved in the gathering stuff.  Of course, Gryzzled Gryphon made the event and we informed him he had made the national list this week, without being named.  He refers to himself as being formerly famous.  HA!  Blue Butterfly was able to come over for a bit and brought Roarin' Lion and Stinky Monkey - both of whom are growing up wayyy too fast!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would like to thank JBK for putting it together and tell Wagtime she's gonna have to try harder to use that Rule of 3 next time!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After all was said and done, Fearless Fox and Lightning and I hated to leave - it was, after all, the last day of summer.  So after everyone left, we swam until the sun went down, then went to a fun little program the park had going.  If you ever want to camp and letterbox in East Texas, Purtis Creek is a fine place to do it - the park staff are wonderfully cheerful (this park has to be right up there with Mission Tejas for me!) and the location is convenient to LOTS of boxes now!

&gt; Thanks Lucy..I am really glad everyone enjoyed it.  It really <br/>
&gt; turned out to be a great day and the weather was really nice (Lucy, <br/>
&gt; we made it through an event with no rain and no cold...LOL).  I was <br/>

&gt; missed, but I am sure she will be reading this.  <br/>

<div>Thanks for the 
compliment, BB, but I am not sure I earned it.  Had you been along this 
morning when my two darling girls nearly got into a knock down drag out fight in 
the stroller you might have decided to admire someone else boxing with kids 
:)  I think I need to invest in a stroller where they DO NOT SIT SIDE BY 
SIDE.  The trouble is, my double jogger has these giant wheels that can 4 
wheel down nearly any trail....MO5 </div>

&gt;  &gt; Thanks Lucy..I am really glad everyone enjoyed it.  It really <br/>
&gt;  &gt; turned out to be a great day and the weather was really nice <br/>
(Lucy, <br/>
&gt;  &gt; we made it through an event with no rain and no cold...LOL).  I <br/>
was <br/>
&gt;  &gt; so glad to finally put some faces with the names that always <br/>
seem <br/>

&gt;  &gt;            Well - we finally settled down long enough today for <br/>
me <br/>
&gt;  &gt; to shoot off a message to say how much I enjoyed seeing everyone <br/>
at <br/>
&gt;  &gt; the Eustace event yesterday!<br/>
&gt;  &gt;   <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  The heat had broken just enough to make sitting under the trees <br/>
&gt;  &gt; comfortable for the day.  It was very enjoyable to be able to <br/>
sit <br/>
&gt;  &gt; and visit with everyone for a little while, then to break away <br/>
and <br/>

&gt;  &gt; for the day and Fearless Fox wasn't far away from it himself.  <br/>
We <br/>
&gt;  &gt; got to meet several new boxers, or boxers that were new to us.  <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Cancan and her son, Timonius, drove up from Austin, as did <br/>
Bloomin <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Grandma Jo and her LSS.  Aymz and her family drove in two waves <br/>
&gt;  &gt; from Hurst.  Atoy Adventurers were out en force, as were Adams <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Trails.  Paw Trekker convinced her dad to bring her over, and he <br/>
&gt;  &gt; and Fearless Fox went on a mid-morning hike of about three miles <br/>
&gt;  &gt; (her dad is FF's hiking buddy I sometimes refer to) and then <br/>
&gt;  &gt; huddled over some scout stuff while Paw Trekker got involved in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt;  &gt; gathering stuff.  Of course, Gryzzled Gryphon made the event and <br/>
we <br/>
&gt;  &gt; informed him he had made the national list this week, without <br/>
being<br/>
&gt;  &gt; named.  He refers to himself as being formerly famous.  HA!  <br/>
Blue <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Butterfly was able to come over for a bit and brought Roarin' <br/>
Lion <br/>
&gt;  &gt; and Stinky Monkey - both of whom are growing up wayyy too fast! <br/>
&gt;  &gt;   <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  I would like to thank JBK for putting it together and tell <br/>
&gt;  &gt; Wagtime she's gonna have to try harder to use that Rule of 3 <br/>
next <br/>
&gt;  &gt; time!   <br/>
&gt;  &gt;  After all was said and done, Fearless Fox and Lightning and I <br/>
&gt;  &gt; hated to leave - it was, after all, the last day of summer.  So <br/>
&gt;  &gt; after everyone left, we swam until the sun went down, then went <br/>

camp <br/>

it -<br/>
&gt;  &gt; the park staff are wonderfully cheerful (this park has to be <br/>
right <br/>
&gt;  &gt; up there with Mission Tejas for me!) and the location is <br/>
convenient <br/>
&gt;  &gt; to LOTS of boxes now!  <br/>
