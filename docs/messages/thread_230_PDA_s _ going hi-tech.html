I got into Geocaching father's day its fairly tech by nature.<br>
<br>
They have software for managing all their locations (such as GSAK) and <br>
their clues.<br>
I just put letterbox info into that program.  I get approximate Latittudes <br>
and Longitudes from the Texas Letterbox Atlas<br>
and also load them into my GPS, or use a website that converts address to <br>
lat/long.  Then I cna load those into a program for my pocket PC to have <br>
the clues handy and my GPS lets me know when I am driving near a letterbox!<br>
<br>
When in a hurry, I do the basic copy/paste into a work doc and then just <br>
pass that down to the pocket pc!<br>
<br>
This can be as simple or complex as you like!<br>
