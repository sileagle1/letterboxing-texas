&gt; First I have to catch a bear.  My recipe calls for 150 pounds of bear meat, so that would probably be about a 200 pound bear, wouldn't you think?<br/>

Bear Stew is what we always have at home, so can't wait, except it does not use Bear Meat, just boot leather and water.  I will bring some marshmellows so we can all have some Ghost Poop around the camp fire in your honor (or just crisp them to a dark burn in the fire). Can't wait<br/>
