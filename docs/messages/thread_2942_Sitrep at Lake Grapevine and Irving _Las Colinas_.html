<div>I made a trek out to Lake Grapevine today and over to Las Colinas in Irving 
to see about our flooded letterboxes.   Rockledge Park near the Lake 
Grapevine dam is closed, no access to anything on those trails, and anything on 
the lower trail near the lake is likely <strong><em><u>in </u></em></strong>the 
lake by now.  I was able to access a part of the trail from another area 
and can report that <em><u>Merlin the Mooseterious</u></em> is high and dry, as 
is <em><u>White Sail</u></em>  up on its hill (most likely, but I couldn't 
get to it to be positive).   The lower trail is still under the lake, 
so I wasn't able to check on the other boxes there, but my best guess is that 
<em><u>The Lost Moose</u></em> is definitely lost, into the lake and on its way 
to who knows where.  I can't really report on the other letterboxes along 
this trail since I wasn't able to get to that part of the trail for the high 
waters.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In Irving, the Trinity is still way over the banks along the Campion Trail 
near NW Hwy, and part of the trails are still underwater, too.  I'm 
pretty sure that anything on that trail is now somewhere way down the river 
heading towards the Gulf of Mexico.  I was able to get to the location of 
my <em><u>Vivaldi! Four Seasons</u></em> box, and it is definitely gone.  
Maybe Vivaldi is trying to float back to Italy (now that <em><u>would</u></em> 
be a HH!).   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I pulled both my Southlake boxes near the south shore of Lake Grapevine at 
Bob Jones Park for maintenance.   Flooding has made the 
equestrian trails along the lake  inaccessible following the clues, 
but I took another route and found the locations of both <em><u>Bat!</u></em> 
and <em><u>Roadrunner</u></em>  high and dry.  Unfortunately, the 
boxes themselves weren't so lucky. The last few finders had reported 
finding them full of water, boxes and bags left open and the logbooks 
soaked.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found the <em><u>Bat!</u></em>  letterbox lying open on the 
ground under the tree without the lid (which was lying nearby).  Both the 
original logbook (full) and a second logbook were in the box in plastic bags, 
but those bags were open, and of course, both logbooks are completely wet and 
the box full of water.  <em><u>Roadrunner </u></em>box was wedged in its 
tree where it should be, box sealed, but bags full of water and both original 
and second logbooks completely soaked.  Apparently this one, too, had been 
left open previously but the last finder must have sealed them up and put the 
box back where it went, well above the ground.  <em><u>Bat!</u></em>, too, 
 was supposed to be placed well up in a bushy cedar tree, wedged 
tightly into the branches and it had survived a number of strong wind and 
rainstorms in that tree.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's in a location that isn't likely to be discovered accidentally, since 
only equestrian trails go nearby and few walkers ever frequent that area.  
I think that it had to be a letterboxer who is, sadly, a careless replacer, 
maybe someone who was in a hurry or let kids put it back or just didn't realize 
that we DO have terrible rains, when it does rain in Texas.   I'm not 
sure if either of these will be replaced.  First, I hope to salvage the 
soggy logbooks with my blowdryer and maybe some hot Texas sun - if we get 
some!   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm  sorry now that I didn't keep the original logbooks when 
they were full, when I added the second logbooks.  I remember our 
discussion on the Texas list that finders like to read the history of a 
letterbox as it is contained in the logs, but now I wish I'd kept that history 
for myself.  Then I'd only have lost part of it if it can't be dried. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What can we do other that ask finders to Recover Well to protect these 
logbooks? Maybe we need to add ReSEAL Tightly to our motto. </div>
