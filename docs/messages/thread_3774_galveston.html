                    <div class="plaintext-content">while the letterboxes are probably the least important concern in galveston (and the houston <br/>
area), we've still wondered how they've faired. our five year old son was watching some of the <br/>
footage from galveston and we saw very close to where our two recently planted boxes were. <br/>
one area was under several feet of water and one was right next to a seawall pier building <br/>
that was demolished! both our magnetic boxes, so i don't think they'd float away, but i <br/>
wouldn't bet money they stayed attached during all that craziness. when we noted that the <br/>
images we were seeing were right by where we planted the boxes, our five year old said, <br/>
"darnit! i guess we're going to have to plant some more...but that's ok."   :-)<br/>
<br/>
hoping all the boxers are safe and dry (and if any boxes are also, that's ok too!,<br/>
