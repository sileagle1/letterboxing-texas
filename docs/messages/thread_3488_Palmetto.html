&gt; &gt; called "Palmetto - Quilt Block Series" has somehow moved. We got <br/>a <br/>&gt; &gt; message from a non-letterboxer (I assume) who said they found the <br/>&gt; box <br/>&gt; &gt; accidentally and replaced it where they found it. Then, when they <br/>
&gt; went <br/>&gt; &gt; into LbNA to check it out, realized it was in the wrong place. <br/>They <br/>&gt; &gt; graciously told me where they left it. We have posted the new <br/>&gt; location <br/>&gt; &gt; on the clue sheets with a request to move it back to where it was <br/>
&gt; &gt; originally placed. The new location is in a pile of rocks <br/>&gt; surrounding <br/>&gt; &gt; a vertical overflow pipe for the CCC pump that feeds the wetlands <br/>&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; the park. When we were there, the pipe was flowing freely, <br/>
leading <br/>&gt; me <br/>&gt; &gt; to think that the letterbox will be in a shower of water most of <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; time. If anyone happens by that way, you might want to reprint <br/>the <br/>&gt; &gt; clues. Thanks a bunch.<br/>
