great minds think alike. We were just talking this morning about the retirement 
of the Circus and starting a new traveling box. My idea, since we have had a bus 
and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield Overland Mail. But I 
like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging raging bulls. Would Bell 
Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show? If the circus is making 
a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no reason that the Rodeo 
couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is there? The Circus has 
been around for over three years so that's not a bad run. I have a couple of 
observations about the traveling boxes. The first is that, in my opinion, there 
should be a size limit for the stamps. There are some really large Circus stamps 
and that just makes the box fill up faster. I know there were some published 
rules or guidelines for the first two buses, such as prompt notification when a 
box is found so that folks won't travel a great distance only to find that the 
box has already been picked up. I was considering a trip when Bell Motel 
reported her find, and I appreciated the notification, but that hasn't always 
been the case, so maybe we should revisit the rules. I know the traveling boxes 
have owners, but I think all of us feel like partial owners and feel the 
responsibility of ownership. One other point, and I'd like to hear other 
opinions on this, is that the first two boxes counted as one find for every 
stamp, so you could really pad your find stats by finding the box. I think that 
generated a lot of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way to 
grab the box. For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one find. 
That's a lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots

&gt; Good ideas. I'd also like to give kudos to The Jackal, dastardly fellow that he is, for his creative clues and for opening my eyes to the great looking trails wherein lies his hidden den. There's a 16 mile long trail there that needs a few letterboxes. We've found a couple there, but it's been awhile. Looks like it deserves a fresh look. Did everyone figure out the location based on his clues? I think there was more interest in the Circus box because of his cleverness.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I would also like to suggest that the retired boxes still be circulated--from person to person. I would like to be able to get the Circus from Bell Motel (or whoever has it) and stamp at my leisure instead of frantically stamping them at an event.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It would be fun to be able to count all the stamps as finds. I hadnÃ¢Â€Â™t thought about that as the reason to get the box. I just wanted to see all the clever stamps!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I guess great minds think alike. We were just talking this morning about the retirement of the Circus and starting a new traveling box. My idea, since we have had a bus and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield Overland Mail. But I like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging raging bulls. Would Bell Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show? If the circus is making a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no reason that the Rodeo couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is there? The Circus has been around for over three years so that's not a bad run. I have a couple of observations about the traveling boxes. The first is that, in my opinion, there should be a size limit for the stamps. There are some really large Circus stamps and that just makes the box fill up faster. I know there were some published rules or guidelines for the first two buses, such as prompt notification when a box
 is found so that folks won't travel a great distance only to find that the box has already been picked up. I was considering a trip when Bell Motel reported her find, and I appreciated the notification, but that hasn't always been the case, so maybe we should revisit the rules. I know the traveling boxes have owners, but I think all of us feel like partial owners and feel the responsibility of ownership. One other point, and I'd like to hear other opinions on this, is that the first two boxes counted as one find for every stamp, so you could really pad your find stats by finding the box. I think that generated a lot of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way to grab the box. For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one find. That's a lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/>

<div>If the Texas Traveling Circus becomes an Event Box, I think it

However, I, personally, am always otherwise engaged on that weekend.  So, I 
can’t promise that I would bring it myself, but I would make a special effort to 
get the box into the hands of someone who is attending the Fest and can bring it 
to the event.  That is, of course, if it becomes an Event 
Box.    I think when we say “retire”, what we really mean is 
“become an Event Box”, i.e., a box with is made available at Events.  
However, this box may continue to be hidden the old-fashioned way for a while, 
just perhaps without any new performers being taken on, so you may get to find 
it by watching for clues to its new hiding place on this list-serve.  Stay 
tuned!  -- Bell Motel</div>

Just returned from a lovely afternoon at the Bell Motel, meeting all the latest additions to the Circus. What a group! The new members, the art work, the clever and interesting stories have grown exponentially since I last had the circus taking R &amp; R at chez moi. With all the discussion about what to do with the circus, thought I'd weigh in with my own $0.02. (By the way, whatever happened to that very useful  cents sign? It was so much easier!)<br/>
Having grown to its present size, the potential for detection and loss of the circus in the woods is great. I'd vote for face to face hand off or "retiring" those circus folks to comfortable life performing as an event box.<br/>
<br/>
These traveling boxes are special, and have brought an added dimension to letterboxing Texas style. Thank you to all who make this hobby cum sport cum passtime so delightful. I'm looking forward to the coming rodeo stage coach. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Good ideas. I'd also like to give kudos to The Jackal, dastardly fellow that he is, for his creative clues and for opening my eyes to the great looking trails wherein lies his hidden den. There's a 16 mile long trail there that needs a few letterboxes. We've found a couple there, but it's been awhile. Looks like it deserves a fresh look. Did everyone figure out the location based on his clues? I think there was more interest in the Circus box because of his cleverness.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I guess great minds think alike. We were just talking this morning about the retirement of the Circus and starting a new traveling box. My idea, since we have had a bus and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield Overland Mail. But I like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging raging bulls. Would Bell Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show? If the circus is making a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no reason that the Rodeo couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is there? The Circus has been around for over three years so that's not a bad run. I have a couple of observations about the traveling boxes. The first is that, in my opinion, there should be a size limit for the stamps. There are some really large Circus stamps and that just makes the box fill up faster. I know there were some published rules or guidelines for the first two buses, such as prompt notification when a box is found so that folks won't travel a great distance only to find that the box has already been picked up. I was considering a trip when Bell Motel reported her find, and I appreciated the notification, but that hasn't always been the case, so maybe we should revisit the rules. I know the traveling boxes have owners, but I think all of us feel like partial owners and feel the responsibility of ownership. One other point, and I'd like to hear other opinions on this, is that the first two boxes counted as one find for every stamp, so you could really pad your find stats by finding the box. I think that generated a lot of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way to grab the box. For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one find. That's a lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/>

Just returned from a lovely afternoon at the Bell Motel, meeting all the latest additions to the Circus. What a group! The new members, the art work, the clever and interesting stories have grown exponentially since I last had the circus taking R &amp; R at chez moi. With all the discussion about what to do with the circus, thought I'd weigh in with my own $0.02. (By the way, whatever happened to that very useful  cents sign? It was so much easier!)<br/>
Having grown to its present size, the potential for detection and loss of the circus in the woods is great. I'd vote for face to face hand off or "retiring" those circus folks to comfortable life performing as an event box.<br/>
<br/>
These traveling boxes are special, and have brought an added dimension to letterboxing Texas style. Thank you to all who make this hobby cum sport cum passtime so delightful. I'm looking forward to the coming rodeo stage coach. <br/>

&gt; If the Texas Traveling Circus becomes an Event Box, I think it should make an appearance a the annual Tomato Mad Fun Fest!  However, I, personally, am always otherwise engaged on that weekend.  So, I canât promise that I would bring it myself, but I would make a special effort to get the box into the hands of someone who is attending the Fest and can bring it to the event.  That is, of course, if it becomes an Event Box.    I think when we say âretireâ, what we really mean is âbecome an Event Boxâ, i.e., a box with is made available at Events.  However, this box may continue to be hidden the old-fashioned way for a while, just perhaps without any new performers being taken on, so you may get to find it by watching for clues to its new hiding place on this list-serve.  Stay tuned!  -- Bell Motel<br/>
