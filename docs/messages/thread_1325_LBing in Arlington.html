<br>
We found CelticLions TExas Bronze #1 Shawnee Trail in downtown Dallas <br>
by the convention center.  The steer were awesome. I have never seen <br>
anything like it!  The rest have been in Arlington - Curse of the <br>
Witness Tree, Butterfly Hello, Red-eared slider, Into The Woods, Pepper <br>
and 2 of the Jazz Quartet Series (Bass Guitar & Drumeset).  The 2 we <br>
couldnt find were the Stampbook Box & Kelley Park.<br>
<br>
We will probably be here a few more days so I am hoping to at least go <br>
get the other 2 in the Jazz Quartet Series.  Lucky for us that Kantexan <br>
has covered Arlington and there are lots of them near us.  <br>
