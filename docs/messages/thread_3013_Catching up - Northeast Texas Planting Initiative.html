                    <html><body><div>I had promised a special stamp to anyone who participated in a planting initiative back in May in the Northeast counties of Bowie, Camp, Cass, Delta, Fannin, Franklin, Harrison, Hopkins, Lamar, Marion, Morris, Rains, Red River, Titus, Upshur, or Wood.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I hope those that participated don't mind, but I decided to go ahead and extend the offer of that image to anyone who had planted in that area through the end of May, so there are some other planters who will be included.  Following are the participants who should be receiving the stamp soon:

<div>Blue Butterfly </div>
<div>Catpawz2004</div>
<div>deniserows</div>
<div>JB Kokopelli</div>
<div>JKC</div>
<div>Mitchel &amp; Tami</div>
<div>Silver Eagle</div>
<div>Baby Bear (he had one of the very first boxes in the area, but it has now also been retired)</div>
<div>The InnKeeper</div>
<div>TrailCat</div>
<div>and Wag Time</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I need your address, I'll email you privately for it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And while on this topic, JBK recently went on another foray through the far northeast part of the state and she planted boxes in the remaining virgin counties, so that we can now say that the Northeast region has boxes in every county - that makes two areas that have no virgin counties left - Southeast and Northeast!  Way to go to us all - now what can we do for the rest of the state???
