                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was everything in the art department. I got the pink stuff, master <br>
carve, They also had New and improved Speedy-Cut in 6 1/4 by 11 huge <br>
slabs of it all on sale for 50% off. The 4x6 pink stuff was only 2.00 <br>
and the master carve was only 4.00 and I got those huge slabs for <br>
only 4.50. They also had all of there ink on sale. I looked and saw <br>
one box pre-made that contains 58 stamps, 8 different inks and a new <br>
pack of markers all in this see threw carring case. You get all of <br>
that for 40.00. So I went to town on the sale. I bought out every <br>
piece of pink, white or other stamp making stuff, got 2 new boxes for <br>
holding all of it, got all new first finders prizes, and picked up <br>
one of those cases that had it all. In that case all of the stamps <br>
are wood backed and some of them are just absolutly beautiful. So if <br>
no one has any objections to new boxes coming out with store bought <br>
stamps I will be like the Easter bunny planting them all over town. <br>
Remember there are 58 of them. I do have a lot of material to carve <br>
also, So just never know. I'm just so excited. Could I please have <br>
some feed back as to the pre made stamps. Would y'all like that. I <br>
could see upward of 40 new boxes within the next couple of months.Not <br>
to mention HH, and cooties.<br>

<br>
I agree completely with your comments, Dewberry.  Hand-carved stamps <br>
are personal and unique, no matter how beautiful or simple they are.  <br>
Finding that original carved stamp that means the box owner took the <br>
time to think of an image and create it personally, regardless of <br>
their artistic ability or carving proficiency, is like a gift, and I <br>
agree with you, it's certainly one of the most important parts of the <br>
whole letterboxing experience for me, too.  Regardless of how cute <br>
they are, store-bought stamps just don't reflect that individual <br>
thought, in my opinion.  But that's just my opinion and I'm sure <br>
others might think differently.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mike, I haven't had the pleasure of finding any of your boxes, but I <br>
have seen your personal stamps in other boxes and I thought they <br>
were great.  If you do your own artwork, no matter who renders the <br>
stamp, how is that not artistic?  My brother-in-law, El Lobo, <br>
designs and custom-orders some of his stamps and carves some of his <br>
others, and they are all unique pieces of art.  I think you've seen <br>
his box called "The Boys from Company K" down in Crockett County and <br>
that's a stamp worth going out of your way to see.  But if anyone <br>
wants to buy a ready-made stamp at Michaels, who is to say that is <br>
wrong?  They are playing the game, and that's what's important, IMHO.<br>

I did it that way because I had just gotten interested in letterboxing and was a bit anxious to do my first box. But then I waited a while and decided that I would enjoy it more if I made my own. So the next one that I planted I hand carved.  I have to say, I have more pride in the hand carved one (just cuz it was my first) but I feel like its all about the sport of letterboxing. A stamp is a stamp and to me anyways, its the thrill of the hunt. I firmly believe everyone is entitled to their opinion on this issue, but don't down yourself for doing it the way
 you do. I  think its great that we have people out there planting more boxes.  Either way, its ok with me. </div> <div>Monarch B<br/><br/><b><i>Mike - KD9KC &lt;mike-2007@elp.<wbr>rr.com&gt;</wbr></i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content   --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="764281419-04012007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Well - I guess my letterboxes just suck then.  I don't have the ability or the time to spend carving up a piece of rubber when I have already been over a year on an engine overhaul for my jeep that should have been done in 3 months.</font></span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="764281419-04012007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="764281419-04012007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">I do my own artwork.  I just pay someone else to make it for
