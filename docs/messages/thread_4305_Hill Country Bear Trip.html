<div>We stumbled across a winery in Pittsburg that you haven't visited. In fact, we went to one and saw another. And do you have a box at Kiepersols between Jacksonville and Tyler?

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Does anyone have a used bear trap for sale?  It doesn't have to be very big.  I've been following a rogue bear around the hill country this week, and I'm afraid he's become a wino, judging by the places he's been visiting and the erractic tracks he's leaving behind.  I'm afraid he's become irrational and that makes him dangerous, so I need to just put him out of his misery.<br/>
