<body id="compText">Thank you for sharing this bit of history, Boots and The Texans! I fear that some may have misunderstood the "rude comments", and didn't realize it was all part of the history and fun shared by the group. Hopefully, those people will also realize they are now PART of this group and are welcome to jump in and share in the fun. Puddle Splasher<br/><br/>

I'm afraid that some of you might in some way be offended by the repartee, so I want to briefly give you the background behind it. What I'm about to tell you is true: A few years ago, a mysterious new letterboxer, known only as IRA Boxer, appeared on the scene, planting boxes and finding some as well.

He quickly became obnoxious, boasting of his letterboxing skills and posting taunts at some of our letterboxing icons, especially Baby Bear. He stated that his goal was to place more boxes than said Bear. Then, as quickly as he appeared, he disappeared. After a little research, and much to my dismay, I found out that IRA Boxer was dead, found murdered in the Mercer Arboretum. I thought the story should be told, so, with the help of some of my family, I founded a group to write the true account of the event. We called ourselves The Texians and here is our account of the death of IRA Boxer (the names have been changed to protect the innocent): http://bootstex.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2007-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max=2008-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;max-results=2 http://bootstex.blogspot.com/search?updated-min=2007-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;updated-max=2008-01-01T00:00:00-08:00&amp;max-results=2 Then, the unthinkable happened: The ghost of IRA Boxer appeared and began to seek revenge for his death.
