I was not born I Texas.  But I got here as quick as I could.  <grin><br/>

<br/>
Have you ever looked at a map of the world? Look at Texas with me just for a<br/>
second. That picture, with the Panhandle and the Gulf Coast, and the Red River<br/>
and the Rio Grande is as much a part of you as anything ever will be.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as anyone anywhere in the world looks at it they know what it is.<br/>
It's Texas. Pick any kid off the street in Japan and draw him a picture of Texas<br/>
in the dirt and he'll know what it is. What happens if I show you a picture of<br/>
any other state? You might get it maybe after a second or two, but who else<br/>
would? And even if you do, does it ever stir any feelings in you?<br/>
<br/>
In every man, woman and child on this planet, there is a person who wishes just<br/>
once he could be a real live Texan and get up on a horse or ride off in a<br/>
pickup. There is a little bit of Texas in everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Did you ever hear anyone in a bar go, 'Wow...so you're from Iowa? Cool, tell me<br/>
about it?' Do you know why? Because no one gives a darn about Iowa.'<br/>
<br/>
Texas is the Alamo. Texas is 183 men standing in a church, facing thousands of<br/>
Mexican nationals, fighting for freedom, who had the chance to walk out and save<br/>
themselves, but stayed instead to fight and die for the cause of freedom.<br/>
<br/>
We send our kids to schools named William B. Travis and James Bowie and Davy<br/>
Crockett, and do you know why? Because those men saw a line in the sand and they<br/>
decided to cross it and be heroes.<br/>
<br/>
John Wayne paid to do the movie himself. That is the Spirit of Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is Sam Houston capturing Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana at San Jacinto.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is huge forests of Piney Woods like the Davy Crockett and Sam Houston<br/>
National Forests.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is breathtaking mountains in the Big Bend.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is the unparalleled beauty of bluebonnet fields in the Texas Hill Country.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is the beautiful, warm beaches of the Gulf Coast of South Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is the shiny skyscrapers in Houston and Dallas.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is world record bass from places like Lake Fork.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is Mexican foods like nowhere else, not even Mexico.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is the Fort Worth Stockyards, Bass Hall, the Ballpark in Arlington and the<br/>
Astrodome. (guess it is now the Reliant Stadium too).<br/>
<br/>
Texas is larger-than-life legends like Michael DeBakey, Ann Richards, Denton<br/>
Cooley, Willie Nelson, Buddy Holly, Gene Autry, Audie Murphy, Tommy Lee Jones,<br/>
Waylon Jennings, Farrah Fawcet, Janis Joplin, Sandra Bullock, Kris<br/>
Kristofferson, Tom Landry, Eva Longoria, Darrell Royal, ZZ Top, Eric Dickerson,<br/>
Earl Campbell, Nolan Ryan, Sam Rayburn, Howard Hughes, George H.<br/>
W. Bush, Lyndon B. Johnson, and George W. Bush, and let's not forget GEORGE<br/>
STRAIT!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Texas is great companies like Dell Computer, Texas Instruments and Compaq, Bell<br/>
Helicopter and LOCKHEED MARTIN AEROSPACE, Home of the F-16 Jet Fighter and the<br/>
JSF Fighter.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is NASA.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is huge herds of cattle and miles of crops.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is home to the most amazing sunsets of gold over an empty field.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is hundreds of deer running around neighborhoods and fields.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is skies blackened with doves and fields full of deer.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is a place where towns and cities shut down to watch the local high school<br/>
football game on Friday nights and for the Cowboys on Monday Night Football, and<br/>
for the night in Old San Antonio River Parade in San Antonio.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To drive across Texas is to drive 1/3 of the way across the United States.<br/>
<br/>
Texas is ocean beaches, deserts, lakes and rivers, mountains and prairies, and<br/>
modern cities.<br/>
<br/>
If it isn't already in Texas, you probably don't need it.<br/>
<br/>
No one does anything bigger or better than it's done in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
By federal law, Texas is the only state in the U.S. that can fly its flag at the<br/>
same height as the U.S. flag. Think about that for a second. You fly the Stars<br/>
and Stripes at 20 feet in Maryland, California, or Maine, and your state flag,<br/>
whatever it is, goes at 17 feet. You fly the Stars and Stripes in front of Klein<br/>
Oak High or anyplace else at 20 feet, the Lone Star flies at the same height -<br/>
20 feet. Do you know why? Because it is the only state that was a Republic<br/>
before it became a state.<br/>
<br/>
Also, being a Texan is as high as being an American down here. Our capitol is<br/>
the only one in the country that is taller than the capitol building in<br/>
Washington, D.C. and we can divide our state into five states at any time if we<br/>
wanted to! We can become a republic again at any time the voters of Texas<br/>
choose, and we included these things as part of the deal when we came on.<br/>
That's the best part, right there.<br/>
<br/>
Texas even has its own power grid!! And don't even lie to yourself... Did I<br/>
mention "Live music" capitol of the world?<br/>
<br/>
If you are a REAL TEXAN, you won't even need to be told to pass this on.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>

<div>I loved the essay Mike posted - when I think about those great men at the Alamo, it sends chills up my spine.  How many people in how many places have the sheer guts to stand and fight, grossly outnumbered but continuing on because they know it's right?  I just can't imagine any self-respecting Texan waving a white flag - it just wouldn't be right!</div>

definitely have to have the "Texan" attitude, along with the pride <br/>
and loyalty that comes with it.  Even if I were to move somewhere <br/>
else, I will always be a Texan, and proud of it!<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure where the Texan attitude comes from, but it was in me <br/>
even before I was old enough to know about the Alamo and all the <br/>
other things that make Texas great.  Every summer my parents would <br/>
ship us kids off to grandma's house in Nebraska, and every year I <br/>
would end up getting in fights with locals when they tried to make <br/>
fun of my accent and Texas in general.  I couldn't explain it, but it <br/>
felt like they were insulting my Mom when they insulted Texas, and <br/>
maybe they were.<br/>
<br/>
I guess all this talk about Texas would have made more sense last <br/>
month during San Jacinto Day, which unfortunately gets less coverage <br/>
than Cinco De Mayo these days, but I'm glad to hear many of y'all <br/>
feel the same way I do.  BTW, if you want to really experience the <br/>
spirit of Texas, just read some books about the Texas Rangers.  My <br/>
favorite story is about Jack Hays holding off a Comanche band of <br/>
warriors from the top of Enchanted Rock.  It gives me chills every <br/>
time I climb up there.<br/>

P.S. Though I didn't have much time in Midland during our Spring <br/>
Break Trip, I did make time to find The Home Run Letterbox, and very <br/>
glad that I did.<br/>

Every summer my parents would <br/>ship us kids off to grandma's house in Nebraska, and every year I <br/>would end up getting in fights with locals when they tried to make <br/>fun of my accent and Texas in general.

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Have you ever looked at a map of the world? Look at Texas with me <br/>
just for a<br/>
&gt;   second. That picture, with the Panhandle and the Gulf Coast, and <br/>
the Red River<br/>
&gt;   and the Rio Grande is as much a part of you as anything ever will <br/>
be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   As soon as anyone anywhere in the world looks at it they know <br/>
what it is.<br/>
&gt;   It's Texas. Pick any kid off the street in Japan and draw him a <br/>
picture of Texas<br/>
&gt;   in the dirt and he'll know what it is. What happens if I show you <br/>
a picture of<br/>
&gt;   any other state? You might get it maybe after a second or two, <br/>
but who else<br/>
&gt;   would? And even if you do, does it ever stir any feelings in you?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   In every man, woman and child on this planet, there is a person <br/>
who wishes just<br/>
&gt;   once he could be a real live Texan and get up on a horse or ride <br/>
off in a<br/>
&gt;   pickup. There is a little bit of Texas in everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Did you ever hear anyone in a bar go, 'Wow...so you're from Iowa? <br/>
Cool, tell me<br/>
&gt;   about it?' Do you know why? Because no one gives a darn about <br/>
Iowa.'<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is the Alamo. Texas is 183 men standing in a church, facing <br/>
thousands of<br/>
&gt;   Mexican nationals, fighting for freedom, who had the chance to <br/>
walk out and save<br/>
&gt;   themselves, but stayed instead to fight and die for the cause of <br/>
freedom.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   We send our kids to schools named William B. Travis and James <br/>
Bowie and Davy<br/>
&gt;   Crockett, and do you know why? Because those men saw a line in <br/>
the sand and they<br/>
&gt;   decided to cross it and be heroes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   John Wayne paid to do the movie himself. That is the Spirit of <br/>
Texas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is Sam Houston capturing Antonio Lopez de Santa Ana at San <br/>
Jacinto.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is huge forests of Piney Woods like the Davy Crockett and <br/>
Sam Houston<br/>
&gt;   National Forests.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is breathtaking mountains in the Big Bend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is the unparalleled beauty of bluebonnet fields in the <br/>
Texas Hill Country.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is the beautiful, warm beaches of the Gulf Coast of South <br/>
Texas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is the shiny skyscrapers in Houston and Dallas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is world record bass from places like Lake Fork.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is Mexican foods like nowhere else, not even Mexico.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is the Fort Worth Stockyards, Bass Hall, the Ballpark in <br/>
Arlington and the<br/>
&gt;   Astrodome. (guess it is now the Reliant Stadium too).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is larger-than-life legends like Michael DeBakey, Ann <br/>
Richards, Denton<br/>
&gt;   Cooley, Willie Nelson, Buddy Holly, Gene Autry, Audie Murphy, <br/>
Tommy Lee Jones,<br/>
&gt;   Waylon Jennings, Farrah Fawcet, Janis Joplin, Sandra Bullock, Kris<br/>
&gt;   Kristofferson, Tom Landry, Eva Longoria, Darrell Royal, ZZ Top, <br/>
Eric Dickerson,<br/>
&gt;   Earl Campbell, Nolan Ryan, Sam Rayburn, Howard Hughes, George H.<br/>
&gt;   W. Bush, Lyndon B. Johnson, and George W. Bush, and let's not <br/>
forget GEORGE<br/>
&gt;   STRAIT!!!!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is great companies like Dell Computer, Texas Instruments <br/>
and Compaq, Bell<br/>
&gt;   Helicopter and LOCKHEED MARTIN AEROSPACE, Home of the F-16 Jet <br/>
Fighter and the<br/>
&gt;   JSF Fighter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is NASA.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is huge herds of cattle and miles of crops.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is home to the most amazing sunsets of gold over an empty <br/>
field.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is hundreds of deer running around neighborhoods and fields.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is skies blackened with doves and fields full of deer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is a place where towns and cities shut down to watch the <br/>
local high school<br/>
&gt;   football game on Friday nights and for the Cowboys on Monday <br/>
Night Football, and<br/>
&gt;   for the night in Old San Antonio River Parade in San Antonio.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   To drive across Texas is to drive 1/3 of the way across the <br/>
United States.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas is ocean beaches, deserts, lakes and rivers, mountains and <br/>
prairies, and<br/>
&gt;   modern cities.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If it isn't already in Texas, you probably don't need it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   No one does anything bigger or better than it's done in Texas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   By federal law, Texas is the only state in the U.S. that can fly <br/>
its flag at the<br/>
&gt;   same height as the U.S. flag. Think about that for a second. You <br/>
fly the Stars<br/>
&gt;   and Stripes at 20 feet in Maryland, California, or Maine, and <br/>
your state flag,<br/>
&gt;   whatever it is, goes at 17 feet. You fly the Stars and Stripes in <br/>
front of Klein<br/>
&gt;   Oak High or anyplace else at 20 feet, the Lone Star flies at the <br/>
same height -<br/>
&gt;   20 feet. Do you know why? Because it is the only state that was a <br/>
Republic<br/>
&gt;   before it became a state.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Also, being a Texan is as high as being an American down here. <br/>
Our capitol is<br/>
&gt;   the only one in the country that is taller than the capitol <br/>
building in<br/>
&gt;   Washington, D.C. and we can divide our state into five states at <br/>
any time if we<br/>
&gt;   wanted to! We can become a republic again at any time the voters <br/>
of Texas<br/>
&gt;   choose, and we included these things as part of the deal when we <br/>
came on.<br/>
&gt;   That's the best part, right there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Texas even has its own power grid!! And don't even lie to <br/>
yourself... Did I<br/>
&gt;   mention "Live music" capitol of the world?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   If you are a REAL TEXAN, you won't even need to be told to pass <br/>
this on.<br/>

  foods like nowhere else, not even Mexico.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the Fort 
  Worth Stockyards, Bass Hall, the Ballpark in <br/>Arlington and the<br/>&gt; 
  Astrodome. (guess it is now the Reliant Stadium too).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas 
  is larger-than-<wbr/>life legends like Michael DeBakey, Ann <br/>Richards, 
  Denton<br/>&gt; Cooley, Willie Nelson, Buddy Holly, Gene Autry, Audie Murphy, 
  <br/>Tommy Lee Jones,<br/>&gt; Waylon Jennings, Farrah Fawcet, Janis Joplin,

  Rayburn, Howard Hughes, George H.<br/>&gt; W. Bush, Lyndon B. Johnson, and 
  George W. Bush, and let's not <br/>forget GEORGE<br/>&gt; 
  STRAIT!!!!!!<wbr/>!!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is great companies like Dell 
  Computer, Texas Instruments <br/>and Compaq, Bell<br/>&gt; Helicopter and 
  LOCKHEED MARTIN AEROSPACE, Home of the F-16 Jet <br/>Fighter and the<br/>&gt; 
  JSF Fighter.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is NASA.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is huge 
  herds of cattle and miles of crops.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is home to the most 
  amazing sunsets of gold over an empty <br/>field.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is 
  hundreds of deer running around neighborhoods and fields.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Texas is skies blackened with doves and fields full of deer.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Texas is a place where towns and cities shut down to watch the <br/>local high 
  school<br/>&gt; football game on Friday nights and for the Cowboys on Monday 
  <br/>Night Football, and<br/>&gt; for the night in Old San Antonio River Parade 
  in San Antonio.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To drive across Texas is to drive 1/3 of the 
  way across the <br/>United States.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is ocean beaches, 
  deserts, lakes and rivers, mountains and <br/>prairies, and<br/>&gt; modern 
  cities.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If it isn't already in Texas, you probably don't need 
  it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; No one does anything bigger or better than it's done in 
  Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; By federal law, Texas is the only state in the U.S. 
  that can fly <br/>its flag at the<br/>&gt; same height as the U.S. flag. Think 
  about that for a second. You <br/>fly the Stars<br/>&gt; and Stripes at 20 feet 
  in Maryland, California, or Maine, and <br/>your state flag,<br/>&gt; whatever 
  it is, goes at 17 feet. You fly the Stars and Stripes in <br/>front of 
  Klein<br/>&gt; Oak High or anyplace else at 20 feet, the Lone Star flies at the 
  <br/>same height -<br/>&gt; 20 feet. Do you know why? Because it is the only 
  state that was a <br/>Republic<br/>&gt; before it became a state.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Also, being a Texan is as high as being an American down here. 
  <br/>Our capitol is<br/>&gt; the only one in the country that is taller than the 
  capitol <br/>building in<br/>&gt; Washington, D.C. and we can divide our state 
  into five states at <br/>any time if we<br/>&gt; wanted to! We can become a 
  republic again at any time the voters <br/>of Texas<br/>&gt; choose, and we 
  included these things as part of the deal when we <br/>came on.<br/>&gt; That's 
  the best part, right there.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas even has its own power 
  grid!! And don't even lie to <br/>yourself... Did I<br/>&gt; mention "Live 
  music" capitol of the world?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If you are a REAL TEXAN, you 
  won't even need to be told to pass <br/>this on.<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

<div>We're not too courteous in Dallas either. It must be a city thing. I've told my husband there are two rules for driving in Dallas. Don't use your turn signal because if you let people know what you're about to do, they won't let you do it; and don't use your rearview mirror: just cut people off. Of course I'm kidding, but.... <em>not really.</em>  I do love it when we get out of the city and people are courteous. Reminds me of when I was a kid! Sad, huh?</div>

Because no one gives a darn about <br/>Iowa.'<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the Alamo. Texas is 183 men standing in a church, facing <br/>thousands of<br/>&gt; Mexican nationals, fighting for freedom, who had the chance to <br/>walk out and save<br/>&gt; themselves, but stayed instead to fight and die for the cause of <br/>freedom.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We send our kids to schools named William B.

<div>
<div>Being a native Texan, I think it is great that some non-natives 
            "get <br/>it". I don't think you have to be born here to be a Texan, 
            but you <br/>definitely have to have the "Texan" attitude, along with 
            the pride <br/>and loyalty that comes with it. Even if I were to move 
            somewhere <br/>else, I will always be a Texan, and proud of 
            it!<br/><br/>I'm not sure where the Texan attitude comes from, but it 
            was in me <br/>even before I was old enough to know about the Alamo 
            and all the <br/>other things that make Texas great. Every summer my 
            parents would <br/>ship us kids off to grandma's house in Nebraska, 
            and every year I <br/>would end up getting in fights with locals when 
            they tried to make <br/>fun of my accent and Texas in general. I 
            couldn't explain it, but it <br/>felt like they were insulting my Mom 
            when they insulted Texas, and <br/>maybe they were.<br/><br/>I guess

            during San Jacinto Day, which unfortunately gets less coverage 
            <br/>than Cinco De Mayo these days, but I'm glad to hear many of

            experience the <br/>spirit of Texas, just read some books about the 
            Texas Rangers. My <br/>favorite story is about Jack Hays holding off 
            a Comanche band of <br/>warriors from the top of Enchanted Rock. It

  - KD9KC.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Have you ever looked at a map of the world? Look at 
  Texas with me <br/>just for a<br/>&gt; second. That picture, with the Panhandle 
  and the Gulf Coast, and <br/>the Red River<br/>&gt; and the Rio Grande is as 
  much a part of you as anything ever will <br/>be.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As soon as 
  anyone anywhere in the world looks at it they know <br/>what it is.<br/>&gt; 
  It's Texas. Pick any kid off the street in Japan and draw him a <br/>picture of 
  Texas<br/>&gt; in the dirt and he'll know what it is. What happens if I show 
  you <br/>a picture of<br/>&gt; any other state? You might get it maybe after a 
  second or two, <br/>but who else<br/>&gt; would? And even if you do, does it 
  ever stir any feelings in you?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In every man, woman and child 
  on this planet, there is a person <br/>who wishes just<br/>&gt; once he could be 
  a real live Texan and get up on a horse or ride <br/>off in a<br/>&gt; pickup. 
  There is a little bit of Texas in everyone.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Did you ever hear 
  anyone in a bar go, 'Wow...so you're from Iowa? <br/>Cool, tell me<br/>&gt; 
  about it?' Do you know why? Because no one gives a darn about 
  <br/>Iowa.'<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the Alamo. Texas is 183 men standing in a 
  church, facing <br/>thousands of<br/>&gt; Mexican nationals, fighting for 
  freedom, who had the chance to <br/>walk out and save<br/>&gt; themselves, but 
  stayed instead to fight and die for the cause of <br/>freedom.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  We send our kids to schools named William B. Travis and James <br/>Bowie and 
  Davy<br/>&gt; Crockett, and do you know why? Because those men saw a line in 
  <br/>the sand and they<br/>&gt; decided to cross it and be heroes.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; John Wayne paid to do the movie himself. That is the Spirit of 
  <br/>Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is Sam Houston capturing Antonio Lopez de 
  Santa Ana at San <br/>Jacinto.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is huge forests of Piney 
  Woods like the Davy Crockett and <br/>Sam Houston<br/>&gt; National 
  Forests.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is breathtaking mountains in the Big 
  Bend.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the unparalleled beauty of bluebonnet fields 
  in the <br/>Texas Hill Country.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the beautiful, warm 
  beaches of the Gulf Coast of South <br/>Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the 
  shiny skyscrapers in Houston and Dallas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is world 
  record bass from places like Lake Fork.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is Mexican 
  foods like nowhere else, not even Mexico.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is the Fort 
  Worth Stockyards, Bass Hall, the Ballpark in <br/>Arlington and the<br/>&gt; 
  Astrodome. (guess it is now the Reliant Stadium too).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas 
  is larger-than-life legends like Michael DeBakey, Ann <br/>Richards, 
  Denton<br/>&gt; Cooley, Willie Nelson, Buddy Holly, Gene Autry, Audie Murphy, 
  <br/>Tommy Lee Jones,<br/>&gt; Waylon Jennings, Farrah Fawcet, Janis Joplin, 
  Sandra Bullock, Kris<br/>&gt; Kristofferson, Tom Landry, Eva Longoria, Darrell 
  Royal, ZZ Top, <br/>Eric Dickerson,<br/>&gt; Earl Campbell, Nolan Ryan, Sam 
  Rayburn, Howard Hughes, George H.<br/>&gt; W. Bush, Lyndon B. Johnson, and 
  George W. Bush, and let's not <br/>forget GEORGE<br/>&gt; 
  STRAIT!!!!!!!!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is great companies like Dell 
  Computer, Texas Instruments <br/>and Compaq, Bell<br/>&gt; Helicopter and 
  LOCKHEED MARTIN AEROSPACE, Home of the F-16 Jet <br/>Fighter and the<br/>&gt; 
  JSF Fighter.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is NASA.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is huge 
  herds of cattle and miles of crops.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is home to the most 
  amazing sunsets of gold over an empty <br/>field.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is 
  hundreds of deer running around neighborhoods and fields.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Texas is skies blackened with doves and fields full of deer.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Texas is a place where towns and cities shut down to watch the <br/>local high 
  school<br/>&gt; football game on Friday nights and for the Cowboys on Monday 
  <br/>Night Football, and<br/>&gt; for the night in Old San Antonio River Parade 
  in San Antonio.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To drive across Texas is to drive 1/3 of the 
  way across the <br/>United States.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas is ocean beaches, 
  deserts, lakes and rivers, mountains and <br/>prairies, and<br/>&gt; modern 
  cities.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If it isn't already in Texas, you probably don't need 
  it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; No one does anything bigger or better than it's done in 
  Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; By federal law, Texas is the only state in the U.S. 
  that can fly <br/>its flag at the<br/>&gt; same height as the U.S. flag. Think 
  about that for a second. You <br/>fly the Stars<br/>&gt; and Stripes at 20 feet 
  in Maryland, California, or Maine, and <br/>your state flag,<br/>&gt; whatever 
  it is, goes at 17 feet. You fly the Stars and Stripes in <br/>front of 
  Klein<br/>&gt; Oak High or anyplace else at 20 feet, the Lone Star flies at the 
  <br/>same height -<br/>&gt; 20 feet. Do you know why? Because it is the only 
  state that was a <br/>Republic<br/>&gt; before it became a state.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Also, being a Texan is as high as being an American down here. 
  <br/>Our capitol is<br/>&gt; the only one in the country that is taller than the 
  capitol <br/>building in<br/>&gt; Washington, D.C. and we can divide our state 
  into five states at <br/>any time if we<br/>&gt; wanted to! We can become a 
  republic again at any time the voters <br/>of Texas<br/>&gt; choose, and we 
  included these things as part of the deal when we <br/>came on.<br/>&gt; That's 
  the best part, right there.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Texas even has its own power 
  grid!! And don't even lie to <br/>yourself... Did I<br/>&gt; mention "Live 
  music" capitol of the world?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If you are a REAL TEXAN, you 
  won't even need to be told to pass <br/>this on.<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div></div></div></blockquote>

Now that is funny. When Curt retired from the Air Force and we were <br/>
moving home to Texas, we got into Dallas during rush hour and I was <br/>
driving my car pulling a 25' sailboat. Undaunted, I drove right up I-35 <br/>
through downtown. I noticed a police car tailing me for awhile, and <br/>
finally the lady cop pulled up beside me and motioned for me to speed <br/>
up and said over her speaker, "keep up with the traffic". I looked at <br/>
my speedometer and was already going about 5 miles over the speed <br/>
limit, but since I was getting passed, I sped up. Of course, now I <br/>
realize that anytime the traffic is actually moving on the freeways, <br/>
take advantage of it! Yep; I had a big smile on my face as I <br/>
thought,"I'm so glad to be HOME!"<br/>

<p>My Fellow Letterboxers, <br/><br/>Saying a fond farewell to the VW Microbus, I boarded an early morning flight for the great state of Texas. Texas - the land of big hair, big hats, and big cars. Not having big hair or a big hat, I went for the big car and rented a brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar. <br/>
<br/>Exploring the sights, I drove down to South Padre Island just in time for the Annual Sand Castle Days. I arrived in the middle of a most perplexing mystery. Seems the faces kept disappearing off of the sculptures. Didn't take me long to solve the crime. Sorry, Safari Man, you should have been a bit more discreet, not to mention on the ball. The Missing Store of Good Manners was already solved, and I don't believe those innocent sculptures were doing any accusing. The show was now able to continue, much to the relief of the sponsors, and all had a good time. <br/>
<br/>Los Colores del Muerto Annual Day of the Dead Celebration in Port Isabel was an event not to be missed. Food, drink, music, decorations, alters, all to welcome the dead home for a few brief hours. Not wanting revenge from my esteemed forefathers, I purchased the best sweets and breads for their arrival. They must have been pleased as I live to tell the tale. <br/>
<br/>It only makes sense that Texas, being the land of big cowboys, is where The World Championship Ranch Rodeo can be found.

It is not easy to milk a wild cow. The Thompson Ranch boys showed how to do it right, taking the event winner prize home with them. But, I did not come here to talk about sand, the dead or milk; I came to talk letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>Letterboxes in Texas; yup, they got um. Lot and lots of them; as of this writing about 1,800. But, Texas, just where are your mystery boxes? I hope you aren't considering 70's in the big numbers. For a state that does things in a big way, you are sadly lacking. The good news is Texans know their containers. Mostly lock n locks out there. Thumbs down on those still using the cheap containers. When hiding boxes, might be a good idea to make sure your coverage won't fly away; doesn't seem to be a lot of rocks in the area.

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My Fellow Letterboxers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Saying a fond farewell to the VW Microbus, I boarded an early morning flight<br/>
&gt; for the great state of Texas. Texas - the land of big hair, big hats, and<br/>
&gt; big cars. Not having big hair or a big hat, I went for the big car and<br/>
&gt; rented a brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Exploring the sights, I drove down to South Padre Island just in time for<br/>
&gt; the Annual Sand Castle Days. I arrived in the middle of a most perplexing<br/>
&gt; mystery. Seems the faces kept disappearing off of the sculptures. Didn't<br/>
&gt; take me long to solve the crime. Sorry, Safari Man, you should have been a<br/>
&gt; bit more discreet, not to mention on the ball. The Missing Store of Good<br/>
&gt; Manners was already solved, and I don't believe those innocent sculptures<br/>
&gt; were doing any accusing. The show was now able to continue, much to the<br/>
&gt; relief of the sponsors, and all had a good time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Los Colores del Muerto Annual Day of the Dead Celebration in Port Isabel was<br/>
&gt; an event not to be missed. Food, drink, music, decorations, alters, all to<br/>
&gt; welcome the dead home for a few brief hours. Not wanting revenge from my<br/>
&gt; esteemed forefathers, I purchased the best sweets and breads for their<br/>
&gt; arrival. They must have been pleased as I live to tell the tale.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It only makes sense that Texas, being the land of big cowboys, is where The<br/>
&gt; World Championship Ranch Rodeo can be found. Packing up the brand new shiny<br/>
&gt; silver Lincoln Towncar, I headed for Amarillo. This rodeo is the real McCoy.<br/>
&gt; Not weekend pretend cowboys, but rather the real down on the ranch working<br/>
&gt; variety. It is not easy to milk a wild cow. The Thompson Ranch boys showed<br/>
&gt; how to do it right, taking the event winner prize home with them. But, I did<br/>
&gt; not come here to talk about sand, the dead or milk; I came to talk<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Letterboxes in Texas; yup, they got um. Lot and lots of them; as of this<br/>
&gt; writing about 1,800. But, Texas, just where are your mystery boxes? I hope<br/>
&gt; you aren't considering 70's in the big numbers. For a state that does things<br/>
&gt; in a big way, you are sadly lacking. The good news is Texans know their<br/>
&gt; containers. Mostly lock n locks out there. Thumbs down on those still using<br/>
&gt; the cheap containers. When hiding boxes, might be a good idea to make sure<br/>
&gt; your coverage won't fly away; doesn't seem to be a lot of rocks in the area.<br/>
&gt; Watch where you're putting your hands; rattlers don't like being disturbed<br/>
&gt; anymore than I do.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sincerely,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Investigator Francis Bacon<br/>

<br/>THEN, in 2007 Miss Emily Post found that the Store of Good Manners had gone missing, and she hired Investigator Bacon to investigate. I would have expected her to have better sense than DMS, but Bacon apparently convinced her he had a wealth of experience solving letterboxing-related crimes. Bacon once again began accusing, resorting to some of the same culprits as during the PZ Caper, and throwing in a few more. I was seriously beginning to worry that I was going to be wrongly convicted of the crime, but thankfully Silver Eagle came to my rescue and defended my innocence successfully. Once again, the crime was solved to Ms. Emily's satisfaction. <br/>
<br/>Finally, late last week I believe, the Inspector showed up on the scene again, seemingly offering a letterboxing travelogue, beginning in Hawaii and traveling to North Carolina and Utah and New Mexico. I confronted him and asked him what he was snooping around for, but he wouldn't tell. He went so far as to antagonize me by implying I stole a sock off some statue at some sculpture garden in Utah, but I think I convinced him that the sock belonged to me in the first place. I told him he couldn't solve a real crime if he tried, and I cited the mystery of the murder of IRA Boxer as an example. He was apparently very familiar with that crime, but he didn't dare claim bragging rights for the solution.<br/>
<br/>Anyway, I've been keeping an eye on him as he flitted around the country, and what I was afraid would happen has indeed happened, and he has landed himself in Texas. Since the Bus and the Circus are sort of our national treasures, I think we should be very concerned about their welfare. On the other hand, maybe we could be so lucky as to send Ira's ghost and that evil clown off with him as he travels along. <br/>
<br/>You know, it just occurred to me - he may have had something to do with the disappearance of the first tour bus...hmmm.<br/><br/>Really though, Puddle Splasher, you should really keep better up to date on current events. <br/>

Inspector Gadget! I do believe I am much more handsome than he is. Not to mention, I don't wear a silly hat. <br/>
<br/>
Your valuables are safe with me. I find objects that are lost, not lose them. You, of all letterboxers, should have discovered this. Must I remind you of your missing sock?<br/>
<br/>
How good are you with dates? Must I also remind you that I was in the great state of Texas way back in October of 2007? Yes, you have increased the number of your letterboxers since that time. Now you are up to approximately 3,387. It saddens me to point out that your mystery boxes have not increased proportionately. So therefore, my dear shoeless one, you may inform the notable Boots Tex that my counting skills are not deficient. I only wish I could say the same as to your labeling skills. <br/>
