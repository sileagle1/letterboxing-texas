over there that we haven't found, including three brand new ones<br>
planted last week by Atoy Adventurers!  Lightning and I made plans on<br>
Friday to go visit my mother on Saturday and sell her some scout<br>
popcorn and take her boxing for a bit.<br>
<br>
We had good intentions of getting out the door and off to Nac about 7<br>
a.m., but our cat conspired with himself to keep us down by greeting<br>
us yesterday morning with an injured leg (infected cat bite) that<br>
required a vet visit and resulting vet bill.  That in itself was an<br>
adventure since the cat himself is NOT a traveler (either on rubber or<br>
in person, but wait - I guess he IS the subject of one of SJZ's<br>
Hitchhikers!) and can barely make the trip a mile away to the vet's<br>
office without destroying the car and everything and everyone in it.<br>
Our pet carrier has been loanded out, so Lightning and I put on long<br>
sleeves and long pants and shuttled the cat into the car - I put him<br>
and Lightning in on one side and went around to the driver's side to<br>
get in, to find that he had already escaped from Lightning and had<br>
positioned himself on the floor of the car to bolt out when I opened<br>
my door.  We went through this scenario a couple more times while I<br>
thought to myself that any cat that can move that fast with an injured<br>
leg probably really doesn't need to go to the vet, but I realized he<br>
would only be worse if we waited so I set those thoughts aside and<br>
contemplated the possibility that he was hopped up on PCP and able to<br>
do amazing feats despite the injury.  Once we finally trapped him in<br>
the car, he yowled mournfully as we got going.  It's really hard to<br>
feel sorry for a cat that cries pitifully that soon after putting us<br>
through our paces.  It's even more difficult to feel sorry for a cat<br>
that tries to climb over the back of my head while I'm driving HIM to<br>
HIS doctor and then digs his claws in as I make a turn at an<br>
inopportune moment.  We got to the vet's office and I went in to scout<br>
out the lobby for dogs, cats, birds, mice, and other possible threats<br>
to tranquility.  After the ride, I almost hoped there would be a big<br>
ol' dog in there to terrorize him, but the lobby was empty.  Five<br>
minutes and $65 later, we began our return journey.  Thankfully, as<br>
big a jerk as the cat had been on our departure, he was just as big a<br>
wimp on our return trip.  We took him out and dumped him in the house,<br>
I threw some sand in a plastic tray and called it a litter box and<br>
finally, finally Lightning and I were on our way - 2 hours after our<br>
intended departure.<br>
<br>
Once on the road, I called my mother to tell her we were on our way.<br>
She's a very organized person who stays on schedule.  I figured she<br>
would want to know that we were running late.  She told me she was<br>
surprised we had left that early.  Her sig stamp is a cat.<br>
<br>
We finally got to Nac and Lightning did his popcorn sales pitch and we<br>
headed out.  This whole time I had a vision of Gryzzled Gryphon<br>
stamping in to the new boxes in Nac just ahead of us because he<br>
doesn't own a cat.<br>
<br>
We went to the SFA campus and parked - it was a perfectly perfect day<br>
for letterboxing!  We quickly found the first two of Atoy Adventurers<br>
boxes - nice hides on the campus.  If you've never been to SFA, it's a<br>
lovely campus - full of old and new.  The new is nice, but frankly, I<br>
love the old buildings, even if they are a little run down.  They are<br>
doing a great job of renovating those old buildings without destroying<br>
the feel of history though.  We were a little concerned while we were<br>
stamping in to the Charlotte's Web box - we heard screams coming from<br>
inside the building.  We figure either the building is haunted or they<br>
were rehearsing for a new play.  Either is likely.  While on campus,<br>
we stopped by and checked on my Go Jacks! box.  She had not yet found<br>
it, so I let her search for it while I hung out.  I was suprised she<br>
hadn't gone to find it, living as she does in Nac and the fact that it<br>
is a tribute to my dad.  She explained though that she didn't ever<br>
feel the circumstance was right for being stealthy.  I realized<br>
finally that her definition of stealthy is not being seen, whereas my<br>
definition of stealthy is not being noticed.  I explained to her that<br>
she should just try to make it appear that she was doing something<br>
normal people do every day, and that her being in a particular place<br>
shouldn't seem odd or unusual.  I thought I was gonna die laughing as<br>
I watched her trying to be casually nonchalant about approaching the<br>
box.  I finally realized that in lieu of her being casual, I should be<br>
her lookout to make sure no one saw her, and to be ready to create a<br>
diversion in case someone approached.  I can't help wondering what she<br>
would've thought if I had launched into my hysterical female act.<br>
<br>
In a desire to be three for three first finders, we headed downtown to<br>
find their third new box.  Cocky finders that we were, we KNEW exactly<br>
where it would be.  But it wasn't.  We re-read the clues and realized<br>
we weren't even at the right starting place.  Hmph.  We went inside to<br>
see if we could figure out the right place, tried one other place, but<br>
we weren't right on that count either.  By then it was almost<br>
lunchtime and my stepdad was expecting us back at the house.  He had<br>
fixed Kabobs for lunch and we surely didn't want to keep them waiting!<br>
 We rationalized that we would leave the third box for someone else to<br>
be FF.<br>
<br>
After a great lunch and a little ribbing of my very frugal stepfather<br>
who had splurged on a wide flat panel TV recently, we headed out the<br>
door again, this time leaving Lightning behind.  He stayed on the<br>
premise of watching college football with my stepdad, but I think he<br>
really sat staring at the TV imagining what it would look like with<br>
Game Cube running on it.<br>
<br>
We went and found Ashby's Krewe d'etat in a park very near my mother's<br>
house.  She had no idea there was anything more than a pool in that<br>
park, so she was enthused to find a real nice trail there.  She and my<br>
stepdad walk every day, sometimes twice a day (he recently had back<br>
surgery, so walking is part of his PT), and while they walk a lot on<br>
Lanana Trail, they are always glad for new places to walk, and this<br>
one was just a block or two from home!<br>
<br>
We were about out of time at that point, so we were going over to<br>
where I would find her box.  In that very same area is Random's NYC<br>
box, so we went and found that one too.  When you box with a kid, it's<br>
easy to explain being in weird places.  When you box with a SSI-aged<br>
woman, it's a lot harder to explain why you are sitting up a hill<br>
amongst a bunch of weeds and briars under a railroad trestle.  Again,<br>
I was ready with my hysterical female act.  I thought that maybe I<br>
should warn her, but decided it would be just as much fun seeing her<br>
reaction as it would be to scare the pants off anyone who thought to<br>
be curious about us.<br>
<br>
After climbing down from the trestle, we bopped along the trail toward<br>
her box, Happy Trails to You, and rounded the corner where I figured<br>
it would be - and promptly stopped in my tracks.  There was a HUGE bog<br>
between me and the box!  They had recently received 5" of rain and all<br>
of it seemed to have collected in that one place!  The only way in to<br>
the box was to go up along the tracks and then down a steep rocky hill<br>
and I decided I would wait to find it.  She was concerned she might<br>
she rehide it, but I told her to wait and watch to see how it<br>
progresses through the winter.  We took a look around and there were<br>
no high water marks on trees at the same level the box was, so the box<br>
itself is likely safe, just may not be accessible.<br>
<br>
By then, Lightning and I had to head home, so I went and collected him<br>
and headed out, leaving behind a bunch of boxes STILL unfound by us!<br>
The good news on that front is that we have to deliver popcorn to Nac<br>
the first week of December, so we'll be back again soon.<br>
