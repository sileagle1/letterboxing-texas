                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got a very interesting email today from some new letterboxers who <br>
were in Rusk State Park to find their first letterboxes.  They had <br>
the clues to my box "General Sherman" and were on the way to find it <br>
when they saw a plastic box laying beside the railroad track.  It <br>
was "General Sherman".  They picked it up and stamped it and went to <br>
put it back where the clues said it should be, and there was already <br>
a box there.  They had found the old "missing" box and the <br>
replacement box was still in place right where it should have been.  <br>
They stamped into the new box as well, and emailed me to offer to <br>
mail the old box to me.  I have a feeling this family will make <br>
great letterboxers.  When I answered their email to thank them, this <br>
is the note I got back:<br>
<br>
"This was actually our first experience trying to find any <br>
letterboxes. We were camping at Rusk state park and 2 of my kids and <br>
myself tried to find two different boxes near the depot the night <br>
before and had no luck. My husband and I were up early the next <br>
morning and I decided to look for your box before the kids got up as <br>
I didn't want them to be disappointed again. Since we were already <br>
in the camp ground I figured we could pick up the trail somewhere in <br>
the middle of your clues (turn left onto the tracks at the crossing) <br>
so we were walking along the tracks and passed the first crossing, I <br>
was busy looking to the left and my husband (who had no clue what we <br>
were looking for and was seeming to be having a hard time grasping <br>
the concept of letterboxing) said "what is that over there." The box <br>
was just lying beside the track on the right not too far before the <br>
second crossing. I was going to dismiss his find as that could not <br>
possibly be the box we were looking for but he went and picked it <br>
up. Sure enough it was a letterbox.  We decided to try to put it <br>
where it belonged and went to where the nature trail enters the <br>
campground and followed the directions. When my husband went to put <br>
it under the rail he couldn't and thus we found the new box. It was <br>
exciting to actually find a box! When the kids got up we followed <br>
the directions and let them find the box. We told them our story and <br>
they decided we should stamp both books so we did. I am happy to <br>
mail your box to you on me as a thank you for the time and effort <br>
you take to make the world a fun place!"<br>
<br>
I thought that was pretty neat.<br>
