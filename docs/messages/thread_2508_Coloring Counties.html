                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, since most people would prefer to see a map of our progess, I <br>
have created one and added it to the Files (lb_counties_map.jpg) and <br>
deleted the Word document.  It shows counties colored in green that <br>
had boxes as of 12/12/06 (the date the webmasters last updated the TX <br>
clue map with my updates), and counties colored in cyan for boxes <br>
added since then.  I will try to keep the map updated and to notify <br>
Choi periodically to have him update the TX clue map.  I will need <br>
your help, though.  If you place a box in a virgin county or notice <br>
one that should be colored cyan that I missed, please notify me or <br>
post to this list with a Subject of "Color Me Please".  I will then <br>
update and upload a new map as soon as I can.<br>
<br>
Now for a few things I need to mention.  First of all, I will only be <br>
coloring in counties that have boxes with clues in LBNA with the <br>
correct county posted.  This means if a box is on AQ but not on LBNA, <br>
it won't count, since it is an LBNA map that we are trying to fill in <br>
and AQ doesn't deal with counties anyway.  It also means that mystery <br>
boxes that don't show the county will not be colored.  This applies <br>
to any WOM boxes, too.  You could post a WOM box clue with the county <br>
and just have people email for clues if you want it to count.  <br>
Second, some counties (e.g. Shackelford) have a box that is listed as <br>
missing, so are not colored.  Other counties (e.g. Liberty) have a <br>
box that is also missing but is not listed that way, so it is <br>
colored.  To keep it simple, counties not currently colored will need <br>
at least one box placed in them before they are colored, and no <br>
counties will be uncolored if a box goes missing in the future.<br>
<br>
Remember, this is just for fun and not a contest, so please don't <br>
feel any pressure to color all the counties in your Region before <br>
others.  So place when you can and enjoy watching our progress!<br>
