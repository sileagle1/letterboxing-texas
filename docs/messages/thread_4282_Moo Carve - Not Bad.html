                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went ahead and bought a small sample (2.5"x2.5"x.75")of this new carving medium and tried it out tonight.  With a 40% off coupon it was about $1.30 at Hobby Lobby.  It carves about like Master Carve but might be a little more crumbly.  It comes in bigger sizes and is thicker than Master Carve, but is cheaper.  The Pink stuff is cheaper than both and is much thinner, so I still prefer it.  Anyway, it might be worth a try if you can find it, especially if you plan to carve a cow :)  <br/>
