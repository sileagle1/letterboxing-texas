Round two...<br/>
Anything related to politics/government/anywhere in<br/>
that rhealm = political. When people don't agree = it<br/>
becomes a political issue. Schpladow! &lt;- That'd be a<br/>
great name for a box!<br/>
<br/>
C.<br/>
I really like LBNA for the many boxes and searches you<br/>
can do. But it's slow.<br/>
I like AQ for many reasons, but there are fewer boxes<br/>
and under "logbook" is where it puts your placed boxes<br/>
- only. I'd think it would have PFXEtc counts. I'd<br/>
never heard of the F1 thing. So I'm not going to check<br/>
that google thing anymore. <br/>
<br/>
So... buttons.<br/>
<br/>
There's that.<br/>
Lena - Strawberry6703<br/>
PS: I can never find myself as another name. I don't<br/>
know, it's like my name is lena, this is who i am. my<br/>
trailname doesn't do that. hm. Any opines there?<br/>
