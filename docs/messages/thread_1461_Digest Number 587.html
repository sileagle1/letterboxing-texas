<div>... and RT's response that Dr. Puddle Splasher is a quack - these made my 
day (I've always known it!).  Seriously, Lucy, glad your daughter's 
situation is going to be OK, and hope you'll enjoy your visit to our area!  
If I can meet you somewhere on the trail doing some R&amp;R, I'll be happy to do 
so!  Hope you'll find your way a little to the west of Dallas, too - 
Heritage Park in Grapevine is an especially pretty location, among others.

LSS - we don't have to worry about taking PRACTICAL<br>
routes!  Woohoo!<br>
