I thought it was just a latent memory of the fire that killed me, but I now realize it is because people are talking about me on this List.

I recently found his letterbox near my haunt and I was so flattered that I just had to email him.

<br/>
Since finding the letterbox dedicated to me, I have researched this fascinating hobby and am pleasantly surprised how many boxes are in cemeteries.  I will have to notify my friends to check them out and give a big welcome next time you visit.  In fact, several of my friends are just like some of you on this List, but with different nicknames.  There is the lady ghost in the Dallas area that appears sweet and innocent, but has a mischievous soul.  Whenever we decide to go anywhere she just has to get there first, and because she likes to splash dogs that visit her grave, we call her Poodle Splasher.  In East Texas we have another lady ghost that likes to go barefoot.  Since she died with her boots on, she thinks going barefoot will bring her back to life eventually, so we call her Barefoot Bootsie.  And in far West Texas there is an army-man ghost that loves to hike and train ghost dogs in his spare time.  Since he also likes sweets, we call him Dessert Warrior.<br/>
<br/>
I  noticed there are many Halloween-themed boxes in a place called Telge Park down in Cypress, so that looks like a great place to visit, especially this time of year.  Just be careful of a grizzly bear that I heard lives near there.  Well I have to go, the day shift at the library is about to arrive and I have to get home.  Please visit my letterbox here in Karnack when you get a chance, and give me a holler over the back fence!<br/>

P.S. Here is a little Halloween humor:  What do you get when you cross a rooster, spaniel, poodle and a ghost?   A cocker-poodle-boo!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to letterboxing, Oonie.  It's nice to meet a ghost with a sense of humor.  The first ghost I came across as a result of letterboxing was The Ghost of Oakwood Cemetery in Austin.  He kidnapped one of Lone Star Quilter's letterboxes and held it for ransom.  We refused to pay the ransom and never heard from the ghost or the box again.  The box was replaced but quickly went missing again.  That was not a nice ghost.  Then there's IRA Boxer, who was Murdered in the Arboretum and came back as a ghost and refuses to leave.  If his murderer would come forward and admit to the deed, perhaps he could get some rest.  I like to place letterboxes in cemeteries, so I'll try not to let your letterboxing ghosts intimidate me, even you.  It's easy to see how one who was struck by lightning while sitting in her own bedroom could be a little paranoid.<br/>
