But, I quickly remembered that he doesn't consider it to be a bad thing when I don't talk to him so I reversed my policy and "discussed my <em>feelings"</em>  with him.

<div>Fearless Fox was scolding me earlier this evening for allowing my 
      Norton Antivirus expire earlier this week.  Now he is the computer 
      geek in the family and he gets all sorts of extra seats on the software he 
      uses at work, so I think it should be HIS responsibility to keep my 
      computer protected, but he somehow thinks I should be self-sufficient with 
      respect to my computer.  He says I can't have it both ways - it seems 
      he dredged up some ancient history and reminded me of our dance lessons 
      when I felt that if we didn't at least take turns leading, we should flip 
      for who leads.  I hate getting caught in my own words! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>ANYWAY, as he was scolding me, he was also looking up a site to buy 
      the download to get me covered again.  He asked me which package I 
      would want and I told him I only needed the basic package, but he 
      suggested we look at the features of the other packages.  We came to 
      one that said something about protecting my computer from suspicious 
      websites.  He commented that I visit so many weird sites that I 
      should think about getting that feature.  Shocked, I asked him what 
      weird sites I visit.  Without missing a beat, he said "Well - you go 
      to all those letterboxing sites, to begin with!" <br clear="all"/></div>
<div>With one felling swoop, he called every last one of us weird!!!<br/>--
