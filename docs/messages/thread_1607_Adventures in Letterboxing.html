<div>My Adventures in Letterboxing lately:   7 attempts, 4 finds 
(3 FF!) and some very good stories along the way, even with the misses:  
</div>
<div>    Very Kind Spouse and I went to Colorado for some 
snowmobiling first week in Jan. - had to go pretty high to find the snow!  
And of course, we took along some clues, you know, just in case.  So 
here's the story:  </div>
<div>    Going around Amarillo, passing right by Silver 
Eagle's George Strait, we of course stopped to look, found the spot, but no 
George.  Box is gone.  So on to Colorado.  </div>
<div>    Two days later, headed up toward Leadville and 
Climax to find txtravelers' Arkansas Headwaters - found the exact spot but 
really deep, high snowdrifts kept us from the actual box, although I really 
considered trying to get to it!  So, two attempts, no boxes yet.  
</div>
<div>    On the way back to Texas, we of course detoured 
through Taos and Red River - more boxes there!  The Rio Grande Gorge River 
box of Funhog should have been an easy one - but no!  The entire location 
was blockaded by police, with helicopters and sheriffs and Mobile Command Units 
- a manhunt was underway along that trail and the gorge!  Again, I thought, 
if my sister were here, she'd probably find another way to the box, but 
no.  Three attempts, no boxes yet.  </div>
<div>    Luckily in Taos we DID find Silver Eagle's Kit 
Carson (hooray!  at last!).  </div>
<div>    Then passing through the canyon toward Red River, 
stopped at Columbine Canyon to find the box in that lovely place, but it was 
getting late, dark, and cold in the canyon, plus the park was closed for winter 
so our hike to where the trial begins would have added about another mile 
round-trip (at least), and we weren't really dressed for that cold.  So, no 
go - again.  Saved for another day.  </div>
<div>    But in Red River, we did find two boxes 
along the river hiking trail (Evergreen and L. D.'s Bear), and were First 
Finders for both, although they'd been there since August!  Very nice 
stamps on both, too, and relatively easy hikes, although we did have to find 
another way around the hiking trail for the Bear since the ski run crosses the 
trail (not a problem last August), but we persisted and found it.  </div>
<div>    Then, finally, on our way through Wichita Falls 
coming home we stopped at the FallsFest right off 287 and searched for that box, 
which we finally found -- and again, were First Finders although it's also been 
there for months and months!  </div>
<div>    So the final tally was:  7 attempts, 4 finds, 
but even on the misses we had good adventures.  And there were so many 
others we didn't even begin to look for in those beautiful mountains, so, 
another day . . . . Viewfinder  </div></font></body></html>
