&gt; I'm wondering how many kids will be there and what<br/>
&gt; ages. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would be willing to put together a few activities to<br/>
&gt; keep the kids occupied while the adults do their<br/>
&gt; thing, and I have a 16 year old daughter who is very<br/>
&gt; good with kids.  I wouldn't want to stick her with<br/>
&gt; them the entire time, but she would enjoy entertaining<br/>
&gt; well-behaved children at least part of the time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For the record, I have a 7 year old boy and a 16 year<br/>
&gt; old girl who will be attending.<br/>

That would be great if we had some activities for the <br/>
kids.  I plan to bring my son (10) and daughter (8) who<br/>
are not that enthusiastic about letterboxing, but would<br/>
enjoy playing with other kids.  Maybe if there was an<br/>
initial activity for them to meet each other they would<br/>
then play on their own (e.g. hide &amp; seek, colored Easter egg,<br/>
etc.) so your daughter wouldn't have to entertain them.<br/>
I can also bring a bingo game in case the weather keeps <br/>
everyone under the shelter.<br/>
