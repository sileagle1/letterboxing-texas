<div>I love the name "Cajun Sweet Dough Pie"! I love the legacy of family recipes and traditions. It's embarrassing to think of the recipes my daughters relate to me, but then those family comfort foods and simple everyday recipes are what family traditions and memories are built of. Thanks for sharing your recipes Joy and Jennifer. I'm printing them out and when we get a rainy, cool day and I get that inspiration to cook, I'll be trying them out!</div>
