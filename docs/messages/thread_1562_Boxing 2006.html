                    <div class="plaintext-content">So these are my personal goals (such as they are) for 2006:<br>
<br>
The Places We Will Go<br>
--I hope to get to Seattle to see my sister and of course do some<br>
boxing.  She thinks boxing is only for kids, and that adults who do it<br>
are total dorks, but what can I say--we are dorks, so there you go.<br>
--We are planning to drive to Colorado this summer-lots of fun boxing<br>
opportunities there and on the way.<br>
--I want to take more time to explore the Lone Star State.  There's so<br>
much to see & do.  You couldn't begin to see it all in a year, but I<br>
hope we see more of it.<br>
<br>
<br>
The People We Will Meet???<br>
--Looking forward to the TX Boxcar LB event.  We only got to go to<br>
last year's for an hour or so, and I missed the Terrors of Telge with<br>
the stomach flu.  It's fun to meet people and see if their faces match<br>
the personalities that show on the lists and in their clues (they<br>
usually don't).<br>
--Hoping that interesting new boxers and planters join the Texas<br>
group; everyone brings his or her own twist to the game.<br>
--I have lots of fun boxing with TeamKing and others.  Hope to find<br>
others out there who would be good boxing companions for me when the<br>
family doesn't want to go.<br>
<br>
<br>
The Things We Will Think!<br>
--Our boxing has evolved over this year.  We used to go on these runs<br>
where we tried to get as many boxes as possible in the shortest period<br>
of time.  Now, we try to enjoy the scenery more and take our time<br>
exploring.  It works better for everyone in our family, even if we can<br>
do fewer boxes.  The kids should be able to spend an hour throwing<br>
stones in a creek if that's what they want to do.  Our boxing style<br>
may change yet again; it'll be interesting to see.<br>
--I hope to come up with some diabolical clues & plant more mystery<br>
boxes.  And to solve diabolical clues and mystery boxes.<br>
<br>
I found 2005 to not be my favorite year overall--too much wacky<br>
weather, tragedy and unrest.  But we had a terrific year of boxing and<br>
I am looking forward to an even better 2006.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

<div>I'd like to plant more, but since I plan on leaving the area as soon as I can in 2007, I'll have to either pull what I plant or find someone to adopt them. I'm kind of in a quandry about that. I think I enjoy planting more than finding. I think. Maybe. &lt;s&gt; And I love carving so want to work on that. </div>

<div>I have been going nuts wanting to get out and enjoy this gorgeous weather and do some letterboxing over the past couple of weeks, but have had too many "holiday and family commitments". So this morning, after my 2 year old grandson went home, I grabbed my backpack and headed for Lake Grapevine to find Viewfinder's White Sails letterbox.  I pulled up to the parking lot at Lake Grapevine and seriously considered leaving and returning another day because the lot was full of cars with empty bike racks, and I thought about how unpleasant navigating that trail would be with so many bikers. However, a car backed out of a spot right by the trail head in front of me, so I decided it must be fate. Once I got on the trail, I became giddy with excitement because it was such a beautiful, gorgeous perfect day for hiking. Who would believe, January 1st? It was overcast, mid-80's and a gentle breeze coming off the lake making the 2 mile round trip hike just wonderful. What a great way to start the new year! The bikers were great about yelling "bike" in plenty of time for me to step off the trail and let them pass. EVERYONE on the trail was smiling, wishing each other a happy new year, and generally just loving life today! How inspirational! Gorgeous location, insanely beautiful day, great letterbox! On the way home, I scouted a location for my next box and can't wait to get it planted!</div>
<div>My boxing goal for 2006: Plan my boxing trips so I can visit as many boxes as possible when in an area, but on the other hand slooooow down and live in the moment, and enjoy every aspect of the letterboxing adventure, and realize if I have to miss a few boxes on my list - then lucky me - I have something to look forward to on a return trip! Texas letterboxers are just so "dad-gummed" nice, I look forward to searching for many boxes in this wide-wonderful state and meeting a big bunch of boxers at the March event! I also have plans for planting a bunch of boxes this winter and spring. Wishing each of you a very happy, prosperous and healthy 2006!</div></div>
