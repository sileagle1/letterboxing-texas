bad thing it was sopping wet.  All the previous stamps were gone, maybe <br/>
a faint ink stain, the little booklet was so wet, you could not turn <br/>
the pages.  We did stamp it, very gently.  I think if it had a  chance <br/>
to dry out you might be able to make out some familiar stamps.<br/>
<br/>
But we enjoyed the drive to the park, it was a fun day.   ANITA<br/>
