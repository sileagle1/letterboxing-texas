I arrived at Brazos Bend on Friday afternoon along with my son <br/>
Clueless Collector, nephew Antman, and brother Baby Bear.  We almost <br/>
did not get a campsite since they messed up my reservation, but <br/>
thanks to a cancellation we got in.  There was not much choice left <br/>
for campsites so I did not expect to be in a good location.  Imagine <br/>
my surprise and delight when I find we are right next to the <br/>
Louisiana Letterboxers!  As we were setting up the tent, they all <br/>
came over to meet us and invite us to share a campfire that night.  <br/>
With that to look forward to, we went off letterboxing before night <br/>
fell and managed to get about half of the boxes in the park.  Then <br/>
it was back to the campsite to eat and go to the campfire.  BOXDN, <br/>
Grits, Barney, Hummer Lady and others made us feel welcome as we <br/>
talked into the night, soon joined by a few other Texas boxers.  I <br/>
especially enjoyed talking with BOXDN since I lived in New Orleans<br/>
back when I was young and enjoyed sharing stories of that fun place.<br/>
He also showed me the shirt he made for the Event and I immediately <br/>
wanted one.  He is not only a talented carver, but a darn good <br/>
designer of shirts!  We finally went to bed about 10:30 but I heard <br/>
the LA group still going strong at 2:00.<br/>
The next morning, we got up early to finish finding the rest of the <br/>
boxes, and we noticed several boxes had been stamped at 12:15 that <br/>
morning by some in the LA group.  What troopers, in my younger days <br/>
I might have been able to hang with them but now I could only shake <br/>
my head in amazement!  When we got back BOXDN was making Beignets <br/>
for everyone and they were great.  Then it was time to start setting <br/>
up everything for the Event.<br/>
The weather stayed nice for the entire day and it was much fun.  <br/>
There was great food brought by many people, and I especially liked <br/>
the Jambalaya cooked from scratch by Tim of the LA group.  I had <br/>
some, then let everyone else have a chance at it, then I finished it <br/>
off.  Man did that bring back memories of good food in New Orleans!<br/>
That night the weather starting looking bad but Wanda needed a few <br/>
more boxes to tie her record for most in a day, so off we went in <br/>
the dark after some.  We visited Mr. Howdy at Kissin Fishes campsite <br/>
and then the lightning started getting pretty bad so my family left <br/>
to go back to the tent, assuming everyone else would, too.  Wrong!  <br/>
They kept going and I'll let BOXDN tell his story of what happened <br/>
that night in the storm.<br/>
The next morning as we were trying to dry out, people starting <br/>
coming by to say goodbye and it was kind of sad to realize it was <br/>
over.  Baby Bear and I helped Wanda map out the general locations of <br/>
many boxes and gave her suggestions for her next 2 weeks she will <br/>
spend in Texas before meeting Pete and heading up to the Oklahoma <br/>
Event.  She will probably get F7000 while in Texas!  She is a very <br/>
interesting person and I enjoyed talking with her.  As she was <br/>
leaving she said that this was one of the best Events she had ever <br/>
been to.  I told her she was just being nice since she has been to <br/>
Events all over the country, but she insisted it was true.  I asked <br/>
her why and she said "because everyone is so nice down here".  I <br/>
think that speaks highly of our group and I appreciate everyone <br/>
showing the kind of hospitality the South is famous for.  <br/>
So long for now,<br/>
