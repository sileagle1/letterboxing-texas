                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another great and memorable event by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear has come and gone and we are marking our calendar for the next one already.  Ghosts and Clowns and Copperheads all made appearances, some welcome, some not so much.   Maybe we could have it in Maine or Hawaii, where there are no poisonous snakes.  You can find ghosts and clowns just about anywhere I would think.  We arrived at the park on Thursday after a short drive down from Bastrop where we spent a couple of days walking the trails finding Silver Eagle's game boxes.  The first one, Twenty Questions Game 8-Place was a nice 3-mile walk and we also found a really nice and colorful Baileys Bunch box, Star Gazing, as a bonus.  The next day LSQ placed a new box in the park and we took a nice 5-mile walk finding SE's other box.  It was only supposed to be a 2-mile walk, but we walked a mile and a half before realizing we started on the wrong end of an 8 1/2 mile trail, so we had to retrace our steps and start over at the right end.  I wonder if we can count those 3 extra miles for the Texas Treasure Hike?  Back at Palmetto, we were the first ones in the trailer camping area, so we unhooked and set up, then went to Luling for lunch and headed for Seguin.  We found a box on the way, San Marcos Primitive Baptist Church and placed a new box at the rest area called Texas Truck.  We intended to place Oxcart JohnTexas Governor Series at a park in town since the governor is now residing in the State Cemetery, but the parks we visited were much too busy and open for my taste, so LSQ checked our GPS to find a cemetery.  She spotted one called San Geronimo, so we headed out there and found it.  I mentioned that I hoped we could find the name Ireland, since our governor was John Ireland.  One corner was obviously an older part, so we drove back there, got out and walked over to an obelisk marker.  It was the grave of John Ireland's wife.  I guess some things are meant to be.  Drove back to Palmetto, picking up another box, Jet Setting, on the way.  Adams Trails had shown up and were our new neighbors, so we said "hi" to them, then retired for the night.  Friday morning we slept in for a while, then headed out to find hiding places for our boxes and locate the few for which we had clues.  We walked out the door and were greeted by SE and BB who were on a mission to hide and find.  Since they planned on going to Seguin, we told them about the boxes on the way and gave them clues.  Coincidentally, they knew about the great history of San Geronimo Cemetery and were already planning a visit.  We ran into them again on the trail before they left the park.  Friday night we attended the Come and Get It event, which you all know about.  It was great company and great barbecue, what more could you ask?  Thanks to Barefoot Lucy and Mosaic Butterfly for finding the place and making the arrangements.  Saturday morning, well, I guess I'm going to have to address the "Cinnamon Roll Caper".  I get up at 6:00 to getting started on the rolls since they have to rise awhile.  We had invited SE and BB over when we ran into them the day before.  We also had a few lb neighbors around us and so I invited them over since I was sure I was making plenty, (even considering the appetites of our two original guests), so we ended up with Lucy Locket and Bluebutterfly and Corazon for breakfast.  Adams Trails had already had breakfast before I saw them.  Now, I apologize for not inviting everyone over, but, you see, it's a matter of logistics.  At home, I have 4 regular size ovens and several large pans in which to cook cinnamon rolls, but in my trailer I have one oven that will accommodate one 9" x 13" cake pan, so I have to make them in shifts and each batch was taking 20-25 minutes, so the last ones didn't come out of the oven until about 8:30.  Now I need to figure how long it would take me to feed 75 people.even if IRA Boxer were to bring Bear Claws and Gummy Bears or Gummy Bear Claws.  Does anyone have a huge camping oven?  I wonder if I can learn how to make cinnamon rolls in a DO?  Anyway, the drama of the day was yet to come, but I've said enough for one post.  I haven't even mentioned the keys left in the cars.   We can be thankful that everything turned out okay and that we have stories to tell around the campfire.  Speaking of the campfire, what was that horrible ghost with the red-heart boxers that swooped down over the fire?  All I heard was the screaming and the flash as it made one last swoop over my head.  <br/>
