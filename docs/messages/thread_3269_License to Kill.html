<div>The letterboxing outing that PuddleSplasher and I enjoyed yesterday was in 
the far South Dallas area around Cedar Hill. We each had to replace some full 
logbooks in our Cedar Hill Nature Center boxes, so we had good, long hikes 
in the morning on two of the trails up on that pretty ridge 
overlooking the lake.  Sadly, I think one of my boxes there is now 
missing (bye-bye, Benny Goodman).</div>
<div>Then we explored the Talala Trail in Cedar Hill SP and found Lone Star 
Quilter's Moosetake on the Lake, but weren't able to find Lucy Locket's or 
Boots Tex's boxes (they might be there but we just couldn't find 
'em).  Still, we had another nice long walk in the woods with a good lake 
view to enjoy.  From there we looped around to the Windmill 
Nature Preserve in DeSoto, where we thoroughly covered all of the 
trails in that pretty little nature preserve.  We found the six boxes 
there as much by luck as skill, since we didn't have a trail map, which is 
almost essential to know where to begin to find any of those trails or the boxes 
hidden there (the trail markers are almost obscure, where there are markers), 
but we did find them all before the sun got too low.  Very nice day on some 
really scenic woodsy trails, perfect weather: some finds, some missed, some 
needed maintenance.    And I even got to enjoy a nice sunset on 
my drive back to toward the west to end the day.  All in all, pretty 
satisfying.  The best part was actually being out hiking all day 
long!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hmmm. Some of the trails seemed better than others. If you park at the North Trail Head on Wintergreen (we didn't know about that parking lot until we happened upon it accidentally after we had hiked from the lot at the corner of Wintergreen and Duncanville), the Cast Iron Trail from the North Trail Head lot is wide and level. From there you can get to the Cotton Box and the Mockingbird Box on pretty level ground. The others may be a little more difficult to get to with a stroller. You have to go up a small, rocky incline for a short distance to get to the Pecan and the Scout boxes. The Eagle and Cattle boxes may be more difficult to get to, but once you're there, you can decide. None of them is too far from the Cast Iron Trail that runs through the center. Be SURE to print out the map and take with you because there is no map at the site and some of the trail markers are difficult to spot. By the way, the clues say this preserve is on the SW corner of the intersection, but actually it is on the SE corner.<br/>
