                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got home from very nearly a perfect Thanksgiving!<br>
<br>
After last year, when Lightning and Fearless Fox went to Arkansas<br>
without SJZ and me, leaving us to do the Thanksgiving shuffle with<br>
family and then set out for a two day letterboxing jaunt, I decided I<br>
didn't want to be left out of the trip this year (even though I had a<br>
GREAT time hanging out with SJZ and boxing with her in the Dallas<br>
area).  I called SJZ and told her we wouldn't be around for<br>
Thanksgiving and invited her to go with, but since she is working<br>
retail, I knew she likely wouldn't be able to come along.  Sure<br>
enough, she wasn't able so she went to lunch at her boyfriend's<br>
parents and we headed to Arkansas.<br>
<br>
As is the case when I travel with FF, I realize I very likely won't<br>
get to do much letterboxing.  I let him know that there was ONE box -<br>
ONLY one box I really wanted to get, and that was Two Jays near<br>
Langley.   I also downloaded a handful of other clues in and around<br>
Conway, Little Rock, Mena, and Hot Springs, but I'm learning from<br>
folks like PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder and Silver Eagle and I'm<br>
learning to be happy getting what I can instead of pushing to get what<br>
I want when I'm on HIS trips.<br>
<br>
Lightning, Fearless Fox, and I left Wednesday evening and arrived in<br>
Clarksville, AR, around 2 a.m.  We then got up Thursday morning and<br>
drove on to Ponca, AR, where we got a campsite.  Now Ponca is wayyyy<br>
up in the Ozarks and it was quite a trek to get there.  There are<br>
several major interstates that cross Arkansas, but Northwestern<br>
Arkansas is not easily accessible from any angle.  Our car wasn't<br>
particularly pleased with our choice and the engine temp was pushed to<br>
its limits on the long climbs and the brakes were tested on the rapid<br>
descents.  By the time we got where we were going, the car was glad to<br>
be given a rest!<br>
<br>
We debated on a couple of places to camp and finally, on one of the<br>
occasions when the car demanded a break, we stumbled into a private<br>
campground nestled in a lovely little valley - with cabins, a<br>
bunkhouse, a river outfitting setup, a store, and several primitive<br>
tent sites, all beside a nice little creek and it even had showers<br>
(hot, if you were willing to pay a dollar for hot water)!  We had been<br>
a little uneasy about the other camp areas we had looked at because of<br>
the lack of privacy and the easy access to the sites by the high foot<br>
traffic on and off the trailheads.  This little private camping area<br>
seemed perfect - except that the owners were nowhere to be found<br>
(okay, we sort of figured out where they lived, but we didn't have the<br>
heart to hunt them down on Thanksgiving Day).  Since there was no one<br>
else camping, we took our pick of campsites and plopped down and<br>
figured they would tell us to move if they were reserved.  Turns out -<br>
that was NOT a problem and we never saw another camper for the<br>
weekend.  Now the campground dog (we named him Tiger, but we later<br>
learned his name was really Baby) did show up and it turned out he was<br>
a friendly beast, but not very scrupulous - every time he left we<br>
found something missing!  Thankfully we are accustomed to camping<br>
around coons and we expected to have to be proactive against black<br>
bears, so we had the food stashed from the word go.  The only other<br>
big worry was shoes, which we learned right off to either put in our<br>
tent or on top of the car.  I got even with him the first night<br>
though, because after dark when he began barking incessantly, I began<br>
barking back at him and his owner would come outside and scold him for<br>
all the barking.  The next day he came around but he never could<br>
figure out where the dog went that got him in all that trouble.<br>
<br>
As soon as we got camp set up, we decided to set out on a short hike<br>
to explore the area where we were staying.  It always seems to pay off<br>
to do that - we had a good idea what the lay of the land was then.  It<br>
felt good to get stretched too, after all that car riding.<br>
<br>
Our original plan had been to go to Southern AR and do a three day<br>
hike, but we decided at the last minute not to do that since we had<br>
recently had a run of strep and all of us weren't back up to full<br>
strength.  Thankfully, a computer geek FF sometimes works with turned<br>
us on to a lot to be found in Northwestern AR, so we altered our plans<br>
and decided to home base somewhere and do short hikes each day.  The<br>
result was I had to scramble to find a new "only one box" and that<br>
became one of Baby Bear's boxes, which it turns out was very near our<br>
campsite.<br>
<br>
It got down to 34 degrees Thursday night, but since we were home<br>
basing and not hiking, we had brought our heavy equipment and so were<br>
prepared for the cold, except for the fact that an old back injury<br>
reared its ugly head for me and I was hurting pretty badly by the<br>
middle of the night and I wound up going to sleep in the car to get a<br>
better position, and so was actually colder in the car than I had been<br>
in the tent.  Never underestimate the power of body heat and a good<br>
sleeping bag!<br>
<br>
The next morning we got up to clouds hanging about us, so we decided<br>
to wait until they had lifted before we took off.  Lightning and I<br>
entertained ourselves by playing in the fire and making biscuits on a<br>
stick.  FF stayed in bed and read for awhile.<br>
<br>
We eventually ventured across to the store, where the posted hours<br>
were 9-ish to 5-ish, and we settled up and made arrangements to stay<br>
on.  It was a classic little general store and the prices weren't even<br>
too bad, although a lot of the merchandise had been purchased at<br>
Walmart for resale.  The owner lady was there, along with a store<br>
employee, and two or three locals.  One of the locals said "Say, y'all<br>
are the campers aren't you?"  We didn't think it was all that unusual<br>
that someone would camp at Thanksgiving, but apparently they did,<br>
because everyone knew us immediately to be The Campers.  Every time<br>
anyone would see us, they would give us a look of friendly disbelief<br>
or do a visual "pat-pat".  They were friendly enough though, and we<br>
felt like we were old-timers by yesterday afternoon when we left, if<br>
not the crazy distant cousins who everyone had to look out for.<br>
<br>
Finally the clouds lifted and we headed out on a trail that was<br>
supposedly about a 3 mile hike RT.  It turned out it was only about 2<br>
miles, so we made a fast trip of it, even after stopping and exploring<br>
and resting and looking around.  It was only 2 miles, but it was<br>
packed with things to see and do!  That's a really neat trail and well<br>
worth the visit.  Nothing terribly strenuous about it, although there<br>
are a couple of points you have to do a little mild climbing to pass<br>
through, and if you go in one of the caves, you have to go in on hands<br>
and knees and you have to count on getting wet.  All three of us being<br>
people-watchers, we got a kick out of watching folks' approach to<br>
getting wet (in mid-40's/low 50's).  Some folks flatly refused and<br>
turned back.  Others dove right in.  The guy that most amused us was<br>
some guy taking pictures of two teenaged boys who was awfully cocky<br>
for a guy carrying a big ol' tripod and an expensive camera, in shoes<br>
not meant for rough terrain.  He was certain he could get across<br>
without getting wet, so he jumped across and landed on one of the wet<br>
rocks (there were no dry ones) and anyone who has crossed water on wet<br>
rocks knows what that means - he began slipping and sliding around.<br>
It was like a classic cartoon move - arms and legs flying in all<br>
directions at once with this tripod and camera nothing but blurs,<br>
except that we were watching in horror as FF jumped to help the guy<br>
and the guy scrambled to catch himself, which he did - and barely.<br>
Had he fallen, he would have fallen flat on his back and down about 6<br>
feet, and would have surely hit his head against the quartz wall on<br>
our side of the water.  He was pretty shook up after that.  Once he<br>
went on we had a hearty laugh, which we could do since it WAS humorous<br>
and it turned out not to be gruesome.<br>
<br>
Since we finished that trail so quickly, we decided to explore a<br>
little of the Buffalo River Trail as well, but not having done our<br>
homework well enough, we didn't stay long on it because it was getting<br>
late in the afternoon.<br>
<br>
We had planned to go "into town" to grab burgers and get a little<br>
respite from the outdoors Friday evening, but the "into town" we had<br>
counted on while planning the trip turned out to be the intersection<br>
of two roads - nothing more.  A quick search for a burger joint proved<br>
fruitless, since there wasn't even a hint of a building there.  How<br>
spoiled we are that we assume there will always be a restaurant in a<br>
reasonable distance from us!  I had asked the general store lady<br>
earlier about a music thing I had seen posted on her bulletin board,<br>
and she told me it was in Harrison, 25 miles away.  We debated jumping<br>
in the car and heading there, but since 25 miles almost certainly<br>
meant at least an hour on the road - one way - and the car was still<br>
harboring a grudge, we decided to stick to our humble little campsite<br>
for grub.  Quick thinking me bought some M&M's from the general store<br>
right before 5-ish, and I treated my guys to Banana Boats - bananas<br>
grilled with peanut butter and chocolate - an ooey gooey dessert they<br>
voted to add to our camping reportoire.<br>
<br>
That night went a lot like the first, with Tiger and I barking back<br>
and forth to each other until FF threatened to beat me with the<br>
newspaper if I didn't shut up.  I knew good and well he didn't have a<br>
newspaper, and told him so, and he replied he would beat me with a<br>
slipper then.  I knew he didn't have a slipper either, but I also knew<br>
if I tempted things he might resort to the closest thing to a slipper<br>
he could find, and since that would have been a hiking boot, I decided<br>
to shut up.  So you see - you CAN teach an old dog a new trick.<br>
<br>
I tried hammocking that night to avoid the back problem.  It didn't<br>
get nearly as cold as the first night (44 degrees), but I couldn't<br>
ever get my cover situated, so I wound up in the car again.  I felt<br>
like a really BAD camper having to sleep in the car!  Yeesh!<br>
<br>
The stars, by the way, were positively stunning.  We've been getting<br>
serious about learning our constellations and stars the last few<br>
months and it was amazing all the ones we could see out in those dark<br>
skies near the top of the mountains.<br>
The next morning we awoke again to clouds hanging about us.  Lightning<br>
was especially amused at the fact that it was clouds, not fog, we were<br>
in (never mind that's what fog IS!).<br>
<br>
We got ready Saturday to head out to Hawksbill Crag, reportedly the<br>
most photographed place in Arkansas.  This was somewhere I really,<br>
REALLY wanted to visit.  We finally found the unmarked road and turned<br>
on it and immediately began a steep incline - that supposedly went on<br>
for 3-4 miles.  The car protested and we decided we had better leave<br>
that hike to another day.  We went instead to take another hike, this<br>
time where I thought Baby Bear's box was.  It turned out to be a<br>
really nice hike, but I figured out too late that we had already been<br>
on the right trail and I hadn't been tuned in to the clues well<br>
enough!  I probably passed very near it!<br>
<br>
My letterboxing on this trip turned out to go from minimal to nil,<br>
although I did ask for and receive permission to plant a box on our<br>
next visit (I would've planted it this time, but my LB backpack had to<br>
stay home due to space constraints, so all I had were my log and<br>
stamps).  There are some stunning places throughout the Ozarks, and<br>
specifically Newton County, to place letterboxes, but I sure got<br>
confused about where I was at any given time - NPS, USDA, state land,<br>
private land.  I realize now why there are so few boxes in Arkansas -<br>
much of the state is government recreational land.  We visited a place<br>
called the Ponca Elk Education Center (and all I could think of was<br>
that was where the lucky Ponca elk went to get their GED's) and<br>
learned quite a lot about the area's wildlife including elk, which<br>
they have reseeded into Arkansas in the last 20 years, and we were<br>
lucky enough to happen upon a herd of 20-25 elk grazing along the side<br>
of the road.  I was very surprised to see that they had a sanctioned<br>
GC on their facility, and that quite a few other similar facilities in<br>
Arkansas also had GC's.  I complained to the lady there that it was<br>
simply not fair that they don't have a letterbox but they do have a<br>
GC, and when I asked her if I could right that, she agreed readily.<br>
She and I then got into quite a productive discussion about how<br>
treasure hunting games both help and hurt primitive areas.<br>
<br>
We finally pulled up stakes yesterday afternoon and decided to head on<br>
to Little Rock to get a start on the return trip.  It took us as long<br>
to get from Ponca to Little Rock as it did to get from Little Rock<br>
home today.  On the way out of Little Rock, I saw an Adult Education<br>
Center and I wondered if we should stop so we could learn more about<br>
Adults.  FF seemed to think we didn't have time for such nonsense.<br>

I knew he didn't have a slipper either, but I also knew<br/>if I tempted things he might resort to the closest thing to a slipper<br/>he could find, and since that would have been a hiking boot, I decided<br/>to shut up. So you see - you CAN teach an old dog a new trick.<br/><br/>I tried hammocking that night to avoid the back problem. It didn't<br/>get nearly as cold as the first night (44 degrees), but I couldn't<br/>ever get my cover situated, so I wound up in the car again. I felt<br/>like a really BAD camper having to sleep in the car! Yeesh!<br/><br/>The stars, by the way, were positively stunning. We've been getting<br/>serious about learning our constellations and stars the last few<br/>months and it was amazing all the ones we could see out in those dark<br/>skies near the top of the mountains.<br/>The next morning we awoke again to clouds hanging about us. Lightning<br/>was especially amused at the fact that it was clouds, not fog, we
 were<br/>in (never mind that's what fog IS!).<br/><br/>We got ready Saturday to head out to Hawksbill Crag, reportedly the<br/>most photographed place in Arkansas. This was somewhere I really,<br/>REALLY wanted to visit. We finally found the unmarked road and turned<br/>on it and immediately began a steep incline - that supposedly went on<br/>for 3-4 miles. The car protested and we decided we had better leave<br/>that hike to another day. We went instead to take another hike, this<br/>time where I thought Baby Bear's box was. It turned out to be a<br/>really nice hike, but I figured out too late that we had already been<br/>on the right trail and I hadn't been tuned in to the clues well<br/>enough! I probably passed very near it!<br/><br/>My letterboxing on this trip turned out to go from minimal to nil,<br/>although I did ask for and receive permission to plant a box on our<br/>next visit (I would've planted it this time, but my LB backpack had to<br/>stay home due to space constraints,
 so all I had were my log and<br/>stamps). There are some stunning places throughout the Ozarks, and<br/>specifically Newton County, to place letterboxes, but I sure got<br/>confused about where I was at any given time - NPS, USDA, state land,<br/>private land. I realize now why there are so few boxes in Arkansas -<br/>much of the state is government recreational land. We visited a place<br/>called the Ponca Elk Education Center (and all I could think of was<br/>that was where the lucky Ponca elk went to get their GED's) and<br/>learned quite a lot about the area's wildlife including elk, which<br/>they have reseeded into Arkansas in the last 20 years, and we were<br/>lucky enough to happen upon a herd of 20-25 elk grazing along the side<br/>of the road. I was very surprised to see that they had a sanctioned<br/>GC on their facility, and that quite a few other similar facilities in<br/>Arkansas also had GC's. I complained to the lady there that it was<br/>simply not fair that they don't
 have a letterbox but they do have a<br/>GC, and when I asked her if I could right that, she agreed readily.<br/>She and I then got into quite a productive discussion about how<br/>treasure hunting games both help and hurt primitive areas.<br/><br/>We finally pulled up stakes yesterday afternoon and decided to head on<br/>to Little Rock to get a start on the return trip. It took us as long<br/>to get from Ponca to Little Rock as it did to get from Little Rock<br/>home today. On the way out of Little Rock, I saw an Adult Education<br/>Center and I wondered if we should stop so we could learn more about<br/>Adults. FF seemed to think we didn't have time for such nonsense.<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/><p>

memories of the time I organized a trip to Ponca to canoe the Buffalo <br>
River.  My family went with my Dad & his wife, Baby Bear and his wife <br>
and my in-laws and we had an "adventurous" time.  After the in-laws had <br>
capsized for the third time, I think they were ready to kill me!  It is <br>
too bad this was before I knew about letterboxing or I would have <br>
placed at least one box there.  Glad you had fun even without getting <br>
to box.<br>
