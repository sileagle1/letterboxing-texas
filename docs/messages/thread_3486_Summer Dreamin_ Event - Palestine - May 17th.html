<div> </div>
<div>We've had a couple new East Texans join the group in the last week, so I wanted to announce again the gathering to be held in Palestine.  The theme of the gathering is summertime dreaming - mainly great vacations we'd like to take or will be taking, fun things we'd like to do during the summer, places we'd like to go - the theme is wide open and the only rule of the road is total relaxation, fun, and indulgence!  To participate, you can sign up below.  You can bring a box to plant, LTC's to trade, maybe a new personal traveler.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>New boxers are most especially welcome, and if you have questions or curiosities about letterboxing, this will be the place to ask!</div>
