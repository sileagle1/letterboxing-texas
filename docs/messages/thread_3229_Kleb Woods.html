Sorry for the delay since we had posted the "place holder" on AQ to<br/>
let people know it was coming.  Then we vacillated a bit since we<br/>
didn't want to duplicate the effort that SandiBox put in.  However,<br/>
perhaps God  was making plans for Baby Jesus to turn up one way or<br/>
another!<br/>
<br/>
We deleted the "place holder" on AQ since it was out of date and<br/>
listed a new plant since it was placed today.<br/>
<br/>
It is not near any boxes we KNOW of in Kleb Woods park, but when we<br/>
saw this spot, we thought, "there must be a box here already".  We<br/>
looked quickly but didn't spot another box. Disclaimer:  We were in a<br/>
hurry -- life's full of stuff and it was getting dark.<br/>
<br/>
So, if it turns out we've encroached on someone else's plant, just let<br/>
us know and we'll move it.  We were just happy to be able to get it<br/>
planted in time for Christmas Day.<br/>
<br/>
Merry Christmas!!<br/>
<br/>
Key Note Sneakers<br/>
P.S.:  SandiBox, we are saddened by your loss and hope that your Baby<br/>
Jesus turns up soon.  We're glad we could help on short notice!<br/>
