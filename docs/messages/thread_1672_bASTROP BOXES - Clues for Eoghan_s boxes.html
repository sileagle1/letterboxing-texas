Note: O-Knot #2 is gone as it was destroyed by fire. O-Knot #3 and 4 <br>
were there in September 2005 as well as Lost Pines.<br>

Lost Pines Letterbox<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Treasure Type: Letterbox<br>
Location: Buescher State Park<br>
Near: Smithville, TX<br>
Placed on: 11/04/00<br>
Terrain difficulty:  ( for shortcut)<br>
Overall difficulty: <br>
<br>
Directions: Begin the hike on the Buescher Hiking Trail, across from <br>
the Lakeview walk-in camping area. After 2.2 miles, take the left <br>
path towards Park Road 1C (to the Pine Gulch trail). You can also <br>
begin the hike here by parking your car on the side of the road. The <br>
trail crosses the road at 0.3 miles past the UT Cancer Research <br>
Center entrance. Approximately a third of a mile after the trail <br>
crosses the road, there is a small wooden foot bridge over an <br>
arroyo. From the bridge go 30 to 35 steps back down the trail to the <br>
south. The letterbox is located approximately 30 feet up the slope <br>
of the hill beneath a small pile of rocks.<br>
<br>

O-Knots<br>

<br>
Treasure Type: Letterbox series<br>
Placed on: 11/10/01<br>
State: Texas<br>
County: Bastrop<br>
Nearest Town: Bastrop<br>
Park: Bastrop State Park <br>
Terrain difficulty: <br>
Overall difficulty: <br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
To locate the four O-knots hidden in this park you will need to <br>
purchase ($3) an orienteering map from the park headquarters when <br>
you enter the park. There are two maps available; buy the one that <br>
shows the numbered locations of the permanent control points. Each <br>
of the letterboxes contains a circular ('O') celtic knot stamp and <br>
is located near one of the permanent orienteering ('O') control <br>
markers shown on the map. (One of the markers is shown in the <br>
picture to the right.) Each box is in the base of a tree trunk at <br>
the bearing and distance from the control marker shown on the table <br>
below. Also indicated is the type of tree or other clue that will <br>
help you locate each box.<br>
<br>
Knot # Control # Bearing Distance Location <br>
1        87       240   90' in base of dead pine tree <br>
2        29        74   85' in base of small oak tree <br>
3        71       180   50' in east end of rotting log <br>
4        91       346   20' double-trunk oak at top of ditch, <br>
beneath rocks <br>

It's not that some people have willpower and some don't. It's that some <br>
people are ready to change and others are not.<br>
