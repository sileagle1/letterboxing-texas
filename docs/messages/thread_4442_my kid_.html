</p><div>My grandson (6) wanted to go letterboxing today, so we printed out a couple of clue sheets and went out. As we're sitting at the first box, stamping in, he said "this is fun, but the best part is the adventure - hiking and finding the box". THAT was a very proud moment for me! He is definitely <em><strong><u>MY</u></strong></em> grandson! I love the boxes and the stamps and all that... but the adventure is the best part for me too. I'm carving him a new stamp tonight because he more than earned it in my book.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to send a special "shout out" to a few boxers who gave me a little help with a couple of my boxes this week: JBKokopelli &amp; Wag Time who rescued one of my boxes, and Reach for the Stars who researched some info about another box I had hidden and shared it with me. I've had a box in McKinney since '07 named Worst Driver in the World. I had read  that honor belonged to a McKinney, Tx man, but I could never find the information confirming this. I received that info from Reach f/t Stars yesterday so I've added that to my clues:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>- According to Wikipedia, the worst driver in the world is recorded in the Guinness Book of World Records as being from McKinney. Although I could find nothing to substantiate this claim, the following information was since provided to me by fellow letterboxer, Reach for the Stars: "According to The Guinness Book of World Records, the world's worst driver was a 75-year-old man who received 10 traffic summonses because he "drove on the wrong side of the road four times, committed four hit-and-run offenses, and caused six accidents, all within 20 minutes, in McKinney, Texas, on Oct. 15, 1966." (Thanks!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's just another aspect I love about letterboxing! Helpful people!</div>
