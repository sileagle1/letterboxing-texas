all the posts yet I wanted to respond to this thread.<br/>
Lucy is absolutely right in her guess of my thoughts.<br/>
I'm not sure how I gave the impression that I did not<br/>
want more boxes at the Event, but that is not the case.<br/>
I have said that I would enjoy the Event even if no<br/>
boxes were there, but that does not mean I don't want<br/>
them.  I also encourage everyone to participate in<br/>
planning the activities.  I think a Bingo game would be<br/>
great, along with anything else someone wants to do.<br/>
This group is the most creative bunch I have ever met<br/>
(way more than me), so I welcome all suggestions.  Even<br/>
though I am the "Host", please don't think of this as<br/>
"My Event".  It is everyone's, and I want it to be fun<br/>
for everyone.<br/>

&gt; Silver Eagle is off on a {everybody breathe a sigh of<br/>
&gt; envy here} kid-free vacation this week, so we won't be<br/>
&gt; hearing from him.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's what I would imagine he has in mind, and bear<br/>
&gt; in mind that I'm ONLY guessing, based on the last two<br/>
&gt; gatherings that he's planned and I've been to (and<br/>
&gt; maybe some of the previous participants can help in<br/>
&gt; guessing his thoughts - we can call this the<br/>
&gt; "Pre-Gathering Guess what Silver Eagle is Thinking<br/>
&gt; Game"):  Meet and do pot luck for lunch, do exchanges<br/>
&gt; and "meet and greet".  Meet and Greet went well into<br/>
&gt; the evening at both of the prior gatherings, and it<br/>
&gt; would be nice if it did again this year, but I think<br/>
&gt; that he doesn't want to put pressure on anyone to<br/>
&gt; think they HAVE to bring boxes or prepare in any way,<br/>
&gt; but to keep it informal.  Make it so everyone has<br/>
&gt; plenty of time to sit around and get to know each<br/>
&gt; other.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On the other hand, I think he appreciates others<br/>
&gt; taking the initiative to add to the event in other<br/>
&gt; ways, just like that infamously epic Clue game was a<br/>
&gt; great addition last year, and that will mean that<br/>
&gt; those folks who don't sit still well will have<br/>
&gt; something to do to keep them busy, and they will still<br/>
&gt; have a place to come back and sit down for a bit and<br/>
&gt; visit before they are off again.  Those folks who<br/>
&gt; really JUST enjoy getting to know other boxers don't<br/>
&gt; have to feel pressured to play games JUST because they<br/>
&gt; are on the schedule.  So that way, there is something<br/>
&gt; for everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And as for another activity, I'm still pulling for a<br/>
&gt; Scarlet Pimpernel Clue Solving Session.  Please. <br/>
&gt; Pretty Please.  Pretty Please with Sugar on Top. <br/>
&gt; Either that, or someone just give me the stinking<br/>
&gt; answer!  (Okay, just kidding on that part!)<br/>
