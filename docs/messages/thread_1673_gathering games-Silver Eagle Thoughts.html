all the posts yet I wanted to respond to this thread.<br>
Lucy is absolutely right in her guess of my thoughts.<br>
I'm not sure how I gave the impression that I did not<br>
want more boxes at the Event, but that is not the case.<br>
I have said that I would enjoy the Event even if no<br>
boxes were there, but that does not mean I don't want<br>
them.  I also encourage everyone to participate in<br>
planning the activities.  I think a Bingo game would be<br>
great, along with anything else someone wants to do.<br>
This group is the most creative bunch I have ever met<br>
(way more than me), so I welcome all suggestions.  Even<br>
though I am the "Host", please don't think of this as<br>
"My Event".  It is everyone's, and I want it to be fun<br>
for everyone.<br>
