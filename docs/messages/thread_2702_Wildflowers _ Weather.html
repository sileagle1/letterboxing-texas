<div>We have had snow today in Dallas - nothing sticking, but definitely coming down off and on. That's crazy. Last year on this date it was 88 in the DFW area! Viewfinder and I are hoping to make a quick trip down that way next weekend (Somerville area), so hopefully it will be good weather.</div>
