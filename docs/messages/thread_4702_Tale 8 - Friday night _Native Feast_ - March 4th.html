I have narrowed to 3 choices from internet research, but if ANYONE has info on these they can share that would help determine which one we go with.  Would need place that is big enough for about 20 to 30 people, and probably better it is like last years BBQ place where you go place your order and sit where you want (not formal wait staff).    Below are the choices, please help is you can:<br>
Frankie's Pasta and Pizza  (open to 10pm)<br>
Drillin Rig Restuarant (may be to small, but rated well)<br>
Kirby's BBQ<br>
