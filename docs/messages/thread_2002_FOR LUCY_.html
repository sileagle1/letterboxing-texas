It was so hot in Texas today that potatoes were baking under ground.  For<br/>
dinner, just pull them up and add salt-pepper-butter.<br/>

<div>Between you and TeamKing, y'all are killing me!  I am NOT a summertime person!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And to make matters worse, my a/c at home went kaput yesterday.  Next available service appointment - NEXT Thursday!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The upside of the situation is that we spent the night last night at my in-laws.  They live on the lake.  I awakened to a beautiful view of the lake, got up poured myself a cup of coffee and went out and sat on the front porch overlooking the lake - and watched the fish jumping and the birds flying about.  What a life.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But then there is STILL the heat!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>That when I called the A/C guy to come look at our unit today, I showed him through the house to the back yard, but when we were walking back through the house (after he had started softening me up for the bad news, but hadn't actually broken it yet), I smelled a heavy yeasty smell as we stepped back inside.  Odd - we haven't had beer in the house in AGES, and for that matter we haven't even opened a bottle of wine in quite a while.  I realized we had entered by the shelf where I keep the hard liquor, so I thought maybe the JD was smelling strongly since it was hot.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But no - the A/C guy took the same path back through the kitchen while I walked around on the other side of the table.  He said "Ummm ma'am - there's a really big mess over here that wasn't here when we went through here the first time".  I stepped around the table to see a huge pool of red - deep dark red.  Right by the wine rack!  A bottle of wine had blown its cork because it was soooo hot!  To make matters worse, before he could get the words out of his mouth two more bottles shot their corks - and scared the poor guy to death!  He was already unhappy at having to give me such horrendous news, and then I think he must've thought I was SHOOTING at him in that brief moment before we both realized what was happening!  What a huge mess I had - but before any more could blow, I started grabbing bottles and throwing them in the refrigerator (which - {{{sigh}}}} - is also going out).  He jumped in and started grabbing bottles and passing them to me.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As he was leaving, I told him to have his boss and/or his wife call me if they wanted to know why he smelled like he had been boozing instead of working.   But as I think more about it, that may not help his case much, hmmm?

<div>Sorry Lucy, that I had such a big laugh at your expense! I know it's horrible to have your AC go out right now, and worse yet to lose three bottles of wine, but your story was so much fun! I'm still laughing.</div>
