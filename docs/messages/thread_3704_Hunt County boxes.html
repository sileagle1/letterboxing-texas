Park box planted by Catpawz2004 and have adopted it also.  <br>
<br>
We have adopted three boxes from Catpawz here in Greenville and we had <br>
recently planted some of our own boxes in their area.  So this area is <br>
just really hopping with boxes right now.<br>
<br>
I believe we have at least 12 active boxes in this area that are <br>
fairly close and should be easily found.  We moved two of Catpawz <br>
boxes within their same parks just made them a little easier to find <br>
with updated clues.<br>
<br>
We hope to see y'all on the trail soon.<br>

My husband and I have just relocated from Lewisville to Greenville.<br>
When things get settled (read: things are unpacked and we get into the<br>
groove of school) be on the lookout for the Strawberry out on the<br>
trails! Wahoo!!<br>
