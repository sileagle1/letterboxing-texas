However when I announced on this group not long after I started <br>
letterboxing, that my friend and letterboxing partner was diagnosed <br>
with ovarian cancer, she sent me the sweetest personal email to let <br>
me know of her struggles and how letterboxing had helped her to cope <br>
with cancer.  She became an inspiration to me with that email and it <br>
was then that I truly realized what a wonderful group of people that <br>
letterboxers are.  I thank her...and only wish that I could have met <br>
her in person and thanked her for that inspiring message.<br>

Not too long ago, Fearless Fox ran across that particular line <br>
(without knowing of its association with Ruby) and started using it <br>
