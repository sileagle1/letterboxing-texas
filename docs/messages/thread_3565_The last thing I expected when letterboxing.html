 he caved.  </strong></div> <div><strong></strong> </div> <div><strong>So, as I am trying to "enjoy" myself...I felt like I was hearing people hiding in bushes, thinking, "Here I am, off the main path with only a cell phone for protection."  I'm sure some of his fear had gotten me a little nervous, but I guess it was a good kind of nervous that kept me alert.</strong></div> <div><strong></strong> </div> <div><strong>That all being said...what were the ideas about being safe on the trail?  I guess I wasn't in on that conversation.  I really think the usual 5 kids are a great deterent!!  Maybe I could start bringing the dog...she could lick them to death!!</strong></div> <div><strong></strong> </div> <div><strong>Texas Trailmix</strong></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">Well - the idea of self-defense is a very personal 
issue.  There are several levels of force available.  the problem is, 
you really do not get to choose - it gets chosen for you by the attacker.  
But there are a few things you can do to help.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">The #1 thing is to be alert and aware of your surroundings 
at ALL TIMES.  This isn't just in the woods - it should get to be a 
life-time thing.  Just knowing what is around you and sensing danger early 
is a great start, it allows you to avoid the danger.  This is especially 
important if you travel alone.  TRUST YOUR GUT!  If something doesn't 
feel right - it ain't right.  Screw making people feel hurt.  Get out 
now!</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">#2 - distance is your friend.  If you let someone near 
enough to touch you - you have already lost half the battle.  In most 
places the "21 foot rule" applies.  If someone is within a 21 foot circle 
from you, and is acting threatening, you would be justified in 
acting.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">#3 - make a fuss.  The first moments of an attack or 
kidnapping are your best chance to escape.  Do not cooperate - FIGHT!  
Immediately and hard.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">#4 - everything is a weapon.  Keys poking out between 
your fingers and punched into the attacker's eyes will usually end the 
fight.  But - remember #2?  Stand-off weapons are best.  MACE 
brand Pepper FOAM is a good choice if you will not consider a handgun.  
Don't get the cheap spray.  Pay the $$$, get the foam.  It has some 
advantages.  NOTE:  In Texas, pepper foam is simple assault.  If 
you would be justified in punching, you are justified in the use of pepper 
foam.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">#5 - I am licensed for and DO carry a handgun.  
ALWAYS.  So does my wife.  As do most of my friends.  No, I do 
not expect trouble.  If I expected trouble, I would carry my rifle - 
remember #2?  I do not expect to have a flat tire, but I have a 
spare.  I do not expect my house to burn, but I have a fire extinguisher 
and insurance too.  I usually also carry pepper foam.  But most 
attacks are swift, surprise is what the attacker is counting 
on.</span></div>

<p><strong>Black<span class="038543900-20052008"> 
- </span>Action taken - threat(s) or danger

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">I have been accused of being more in ORANGE than 
YELLOW.  So be it.  But just realizing that you are in white and 
trying to develop the mindset to get into yellow is a good 
start.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008">You really deserve a better reply than this.  Perhaps 
someone can dig in the archives for my old message.  But my dog is very 
ill.  I am afraid he will not be with us much longer.  8 years.  
5 show titles. A wall full of ribbons and photos.  Thousands of miles 
travelled.  Hundreds of miles hiked.  Damn bone cancer.  So I am 
going to sit with him for a while.  And is all 175 pounds of him lays on

</p><div><strong>This is interesting.<wbr/>..my husband and I 
  were just having this particular conversation at the beginning of the 
  weekend.  On Thursday night, I was eagerly awaiting his home coming from 
  work, hoping he would agree to me having a little while to go letterboxing by 
  myself.  A friend from church was going to have a small get together with 
  some of her friends and introduce them to her newfound hobby of 
  letterboxing.  Not wanting them to get easily discouraged, I thought I 
  would go hunt the boxes prior to the meeting and make sure all was well.  
  My husband thought I was nuts!!  He DID NOT want me to go to the park 
  alone...now this is a park I frequently go to with the kids and I really 
  couldn't understand the problem.  I did try to call a friend (who wants 
  NOTHING to do with lb'ing, but was the only person I thought available on 
  short notice), and I guess when he saw the downcast look on my face after she 
  said no, he caved.  </strong></div>
<div><strong></strong> </div>
<div><strong>So, as I am trying to "enjoy" myself...I felt 
  like I was hearing people hiding in bushes, thinking, "Here I am, off the main 
  path with only a cell phone for protection."  I'm sure some of his fear 
  had gotten me a little nervous, but I guess it was a good kind of nervous that 
  kept me alert.</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong> </div>
<div><strong>That all being said...what were the ideas 
  about being safe on the trail?  I guess I wasn't in on that 
  conversation.  I really think the usual 5 kids are a great 
  deterent!!  Maybe I could start bringing the dog...she could lick them to 
  death!!</strong></div>

<div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>Well - the idea of self-defense is a very personal 
issue.  There are several levels of force available.  the problem is, 
you really do not get to choose - it gets chosen for you by the attacker.  
But there are a few things you can do to help.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>The #1 thing is to be alert and aware of your surroundings 
at ALL TIMES.  This isn't just in the woods - it should get to be a 
life-time thing.  Just knowing what is around you and sensing danger early 
is a great start, it allows you to avoid the danger.  This is especially 
important if you travel alone.  TRUST YOUR GUT!  If something doesn't 
feel right - it ain't right.  Screw making people feel hurt.  Get out 
now!</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>#2 - distance is your friend.  If you let someone near 
enough to touch you - you have already lost half the battle.  In most 
places the "21 foot rule" applies.  If someone is within a 21 foot circle 
from you, and is acting threatening, you would be justified in 
acting.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>#3 - make a fuss.  The first moments of an attack or 
kidnapping are your best chance to escape.  Do not cooperate - FIGHT!  
Immediately and hard.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>#4 - everything is a weapon.  Keys poking out between 
your fingers and punched into the attacker's eyes will usually end the 
fight.  But - remember #2?  Stand-off weapons are best.  MACE 
brand Pepper FOAM is a good choice if you will not consider a handgun.  
Don't get the cheap spray.  Pay the $$$, get the foam.  It has some 
advantages.  NOTE:  In Texas, pepper foam is simple assault.  If 
you would be justified in punching, you are justified in the use of pepper 
foam.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>#5 - I am licensed for and DO carry a handgun.  
ALWAYS.  So does my wife.  As do most of my friends.  No, I do 
not expect trouble.  If I expected trouble, I would carry my rifle - 
remember #2?  I do not expect to have a flat tire, but I have a 
spare.  I do not expect my house to burn, but I have a fire extinguisher 
and insurance too.  I usually also carry pepper foam.  But most 
attacks are swift, surprise is what the attacker is counting 
on.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>Here is the COMBAT COLOR CODE.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>
<p><b>White<span> 
- </span>Oblivious to your surroundings. You should never be 
in white while awake.</b></p>
<p><b>Yellow<span> 
- </span>Alert to your surroundings, no particular threat(s) 
or danger.</b></p>
<p><b>Orange<span> 
- </span>Possible threats or danger nearby. You are alert 
and ready but action is not eminent.</b></p>
<p><b>Red<span> - 
</span>You are in danger. Take appropriate action to ensure 
survival for you and your family</b></p>
<p><b>Black<span> 
- </span>Action taken - threat(s) or danger 
neutralized.</b></p></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>I have been accused of being more in ORANGE than 
YELLOW.  So be it.  But just realizing that you are in white and 
trying to develop the mindset to get into yellow is a good 
start.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>You really deserve a better reply than this.  Perhaps 
someone can dig in the archives for my old message.  But my dog is very 
ill.  I am afraid he will not be with us much longer.  8 years.  
5 show titles. A wall full of ribbons and photos.  Thousands of miles 
travelled.  Hundreds of miles hiked.  Damn bone cancer.  So I am

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p><span>Well - the idea of self-defense is a very personal issue. 
There are several levels of force available.  the problem is, you really
do not get to choose - it gets chosen for you by the attacker.  But there
are a few things you can do to help.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>The #1 thing is to be alert and aware of your surroundings at ALL
TIMES.  This isn't just in the woods - it should get to be a life-time
thing.  Just knowing what is around you and sensing danger early is a
great start, it allows you to avoid the danger.  This is especially
important if you travel alone.  TRUST YOUR GUT!  If something doesn't
feel right - it ain't right.  Screw making people feel hurt.  Get out
now!</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>#2 - distance is your friend.  If you let someone near enough
to touch you - you have already lost half the battle.  In most places the
"21 foot rule" applies.  If someone is within a 21 foot circle
from you, and is acting threatening, you would be justified in acting.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>#3 - make a fuss.  The first moments of an attack or
kidnapping are your best chance to escape.  Do not cooperate -
FIGHT!  Immediately and hard.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>#4 - everything is a weapon.  Keys poking out between your
fingers and punched into the attacker's eyes will usually end the fight. 
But - remember #2?  Stand-off weapons are best.  MACE brand Pepper
FOAM is a good choice if you will not consider a handgun.  Don't get the
cheap spray.  Pay the $$$, get the foam.  It has some
advantages.  NOTE:  In Texas, pepper foam is simple assault.  If
you would be justified in punching, you are justified in the use of pepper
foam.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>#5 - I am licensed for and DO carry a handgun.  ALWAYS. 
So does my wife.  As do most of my friends.  No, I do not expect
trouble.  If I expected trouble, I would carry my rifle - remember
#2?  I do not expect to have a flat tire, but I have a spare.  I
do not expect my house to burn, but I have a fire extinguisher and insurance
too.  I usually also carry pepper foam.  But most attacks are swift,
surprise is what the attacker is counting on.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>Here is the COMBAT COLOR CODE.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span>White
- Oblivious to your surroundings. You should never be in white while awake.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span>Yellow
- Alert to your surroundings, no particular threat(s) or danger.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span>Orange
- Possible threats or danger nearby. You are alert and ready but action is not
eminent.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span>Red
- You are in danger. Take appropriate action to ensure survival for you and
your family</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span>Black
- Action taken - threat(s) or danger neutralized.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>I have been accused of being more in ORANGE than YELLOW.  So
be it.  But just realizing that you are in white and trying to develop the
mindset to get into yellow is a good start.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>You really deserve a better reply than this.  Perhaps someone
can dig in the archives for my old message.  But my dog is very ill. 
I am afraid he will not be with us much longer.  8 years.  5 show
titles. A wall full of ribbons and photos.  Thousands of miles
travelled.  Hundreds of miles hiked.  Damn bone cancer.  So I am
going to sit with him for a while.  And is all 175 pounds of him lays on
top of me, I guess I won't complain.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><span>Y-all have a good evening.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><strong><span>This is interesting...my
husband and I were just having this particular conversation at the beginning of
the weekend.  On Thursday night, I was eagerly awaiting his home coming
from work, hoping he would agree to me having a little while to go letterboxing
by myself.  A friend from church was going to have a small get together
with some of her friends and introduce them to her newfound hobby of
letterboxing.  Not wanting them to get easily discouraged, I thought I
would go hunt the boxes prior to the meeting and make sure all was well. 
My husband thought I was nuts!!  He DID NOT want me to go to the park
alone...now this is a park I frequently go to with the kids and I really
couldn't understand the problem.  I did try to call a friend (who wants
NOTHING to do with lb'ing, but was the only person I thought available on
short notice), and I guess when he saw the downcast look on my face after she
said no, he caved.  </span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>

<div>
<p><strong><span>So, as I am trying to
"enjoy" myself...I felt like I was hearing people hiding in bushes,
thinking, "Here I am, off the main path with only a cell phone for
protection."  I'm sure some of his fear had gotten me a little
nervous, but I guess it was a good kind of nervous that kept me alert.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><strong><span>That all being
said...what were the ideas about being safe on the trail?  I guess I
wasn't in on that conversation.  I really think the usual 5 kids are a
great deterent!!  Maybe I could start bringing the dog...she could lick
them to death!!</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span>Today I went out to find a new series of letterboxes that had
been planted over the weekend.  The subject of the series is really
interesting to me, and the greenbelt where they are planted is close to my
home.  So off I go….</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p><span>While hiking in the woods it occurred to me that it probably
wasn’t the safest thing to do – going out alone in a really large
wooded area where there may or may not be other people around.  What if I
fell down, got hurt, ran into a mugger, whatever.  I couldn’t find
the boxes and kept hiking further and further into the wood, all the time
letting my imagination get the better of me.  I had pretty much worked out
every calamity I could think of and a had plan of action for most of them.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>I was walking along a main trail and noticed a person coming
toward that trail from a spur trail to my right.  I could just make them
out through the trees.  It turns out that they got to the main trail at
the same time as I got to the entrance to the trail they were on.   I
looked up to say hello and noticed that the guy was all alone and was carrying
a chainsaw.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>He said hello and went on to find the camping co-eds or whoever
he was after… but it sure scared me.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on toward the goal to
win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ
Jesus.   -Philipians 3:13-14</span><o:p></o:p></p>
