<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Well - the idea of self-defense is a very personal 
issue.  There are several levels of force available.  the problem is, 
you really do not get to choose - it gets chosen for you by the attacker.  
But there are a few things you can do to help.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The #1 thing is to be alert and aware of your surroundings 
at ALL TIMES.  This isn't just in the woods - it should get to be a 
life-time thing.  Just knowing what is around you and sensing danger early 
is a great start, it allows you to avoid the danger.  This is especially 
important if you travel alone.  TRUST YOUR GUT!  If something doesn't 
feel right - it ain't right.  Screw making people feel hurt.  Get out 
now!</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#2 - distance is your friend.  If you let someone near 
enough to touch you - you have already lost half the battle.  In most 
places the "21 foot rule" applies.  If someone is within a 21 foot circle 
from you, and is acting threatening, you would be justified in 
acting.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#3 - make a fuss.  The first moments of an attack or 
kidnapping are your best chance to escape.  Do not cooperate - FIGHT!  
Immediately and hard.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#4 - everything is a weapon.  Keys poking out between 
your fingers and punched into the attacker's eyes will usually end the 
fight.  But - remember #2?  Stand-off weapons are best.  MACE 
brand Pepper FOAM is a good choice if you will not consider a handgun.  
Don't get the cheap spray.  Pay the $$$, get the foam.  It has some 
advantages.  NOTE:  In Texas, pepper foam is simple assault.  If 
you would be justified in punching, you are justified in the use of pepper 
foam.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="038543900-20052008"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">#5 - I am licensed for and DO carry a handgun.  
ALWAYS.  So does my wife.  As do most of my friends.  No, I do 
not expect trouble.  If I expected trouble, I would carry my rifle - 
remember #2?  I do not expect to have a flat tire, but I have a 
spare.  I do not expect my house to burn, but I have a fire extinguisher 
and insurance too.  I usually also carry pepper foam.  But most 
attacks are swift, surprise is what the attacker is counting 
on.</font></span></div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: 'Bookman Old Style', 'serif'">While hiking in the woods it occurred to me that it probably wasn’t the safest thing to do – going out alone in a really large wooded area where there may or may not be other people around..  What if I fell down, got hurt, ran into a mugger, whatever.  I couldn’t find the boxes and kept hiking further and further into the wood, all the time letting my imagination get the better of me.  I had pretty much worked out every calamity I could think of and a had plan of action for most of them.</span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: 'Bookman Old Style', 'serif'"></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: maroon; FONT-FAMILY: 'Bookman Old Style', 'serif'">I was walking along a main trail and noticed a person coming toward that trail from a spur trail to my right.  I could just make them out through the trees.  It turns out that they got to the main trail at the same time as I got to the entrance to the trail they were on.   I looked up to say hello and noticed that the guy was all alone and was carrying a chainsaw.</span></div>

<div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;">Today I 
      went out to find a new series of letterboxes that had been planted over 
      the weekend.  The subject of the series is really interesting to me, 
      and the greenbelt where they are planted is close to my home.  So off 
      I go.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;"></span></div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;">While 
      hiking in the woods it occurred to me that it probably wasn't the safest 
      thing to do  going out alone in a really large wooded area where there 
      may or may not be other people around.  What if I fell down, got 
      hurt, ran into a mugger, whatever.  I couldn't find the boxes and 
      kept hiking further and further into the wood, all the time letting my 
      imagination get the better of me.  I had pretty much worked out every 
      calamity I could think of and a had plan of action for most of 
      them.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;"></span></div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;">I was 
      walking along a main trail and noticed a person coming toward that trail 
      from a spur trail to my right.  I could just make them out through 
      the trees.  It turns out that they got to the main trail at the same 
      time as I got to the entrance to the trail they were on.   I 
      looked up to say hello and noticed that the guy was all alone and was 
      carrying a chainsaw.</span></div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;"></span></div>
<div><span style="color: maroon;">He said 
      hello and went on to find the camping co-eds or whoever he was after but 
      it sure scared me.</span></div></div>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Well - the idea of self-defense is a very personal issue. 
There are several levels of force available.  the problem is, you really
do not get to choose - it gets chosen for you by the attacker.  But there
are a few things you can do to help.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>The #1 thing is to be alert and aware of your surroundings at ALL
TIMES.  This isn't just in the woods - it should get to be a life-time
thing.  Just knowing what is around you and sensing danger early is a
great start, it allows you to avoid the danger.  This is especially
important if you travel alone.  TRUST YOUR GUT!  If something doesn't
feel right - it ain't right.  Screw making people feel hurt.  Get out
now!</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>#2 - distance is your friend.  If you let someone near enough
to touch you - you have already lost half the battle.  In most places the
"21 foot rule" applies.  If someone is within a 21 foot circle
from you, and is acting threatening, you would be justified in acting.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>#3 - make a fuss.  The first moments of an attack or
kidnapping are your best chance to escape.  Do not cooperate -
FIGHT!  Immediately and hard.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>#4 - everything is a weapon.  Keys poking out between your
fingers and punched into the attacker's eyes will usually end the fight. 
But - remember #2?  Stand-off weapons are best.  MACE brand Pepper
FOAM is a good choice if you will not consider a handgun.  Don't get the
cheap spray.  Pay the $$$, get the foam.  It has some
advantages.  NOTE:  In Texas, pepper foam is simple assault.  If
you would be justified in punching, you are justified in the use of pepper
foam.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>#5 - I am licensed for and DO carry a handgun.  ALWAYS. 
So does my wife.  As do most of my friends.  No, I do not expect
trouble.  If I expected trouble, I would carry my rifle - remember
#2?  I do not expect to have a flat tire, but I have a spare.  I
do not expect my house to burn, but I have a fire extinguisher and insurance
too.  I usually also carry pepper foam.  But most attacks are swift,
surprise is what the attacker is counting on.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>White
- Oblivious to your surroundings. You should never be in white while awake.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>Yellow
- Alert to your surroundings, no particular threat(s) or danger.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>Orange
- Possible threats or danger nearby. You are alert and ready but action is not
eminent.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>Red
- You are in danger. Take appropriate action to ensure survival for you and
your family</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p><strong><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif"'>Black
- Action taken - threat(s) or danger neutralized.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>I have been accused of being more in ORANGE than YELLOW.  So
be it.  But just realizing that you are in white and trying to develop the
mindset to get into yellow is a good start.</span><o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>You really deserve a better reply than this.  Perhaps someone
can dig in the archives for my old message.  But my dog is very ill. 
I am afraid he will not be with us much longer.  8 years.  5 show
titles. A wall full of ribbons and photos.  Thousands of miles
travelled.  Hundreds of miles hiked.  Damn bone cancer.  So I am
going to sit with him for a while.  And is all 175 pounds of him lays on

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="color:#007F7F">This is interesting...my
husband and I were just having this particular conversation at the beginning of
the weekend.  On Thursday night, I was eagerly awaiting his home coming
from work, hoping he would agree to me having a little while to go letterboxing
by myself.  A friend from church was going to have a small get together
with some of her friends and introduce them to her newfound hobby of
letterboxing.  Not wanting them to get easily discouraged, I thought I
would go hunt the boxes prior to the meeting and make sure all was well. 
My husband thought I was nuts!!  He DID NOT want me to go to the park
alone...now this is a park I frequently go to with the kids and I really
couldn't understand the problem.  I did try to call a friend (who wants
NOTHING to do with lb'ing, but was the only person I thought available on
short notice), and I guess when he saw the downcast look on my face after she
said no, he caved.  </span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>

nervous, but I guess it was a good kind of nervous that kept me alert.</span></strong><o:p></o:p></p>
