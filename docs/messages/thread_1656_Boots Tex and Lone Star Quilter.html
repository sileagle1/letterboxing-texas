                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Lucy, we were up there Friday, but didn't get all the boxes <br/>
due to a lack of time.  We enjoyed reading your story.  When we were <br/>
at the Old North Church a couple came right behind us and followed us <br/>
around, or so it seemed.  We ended up stamping and replacing in the <br/>
dark. Maybe they were LB's and were waiting for us to leave. Sunshine <br/>
#2 had a short stay at the church.  Take good care of her.<br/>
