<div>You know, I've never felt badly about getting older.  I can honestly say every year has been better than the year before.  Even when we've had tough times and bad things have happened to us over the course of the year, we can look back and say we are better for those events and have grown because of, and sometimes in spite of, them.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - when I turned 40, life really, truly began!  I was old enough to know what the heck I wanted, and to do it.  Folks quit questioning my judgment, and if they thought I was odd for what I was doing, they somehow accepted it because - well - if nothing else it must be a mid-life crisis.  I quit caring what other folks think, and quit worrying about what other folks were doing.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I keep thinking - if the 40's are as great as they have been for me, what must 50 be like???  I can't wait to find out!<br/><br/> </div>

<p>This is Granny Butterfly with a son who moved to Baytown for Bayer. <br/>This weekend he drove the MS150 and called last night so excited. <br/>Again today he sounded simply exhilarated. He turned 40 so life must <br/>be beginning again for him there!! Just wanted to blow my horn a bit
