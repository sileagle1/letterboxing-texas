Hey all,<br/>
I checked on my Granbury Legends #2-John Wilkes Booth? tonight and <br/>
guess who had already stamped in?  The mysterious wanderer-Gryzzled <br/>
Gryphon!  I planted it Monday and he got to it Wed.!  <br/>
My son, The Pikachu Ponderer, joked that maybe he follows boxers <br/>
around stealthily, just waiting for one to plant, and then, <br/>
instantaneously-poof!  There he is!<br/>
BTW, The reason I was in Granbury tonight was because I took all the <br/>
little Samurai Stampers to the Brazos Drive-In.  If you haven't been, <br/>
and would like to have a mind-blowingly retro experience, go down <br/>
there and catch one of their Friday or Saturday double features!  What <br/>
a blast!  We loaded up the pickup with lawnchairs in the back, got our <br/>
popcorn and skittles and just enjoyed the whole ambience.  I believe <br/>
there are only 9 Drive-Ins left in TX now.  It felt like 1971 all over <br/>
again!<br/>
Also, thanks for all the help with the cammo tape search!<br/>

<p><span>Wow, I love drive-in, when we lived in Arizona, they
had a huge drive in and we would go, because we had a newborn baby -- so that
was great, she would go to sleep and we would get to watch movies, and of
course in AZ -- no mosquitos, but the neat thing about this drive in, was you
did have a mono speaker to hook to your window -- you would get your sound
through the FM radio, they would tell you what channel to tune into for which
screen.  I love drive in and wish that they were still popular.  That
might be worth the drive.   Curious where the other 8 are in

&gt; which screen.  I love drive in and wish that they were still <br/>
popular.<br/>
&gt; That might be worth the drive.   Curious where the other 8 are in <br/>
Texas?<br/>

&gt; Hey all,<br/>
&gt; I checked on my Granbury Legends #2-John Wilkes Booth? tonight and <br/>
&gt; guess who had already stamped in?  The mysterious wanderer-<br/>
Gryzzled <br/>
&gt; Gryphon!  I planted it Monday and he got to it Wed.!  <br/>
&gt; My son, The Pikachu Ponderer, joked that maybe he follows boxers <br/>
&gt; around stealthily, just waiting for one to plant, and then, <br/>
&gt; instantaneously-poof!  There he is!<br/>
&gt; BTW, The reason I was in Granbury tonight was because I took all <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; little Samurai Stampers to the Brazos Drive-In.  If you haven't <br/>
been, <br/>
&gt; and would like to have a mind-blowingly retro experience, go down <br/>
&gt; there and catch one of their Friday or Saturday double features!  <br/>
What <br/>
&gt; a blast!  We loaded up the pickup with lawnchairs in the back, got <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; popcorn and skittles and just enjoyed the whole ambience.  I <br/>
believe <br/>
&gt; there are only 9 Drive-Ins left in TX now.  It felt like 1971 all <br/>
over <br/>
&gt; again!<br/>
&gt; Also, thanks for all the help with the cammo tape search!<br/>
