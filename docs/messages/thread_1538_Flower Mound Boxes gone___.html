                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all,<br>
Papa Woodwoses here of MD, (Native Texan) I just wanted to pass on here <br>
that our, The Woodwoses, Flower Mound series are missing. We come back <br>
to TX for the holidays every year and planted this series in public <br>
parks that my family was involved in creating. I have recieved a number <br>
of delightful emails from folks about our series and read comments here <br>
about them. We checked all three yesterday and found 1 of 3. The Be <br>
Happy/Tiger Trail box was located and pulled, but the Flower Mound Mini <br>
and the Gerault Park boxes are definetly missing. I just have to say, <br>
that I've been boxing for awhile, and have lost a few boxes that I have <br>
planted, but losing these is really a bummer. I was really excited to <br>
read their logs and revamp them. So that is the boxing life, but I <br>
can't help but let it get me down. So we will be recreating the two <br>
missing ones, (and hopefully finding better hiding spots) and <br>
replanting all three. Additionally we hope to leave ya'll some extra <br>
boxes in the area to find when we head north..(and one HH we brought <br>
with us...ssshhhh....) so thanks to all for the Texas boxing (I keep <br>
hoping more would show up in the Lewisville/Flower Mound/Grapevine <br>
area...)and glad to contribute, watch for coming boxes, Happy Holidays,<br>
Much Peace and Happy Trails,<br>

<div>I'm one of those many local LBers who enjoyed finding your Flower 
Mound boxes and discovered places there I'd never known about in the process of 
searching for them.  I'm really surprised about the Flower Mound box going 
missing because it was so cleverly hidden I'd have thought it was really 
safe!  Hope you do plant more boxes, and then I'll go looking for them, 
too.  Thanks! -- Viewfinder </div></font></body></html>
