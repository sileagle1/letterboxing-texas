<br/>
I just wanted to share that I checked on a number of boxes in the Bastop area today, and all those mentioned in the newspaper recently were nice and dry and well hidden. <br/>
My little knife has been found, thank you to all of you who helped me look for it over the last year, and Pinch!Pinch! has swam away to be with his brothers.<br/>
Bastop parks all look good, but it's hard to find a place to pee when all of the underbrush has been burned away- smile. You could see evidence of fire, but the forests are still standing tall. <br/>
<br/>
WOW<br/>
