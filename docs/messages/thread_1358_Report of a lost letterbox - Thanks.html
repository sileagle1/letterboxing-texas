                    <div class="plaintext-content">I want to take this opportunity to publically thank<br/>
Mike for his efforts in the El Paso area.  At my<br/>
suggestion, he is trying to find three of the oldest<br/>
boxes in TX, and if found, make sure they stay safe.<br/>
Unfortunately, it looks like one of them is already<br/>
missing, but at least we know its status.  The other<br/>
two in Hueco Tanks SP will be tougher to find since they<br/>
may be in areas no longer accessible to the public<br/>
without a guide.  Thanks to Mike's association with<br/>
the rangers there he may be able to salvage them for<br/>
all of us to enjoy in the future.  I hate delegating<br/>
all this responsiblity to somebody else, especially<br/>
a new letterboxer, but Mike is the only letterboxer that <br/>
lives in the area and he has responded in true TX Letterboxer <br/>
manner!  Once I explained how special these boxes were he <br/>
volunteered to do his best.  Mike, I appreciate your<br/>
efforts and I'm looking forward to hearing more about your <br/>
future letterboxing adventures in West TX.<br/>

&gt; Good evening everyone.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	It was suggested I post this notice here so anyone on the <br/>
list would<br/>
&gt; not come looking for this letterbox.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/message/211<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	My daughter and I searched for it Saturday morning.  <br/>
Following the<br/>
&gt; clues, I found a place where I would place a box.  But it was <br/>
empty.  We<br/>
&gt; spent an hour checking every spot possible within 25 yards of the <br/>
area.  No<br/>
&gt; luck.  It was disappointing.  There are only TWO letterboxes in <br/>
the area for<br/>
&gt; me to find.  I found one.  I know EXACTLY where the other is.  I <br/>
am saving<br/>
&gt; it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I am going to search for these two after I return from the <br/>
dog show.<br/>
&gt; We have 3 dogs in the national finals, so we MUST attend.  My <br/>
hiking buddy<br/>
&gt; is headed for a blue ribbon this year!  Bless his big heart!<br/>

&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/message/212<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	I have already contacted the ranger, an old friend from the <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; park.  He will help with the search and clear the letterbox for <br/>
use if it is<br/>
&gt; not in a restricted area.  He will help put it in a safe area if <br/>
it needs to<br/>
&gt; be moved.  I will keep the group posted on the results.  I will do <br/>
my best<br/>
&gt; to get them reactivated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Y-all have a fine Sunday evening.<br/>

  to hike with me too.  She got married a year ago.  Yesterday was her 
  first outing with old dad after over a year.  And her introduction to 
  letterboxing (she already Geocaches).  Well - she was sucking wind so bad

  adventures.  And there are NO letterboxes that I can find in Southern New 
  Mexico.  The Great Dane National Show is in Chandler AZ.  I hope 
  there are a few letterboxes there.  My dog and I are up only one 
  day.  The other 9 might get boring for us.  My wife will be much

  yesterday's hike to the Elephant's Trunk took me within 3 feet of that last 
  letterbox.  I know exactly where it is, but I am saving it for another 
  day.  I do hope the ones at Hueco Tanks work out.  If they were 
  hidden well, it is possible that they still survive.  I will do my best
