                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to tell you all about a recent incident involving a geocacher, a letterbox and a state park.  Some of you know that, last week, LSQ and I went to Cedar Hill SP to replace my box called "Talala" and repair her box called "Moosetake on the Lake", which was reported to have a missing stamp.  We made complete new boxes for both just in case.  Her box had been hidden in a large hollow stump, and when we got to the stump, there was a large ammo-box geocache in there, but no letterbox.  Since we didn't want to put the replacement box in the same hole with the geocache, I started scouting out a new hiding spot while LSQ sat on the bench and opened the ammo box.  Her letterbox was in the geocache box!  We took it with us and placed the new one in a different spot but close by.  Last night, Barefoot Lucy called me to tell me that a complaint about LSQ's box had been filed, apparently by the staff at the park.  It, in effect, said that LSQ had stolen a part of the geocache and created a letterbox from it, which she had placed about 50 feet away.  He was pretty irate and stated the rules about filing a permit and said that her box and my "Talala" box were both being picked up and held by park staff.  After discussing various scenarios with BL, we decided that the writer of the email must be the geocacher and not the ranger, and that I should call the park this morning and talk to the him about the situation, which I did.  In fact, I had a nice long talk with him in which he gained some insight into letterboxing, with which he was unfamiliar, and I gained some knowledge about state park policy, or at least Cedar Hill State Park policy.  He was extremely nice and understanding.  He was familiar with geocaching and knew that there were caches in the park.  He said that they didn't mind them being in the park as long as they were aware of them and their location, in case they created a problem, and that the same policy would apply to letterboxes.  By the way, he didn't know the person who sent in the complaint and he did not have our letterboxes, but said that if they showed up he would call me.  He did ask that if we place letterboxes there, we either request a permit by email before we come or stop by the office.  He also said that the permits could be renewed by email and that it wasn't necessary to revisit the park.  He asked me to forward the email complaint and said that he was going to contact the guy and tell him that he had no right to pick up anything in the park, including letterboxes, which remained the personal property of the placer.  LSQ and I have decided that, in the future, anytime we place a box in a state park, we will first obtain a permit, and if the park doesn't want a letterbox there, we'll put it somewhere else.  It might be worth a try for all of us to consider doing that the next time we visit a Texas state park.  Just make a letterbox and stop by the office on your way in and ask to fill out a permit (or get one by email in advance).  Offer to show them your letterbox if they are interested and brag on their park.  I never met a Texas State Park I couldn't honestly brag on.  If they don't want it there, place it somewhere else. The experience we had with the park personnel at Mission Tejas SP convinced me that maybe other parks may be willing to host letterboxes if we approach them in the right way.  At least, maybe we could identify some that are okay with letterboxing and others that are not.   It might be worth a try.  What do you think?  By the way, we are retiring those two boxes since we don't know if they are there or not.  If anyone happens to be visiting Cedar Hill SP, maybe you could check on them for us, even if they are listed as retired. Thanks.<br/>

<div></div>
<div>It's really good to know that we can renew by email. I hope that's true at all state parks, and not just Cedar Hill.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When I first started out, several of my boxes were in state parks. Since the new policy went in place, I've struggled with the idea of asking permission because it seemed cumbersome, especially on the renewal process. I've opted not to hide anything in state parks any longer. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I would, however, be willing to try planting one in a state park going through the proper process to see how it goes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The problem I see with Texas new policy on letterboxing/geocaching in state parks is that it isn't consistently applied. Some parks seem to prefer not to be bothered with the paperwork, while others want to go overboard. It makes it hard to know how far to go in any given place.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I wonder if we might not come up with a list of questions we would like to know about the process practiced in each park: Here are some I can think of: 1) Does your park allow letterboxes? 2) Do you allow email renewals? 3) What information do you require to place a box? 4) Does the same person that planted a box have to file a renewal? Other things I would like to know is what procedure the park uses to confiscate unauthorized boxes - do they hold them for the planter or do they destroy them? Do they contact the placer or do they contact the website? Do they actively pursue boxes that are unauthorized or do they only deal with them if they stumble across them?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I think it would be interesting to know the mindset of various park superintendents. As an example, the ranger BT talked to at Cedar Hill recognizes that stashing games bring people to his park that might not otherwise be there, so he sees the value. That's good information. It also sounded like the permit was more of a means for him to keep order in his park rather than a way for him to be restrictive on park visitors. He used an example of an ammo can geocache that someone stumbled across and thought was an explosive device. Because he knew the stash was there, he was able to assure them it was a geocache and not a bomb. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I think a little knowledge would go a long way toward helping us understand where and how we can successfully plant in state parks, and even in other areas.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that compromising existing boxes is a real concern and I'm glad you brought it up, Silver Eagle.  When the geocacher picked up our two boxes at Cedar Hill (if he really did), he had to find my box on either LbNA or Atlas Quest, but our boxes were listed near the city of Cedar Hill.  He probably didn't find the other two boxes in the park because they were listed as being near Dallas.  Those two boxes have been there a long time and are historic letterboxes.  When we do go into a park to place a box, we shouldn't volunteer any information or knowledge about other boxes in the park, in my opinion.  Of course, when the park personnel become aware of letterboxing, they may get curious and search for them online.  I guess there's nothing we can do about that.  It would be a pretty big job to try to permit every existing box, especially for those who have a lot of boxes in state parks.  Maybe we should only worry about existing boxes if they are confiscated by the ranger, and try to get them permitted by email at that point.  I think TPWD is going to have to realize, like the Cedar Hill ranger does, that Letterboxing is here to stay and that it is a legitimate family-friendly recreation activity, and not an extreme, Devil-may-care sport that ignores the policies and environmental concerns of our parks.  I wish they would somehow agree to meet with us on a state level so we could convince them that letterboxing is not a destructive activity.  Since most of them are aware of geocaching, we could put one of those huge ammo boxes on the table and, next to it, one of your film cannister letterboxes and say, "This is a geocache.  This is a letterbox."  Maybe that would make a point.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Based on some of our past problems, I usually don't list the name of the state park in the location of my clues, hoping the powers that be won't come across my clues if they run a search. However if they were to check "Weches" or the nearest town to the park, they would certainly pop up! Adding a few mean-spirited geocachers to the mix makes it a more daunting task to protect our boxes. Maybe we need to put our future box locations in a code which you can only access by being a member of the Texas list or writing to the placer of the box.<br/>

&gt; I will try contacting the person John recommended to me at TX Parks &amp; Recreation and ask some of these questions, but I suspect I will just get the standard answer of needing same permits as geocaches.

I've already got so many boxes in State Parks that getting permits for them would be a real pain, even if I could do it all by email, but I guess I would do it if that would guarantee no confiscation.

&gt; &gt; Those are very relevent questions, BL.  I think Silver Eagle has some contact information that was given to him by Ranger John Tatum at Mission Tejas, so he may have some ideas as well.  You are right that it seems like each park makes their own rules and we can't seem to get any response on a state level. We may have to work on them one park at a time and eventually, we'll have an idea of which parks are welcoming and which are not.  The ranger I talked to recognizes that this is a new form of recreation and that it's something that has to be addressed.  He would rather control the boxes than ban them, and the way he does that is to keep a file of the permits.  He even said that if our two boxes had been turned in, he would go to the website and find out where they were located and replace them for me.

&gt; I think that compromising existing boxes is a real concern and I'm glad you brought it up, Silver Eagle.  When the geocacher picked up our two boxes at Cedar Hill (if he really did), he had to find my box on either LbNA or Atlas Quest, but our boxes were listed near the city of Cedar Hill.  He probably didn't find the other two boxes in the park because they were listed as being near Dallas.  Those two boxes have been there a long time and are historic letterboxes.  When we do go into a park to place a box, we shouldn't volunteer any information or knowledge about other boxes in the park, in my opinion.  Of course, when the park personnel become aware of letterboxing, they may get curious and search for them online.  I guess there's nothing we can do about that.  It would be a pretty big job to try to permit every existing box, especially for those who have a lot of boxes in state parks.  Maybe we should only worry about existing boxes if they are confiscated by the ranger, and try to get them permitted by email at that point.  I think TPWD is going to have to realize, like the Cedar Hill ranger does, that Letterboxing is here to stay and that it is a legitimate family-friendly recreation activity, and not an extreme, Devil-may-care sport that ignores the policies and environmental concerns of our parks.  I wish they would somehow agree to meet with us on a state level so we could convince them that letterboxing is not a destructive activity.  Since most of them are aware of geocaching, we could put one of those huge ammo boxes on the table and, next to it, one of your film cannister letterboxes and say, "This is a geocache.  This is a letterbox."  Maybe that would make a point.<br/>

He probably didn't find the other two boxes in the park because they were listed as being near Dallas.  Those two boxes have been there a long time and are historic letterboxes.  When we do go into a park to place a box, we shouldn't volunteer any information or knowledge about other boxes in the park, in my opinion.  Of course, when the park personnel become aware of letterboxing, they may get curious and search for them online.  I guess there's nothing we can do about that.  It would be a pretty big job to try to permit every existing box, especially for those who have a lot of boxes in state parks.  Maybe we should only worry about existing boxes if they are confiscated by the ranger, and try to get them permitted by email at that point.  I think TPWD is going to have to realize, like the Cedar Hill ranger does, that Letterboxing is here to stay and that it is a legitimate family-friendly recreation activity, and not an extreme, Devil-may-care sport that ignores the policies and environmental concerns of our parks.  I wish they would somehow agree to meet with us on a state level so we could convince them that letterboxing is not a destructive activity.  Since most of them are aware of geocaching, we could put one of those huge ammo boxes on the table and, next to it, one of your film cannister letterboxes and say, "This is a geocache.  This is a letterbox."  Maybe that would make a point.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will try contacting the person John recommended to me at TX Parks &amp; Recreation and ask some of these questions, but I suspect I will just get the standard answer of needing same permits as geocaches.  I think our best bet will be what Boots did:  approaching each State Park on an individual basis.  I used to worry about existing boxes being compromised, but we are probably past that now.  I've already got so many boxes in State Parks that getting permits for them would be a real pain, even if I could do it all by email, but I guess I would do it if that would guarantee no confiscation.  Thanks for finding this out for us, Boots.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Those are very relevent questions, BL.  I think Silver Eagle has some contact information that was given to him by Ranger John Tatum at Mission Tejas, so he may have some ideas as well.  You are right that it seems like each park makes their own rules and we can't seem to get any response on a state level. We may have to work on them one park at a time and eventually, we'll have an idea of which parks are welcoming and which are not.  The ranger I talked to recognizes that this is a new form of recreation and that it's something that has to be addressed.  He would rather control the boxes than ban them, and the way he does that is to keep a file of the permits.  He even said that if our two boxes had been turned in, he would go to the website and find out where they were located and replace them for me.  Maybe he'll send someone out to see if they are still in place. He is even a member of geocaching.com so he can look up caches if he needs to, so he may be joining LbNA for the same reason.  Any suggestions  are welcome.  I don't think we can keep fighting them, but I like to find and place boxes in our state parks, so we'll see how it goes.  We placed 4 boxes in 2 state parks last week and, unfortunately, it's too late to get permits for them, so they're posted as sort of mysterious boxes.  All boxes we place in the future will be permitted.  If it becomes cumbersome, we'll just stop placing boxes in state parks, but that would be a shame.<br/>
