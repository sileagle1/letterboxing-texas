&gt; On 7/14 we found <br/>
&gt; Polly's Paws in Lewisville- alive and well.  A<br/>
&gt; fabulous park I did <br/>
&gt; not know existed even with all of my baseball field<br/>
&gt; travels these past two years.\<br/>
<br/>
That's my an my husband's box. Thanks for the status<br/>
update on it. I need to go by and see who else has<br/>
logged in. I'm glad you enjoied the park! Polly says<br/>
hello!<br/>
<br/>
We haven't been out boxing lately. I've gone back to<br/>
school and I just got a job this week so we haven't<br/>
been tramping around any woods. I FINALLY finished<br/>
healing form all my bug bites. So when the weather<br/>
cools down, I'm sure we'll start lbing again.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I cant speak about anything but the barn raising <br/>
it is in the very early planning stages, so all that<br/>
is known is what you have.  It IS October 23rd and it<br/>
IS in Waxahachie.  It will be an all day affair.<br/>
<br/>
As Im sure you know, an old-fashioned barn raising<br/>
was held when new settlers came along.  The neighbors<br/>
gathered together and raised a barn for them in a day,<br/>
so they could get their farm working.  If these events<br/>
didnt happen, often settlers were doomed for failure<br/>
or at least an uphill struggle.  In the same vein,<br/>
its difficult to get and keep new letterboxers if<br/>
there are no boxes around for them to find.  Because<br/>
barn raisings are synonymous with the great frontier,<br/>
and since Texans still have a great frontier attitude,<br/>
it seemed only appropriate that we do our own sort of<br/>
barn-raising!<br/>
<br/>
Johnson, Ellis, and Navarro counties currently have no<br/>
boxes (although they will probably have a couple<br/>
between them before the barn raising happens).   We<br/>
would like to go ahead and seed these three counties<br/>
with boxes on the premise that If you plant them,<br/>
they will come.  So on October 23rd we will all<br/>
arrive and spread out and plant boxes in the morning,<br/>
then come together around lunch time and share a meal<br/>
and do exchanges and possibly have a couple of other<br/>
fun activities.  After weve spent some time together,<br/>
well head out and go find the boxes we planted, but<br/>
leaving them for letterboxers-yet-to-come.  <br/>
<br/>
My intent is to reserve a pavilion in a park in<br/>
Waxahachie to serve as home base and for us to gather<br/>
at.  There is no camping except RV camping in<br/>
Waxahachie, but theres camping at Bardwell Lake about<br/>
twenty miles away.  I imagine my family will camp at<br/>
Bardwell both Friday and Saturday nights.<br/>
<br/>
Im in the process of gathering information about the<br/>
area, including town names, parks and trails, history<br/>
and that sort of thing so that we can come prepared<br/>
with boxes ready to plant.  I had a really, really<br/>
cool website all fixed up, until my computer made<br/>
confetti of it!  Ill rebuild it this weekend and add<br/>
to it as we get more information together!<br/>
<br/>
Look to Ruby Tuesday for t-shirt info!<br/>
