<br/>
<br/>
Placed today (10/31) and on letterboxing.org (not on atlas yet)<br/>
<br/>
King Tut II   (replaced King Tut who was bulldozed).  This is really <br/>
version one stamp down with razor, then I got speedball tool and made a <br/>
better one, who was<br/>
the original King Tut.  If you got a stamp of the good image, can you scan <br/>
and email me!  [Egypt, TX - technically]<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All Wrapped Up -  A Halloween based stamp, notice the placed date.  In <br/>
general vicinity of where another lost stamp (Pen the tail on the pony) <br/>
was, but different section of park.  [Magnolia/Conroe/Woodlands - TX]<br/>
<br/>
Red Dragon microbox - placed actually about two weeks ago in Huntsville <br/>
State Park,  there is an admission fee here!<br/>
<br/>
Tibetan Tiger - this was a project between MonkeyToes and I.  We each <br/>
prepared a box and we traded when I visited Victoria, so I hid his in my <br/>
area, and he'll hide mine in Victoria.<br/>
Located in the other section of Mercer Park.  [Spring, TX]<br/>
<br/>
Stallions - placed also in West side of Mercer Park.  Now the 4th stamp at <br/>
the park, so definitely worth a visit!  [Spring, TX]<br/>
<br/>
we missed placing one at the Sam Houston Statue gift shop by 5 minutes.  So <br/>
around mid November, should be there!<br/>
