after being gone for a month. We went to Ohio to visit our daughter and <br/>
Granny Butterfly and Coffee Mug planned a mini meet for us. I have you <br/>
all know that Ohio letterboxers are as much fun to be with as we Texas <br/>
letterboxers are and just as crazy,strange as we are too. Picked up a <br/>
cootie while we were there too. I have scratched and scratched but I <br/>
have not gotten rid of it yet. You can read about the event and see <br/>
pictures here http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=974. I <br/>
hope that worked. There are photos and other neet things to check out.<br/>
We enjoyed the party very much. Thanks Granny Butterfly and everyone <br/>
for such a great time.<br/>
