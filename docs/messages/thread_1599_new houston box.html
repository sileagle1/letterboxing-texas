<div>Yesterday it occurred to me that somehow I have 
come to understand that when my baby makes a certain funny sound in the back of 
her throat that she is telling me, "Look!  A dog!" and I started thinking 
about how amazing it is when babies learn to talk, and even more amazing is that 
parents learn to understand.  In honor of this great parent-child exchange 
I have placed a new box, "Gibberish".  Have fun!

<div>Just finished posting a 
new delightful Houston area box, "Fairy Talk".  This one is dedicated to 
our own dear Dewberry, for all the hair I have pulled out of my own head solving 
her puzzles.  (That being said, I'm sure she will have the puzzle solved 
before she goes to bed tonight!)  Enjoy!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">See, I've been pining away for more mystery boxes and aren't you a<br/>
dear to oblige.  We should be back at you with another one tomorrow<br/>
called The Saurus Rex, but it'll be a fairly easy one to solve. <br/>
(Warning: because of the way I want to set up the clues, this one may<br/>
be listed solely on Atlas quest).<br/>
<br/>
Now, back to your puzzle.  Apparently, I don't speak fairy talk<br/>
because the answer is not immediately apparent.  I was expecting<br/>
Elvish (possibly because the boys have been on a LOTR kick).  Will<br/>
have to let this one percolate!<br/>
<br/>
Great job!<br/>
<br/>
Dewberry<br/>
<br/>
ps I have had quite a few of my boxes go missing recently.  I am<br/>
updating the listings as I check on them or get confirmed reports. <br/>
Missing boxes will in all probability not be replaced.  My preference<br/>
would be to pull the clues on retired boxes from LBNA, but that will<br/>
cause people to lose credit for that Find so I'm open to leaving them<br/>
if that's the general preference.  <br/>

<div>Please let Armadillo Girl know that her idea for a teacher gift is the 
coolest!  Being a teacher, I would love it if one of my students came up 
with such a creative idea.  I can't wait to go out this summer ( just two 
more days until summer vacation!!) and find "An Apple for My Teacher"!</div>
