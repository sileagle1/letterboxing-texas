Heck, I don't even know when earth day is but I agree that Leave No <br>
Trace is such a good idea. When we get to a place close to a box, we <br>
think "Where is this box?" and instead of reading the clues and <br>
checking out the trees and underbrush, we just look for the trail off <br>
the main path and sure enough, there is the box. Not good but works <br>
most of the time. Also, we then try to disguise the trail somehow <br>
with sticks, leaves or other underbrush. More than once we have spent <br>
more time disguising the trail to the box than stamping in. Another <br>
point we want to make is wash your hands before you touch a box <br>
because if you have been eating, you have smells of food on your <br>
hands and that can transfere to the box. Wild animals can smell food <br>
fragance that you may leave on the box.<br>
<br>
Yesterday we went to the Athen's Arboretum to check on <br>
our "Children's Stories and Rhymes Series". We appreciate all the <br>
people who have log their finds in the books. Some of the boxes are <br>
on their 3rd. Logbooks. All were fine except LITTLE MISS MUFFET. Even <br>
the log that it was in is missing. Also, when we check on our boxes, <br>
we also check on Catpawzw2004 Texas Passport Series #1 in the same <br>
Arboretum. We found it missing also. Someone may have taken it for <br>
maintains and will replace it but we wanted to let Catspawz2004 know.<br>

<div> </div>
<div>You are so right about the handwashing thing - it should really be a part of a letterboxer's LNT because we are handling something and leaving it behind.  I always try to rub my hands in the local dirt to disquise my own human-y odor as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>FYI - Catpawz is pretty much out of the game, at least for the time being.  I have no idea why, except that life sometimes gets in the way, but it's quite a shame because they (it's a pair of women) are hilariously funny and really good letterboxers besides.  I ran into them in the Hobby Lobby parking lot in Tyler around February of last year - I was walking out to my car and a car screeched up behind me and these voices were yelling "HEY LUCYYY!".  I turned around to see the two of them hanging their heads out their car windows yelling at me.  Now bear in mind, I'm from Jacksonville and they are from Greenville and we bumped into each other in Tyler.  Top it off with I had been trying just that week to get in touch with them regarding their box, Gephyrophobia, which had been in the Footbridge Park in Rusk.  We had a really nice visit and they said at that time that they had simply not had time to box and weren't sure when they would again.  I would go ahead and send that message to them, but don't be surprised if you don't get a response.  They said they check that email account occasionally, but it's often so full they just have to delete everything. <br/>
