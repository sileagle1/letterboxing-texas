&gt;<br/>
Heck, I don't even know when earth day is but I agree that Leave No <br/>
Trace is such a good idea. When we get to a place close to a box, we <br/>
think "Where is this box?" and instead of reading the clues and <br/>
checking out the trees and underbrush, we just look for the trail off <br/>
the main path and sure enough, there is the box. Not good but works <br/>
most of the time. Also, we then try to disguise the trail somehow <br/>
with sticks, leaves or other underbrush. More than once we have spent <br/>
more time disguising the trail to the box than stamping in. Another <br/>
point we want to make is wash your hands before you touch a box <br/>
because if you have been eating, you have smells of food on your <br/>
hands and that can transfere to the box. Wild animals can smell food <br/>
fragance that you may leave on the box.<br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we went to the Athen's Arboretum to check on <br/>
our "Children's Stories and Rhymes Series". We appreciate all the <br/>
people who have log their finds in the books. Some of the boxes are <br/>
on their 3rd. Logbooks. All were fine except LITTLE MISS MUFFET. Even <br/>
the log that it was in is missing. Also, when we check on our boxes, <br/>
we also check on Catpawzw2004 Texas Passport Series #1 in the same <br/>
Arboretum. We found it missing also. Someone may have taken it for <br/>
maintains and will replace it but we wanted to let Catspawz2004 know.<br/>
