                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, the River Legacy Haunts boxes are in place.  I'll warn y'all  <br>
ahead of time, they are in high traffic areas, literally!  Two are  <br>
right off very busy roads.  One is off a very busy trail.  I'll be  <br>
surprised if they last until after Halloween, but if they do, I plan  <br>
to move the Screaming Bridge and Hell's Gate to the actual (very  <br>
secluded) locations of the haunts at a later date.  I just couldn't  <br>
do it with my kids.<br>
<br>
Oh, one more warning: if you go for Hobo when the wind is out of the  <br>
south, beware the smell.  You'll be downwind of the city dump.   <br>
You'll likely want to get out of there as quickly as possible...and  <br>
not just because of the smell! (Evil laugh!!!)<br>
<br>
Another hint: find these at night if at all possible.  Your chances  <br>
of encountering something "out of the ordinary" are much greater.   <br>
Spooooooky!  The park is open until 10:00pm.<br>
