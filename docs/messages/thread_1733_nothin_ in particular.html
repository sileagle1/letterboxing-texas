</p><div>I was just cleaning my pocket knife today and "thinking" - yes, sometimes I think. Anyway, Viewfinder and I were out letterboxing yesterday, and between the two of us, we used up all the extra plastic bags we brought with us to replace any ripped or missing bags we might find. We found one box where the logbook was totally saturated with water and the stamp was beginning to mildew, and we had to use my pocket knife to pry open a couple of Altoid can boxes that had begun to rust (unfortunately I don't carry steel wool and WD-40 in my backpack, but maybe I should). Anyway, just thinking, if anyone ever finds any of my boxes that need attention, please email me and let me know so I can take care of them. We were thinking yesterday how sad it is to go to all the work of finding a box, only to find you may not be able to open it because it had rusted closed or the logbook is too wet to stamp. I would be so sad if I lost all those wonderful stamps in my logbooks. That it... nothin' in particular....</div>

<br>
I've only come across one logbook that was so terribly<br>
damaged I couldn't stamp in.  I was taken by surprise<br>
by how disappointed I was in that - more disappointed<br>
I think than not being able to find a box at all.  <br>
<br>
I know some folks are very possessive of their boxes<br>
even after they've released them into the wild, but I<br>
tend to think of it more on terms of "It takes a<br>
village to care for a box..."  Once a box is in the<br>
wild, we all have a responsibility to look after it if<br>
we want to perpetuate the hobby, and taking care of it<br>
includes doing a little first aid if possible and<br>
notifying the owner if they need to go tend to the<br>
box.<br>
