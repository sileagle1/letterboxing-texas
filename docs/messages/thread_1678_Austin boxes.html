the area from 1st Ave. I think up to the edge of the University. I don't <br>
really know Austin areas so can anyone give me a hint at what boxes are in <br>
this section? I am thinking the bat one and  the one at the Cemetery are in <br>
that area.<br>

Clues for Eoghan's boxes in Bastrop and Buescher State Parks.<br>

Note: O-Knot #2 is gone as it was destroyed by fire. O-Knot #3 and 4<br>
were there in September 2005 as well as Lost Pines.<br>

Lost Pines Letterbox<br>
---------------------------------------------------------------------<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
Treasure Type: Letterbox<br>
Location: Buescher State Park<br>
Near: Smithville, TX<br>
Placed on: 11/04/00<br>
Terrain difficulty:  ( for shortcut)<br>
Overall difficulty:<br>
<br>
Directions: Begin the hike on the Buescher Hiking Trail, across from<br>
the Lakeview walk-in camping area. After 2.2 miles, take the left<br>
path towards Park Road 1C (to the Pine Gulch trail). You can also<br>
begin the hike here by parking your car on the side of the road. The<br>
trail crosses the road at 0.3 miles past the UT Cancer Research<br>
Center entrance. Approximately a third of a mile after the trail<br>
crosses the road, there is a small wooden foot bridge over an<br>
arroyo. From the bridge go 30 to 35 steps back down the trail to the<br>
south. The letterbox is located approximately 30 feet up the slope<br>
of the hill beneath a small pile of rocks.<br>
<br>
<br>
O-Knots<br>

<br>
Treasure Type: Letterbox series<br>
Placed on: 11/10/01<br>
State: Texas<br>
County: Bastrop<br>
Nearest Town: Bastrop<br>
Park: Bastrop State Park<br>
Terrain difficulty:<br>
Overall difficulty:<br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
To locate the four O-knots hidden in this park you will need to<br>
purchase ($3) an orienteering map from the park headquarters when<br>
you enter the park. There are two maps available; buy the one that<br>
shows the numbered locations of the permanent control points. Each<br>
of the letterboxes contains a circular ('O') celtic knot stamp and<br>
is located near one of the permanent orienteering ('O') control<br>
markers shown on the map. (One of the markers is shown in the<br>
picture to the right.) Each box is in the base of a tree trunk at<br>
the bearing and distance from the control marker shown on the table<br>
below. Also indicated is the type of tree or other clue that will<br>
help you locate each box.<br>
<br>
Knot # Control # Bearing Distance Location<br>
1        87       240   90' in base of dead pine tree<br>
2        29        74   85' in base of small oak tree<br>
3        71       180   50' in east end of rotting log<br>
4        91       346   20' double-trunk oak at top of ditch,<br>
beneath rocks<br>

<div>Depending on where she will be "downtown," there are quite a few along the 
trail by Town Lake that runs through downtown near several of the hotels between 
I35 and Zilker Park, and of course, there are several good ones in Zilker Park, 
which isn't far from there if she likes to walk, and it's accessible from the 
Town Lake Trail.   One of my favorites is in Oakwood Cemetery, just 
across I35 from downtown, a possibility.  And I think there are a couple on 
or near the UT campus.  Maybe she should check the clues and then look up 
the areas on Mapquest to see where they are from where she'll be. . . </div>
