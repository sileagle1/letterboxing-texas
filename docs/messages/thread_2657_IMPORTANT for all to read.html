                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I just played a bit of moderator sneakiness and put JB <br>
Kokopelli on nomail so I could send this without her knowing.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow is JBK's birthday and I happen to know this because she <br>
mentions it in the clues of her March Holiday Series.  <br>
<br>
Besides becoming quite a prolific Texas planter, she returned a few <br>
days ago from a trip on which she placed 30 boxes across the South.  <br>
30 boxes...In a week!  She has also begun the monthly holiday series <br>
which I and others have been enjoying.  Obviously, she is really <br>
contributing to our letterboxing enjoyment.<br>
<br>
We all also know she's had a tough road this past year.  Her good <br>
friend Joan passed away, someone she shared several of her favorite <br>
hobbies with, including letterboxing.  However, even though you can <br>
tell she feels it deeply, she never complains, never looks for <br>
sympathy - she faces it matter-of-factly and deals with it.  I really <br>
admire her for that and I hope that when I lose someone close to me I <br>
can do the same.  I feel very fortunate to count her among the many <br>
friends I've made while letterboxing.<br>
<br>
ANYWAY- would you each take the time to send her a birthday message <br>
tomorrow?  Her email address is tigger32167@yahoo.com.  If you really <br>
wanted to do something special for her, you could plant a box in her <br>
honor.  Or do something else kind for her.  And if you aren't so <br>
inclined - that's cool too.  Just thought I'd mention the <br>
opportunity...<br>
