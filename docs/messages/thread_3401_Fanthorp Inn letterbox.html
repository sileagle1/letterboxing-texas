<div>What a shame!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Boots, remember when you hid your governor series letterbox at Sparkman Hillcrest Cemetery in Dallas, and they gave you an escort to the governor's grave? That's also the cemetery where I later planted "The Mick" letterbox and spent practically an hour wandering around the mausoleum looking for Mickey Mantle's memorial because after your experience, I was afraid to ask where it was!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is also the cemetery where our dear friend Ruby Tuesday has been laid to rest. I know she'd love the fact that there are two letterboxes planted nearby! Yesterday, Viewfinder and I wanted to pay a visit to her gravesite, but I couldn't find it. Finally we had to go to the office and ask. We were actually happy we did, because not only did we get a ride right to her grave, but we also got a tour of the other "famous" gravesites in the cemetery. Our guide was extremely nice. Anyway, it brought a smile to my face as we were riding in the van around the cemetery, remembering your very similar experience.</div>
