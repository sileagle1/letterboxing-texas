<div>Most of the loose moose are around Lake Grapevine (between Dallas and Ft Worth). After the "Meese Meet" gathering last November at the lake, we met at La Madelines in Grapevine for coffee (pastries, wine and other goodies). Maybe August 21st would be a good time for all of us that are available to get together again to meet our friend, MoWizLiz, for an exchange and treats at La Mads. By the way, MoWizLiz... going on a moose hunt in late August in Texas requires lots of water on the trails. Looking for to your visit!</div>

<div>Today we drove by Wilson Creek in McKinney which flows behind our neighborhood. This is the creek where Baby Bear <em>had</em> his box hidden under a bridge. The water was above the bridge today, and streets were closed all around it. This is the same area I took my little hike in the lightning a couple of days ago. We are presently getting another huge storm. Whenever possible, I try to put a substantial rock on top of my boxes when I plant them, but they don't always get replaced, so it will be interesting to see what survives all this rain (which is in the forecast for the next seven days). I LOVE Texas - I truly do - it never ceases to amaze me how we can go from a terrible drought straight into floods and more rain than our swollen rivers can handle.</div>
