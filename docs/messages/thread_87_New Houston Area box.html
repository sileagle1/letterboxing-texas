                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Well, I finally got around and posted the clues for a new box.  The <br>
name of it is "Hershey's Kiss", and the placer is Mother of Four.  <br>
It's a great park to visit for a family bike ride, if you are so <br>
inclined.  Baby bear...we took a very similar trip two weeks ago <br>
(except for the wineries, because we had all four kids with us!)  We <br>
also camped at Kerrville, now we'll have to go back to look for your <br>
box.  I doubt there is any place on earth more beautiful that the <br>
hill country in the springtime!<br>
