                    <div class="plaintext-content">TeamKing and I found this box the other day.  The company that owns<br>
the land had marked with purple blazes the area you are supposed to<br>
stay out of.  It was unclear to us as we followed the trail along the<br>
creek whether this area was part of the restricted-access area.  But<br>
then, that mess of trails is pretty confusing to begin with.<br>
<br>
Nice box, pretty walk, though.  Glad the mosquitos weren't out.<br>
