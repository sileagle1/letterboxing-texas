                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last week my husband and I made a quick road trip from Keller to KY, <br>
and managed a rest stop on I40 in Arkansas to find Wanda&Pete's <br>
LB, "Adding a Splash of Color."  Nice little roadside treat!  Hurricane <br>
Dennis literally put a damper on most of my letterbox plans, but on the <br>
way home we did manage three little hikes in the Ozarks, finding <br>
TxLuvBug's "B is for Branson" at a very scenic overlook NW of Branson, <br>
and then two nice woodsy walks at Roaring River State Park to <br>
find "Springhouse Trail" and "Devil's Kitchen" planted by Skipper.  <br>
Lucky for us, the weather was sort of cool and the rains stopped long <br>
enough for us to make these hikes!  Others will have to wait for <br>
another time, due to the weather and enough twisty mountain road <br>
driving for two days.  I did manage to carve a new little HH <br>
stamp, "Chick Tracks," and drop it off in one of those Ozarks spots to <br>
begin its travels, though.  Maybe it will make it around to some of <br>
those LBs I couldn't get to this time!  -- Viewfinder of tx2chic.<br>
