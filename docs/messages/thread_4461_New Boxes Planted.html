JB Kokopelli has planted a huge amount of boxes over the weekend, and the clues are amazing!  I hope to be able to hunt them soon, but know I won't be able to get out there soon enough to be first finder.  The clues (or rather, the stories behind the clues) are so clever!  I hope the rest of you enjoy seeking after these boxes as I am sure I will.<br>
<br>
(The clues I saw were posted on the AQ, I am not sure whether they have been posted on LBNA or not.)<br>

week, during our Circle Tour 2010 spring break "trip".  We usually 
road-trip while JBK is off school, but this year she came up to DFW to spend the 
week with me and we covered the area as best we could.  I've still got a 
few plants to announce myself.  We both hope everyone has a good time 
visiting some new sites!</font></span></div><br/>
