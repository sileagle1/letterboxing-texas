Letterbox:  The Jewerly Box got planted today.  A month after we <br>
planned.  We have been way more crazy than we expected.  I am letting <br>
you guys know this because there has been 31 hits on the clue.  She is <br>
very excited about this box.  And helped carve some of the stamps <br>
herself.<br>
  Monkey Biz says hi Boots-Tex.  For the ones that don't know...  Her <br>
1st box to find was one of his. She was also the 1st finder of that <br>
box.  And her 1st HH was one of his. <br>
Thanks To ALL for this Great experience.  And the AWESOME adventures <br>
ahead.<br>
