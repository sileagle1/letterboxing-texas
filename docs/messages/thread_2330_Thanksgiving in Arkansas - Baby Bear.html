Thanksgiving.   We headed out Thursday morning, plowing through East <br>
Texas to DeKalb, where we visited Hoss and his letterbox, then on to <br>
SE Oklahoma and Beavers Bend S.P.   Found 5 boxes, and placed one.  <br>
Also had turkey lunch at their facility.  What a beautiful park!  <br>
Then on to the Talimena Byway, but we went west on it to Talimena <br>
State Park, and found box there.  Then we finished the day driving <br>
up to Fort Smith and staying in hotel (weather was so great, we wish <br>
we would have camped this year like we usually do).   Friday we went <br>
east to Mt Nebo S.P., and did some hiking.  Then south to Petit Jean <br>
S.P., finding Petit Polecat box and hiking down to Cedar Falls.  My <br>
wife and I have visited this park about 8 times now, and we still <br>
love it. Fall colors were great.  We then headed west to Mount <br>
Magazine S.P., where we checked into the new lodge.  It was only <br>
opened this May, and is one of the best lodges we have ever stayed <br>
in.  What a view from our 3rd story room!!!   Saturday we got up and <br>
hiked to the top of Arkansas, and picked up Silver Eagle's box.  We <br>
then explored the rest of the park until noon, when we headed for <br>
Paris and Altus, the Arkansas Wine Country!  We visited all 5 <br>
wineries (only 6 in state that I know of), and had a great time.  <br>
The lady at Post Winery rememebered us from last year (that may not <br>
be a good thing).  All the tasting is FREE, and at Post they will <br>
let you taste it ALL (we made it through 12 different wines).  The <br>
last winery was Chateux Aux Arc, where again they remembered us from <br>
last year(seems to be a trend here...hope it is because we came so <br>
far).  Then we headed back to the lodge to dry out, and had a great <br>
dinner.  Sunday we headed home, having breakfast at Queen Wilhemena <br>
S.P., then driving the Talimena byway (finding S.E's 2 boxes) to OK, <br>
then south to Texas, through Tyler, Palestine and on to Fort Boggy <br>
State Park near Centerville.  Found box there, and left "Boggy Creek <br>
Monster" - I carved this box 3 years ago, but only recently found <br>
out they finally developed this park.  Then back home after dinner <br>
in Magnolia.   We had a great trip, found all the boxes we looked <br>
for, and really enjoyed the new lodge at Mount Magazine!!!  Arkansas <br>
really is a good escape from the flat land to the "mountains". Take <br>
Care.<br>
