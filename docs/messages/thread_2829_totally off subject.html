                    <html><body><div>A couple of years ago, when moving, I got rid of everything that I hadn't used in the last year. My mother had a fit. I told her I was Feng Shui'ing. I was happy. When we moved into the new apartment I had empty cupboards. It was great. Well, Christmas came around and I didn't have the 'right' cake pan, so I had to buy some. Then, I needed a potato masher for something (other than mashing potatos of course), so I had to buy another one. Needless to say, my cupboards are full again.</div> <div> </div> <div>I am moving again next month and DH said that we were going to only move the stuff we need (meaning the rest will go to a garage sale or Goodwill). I said, "Remember we tried that and ended up with the same ole stuff later."</div> <div> </div> <div>And, I wonder, how did I end up with 4 boxes of pie crust? I use the frozen Mrs. Smith's, so how would that even end up at my house? I think my mother sends the stuff she doesn't want to my house so I have to
 store it. She can't throw anything away.</div> <div> </div> <div>janet, BF<br/><br/><b><i>Maribeth Jagger &lt;cjagger405@earthlink.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div> <div>Warning: this is totally off the subject of letterboxing.</div> <div>Just a thought brought on by moving: Why do we store so much STUFF?
