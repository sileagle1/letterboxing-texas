&gt; &gt;  This morning, PuddleSplasher and I (Viewfinder) were driving along<br/>
&gt; &gt; Shoreline Drive in Flower Mound, heading for the Northshore Trail at Lake<br/>
&gt; &gt; Grapevine in the Twin Coves Park area (Mapquest 2000 Shoreline Drive, Flower<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mound, to see how to get there from wherever you may be).  Suddenly a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; big bus came flying past us on that narrow lane, passengers hanging out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the windows and off the roof of the bus,  with all kinds of loud raucous<br/>
&gt; &gt; noise and dust and smoke flying behind them.  They continued just ahead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; us to a dead end, where we skidded to a stop in front of two very old fake<br/>
&gt; &gt; deer, but the bus didn't stop at the rail!  It continued on down the<br/>
&gt; &gt; little trail, heading right toward the lake!  Fearing that the bus was<br/>
&gt; &gt; completely out of control, brakes gone, and all those passengers were going<br/>
&gt; &gt; to wind up IN the lake, we gave chase on foot.  After a few yards, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; passed a trail intersection, but the bus didn't turn  just kept heading<br/>
&gt; &gt; straight toward the water!  We started counting at that intersection as we<br/>
&gt; &gt; huffed and puffed along after the bus, and about 50 steps on, the bus<br/>
&gt; &gt; suddenly veered off the path to the left toward a small cluster of cedar<br/>
&gt; &gt; trees, with a small oak right in front of the center cedar tree.  Amazingly,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that bus veered around the little oak and came to rest just beneath the<br/>
&gt; &gt; center cedar, with small rocks, bark and leaves flying up and then settling<br/>
&gt; &gt; back down to cover it.  Seeing that the noisy passengers all appeared to<br/>
&gt; &gt; be OK (probably because they are all packed in there so tightly and, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; suspect, some of them might possibly be engaging in unprescribed medications<br/>
&gt; &gt; as well), PuddleSplasher and I quickly turned around and headed back to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; car to make our escape, glad to be free of that out-of-control group  but<br/>
&gt; &gt; not before PuddleSplasher managed to slip a little Bonus Box under the bus<br/>
&gt; &gt; to reward not only the bus finder, but also an other  finders who get<br/>
&gt; &gt; there a little too late and miss the bus.  (Please do NOT take the Bonus<br/>
&gt; &gt; Box if you are the finder of the bus; it will be posted as a permanent<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterbox by PuddleSplasher).<br/>
&gt; &gt; Warning:  Use caution in approaching this site we think some of those<br/>
&gt; &gt; passengers are armed and dangerous, not to mention the heavy purple haze of<br/>
&gt; &gt; sweet-smelling smoke mingled with the pungent scent of a bear and far too<br/>
&gt; &gt; many passengers above the bus' capacity all crammed together for far too<br/>
&gt; &gt; long without showers!  -- Best wishes, Viewfinder<br/>
