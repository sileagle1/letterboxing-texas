                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it's great when you replace a lost box (even if you put it in a <br>
new location). There are always people who haven't had an opportunity <br>
to find it yet and would love to. I've recarved and replaced boxes <br>
before. One of my Artist Series boxes went missing last summer and I <br>
recarved it and placed it in the exact same location as before. It had <br>
been visited well over 100 times before it went missing, so I couldn't <br>
entirely blame the location. It is in a busy location (Ft Worth <br>
Botanical Gardens) so it's likely that it was observed being found or <br>
replaced and someone went to investigate.<br>
On the other hand, after my Wooly Booly box went missing, I chose not <br>

                    <html><body><div class="gmail_quote">I lost my SFA box awhile back, probably to custodians.  It was a tribute box to my dad, and the stamp in it was positively excellent, if I do say so myself.  After much thought, I decided not to replace it.  It was a very good box for the time it was there, but I knew when I planted it that it was a high risk location (albeit the place it HAD to be) and that's why I made it a WOM box.  It gave pleasure to the folks who found it, and to me, but I had the feeling that working too hard at keeping it there would take some of the pleasure of it away.  I came to think of it as a passing serendipity (how's that for a good word Janet?), something that gave a lucky few something special.  </div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">One of my first boxes was a box planted at Killough Monument - a local historical site that moves me every time I'm there.  I recarved that stamp three times, changing locations once, before I finally let it go.  I had become concerned about the safety of the location because it was extremely isolated and nearly every time I went out there, I ran into "someone" doing "something", and they never seemed too pleased to see me.  The last time the box disappeared - or was destroyed actually - I toyed with the idea of replacing the box near the monument instead of at it, but it just wouldn't be the same, so I decided that box had seen its day and I retired it.  About a month ago someone was murdered at the site.  Although the victim was presumably a part of a drug deal gone bad, it could have easily been a letterboxer who stumbled upon the drug deal gone bad.  </div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">I also recently lost a box that was placed purely to plug a hole in the map box-wise.  When it went, I shed no tears and never considered recarving.  I was almost relieved not to have it sitting out there with my name on it, because it wasn't anything special and nothing I was particularly proud to call my own.  It haled back to the days of few boxes in East Texas, when something was better than nothing, so there it was.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">My Spring Hope box is disabled at the moment, but it has been in place for quite awhile.  I will always continue to replant that box, although this time I'm going to change the image up.  Why is it important to me to replace it?  Because Ruby Tuesday and Stillwater came boxing in my town one weekend, and she was sick enough at that point that Stillwater (an LSS mind you, not himself a boxer) would get out of the car and go find the box, walk back to the car with it and let her stamp in, then take the box back to its hiding spot.  He didn't just do this with a box or two - they found lots of boxes that weekend. I happened upon them that Saturday in the park near my house, and it touched me deeply to watch him do this for her.  Now that's LOVE!  When I met up with them later for coffee, they laughingly told me the story of finding my Spring Hope box.  It's a puzzle box, and Stillwater actually figured it out before Ruby did - something that was really hard to do.  Stillwater told me to never let that box go, that it was his favorite they had ever found, probably because he bested her.  And Ruby mentioned that box and their experience with it every time I saw her after that.  So that's a box I will always recarve and replace.  It's always been a favorite of mine anyway, and Ruby will always be one of my favorite letterboxers, and Stillwater loved Ruby enough to do her boxing for her when she couldn't manage it for myself, something I hope Fearless Fox would do for me if it ever came to that (and I think he would).  It holds a lot of symbolism for me.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">So you see, I think that the decision to recarve and replace has to be a case-by-case thing, and only you can know what you should do.  Over the years, I've come to the decision that - for me - planting a box shouldn't be a haphazard thing in the first place.  I try to think what I want to accompllish by placing the box, who I'm aiming it toward, what I expect to get out of it.  So when a box goes missing that was planted with forethought, it is much easier to make that decision whether to replace/recarve because I can ask myself if my mission was accomplished.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In the beginning, I used to always replace boxes with the same stamp<br>
recarved, sometimes up to 3 times, but I soon got tired of doing this.<br>
Since most of my stamps are related to the location, changing the idea <br>
of the box was not an option in most cases, but I soon realized that<br>
except for unique stamps I could just modify them a little and put a <br>
number on the end of the name (e.g. box 2) and it would be a new box.<br>
This way even people that had found the original box would have another <br>
one to find.  This is especially nice when I send a box to someone to <br>
help me replace a box far away since it gives them a new find for their <br>
trouble.  The only down side to not replacing is that the historical <br>
place date is lost, so if you placed the first box in a particular <br>
place, but then it went missing and you did not replace it, future <br>
boxers would never know about it.  Not a big deal, but worth <br>
considering.<br>
<br>
There are a few special boxes that I will always replace or some that I <br>
will just retire.  I guess it just depends how you feel about a <br>
particular box as to what you do, but there is no wrong answer.<br>

Well, nothing like a good cry when you first wake up. I am so glad you<br>

<br>
I've had that happen more than once, where a box would be "attempted" <br>
or even reported as missing.  I'd carve a new stamp with the original <br>
image and make a new logbook and box, only to find the original box <br>
exactly where it was supposed to be.  I tend to ignore the <br>
first "attempt", especially if I don't know the letterboxer.  If a <br>
favorite box really goes missing, though, or if one in a series, like <br>
the Murder at the Arboretum, I'll recarve and replace.  In fact, <br>
everytime one of those boxes are attempted, but not found, I go check <br>
on it.  It would't be fair to know one of those boxes were missing <br>
because I believe if someone is going to take the time to look for <br>
them, they should all be available to complete the story line.  One <br>
finder of that seven-box series reported finding the first 3 boxes <br>
and reported the last 4 as "attempted".  I went and checked and found <br>
all the boxes in place.  I contacted the placer (someone I didn't <br>
know) and they replied that, after the first 3, they ran out of time <br>
and didn't even look for the other 4.  LSQ believes that every lost <br>
box should eventually be replaced.  One of hers, at Oakwood Cemetery <br>
in Austin, has been replaced twice and is missing again, so at some <br>
point, you have to give up and retire the box, and hope the next one <br>
has better luck.<br>

all get excited (still) about new boxes and we want new boxes to find.<br>
<br>
So, rather than replacing old ones, I generally decide to create an<br>
entirely new box so that the letterboxing friends who give me so much<br>
fun & adventure may have a new one of their own.<br>
<br>
That said, there are special boxes that I will always try to replace.<br>
 For instance, I have had a replacement for my Pirate's puzzle riding<br>
around in my car for almost exactly one year...some day, some day.<br>
