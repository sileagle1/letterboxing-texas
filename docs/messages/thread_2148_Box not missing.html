<div>I can't remember who recently contacted me about my Whistle Stop Spur 
letterbox, reporting they were unable to find it and thought it might be 
missing.  I had just replaced the original logbook (full) with Logbook II, 
and was pretty sure it was still there.  I've just come from checking on it 
and yep, there it is.  I'll warn you though:  you have to look for 
it.  It's well hidden - probably why it's still there after about a year 
and a half, when that train is well-visited!  </div>
