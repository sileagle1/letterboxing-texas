made it back to Marfa that evening and drove out of town a few miles to the spot 
where people gather to look across the flats toward the mountains hoping to see 
the mystery lights, and we got out there with our pizza and cokes well before 
sunset.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No one else was out there

just there, and we were just there, so it was another easy find and a fun stamp.

mystery lights - incredible!  Big points of light just popping up, moving 
around, changing colors, disappearing and reappearing across the desert and 
mountains: pale and bright, yellow, orange, blue, small and large.  The 
first one I saw, sort of faint, brought me right up on my toes, and we stood 
transfixed for about an hour, wrapped in a quilt to keep from freezing and 
watching the lights appear and dance around and disappear and reappear in 
different places in the desert. Fantastic!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

next day was sunny and hot with brilliant blue skies and enormous puffy clouds 
when we drove down to Big Bend and the Chisos Mts. basin We stopped at a 
roadside pullout to take pictures of the Rio Grande and the canyons (later 
realized that was the location of another one of Silver Eagle's LBs, but didn’t 
realize it at the time – darn!), and then we happened upon the Contrabando movie 
set along the river - took lots of pictures, explored, watched the river rafters 
floating by beneath the towering mountains.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just beautiful – the river, canyons, 
cholla, ocotillo and prickly pear, old buildings that looked like the background

to Lajitas, now an expensive upscale resort, stopping for more pictures, through 
Terlingua and Presidio and back to Marfa.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

roadrunners, donkeys in the desert, goats and sheep, deer, some <i style="mso-bidi-font-style: normal"><u>camels</u></i> - and lots and lots

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">One 
definite shortcoming in Marfa is the lack of places open for dinner on a Monday 
or Tuesday night, other than the lovely Jett Rink Bar and Grill in the Paisano 
(where we did enjoy a long slow dinner Sunday night), but after our long drive 
to and from Big Bend, we didn't want to wait until 8:30 or 9:00 for dinner that 
evening, so it was the DQ.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those 
chili cheese dogs were good, too!  And the stars above us were 
amazing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">The 
next morning after breakfast at Alice's restaurant, about the only place open 
for breakfast in Marfa, we located a site for my Giant letterbox- not easy to do 
in Marfa because the entire city is so clean and neat, all the cedars are nicely 
trimmed and clipped, the historic buildings – now mostly art galleries – are 
exceptionally well maintained, but we found a good place. We then went back up 
to </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Ft.</span></st1:placetype><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">

and hiked around on the trails above the old historic fort (after making dinner 
reservations for that night so we'd have a choice besides DQ).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We climbed very steep rocky trails to 
the top of the hills above the fort (we were passed by a troop of boy scouts 
from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">San 
Antonio</span></st1:place></st1:city><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> 
when I had to stop to breathe), hiked the mountain trail, walked all over the 
fort – great desert air and exercise! Then back to Marfa for dinner at the Blue 
Javelina (great place, very hip, modern art contemporary, incredible food, 
SLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW kitchen! But definitely worth the wait).

we left Marfa and drove to Alpine for breakfast and then on toward home.   
We saw many more pronghorn antelope - even saw a big coyote chasing one but lost 
sight of them in a little brushy draw so we’ll never know who won; lots of 
sheep, goats, donkeys, even zebra and game antelope and bison on what was 
apparently a game ranch. In </span><st1:placetype><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial">Ft.</span></st1:placetype><span style="COLOR: blue; FONT-FAMILY: 'Franklin Gothic Book'; mso-bidi-font-family: Arial"> 
Stockton we detoured to find Paisano Pete’s statue and take his picture, and 
drove around the historic district and the fort, and then realized later, Silver 
Eagle had letterboxes right there, too, which again I didn’t realize at the 
time.  Still, I'd found 3 good ones and planted one of my own, so I was 
satisfied and my LSS wasn't burned out on letterboxing this trip. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was a great road trip, relaxing, good 
exercise, good food, wildlife and scenery, history, and 3 cool letterboxes!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>

</span><span style="COLOR: blue">Rio Grande River Road</span><span style="COLOR: blue"> to Lajitas, now an expensive upscale resort, stopping for more pictures, through Terlingua and Presidio and back to Marfa.<span>  </span>
Saw lots and lots of pronghorn antelope, some bighorn sheep, several roadrunners, donkeys in the desert, goats and sheep, deer, some <i><u>camels</u></i> - and lots and lots of blooming yucca!  </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue"> </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">One definite shortcoming in Marfa is the lack of places open for dinner on a Monday or Tuesday night, other than the lovely Jett Rink Bar and Grill in the Paisano (where we did enjoy a long slow dinner Sunday night), but after our long drive to and from Big Bend, we didn't want to wait until 8:30 or 9:00 for dinner that evening, so it was the DQ.
<span>  </span>Those chili cheese dogs were good, too!  And the stars above us were amazing.</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue"> </span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">The next morning after breakfast at Alice's restaurant, about the only place open for breakfast in Marfa, we located a site for my Giant letterbox- not easy to do in Marfa because the entire city is so clean and neat, all the cedars are nicely trimmed and clipped, the historic buildings  now mostly art galleries  are exceptionally well maintained, but we found a good place. We then went back up to 
</span><span style="COLOR: blue">Ft.</span><span style="COLOR: blue"> </span><span style="COLOR: blue">Davis</span><span style="COLOR: blue"> and hiked around on the trails above the old historic fort (after making dinner reservations for that night so we'd have a choice besides DQ).
<span>  </span>We climbed very steep rocky trails to the top of the hills above the fort (we were passed by a troop of boy scouts from </span><span style="COLOR: blue">San Antonio</span><span style="COLOR: blue"> when I had to stop to breathe), hiked the mountain trail, walked all over the fort  great desert air and exercise! Then back to Marfa for dinner at the Blue Javelina (great place, very hip, modern art contemporary, incredible food, SLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW kitchen! But definitely worth the wait).  
</span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue"><span>            </span></span></p>
<p><span style="COLOR: blue">Thursday we left Marfa and drove to Alpine for breakfast and then on toward home.   We saw many more pronghorn antelope - even saw a big coyote chasing one but lost sight of them in a little brushy draw so we'll never know who won; lots of sheep, goats, donkeys, even zebra and game antelope and bison on what was apparently a game ranch. In 
</span><span style="COLOR: blue">Ft.</span><span style="COLOR: blue"> Stockton we detoured to find Paisano Pete's statue and take his picture, and drove around the historic district and the fort, and then realized later, Silver Eagle had letterboxes right there, too, which again I didn't realize at the time.  Still, I'd found 3 good ones and planted one of my own, so I was satisfied and my LSS wasn't burned out on letterboxing this trip. 
<span>  </span>It was a great road trip, relaxing, good exercise, good food, wildlife and scenery, history, and 3 cool letterboxes!<span>  </span></span></p>
