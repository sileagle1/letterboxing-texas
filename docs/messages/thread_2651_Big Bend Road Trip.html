<p><span><o:p>I've 
</o:p></span><span>just 
returned from a road trip to far, far </span><st1:place><span>West 
Texas</span></st1:place><span> 
during Spring Break last week with my LSS, during which I did manage just a 
little letterboxing.<span>  </span><span> </span>We drove to Marfa, a very long drive west 
from </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>Ft.</span></st1:placetype><span>
</span><st1:placename><span>Worth</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span>, 
and stayed at the historic and lovely old Hotel Paisano, built in the 1930’s and 
beautifully restored.<span>  </span>This hotel 
was the headquarters for the cast of the 1956 movie, Giant, but I’m pretty sure 
our small historic room wasn’t the same room that either Elizabeth Taylor, Rock 
Hudson, or James Dean stayed in then! Still, it inspired my newest 
letterbox:  Giant. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>We 
had expected it to be really hot out there, so only took light jackets, T 
shirts, shorts and jeans and hiking boots, but no sweat shirt or long sleeves – 
<b><i><u>mistake!</u></i></b><span>  </span>The weather was very chilly our first 
day there, which we spent driving the scenic drive and a little hiking in the 
</span><st1:place><st1:placename><span>Davis</span></st1:placename><span>
</span><st1:placename><span>Mts</span></st1:placename><span><span>  </span></span><st1:placetype><span>State 
Park</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span> 
and at the McDonald Observatory.<span>  </span>I 
know my LSS’s letterboxing limit, but still, we just <i><u>happened</u></i> to find ourselves at the 
top of the mountain on </span><st1:street><st1:address><span>Skyline 
Drive</span></st1:address></st1:street><span>, 
where, after a short and scenic hike along the ridge, Silver Eagle's McDonald 
Observatory letterbox is located.<span>  
</span>Great location, nice stamp.<span>  
</span>Thanks, SE.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Then 
a little later, we just <i><u>happened</u></i> to drive right by the 
roadside pullout near the McDonald Observatory where Star Seeker’s beautiful 
Jupiter letterbox is located, an easy drive-by with an absolutely beautiful 
stamp. Thanks, Star Seeker! Love those easy finds and great stamps when I’m on 
vacation with my LSS.<span>  </span><span> </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>We 
made it back to Marfa that evening and drove out of town a few miles to the spot 
where people gather to look across the flats toward the mountains hoping to see 
the mystery lights, and we got out there with our pizza and cokes well before 
sunset.<span>  </span>No one else was out there 
yet, so I easily found the Astro D’s Marfa letterbox, too!  I mean, it was 
just there, and we were just there, so it was another easy find and a fun stamp. 
<span> </span>I was pretty excited about it: 3 
LBs on the first day, but decided to cool it on the LBing, not wanting to push 
the LSS’s letterboxing limit .<span>  
</span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span> </p>
<p><span><span></span>Just after dusk, we actually SAW the Marfa 
mystery lights - incredible!  Big points of light just popping up, moving 
around, changing colors, disappearing and reappearing across the desert and 
mountains: pale and bright, yellow, orange, blue, small and large.  The 
first one I saw, sort of faint, brought me right up on my toes, and we stood 
transfixed for about an hour, wrapped in a quilt to keep from freezing and 
watching the lights appear and dance around and disappear and reappear in 
different places in the desert. Fantastic!<span>  
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The 
next day was sunny and hot with brilliant blue skies and enormous puffy clouds 
when we drove down to Big Bend and the Chisos Mts. basin We stopped at a 
roadside pullout to take pictures of the Rio Grande and the canyons (later 
realized that was the location of another one of Silver Eagle's LBs, but didn’t 
realize it at the time – darn!), and then we happened upon the Contrabando movie 
set along the river - took lots of pictures, explored, watched the river rafters 
floating by beneath the towering mountains.<span>  </span>Just beautiful – the river, canyons, 
cholla, ocotillo and prickly pear, old buildings that looked like the background 
of every old western.<span>  </span>I could just 
see Tommy Lee Jones and Robert Duvall there by the adobe church or saloon.<span> </span></span></p>
<p><span><span></span></span> </p>
<p><span><span></span>In </span><st1:place><st1:placename><span>Chisos</span></st1:placename><span>
</span><st1:placetype><span>Basin</span></st1:placetype></st1:place><span>, 
we hiked a short hike to photograph The Window - the opening in the basin with a 
long-distance view across the desert, then drove back the way we came, along the 
</span><st1:street><st1:address><span>Rio 
Grande River Road</span></st1:address></st1:street><span> 
to Lajitas, now an expensive upscale resort, stopping for more pictures, through 
Terlingua and Presidio and back to Marfa.<span>  
</span>Saw lots and lots of pronghorn antelope, some bighorn sheep, several 
roadrunners, donkeys in the desert, goats and sheep, deer, some <i><u>camels</u></i> - and lots and lots 
of blooming yucca!  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>One 
definite shortcoming in Marfa is the lack of places open for dinner on a Monday 
or Tuesday night, other than the lovely Jett Rink Bar and Grill in the Paisano 
(where we did enjoy a long slow dinner Sunday night), but after our long drive 
to and from Big Bend, we didn't want to wait until 8:30 or 9:00 for dinner that 
evening, so it was the DQ.<span>  </span>Those 
chili cheese dogs were good, too!  And the stars above us were 
amazing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>The 
next morning after breakfast at Alice's restaurant, about the only place open 
for breakfast in Marfa, we located a site for my Giant letterbox- not easy to do 
in Marfa because the entire city is so clean and neat, all the cedars are nicely 
trimmed and clipped, the historic buildings – now mostly art galleries – are 
exceptionally well maintained, but we found a good place. We then went back up 
to </span><st1:place><st1:placetype><span>Ft.</span></st1:placetype><span>
</span><st1:placename><span>Davis</span></st1:placename></st1:place><span> 
and hiked around on the trails above the old historic fort (after making dinner 
reservations for that night so we'd have a choice besides DQ).<span>  </span>We climbed very steep rocky trails to 
the top of the hills above the fort (we were passed by a troop of boy scouts 
from </span><st1:city><st1:place><span>San 
Antonio</span></st1:place></st1:city><span> 
when I had to stop to breathe), hiked the mountain trail, walked all over the 
fort – great desert air and exercise! Then back to Marfa for dinner at the Blue 
Javelina (great place, very hip, modern art contemporary, incredible food, 
SLLLLLOOOOOOWWWWW kitchen! But definitely worth the wait).  
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><span>            
</span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Thursday 
we left Marfa and drove to Alpine for breakfast and then on toward home.   
We saw many more pronghorn antelope - even saw a big coyote chasing one but lost 
sight of them in a little brushy draw so we’ll never know who won; lots of 
sheep, goats, donkeys, even zebra and game antelope and bison on what was 
apparently a game ranch. In </span><st1:placetype><span>Ft.</span></st1:placetype><span> 
Stockton we detoured to find Paisano Pete’s statue and take his picture, and 
drove around the historic district and the fort, and then realized later, Silver 
Eagle had letterboxes right there, too, which again I didn’t realize at the 
time.  Still, I'd found 3 good ones and planted one of my own, so I was 
satisfied and my LSS wasn't burned out on letterboxing this trip. <span>  </span>It was a great road trip, relaxing, good 
exercise, good food, wildlife and scenery, history, and 3 cool letterboxes!<span>  </span><o:p></o:p></span></p>
