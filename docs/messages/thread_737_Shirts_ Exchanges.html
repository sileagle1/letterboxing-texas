Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
If you did not recieve a shirt and wanted one I do have a few left.  <br/>
I will need to get $5 for them due to shipping charges and they will <br/>
be first come first serve.  I have these sizes left:<br/>
2...small<br/>
1...medium<br/>
1...Large<br/>
5...xLarge<br/>
3...2xlrg<br/>
<br/>
You can email me your order and ship to address to boxdn@yahoo.com , <br/>
subject BB shirt.  <br/>
<br/>
To everyone that replied to my low exchange count thanks I will be <br/>
emailing you soon.  I think I didn't get my book on the table in <br/>
time for the flood of people.  That morning at Cafe' Boxdn I kinda <br/>
ran ya'll off from the table cause I didn't want your logs getting <br/>
grease on them and then I never had a chance to join you at the <br/>
other table.  Live and learn.  <br/>
<br/>
Just to let you guys know some good news a fellow boxer from GA had <br/>
their first child Sunday while we were all ringing out from the <br/>
rain.  Another boxing baby boy 8.1 lbs 19 inches mom and new born <br/>
doing fine at home.<br/>
