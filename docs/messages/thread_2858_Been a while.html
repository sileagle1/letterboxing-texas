<div> </div>
<div>I've been kind of lurking for quite some time, as life has gotten too busy to do any fun stuff like Letterboxing!!  But, that all changed this week!  We went camping at Pedernales Falls State Park and found the boxes there and had an absolutely wonderful time!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Boxes found all in good condition:</div>
<div>Ziggy Gifts (despite warnings that it was hard to find, we were able to find it with no problem.. Of course, we couldn't find our compass, so that required us to be extra observant to make up for that!  We did, however have a hard time finding our way back and ended up down by the river somehow and had to do some rock climbing/boulder hoping to get back up to the trail!  LOL!!)
