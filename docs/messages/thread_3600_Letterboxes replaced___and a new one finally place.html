Also, I added a new one - Adam and Eve - that I am really happy with. <br>
I carved the stamp and got the box ready 4 years ago! So I am really <br>
glad that it is finally placed. Maybe I should start a Bible Story <br>
series while I seem to be on a roll. ;)<br>
<br>
Oh - and I know I am losing my mind, but I just had that confirmed <br>
again... The three-part stamp for the Bee Hive Hitchhiker Hostel, <br>
that I thought had two of the parts missing, was all there. I had <br>
carved all three stamp images on one piece of 'rubber'. Even looking <br>
at it, I had not noticed, and forgotten all about that little fact. <br>
The stamp just has to be flipped and then turned on end to get all <br>
three images. Sheesh! <br>

 I did get a report that the Lost and Found Leaf outside of a <br>
cemetery in Beeville is alive and well - except for needing a new <br>
book. I think it had been reported as missing before. So, I will get <br>
back to that one with a new booklet as soon as I can get around to <br>
it. <br>
