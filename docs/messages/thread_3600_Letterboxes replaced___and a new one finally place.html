I carved the stamp and got the box ready 4 years ago! So I am really <br/>

<br/>
Oh - and I know I am losing my mind, but I just had that confirmed <br/>
again... The three-part stamp for the Bee Hive Hitchhiker Hostel, <br/>
that I thought had two of the parts missing, was all there. I had <br/>
carved all three stamp images on one piece of 'rubber'. Even looking <br/>
at it, I had not noticed, and forgotten all about that little fact. <br/>
The stamp just has to be flipped and then turned on end to get all <br/>
three images. Sheesh! <br/>

 Hi everyone! It's been so long, y'all probably don't remember me, <br/>
but I wanted to drop by and give an update on a few of my <br/>
letterboxes. <br/>
&gt; In Evergreen Cemetery, near Skidmore, I have pulled three of my <br/>
boxes. The Bottino Family emailed me recently telling me that the <br/>
books were full and damaged. When I went to check on them, the boxes <br/>
on two of&gt; them were cracked too, so they will be replaced as <br/>
well. 'Watchful Birds' and 'Rest in Peace #1' will be returned very <br/>
soon, but 'The Bee Hive Hitchhiker Hostel' is missing 2 parts of the <br/>
3-part box stamp. So I am going to have to do some recarving there. <br/>
Apparently someone mistook those two stamps (a bee and a hexagon(?) <br/>
shape) for hitchhikers! There are several nice hitchhikers in the <br/>
hostel, but I am taking good care of them until the whole thing is re-<br/>
placed. <br/>
 I did get a report that the Lost and Found Leaf outside of a <br/>
cemetery in Beeville is alive and well - except for needing a new <br/>
book. I think it had been reported as missing before. So, I will get <br/>
back to that one with a new booklet as soon as I can get around to <br/>
it. <br/>
 Happy boxing,<br/>
