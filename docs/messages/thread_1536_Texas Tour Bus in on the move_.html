                    <html><body><div><p>The Texas Tour Bus has been fully gassed and has made another stop! You can find the bus at Cleburne SP located in Cleburne, TX. </p>
<p>Clues: </p>
<p>Start with looking at the map <a href="http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/pwdpubs/media/park_maps/pwd_mp_p4503_013a.pdf">http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/pwdpubs/media/park_maps/pwd_mp_p4503_013a.pdf</a></p>
<p>~Take the spillway hiking trail by starting where the little man symbol is on the map. There is a little culdisac to park in. </p>
<p>~Follow the trail across a mini dry creek with 3 cement squares and follow the trail steadily up the hill till you come to a wide trail.</p>
<p>~This trail will bring you to the spillway.</p>
<p>~You will see a trail sign that says "to overlook or Lake loop". From the sign turn Left and follow the trail near the cliff. Look for 4 white rocks in a mini trail and take the trail. </p>
<p>~Follow the trail into the trees and go to the left tree. The box is in the back of the tree covered in White rocks and sticks. </p>
<p>Have fun and enjoy the park. I planed 2 new boxes today also! <br/><br/>~Delivery Girl~<br/>Texas Letterboxer</p></div><br clear="all"/><hr/> <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMAENUS/2737??PS=47575" target="_top">Find e-mail, documents and more on your PC instantly with Windows Desktop SearchFREE!</a> </body></html>
