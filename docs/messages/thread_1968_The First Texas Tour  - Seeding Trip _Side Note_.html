&gt; Hopefully this will not bore every to tears, but below are some <br/>
&gt; additional side notes of the early days of Texas Letterboxing, and <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; history of Silver Eagle and my (Baby Bear) first trip to seed <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; around the state.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; * My first finds were all out of state letterboxes, in Washington, <br/>
&gt; New Mexico and Colorado.<br/>
&gt; * My oldest surviving "original" letter box is "Old 300" placed <br/>
&gt; 12/08/02 at Stephen F. Austin State Historical Park.<br/>
&gt; * My first Placed box was actually put in LA, "Cypress Bend" - it <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; gone.<br/>
&gt; * My second box, "Texas Birth" is my oldest named box still <br/>
around, <br/>
&gt; but had to be replaced once. Originally placed 11/16/02, and <br/>
replace <br/>
&gt; the next year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The First Trip - 2 days (1/30/03 - 1/31/03)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle and I headed out from Cypress, up I-45 to <br/>
Huntsville.  <br/>
&gt; We stopped at the statue for Sam Houston, and I placed "The <br/>
Raven".  <br/>
&gt; This box is now gone (state prisoners clean the area, and was <br/>
picked <br/>
&gt; up by guards worried about drugs being left for prisoners).  We <br/>
then <br/>
&gt; heading to Sam Houston's home, where Silver Eagle <br/>
placed "Steamboat <br/>
&gt; Sam".  After quit side trip to cemetery to see Sam's grave, we <br/>
&gt; headed up to Crockett and I place "Davy Crockett" box at Davy <br/>
&gt; Crockett Springs (box recently reported still in place).  On to <br/>
&gt; Weches, and Mission Tejas S.P.   We each placed boxes <br/>
here, "Tejas" <br/>
&gt; and "Spanish Flag".  On to Alto, and Caddoan Mounds SHP.  I <br/>
&gt; placed "Stone Celt", which is now gone.  Next was Rusk, and Jim <br/>
Hogg <br/>
&gt; SHP, where I placed "Hogg", which is still in place.  On to Rusk <br/>
&gt; S.P. and Silver Eagle placed "Texas State RR" (replaced since).  <br/>
&gt; Next came Palestine S.P., and I placed Texas Dogwood (gone).  East <br/>
&gt; to Old Fort Parker in Mexia, and I placed "Comanche" box (which I <br/>
&gt; had to replace later, and has gone missing again).  On to <br/>
&gt; Confederate Reunion Grounds SHP and we each placed boxes, "Val <br/>
Verde <br/>
&gt; Cannon" (has been replaced) and "Confederate Flag".  Then to Waco, <br/>
&gt; and the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame, where we each placed boxes <br/>
&gt; ("Texas Ranger #1" and "Baylor Bear" - both went missing, and were <br/>
&gt; replaced in other locations).  North to Mother Neff S.P. and I <br/>
&gt; placed "Horned Owl", which went missing and has been replaced <br/>
&gt; by "Horned Owl #2".  On to Belton, where we finally had a chance <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; find boxes.  We found "4ID" at Chalk Ridge Falls as it was getting <br/>
&gt; dark (yes we had done all of this on 1/30/03).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next morning we found "Dana's Peak", "Mama Turtle", "Baby <br/>
&gt; Turtle", and "Patriotic Pug" all at Harker Heights.  Now we went <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; Bend, and Colorado Bend S.P. and found the 6 boxes ("Six Flags <br/>
over <br/>
&gt; Texas") and I placed "Guadelupe Bass" (gone).  On to Austin, where <br/>
&gt; after wasting an hour trying to figure out the clues we finally <br/>
&gt; found "Barbed wire &amp; the Galopagos of Texas".   Then back to <br/>
Houston.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Not to many placing, as at that time we did not want to put boxes <br/>
&gt; anywhere close to another one of our boxes, and we were still <br/>
fairly <br/>
&gt; new at carving stamps.  We then began doing weekend trips to other <br/>
&gt; areas to place boxes in parks we liked.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Our 2003 Trip along the Lewis and Clark route from Missouri to <br/>
North <br/>
&gt; Dakota is were we found and placed more than ever before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, that's enough for one day. Thanks for your interest in our <br/>
&gt; journeys!<br/>

Has anyone placed a memorial box along the explosion trail?  I know <br/>
there are several at Challenger Park in Webster, but those wouldn't be <br/>
for the Columbia crew, I'm guessing.  A letterbox memorial might be a <br/>
nice touch.<br/>
