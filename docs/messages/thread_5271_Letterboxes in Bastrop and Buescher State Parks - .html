Whether you are a Geocacher, letterboxer or both, we are ALL hiders and seekers. Scavenger hunters extraordinaire.  Not only do the Parks want to put safety of their visitors in top priority, but they are concerned about the protection of our parks. They have the right to know where things are in the park. Will it's placement cause a "geo trail" from future finders tromping through the brush? Is it in an area with endangered plants? Not everyone is familiar with the flora and geology of the parks in all seasons the way the staff are.  Maybe they know that the area is prone to flooding in wet seasons or will be completely overgrown by poison ivy in summer. If you're placing a container, is is something that a squirrel could destroy in 2 seconds and spread the contents all over or choke on the plastic baggies?  If they plan to do controlled burns in an area, they can warn hiders to temporarily remove their boxes, but only if they know they are there. </p>
<p dir="ltr">I know there is a lot a badmouthing of Geocachers in certain letterboxing circles. But, there are some good qualities of them as well. The first thing you will hear from most caching podcasts, websites, blogs, etc. Is to get permission before placing a container. It is courtesy and establishing good relations - not micro-managing.</p>

<div style="font-size:12pt;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;"><div>The subject about Texas State Parks and letterbox permits. Some of our State Parks are requiring that one fills out a permit which is free in order to hide a letterbox. A few are upset because they are being included with geocaching and I insert a comment: " I just don't care for the hobby being micro-managed by park bureaucrats who just don't get it."  Now normally I would just let it go but... The park bureaucrats are not trying to micro manage these hobbies (letterboxing and geocaching) they are trying to keep it "safety first" really. If you follow "Government guidelines for parks, yes the parks are government land" and check in with the office telling them you are there to letterbox or geocache, will help the employees know the general area you will be in... with that said, note that a few state parks
 do not get cellphone reception and if you should get hurt they would know the area where you were going and if you had not checked out and could send search and rescue. A lot of us do not have "buddies" and are alone when we do this... So I do not feel that this is a bad idea. I am not on a soap box just trying to give another view point.<br/>
