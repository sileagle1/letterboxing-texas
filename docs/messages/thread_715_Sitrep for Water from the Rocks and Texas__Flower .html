Thanks, Barefoot Lucy for that reminder!   We all need to remain as vigilant at hiding other people’s boxes as we are with our own.<br/>
I’ve seen myself and heard from some others about boxes whose hiding places were definitely less than desired.  Of course some of this was due to weather, etc. but that just means we need to try to hide even better with those things in mind.<br/>
<br/>
I know I tend to rush when I’m nervous about getting “caught.” So I always try to have a visible reason why I’m where I am.  Some of the people on this list have listed some great covers... active children is one of the best I remember.  I’d have to hire adults of a childish-stature, which was just too much work, so I figured out something else.  I do photography, so I always have a camera with me, and well... you’d be surprised at some of the places I have to go to get a good picture.  This gives me a reason to be where I am, so I can take my time and hide boxes as well as I can.  <br/>
<br/>
One other suggestion that, I believe, has served me well...  be aware of your surroundings.  In a busy park, plan on someone coming around the trail just as you are replacing a box, and try to have some plausibility, so they don’t wonder what you were doing.  Tying your shoelaces is a great way to “explain” why you were leaning down at that particular moment.  Having no visible reason to be where you are is a great way to arouse unwanted interest.  Trails are horrible on shoelaces.  They are also great places for birdwatching, flower finding, lizard catching, and well... I’m sure you get the idea.  <br/>

<blockquote><tt>Texasluvbug has been hard at work planting boxes<br/>
around Cherokee County and my kids and I ventured out<br/>
this evening to find her Water from the Rocks box. <br/>
It's planted at a neat little roadside spring where<br/>
people come to get a little drink or to collect water<br/>
to use at home.  Parts of Cherokee County are still<br/>
very, very rural and (ahem) backward, so there are<br/>
even folks who gather water from this spring to use in<br/>
place of running water in their homes!  The water is<br/>
smooth and clean and COLD, and it tastes oh so good! <br/>
It's flowed for a long, long time, winter or summer,<br/>
rainy or dry.  I must confess, I have considered<br/>
placing a box at this site for quite some time, but<br/>
never got off the stick to do it, and now luvbug has<br/>
jumped in and beat me to it!  You go girl!<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, we found Water from the Rocks in good<br/>
condition, but a little crowded in the box.  Planted<br/>
ourselves down with a good view of the spring, but no<br/>
one noticed us spying on them while we stamped in.  It<br/>
has seen two other boxers today, but they left behind<br/>
a little rubber that needed to get out and stretch, so<br/>
we relieved the overcrowding situation in the box by<br/>
taking Texas Flower Power on a ride.  I see a three<br/>
hour trip south in its very near future!<br/>
<br/>
Let me take a moment to mention to new boxers and old<br/>
- to help this game thrive, it is really important to<br/>
rehide boxes well.  Even a little corner peaking out<br/>
can attract unwanted attention and result in a box<br/>
being discovered by the uninitiated.  I saw the box<br/>
from about six feet away as I approached.  There was<br/>
just a very tiny corner showing, but I caught the<br/>
glint and knew what I was seeing.  My crew and I<br/>
usually play a little game - one person hides it back<br/>
and the others of us try to spot it without using our<br/>
hands.  I know, it's kind of an ignorant game, but it<br/>
does the trick!  Nuff said - "Think boxing is swell? <br/>
Rehide well!"<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for another box luvbug - very nice!  Look for a<br/>
new one in our area tomorrow evening!<br/>
