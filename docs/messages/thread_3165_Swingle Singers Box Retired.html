<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="636300812-07112007">    This is the first letterbox being retired that 
I have visited.  Kinda sad.  Yup - looked in the log-book.  It 
was just the one I thought it was.  I had to nike back across the 
water-flow there, I used the stepping stones on the side of the road to cross 
the water.  We were there for a week about a year ago with my wife's folks 
from Germany.  We all had a great time.  </span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="636300812-07112007">    They are coming back in 2009, about the 
time my son returns from his combat tour.  We are planning on the Grand 
Canyon.  I hope I am light enough to take the mule ride to the canyon 
floor.  That seems like a fun trip.  Got to lose 7 more pounds in 18 
months.  Not sure.... I love food too!</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="636300812-07112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="636300812-07112007">    Or maybe I should hike down and ride the 
mule up again?  Or just hike both ways, that would take 7 pounds off 
me!  &lt;grin&gt;</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="636300812-07112007">    Y-all have a great day.  This is 
one day I do not want to go to work....  what a mess I left 
yesterday....</span></div>
