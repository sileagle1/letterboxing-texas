You can use the search function to find what you're looking for.  The<br/>
webmasters have done a great job with the search function.  My<br/>
youngest wants to go letterboxing and on a picnic today, but I have a<br/>
bad cold, so don't feel up to much hiking.  I wanted to look for a<br/>
couple of the boxes in the Woodlands we hadn't found, so I did a<br/>
county search for Montgomery County and voila!  there they all were.  <br/>

Choi was resorting Georgia into some subgroups I had sent him and <br/>
accidently sorted _ALL_ counties by a specific name, not just the ones <br/>
in Georgia. So for instance, Pierce county WA and GA were both in GA as <br/>
were Chatham SC and GA, Cook IL and GA (suddenly we had a ton of boxes; <br/>
I guess adding Chicago to a county with one box listed will do that) <br/>
etc. Then when he undid that sorting, he apparently put all the GA ones <br/>
back into the "other" states temporarily until he reresorted back out <br/>
the GA only counties.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily I don't anticipate sending him any more resort requests after <br/>
having done NC and GA in recent weeks.<br/>
