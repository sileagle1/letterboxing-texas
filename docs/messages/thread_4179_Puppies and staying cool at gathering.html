We got a black lab last night, he is five years old and has had his hip replaced a few years back.  I wish we had know about the lab/husky mix Pretty Kitty has been wanting a husky.  Rats!<br/>

Has anyone ever hear of cool ties?  They are these things that you wear around your neck.  They have this gell in them that if you soak it in hot water it holds the coolness in.  I make and sell them.  I can bring some to the gathering if anyone would like to try them out.<br/>
