We're going from here to San Augustine to place a governor box, then to Shreveport, east on I-20 to Birmingham, then north on I-65 to Huntsville.  We're visiting El Lobo and Star Seeker, who have moved there and built a new house.  Anyway, I've been searching for boxes along that route within easy access from the Interstate.  We have never found a letterbox in the U.S. outside of Texas (amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that Louisiana and Mississippi have so few boxes in so few counties.  We've picked out a couple that we want to stop and get, but was wondering if anyone could recommend some good ones along that route? We won't have time to get very far off-line and don't want to attempt urban boxes just because they take more time. Any help would be appreciated. I can't believe I didn't see any Silver Eagle or Baby Bear boxes!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been to the Vicksburg National Military Park, pre-letterboxing.  I think there may be one box there, we'll probably check it out.  I hadn't searched Huntsville yet, we'll see where that takes us.  EL and SS moved to Huntsville because Star Seeker took a position with a national child advocacy organization there, so El Lobo retired and went with her, after a living in Midland virtually all his life.  They're loving it there.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Boots! Just to let you know, my box is probably about 10-12 miles south of I-20. Last time I checked, it was still there, but it has been a while since I have been out there. (Vicksburg is my hometown) It's an easy drive by at a cemetery. Corazon's box "The Rock of Gilbraltor" is fairly easy to get because it is right off of I-20 just across the bridge and happens to be the very first box Lucy Locket and I stamped in. Although it is near a very busy playground. I hope you are able to get a few of Corazon's boxes, they are some of my favorites. <br>
Have fun!<br>

We have never found a letterbox in the U.S. outside of Texas (amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that Louisiana and Mississippi have so few boxes in so few counties. We've picked out a couple that we want to stop and get, but was wondering if anyone could recommend some good ones along that route? We won't have time to get very far off-line and don't want to attempt urban boxes just because they take more time. Any help would be appreciated. I can't believe I didn't see any Silver Eagle or<br>

We're visiting El Lobo and Star Seeker, who have moved there and built a new house. Anyway, I've been searching for boxes along that route within easy access from the Interstate. We have never found a letterbox in the U.S. outside of Texas (amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that Louisiana and Mississippi have so few boxes in so few counties.

<p>Texas is hot! Has anyone else noticed or is it just me? :) We're 
contemplating a trip to northern Alabama in a couple of weeks (sounds cooler). 
We're going from here to San Augustine to place a governor box, then to 
Shreveport, east on I-20 to Birmingham, then north on I-65 to Huntsville. We're 
visiting El Lobo and Star Seeker, who have moved there and built a new house. 
Anyway, I've been searching for boxes along that route within easy access from 
the Interstate. We have never found a letterbox in the U.S. outside of Texas 
(amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that Louisiana and Mississippi have so 
few boxes in so few counties. We've picked out a couple that we want to stop and 
get, but was wondering if anyone could recommend some good ones along that 
route? We won't have time to get very far off-line and don't want to attempt 
urban boxes just because they take more time. Any help would be appreciated. I 
can't believe I didn't see any Silver Eagle or Baby Bear boxes!<br/><br/>Boots Tex

Their called "Peek-A-Boo" and "Mini Road Trip".  They were last found on July 18, 2011.  Good luck and have an awesome trip.  Mothers Love<br>

> Texas is hot!  Has anyone else noticed or is it just me? :) We're contemplating a trip to northern Alabama in a couple of weeks (sounds cooler).  We're going from here to San Augustine to place a governor box, then to Shreveport, east on I-20 to Birmingham, then north on I-65 to Huntsville.  We're visiting El Lobo and Star Seeker, who have moved there and built a new house.  Anyway, I've been searching for boxes along that route within easy access from the Interstate.  We have never found a letterbox in the U.S. outside of Texas (amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that Louisiana and Mississippi have so few boxes in so few counties.  We've picked out a couple that we want to stop and get, but was wondering if anyone could recommend some good ones along that route? We won't have time to get very far off-line and don't want to attempt urban boxes just because they take more time. Any help would be appreciated. I can't believe I didn't see any Silver Eagle or Baby Bear boxes!<br>

<div>I have a drive-by letterbox hidden there (on the porch of the B&amp;B), 
called “Fairfield”.  Also, it is a good 20 minutes or more from I-20 to my 
box “Bravest Woman in Texas”, but I love that there is a monument to her at 
Potter’s Point, TX!  Have a great trip!  -- Bell Motel</div>

enough down the road. Look for more than a beautifully carved roast. Homemade 
fried pies for breakfast. Definitely go with the coconut. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Sent
