                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've been to the Vicksburg National Military Park, pre-letterboxing.  I think there may be one box there, we'll probably check it out.  I hadn't searched Huntsville yet, we'll see where that takes us.  EL and SS moved to Huntsville because Star Seeker took a position with a national child advocacy organization there, so El Lobo retired and went with her, after a living in Midland virtually all his life.  They're loving it there.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Boots! Just to let you know, my box is probably about 10-12 miles south of I-20. Last time I checked, it was still there, but it has been a while since I have been out there. (Vicksburg is my hometown) It's an easy drive by at a cemetery. Corazon's box "The Rock of Gilbraltor" is fairly easy to get because it is right off of I-20 just across the bridge and happens to be the very first box Lucy Locket and I stamped in. Although it is near a very busy playground. I hope you are able to get a few of Corazon's boxes, they are some of my favorites. <br/>
Have fun!<br/>

&gt; I have an easy box in Tatum, TX (The Family Tree) but that may not be on<br/>
&gt; your route.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; JBK has a box in Gibsland, LA (about 10 miles south of I-20 to the box) -<br/>
&gt; Ambush of Bonnie &amp; Clyde.  It was last found in June of this year, so a safe<br/>
&gt; bet that it's still there and it will be a quick find as well.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; When we went through LA and MS, we found several boxes in Vicksburg that we<br/>
&gt; really liked.  They were technically "urban", but were easy finds that<br/>
&gt; didn't take much time or send us around in circles.  JBK also placed two in<br/>
&gt; cemeteries in Vicksburg (Hats Off To Freedom, and The Price of Freedom).<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Much fun and safe travels!<br/>

&gt; Texas is hot! Has anyone else noticed or is it just me? :) We're<br/>
&gt; contemplating a trip to northern Alabama in a couple of weeks (sounds<br/>
&gt; cooler). We're going from here to San Augustine to place a governor box,<br/>
&gt; then to Shreveport, east on I-20 to Birmingham, then north on I-65 to<br/>
&gt; Huntsville. We're visiting El Lobo and Star Seeker, who have moved there and<br/>
&gt; built a new house. Anyway, I've been searching for boxes along that route<br/>
&gt; within easy access from the Interstate. We have never found a letterbox in<br/>
&gt; the U.S. outside of Texas (amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that<br/>
&gt; Louisiana and Mississippi have so few boxes in so few counties. We've picked<br/>
&gt; out a couple that we want to stop and get, but was wondering if anyone could<br/>
&gt; recommend some good ones along that route? We won't have time to get very<br/>
&gt; far off-line and don't want to attempt urban boxes just because they take<br/>

enough down the road. Look for more than a beautifully carved roast. Homemade 
fried pies for breakfast. Definitely go with the coconut. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Sent

noticed or is it just me? :) We're contemplating a trip to northern Alabama in a 
couple of weeks (sounds cooler). We're going from here to San Augustine to place 
a governor box, then to Shreveport, east on I-20 to Birmingham, then north on 
I-65 to Huntsville. We're visiting El Lobo and Star Seeker, who have moved there 
and built a new house. Anyway, I've been searching for boxes along that route 
within easy access from the Interstate. We have never found a letterbox in the 
U.S. outside of Texas (amazing!), and I am struck by the fact that Louisiana and 
Mississippi have so few boxes in so few counties. We've picked out a couple that 
we want to stop and get, but was wondering if anyone could recommend some good 
ones along that route? We won't have time to get very far off-line and don't 
want to attempt urban boxes just because they take more time. Any help would be 
appreciated. I can't believe I didn't see any Silver Eagle or Baby Bear 
boxes!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br/>&gt; &gt;
