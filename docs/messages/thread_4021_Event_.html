                    <div class="plaintext-content">so i was hoping to have an event in tyler State park April 18th... but decided that i would just do it at faulkner park in Lindale (hwy 69 between lindale and mineola)  instead, as i didn't want to try to get permits for 12 boxes all at once!! this is the closest saturday to my 30th birthday... so wanted to combine an event to start off my "choose your own adventure series" and my birthday!! so as soon as i figure out HOW to list it in the events on Atlas Quest ...it will be there.<br/>
