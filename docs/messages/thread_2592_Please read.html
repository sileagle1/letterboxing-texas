                    <html><body><div>I spent a few years as the chief financial officer of an organization that got about 90% of its funding from the state and part of my job was to get in the trenches and scrap it out to get the money we needed to operate.  I can tell you from the bruises I used to bear during budget years that every last dollar our state has is fiercely coveted by many sources!  During that time, I learned that the key to getting funded was being heard.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just as with a home budget, when there isn't enough money to do everything, choices have to be made.  I don't purport to say that parks are more important than XXX, or less important than YYY, only that each of us needs to make an active effort to be heard so the ones that have to decide how to spend state money know what we expect of them.  Here are a few ways of doing this with respect to parks and sites specifically, and I'm sure other folks have other suggestions as well:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) When you visit a state park, don't neglect to check in at the park office.  even if you have a state parks pass.  Sign in to their guest book if they have one so they have evidence of your visit for the time when they have to argue their own viability.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Express your long-term support by buying a park pass annually.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) If you don't have a park pass, pay your park fee even if there is no one on duty.  Slip your money into the Iron Ranger.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4) When you visit a park, send a quick email review of your visit to pertinent parties.  See below for examples of people who might be influential in placing funding.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5) Take advantage of events and programs in the parks.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>6) Volunteer in your nearest park.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>7) Get to know your rangers and learn about the needs of your local parks and sites.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gone are the days when we can passively sit back and enjoy the benefits of a prosperous state.  We like to slip in and slip out of parks without being seen, but we need to learn to be visible visitors, making our presence known so that those who count will know that park closures will have an effect on "someone".  Sadly, we also need to realize that if all of our parks and sites are to be saved, those of us who use them may find ourselves shouldering more of the cost through higher entrance fees.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Go here to find out who YOUR legislators are, then email them: <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/">http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Comptroller's Office:  <a href="mailto:statewide.accounting@cpa.state.tx.us">statewide.accounting@cpa.state.tx.us</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>General Land Office (over parks and wildlife):  <a href="mailto:webmaster@glo.state.tx.us">webmaster@glo.state.tx.us</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Go also to TPWD:  <a href="https://www2.tpwd.state.tx.us/business/feedback/webcomment/?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpwd.state.tx.us%2Fspdest%2Ffindadest%2Findex.phtml">https://www2.tpwd.state.tx.us/business/feedback/webcomment/?p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.tpwd.state.tx.us%2Fspdest%2Ffindadest%2Findex.phtml
</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>This sounds like a lot of work, but I have an email group set up for the ones with actual email addresses, so I only have to write one email and it goes to them all.  I then copy and paste my message into the online response form at TPWD.

<div>Thanks for those tips. We get a yearly pass every 
year but I will make sure I check for a guest book at all the sites we go to and 
do the follow up. Good ideas Lucy.</div>
