                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just wanted to thank you all for your hospitality and letting us <br/>
join in.  We really enjoyed meeting ya'll and of course the boxing.  <br/>
Everyone was so helpful, especially Barefoot Lucy with all her help <br/>
before the event with clues, suggestions and printouts.  Her tribute <br/>
box was very thoughtful and obviously deserved.<br/>
<br/>
All the kids were so well behaved and seemed to have a great time.  <br/>
We commented on it on the way home.  My daughter told me she made <br/>
several friends, although she didn't know any of their names.<br/>
<br/>
On the down side we were silly enough to drive home today through <br/>
Dallas in the flash flood.  It took us 5 1/2 hours to get from East <br/>
Dallas to Ardmore, enough said!  We're exhausted but couldn't resist <br/>
taking a few min. to check our letterbox e-mails and seeing what <br/>
everyone said about the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone and remember you're welcome to cross the <br/>
river north and box anytime.  Just let us know you're coming and <br/>
we'll be glad to help out.<br/>
<br/>
Dewberry, my dad - Wes of HappyDays - loved the codes.  The Oklahoma <br/>
boxers are in for a little more of a challenge I suspect from now on.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for the chili and the warm <br/>
fire.  Coming from a burn ban state it felt great!<br/>
