                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Letterboxers of Texas,<br>
<br>
It is with heavy heart that I leave you now. You are an outstanding group of letterboxers and it has been my pleasure to join in your banter. However, all good things must come to and end. I do have a few parting observations. Take it for what you will.<br>
<br>
Barefoot Lucy, next time you label your socks, do so correctly. If you need help with the directional complexities, I am sure that Mike would come to your aid. Keep your eye on that Puddle Splasher; she just might catch up in the devious category.<br>
<br>
Puddle Splasher, you really do need to keep better tabs on the current events. I would hate for you to miss any important newsbreaks, so do pay attention in the future. Keep submitting those fan club applications. However, you might want to resort to telling little white lies in order to obtain acceptance. Wanting to see dead people is just not going to cut it. <br>
<br>
Boots Tex, I do have a road map, and I do know how to use it. I am a mystery buff, and I do know about mysteries. I trust you found my investigation of Lock `n Locks beneficial and will make the most of the information.<br>
<br>
LB Bozo, although you have excellent tastes in fan clubs, I am afraid you will continue to be misunderstood and unappreciated. I regret to inform you it is the fate of all clowns; difficult to take anyone seriously who is wearing a rubber nose. <br>
<br>
IRA Boxer, from one harasser to another, keep up the good work. However, you might want to take it easy on the dames in this group. They seem to be quite vicious, and I hear exorcism is painful. <br>
<br>
Mother of Five, make sure the children get enough sleep and don't drink the water. It seems to befuddle the mind of Texans. Watch your back; presidents around these parts come and go.<br>
<br>
BRex, never fear, those who want to figure out the letterboxing scene will. Do you really want "clueless" members?<br>
<br>
Mike, threats abound on this board. However, I must point out, I was not the instigator. I was simply the visitor here. I am, therefore, an innocent party. <br>
<br>
Bloomin Gramma Jo, I will tell you one last time; yes, I can be trusted. Don't worry about the ghost or me. I am leaving and IRA Boxer is full of hot air. <br>
<br>
Wisconsin Hiker, you are correct. There are other ways to discover what C.L.U.E. is. Bribery with tequila works well, cells phones don't.<br>
<br>
Baby Bear, don't count on the Cypress PD to protect you. I hear they are fond of bear rugs. My suggestion is to take a bath and go into hibernation.<br>
<br>
SandiBox, the Dewberry fan club is indeed worthy. However you might want to reconsider your position. The presidency is a dangerous job around these parts. <br>
<br>
Janet, now that I have left, it is safe to wonder what happened to me. Good luck with that bone marrow transplant. <br>
<br>
Silver Eagle, while there is no doubt that Texas is big; it is also dangerous. Dangerous wildlife and dangerous women. I am afraid you are in for a lifetime of clarifying confusion with the likes of the dames on this board. Watch yourself out there. <br>
<br>
Till we meet again.<br>

Although you will focusing elsewhere, I will continue to peek at your mystery clues from time to time, hoping to solve one or two. I was especially entertained by your clues found on Mark and Sue Pepe's website. I've read between the lines in your posts, also hoping to discover a clue or two which might have suggested a mystery box hidden deep in the heart of Texas, but to no avail. Although reading "between the lines" provided some very entertaining reading, no clues became intuitively obvious to me. God's Speed, Investigator. You are welcomed back in Texas any time!<br>
