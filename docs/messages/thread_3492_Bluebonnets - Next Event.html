For next year's Event, I am thinking of having it at another Lower <br>
Colorado River Authority park near Fayetteville (Oak Thicket Park).  <br>
This is not too far south from Brenham and Washington county, so you <br>
could visit coming or going to the Event.  Or we could have it at <br>
Lake Sommerville SP again, which is even closer.  For the wildflowers <br>
to be in bloom, though, we would have to schedule the Event later in <br>
March or early April.  It might be worth considering.<br>

<div>One thing to think about in choosing a week - and I THINK this is true, but maybe someone else can better shed the light - with the new standardized school calendar, kids all over the state are TAKS testing Tuesday through Friday during the first week of March (I know for sure they are in many of the school districts around me), so that it would be very difficult to either take them out of school or leave early on that Friday.  I realize that may fall lower down the priority scale than some other considerations (and that's fine), but I know there are several of us who take off Friday and head down early to minimize the impact of the long drive on the weekend.</div>
