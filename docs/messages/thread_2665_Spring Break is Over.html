<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">3 years ago I weighed 275 lbs.  Today... right now 
after a 16.5 mile bike ride at 13.5 MPH, I weigh 209.5.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">It was not easy.  My wife had to ride me - I love 
food.  She put  -US-  (that is important - work together) on the 
Atkins diet.  The first two weeks was tough.  Then my body got to 
burning fat.  Ant the weight started coming off.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">Later - I checked with a doctor about some other 
stuff.  He noticed my weight loss (about 25 pounds by then) and asked how I 
did it.  So I told him.  He said he was against the Atkins diet in 
general, but he was more against being overweight.  So he ran up a few 
tests on me, and two weeks later told me to KEEP AT IT.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">Now - I never was really out of shape.  I could still 
out-hike and out run my Cavalry Scout son even at 275 lbs.  But 209 is so 
much better.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">I have had to make sacrifices.  Especially Coca 
Cola.  I loved it so.  But my substitute is now Diet A&amp;W Root 
Beer.  I don't get pizza as often.  But I feel 
better.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">After Sept 11th, the Army refused to take me back into 
Combat.  Overweight and high blood pressure.  Today that is no longer 
the case.  They have my son on the front lines, they think that is 
enough.  And if I go back, I damn sure don't want to be a 
cook.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="370524823-21032007">So......  GO FOR IT!  You can do
