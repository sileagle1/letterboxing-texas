                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's amazing how much a park can change in just a few years, isn't it?  It's sad that the boxes are gone, but we have to remember that this is a natural process.  It's an opportunity to go back and place new boxes!  Mission Tejas holds some good memories for me.  In 2007 we started a tradition of making a camping trip with our son and his family, our grandchildren, and we chose Mission Tejas State Park.  When we checked in, along with the trail map, they gave us a list and clues to the five geocaches that were in the park.  The next day, we all carved a stamp and made letterboxes, then went to the office to ask permission to place our  in the park.  The lady ranger had never heard of letterboxing, but she was immediately excited about it and called in the park manager.  I gave them the LbNA website and she looked it up and they thought it was a great hobby and said we could place as many as we wanted, no forms to fill out, no permit required, so we planted our first boxes.  Later in the day, one of the rangers, an older man, came around to the trailer and gave the three grandkids bug collection boxes and explained how to catch the bugs and told them to be sure to release them every night and catch new ones the next day.  Too bad more parks are not as people-friendly as Mission Tejas.  We'll probably place new boxes there.  Thanks, Open Space, for the wonderful report.  Don't look at it as disgusting, just as an opportunity.  We're leaving next week for our annual camping trip.  We're going to Dinosaur Valley SP for a few days then out to Fort Davis for a week or so.  Hoping to find a few boxes along the way and maybe place some.<br>

Many people will agree that the event held there several years ago was one of the better ones, mainly because of the park.  Maybe we will have to have another one there in the near future.<br>
