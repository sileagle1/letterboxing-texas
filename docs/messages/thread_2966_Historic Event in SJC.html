                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's amazing how educational letterboxing can be.  I <br>
googled "inventor of traffic signal" and found out that Garret <br>
Augustus Morgan, the grandson of a former slave and a Confederate <br>
general, John Hunt Morgan, not only invented the traffic signal, but <br>
also was a sewing machine repairman who invented the zigzag <br>
attachment for sewing machines.  He was also the first black man in <br>
Cleveland (Ohio, not Texas) to own a car.  Also, he invented the gas <br>
mask which saved a lot of lives in World War I.  Google is a <br>
wonderful thing.<br>

  proper trafic signal, anf Jeff Davis County is devoid <br/>of <br/>&gt; any that 
  I can recall. I think you're probably right about Loving <br/>&gt; county too. 
  Terrel county doesn't have ANY traffic lights <br/>(flashing or <br/>&gt; 
  otherwise), and I don't think Hudspeth county has any either. <br/>Pecos 
  <br/>&gt; county is off the list because I'm pretty sure there is one 
  <br/>traffic <br/>&gt; signal in Fort Stockton. I seem t remember waiting on a 
  light in <br/>the <br/>&gt; city of Pecos so Reeves county is off the list, and 
  I might <br/>remember <br/>&gt; one light in Van Horn, so maybe Culberson is off 
  the list too. <br/>Until <br/>&gt; you get to El Paso County the entire 
  Trans-Pecos region is pretty <br/>much <br/>&gt; traffic-signal free (and 
  traffic free for that matter). I'm from <br/>&gt; Houston, so I have to say 
  that I don't miss the traffic one bit!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Warm Front <br/>&gt;

  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Today is a historic one in San Jacinto County. Our first 
  <br/>traffic <br/>&gt; &gt; control light has been turned on. Oh, we have a 
  couple of <br/>flashing <br/>&gt; &gt; red lights, but this one has red, yellow 
  and green! Welcome to <br/>the <br/>&gt; &gt; 21st century, SJC! The light is at 
  the intersection of Highways <br/>150 <br/>&gt; &gt; and 156 in Coldspring. We 
  really did need one...I've seen as <br/>many as <br/>&gt; &gt; seven or eight 
  cars backed up at that intersection. Sometimes <br/>it <br/>&gt; &gt; takes you 
  a couple of minutes to get through, so this is a real <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  improvement. Y'all be careful now when you come through here. <br/>I <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; wonder how many Texas counties are left without a traffic <br/>light? 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; Probably Loving County at least. Just wondering.<br/>&gt; &gt;
