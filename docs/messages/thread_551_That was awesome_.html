Okay, we did Lake Chase 1, 2, and 3 in Arlington today.<br>
<br>
My husband is absolutely addicted and my 4yo nephew is SO proud!  He<br>
was in love with the hunt! :)<br>
<br>
All the boxes were in great condition and the finished image was<br>
really cool!  Great job Kantexan!  We will definitely continue this<br>
hobby!  <br>
<br>
We're planning to place a few this coming weekend, so be on the lookout :)<br>
