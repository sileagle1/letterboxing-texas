                    <div class="plaintext-content">Friday I went to the library in 7 Points to check on our letterbook box <br>
there. To my dismay, the library had re aranged all the books again. I <br>
guess they do this every year at this time as it was this time of year <br>
that I hid the first book and it went missing in 2 weeks. I then made a <br>
volumn 2 and it has successfully stayed in the library until the yearly <br>
rearangement. Back to good news. I went to George, the director, and <br>
asked if he knew where they had put the letterbook. He said that he had <br>
noticed they had put THEM in this office. He then went and got both <br>
books and handed them to me. Some of the workers had stamped in the <br>
first book in July 2007 but of course the clues would not have lead any <br>
letterboxer to the book. I could not even find it. I rehid the Volumn 2 <br>
book and will update the clues. The Volumn 1, I will hide in a <br>
different library. I was so upset when the first book went missing and <br>
am really glad I have gotten it back and in great condition.<br>
