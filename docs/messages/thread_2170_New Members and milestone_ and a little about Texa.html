                    <html><body><div>As with the other lists, the Texas list has also been growing like crazy lately.  Sometime in the last week or so we've crossed over the 200 member mark!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To new members, we are really glad you are with us and hope you'll enjoy participating on this list.  We try to honor the Texas tradition of freindliness and big-hearted neighborliness.  You might look back in our archives for a recent (last month or two) thread titled something like "10 steps to becoming a successful letterboxer".  If you'll do an archive search for successful letterboxer and then read the messages in that date range, I think you'll get a lot of great information!  One of these days I'm going to take that information and put it into one file for future reference.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would also like to mention the main resources for letterboxing.  I'm almost positive I will forget some and hopefully everyone else will chime in with others:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clue Sites:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a>  (usually just called LBNA)</div>
<div><a href="http://www.atlasquest.com">www.atlasquest.com</a>  (or AQ)</div>
<div>and keep an eye out for members' websites where clues are stored, the most likely of which you will run into is Silver Eagle's.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Informational sites:<br clear="all"/>again, LBNA and AQ</div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.info">www.letterboxing.info</a> (or Silent Doug's)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Specifically Texan:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com">www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com</a> - this is a mapping atlas that Sea Dove of Birds of a Feathers put together for those of us who need the visual assistance of seeing where boxes are located.  And as a note, as you begin to plant boxes, Sea Dove will NOT put your boxes on his map without your approval, so email him and give him the okay if you want to see your boxes listed there.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Good place to buy carving material:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.stampeaz.com">www.stampeaz.com</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Email Lists:</div>
<div><a href="http://groups.letterbox-usa.com/group/letterbox-usa">http://groups.letterbox-usa.com/group/letterbox-usa</a> (This is the Big List - and as many of you have learned, it's not for the faint-hearted!  Please though, don't count it out as a resource.  Even during flames it's possible to learn a lot there - just wear your thick coat of fur if you post there)
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://groups.newboxers.com/group/newboxers">http://groups.newboxers.com/group/newboxers</a> This is the place to go to get questions answered of a general nature.  No dumb questions there!  Great list.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is also a Texas forum on AQ, but last I looked it isn't very active.  Still though, it IS there so you might drop in on it every now and then to see what's going on.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are many types of styles of letterboxing that each have their own lists as well - most notably, postal letterboxing.  There are members here who enjoy postal letterboxing as well, and maybe they can chime in with a plug for it.
