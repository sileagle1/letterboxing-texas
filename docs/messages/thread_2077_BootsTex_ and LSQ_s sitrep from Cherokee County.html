<div> </div>
<div>They've gotten 14 boxes today, I guess between their home and Cherokee County...this is only a partial sitrep, the highlights, or in some cases, lowlights of the day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>General Sherman</strong>-BootsTex in Texas State Railroad park in Rusk - really, truly missing.  He says he'll replace it, but in a little different spot probably.  What a loss - I loved that hiding spot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>She Rocks!</strong>-BarefootLucy - Nichols Green in Jacksonville - as I mentioned in an earlier post, it has been disturbed.  They were kind enough to put it back together, but it will be moved soon to avoid it going missing.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Barefoot Den Mother</strong>-Silver Eagle-Nichols Green in Jacksonville - didn't find.  The woods are very overgrown where it is and the landmarks to look for are difficult to spot, but in the course of box checking Saturday, I did find it - but I knew where to look.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div><strong>Scarlett and Rhett</strong>-j b kokopelli-Dialville - entire box was soaked.  A tree limb fell on the box and forced the lid open.  Baggies were either not resealed well or may have had damage from the tree falling, and water got inside them and soaked the logbook.  ****BIG NOTE - Boots Tex and LSQ took the logbook to their hotel and will try to dry it out tonight and will return it to the box tomorrow. ****
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While this is technically a partial sitrep I'm posting on their behalf, I would like to add that while I was box-checking Saturday, I found the following box to be missing from the place I had previously found it and knew it to belong:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Life is a Picnic</strong>-Nichols Green in Jacksonville.  It was nowhere to be found, although the cover material was still in the tree.  I tried mimicking PuddleSplasher's ingenius tool improvisation skills and was only successful enough to determine there was nothing under the cover material.  Perhaps I would've been more successful with a red wig.  Either that or the tree ate the box.  Or the Tree Druids stole it.  Your pick.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And on a final note, I hope that BootsTex has left his Italian ticks and mosquitoes at home!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>

including the New York box and I think we've seen all of your boxes <br/>
on the list in this area and all are fine except Scarlett and Rhett.  <br/>
We took the stamped sheets out of the logbook (it was dripping with <br/>
water) and dried them out and placed them with a new log book, so <br/>
it's okay for now until you can check it.  We're at the library in <br/>
Corsicana getting ready to head for Bardwell and Waxahachie.  We'll <br/>
report later if the heat doesn't get us.<br/>

is going well and y'all will be back on the trail soon!<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   With that in mind, I've been doing box maintenance in the last <br/>
couple weeks, but I've not checked yours because you are close by.  <br/>
I'll be glad to check in on them as I go about other checking.<br/>

care of Scarlett and Rhett.  J and I havent been able to get out and <br/>
letterbox the past couple of months.  J was diagnosed with cancer in <br/>
June and has been undergoing treatments.  So even though we haven't <br/>
been letterboxing lately, we are still lurking around.  If anything <br/>
else for Scarlett and Rhett are any other boxes of mine need to be <br/>
taken care of, please let me know and I will take care of it. <br/>

&gt;           I told BootsTex I would go ahead and post a couple of <br/>
notable items he mentioned to me from his and LSQ's boxing today.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   They've gotten 14 boxes today, I guess between their home and <br/>
Cherokee County...this is only a partial sitrep, the highlights, or <br/>
in some cases, lowlights of the day.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   General Sherman-BootsTex in Texas State Railroad park in Rusk - <br/>
really, truly missing.  He says he'll replace it, but in a little <br/>
different spot probably.  What a loss - I loved that hiding spot.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   She Rocks!-BarefootLucy - Nichols Green in Jacksonville - as I <br/>
mentioned in an earlier post, it has been disturbed.  They were kind <br/>
enough to put it back together, but it will be moved soon to avoid it <br/>
going missing. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Barefoot Den Mother-Silver Eagle-Nichols Green in Jacksonville - <br/>
didn't find.  The woods are very overgrown where it is and the <br/>
landmarks to look for are difficult to spot, but in the course of box <br/>
checking Saturday, I did find it - but I knew where to look. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Scarlett and Rhett-j b kokopelli-Dialville - entire box was <br/>
soaked.  A tree limb fell on the box and forced the lid open.  <br/>
Baggies were either not resealed well or may have had damage from the <br/>
tree falling, and water got inside them and soaked the logbook.  <br/>
****BIG NOTE - Boots Tex and LSQ took the logbook to their hotel and <br/>
will try to dry it out tonight and will return it to the box <br/>
tomorrow. **** <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   While this is technically a partial sitrep I'm posting on their <br/>
behalf, I would like to add that while I was box-checking Saturday, I <br/>
found the following box to be missing from the place I had previously <br/>
found it and knew it to belong: <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Life is a Picnic-Nichols Green in Jacksonville.  It was nowhere <br/>
to be found, although the cover material was still in the tree.  I <br/>
tried mimicking PuddleSplasher's ingenius tool improvisation skills <br/>
and was only successful enough to determine there was nothing under <br/>
the cover material.  Perhaps I would've been more successful with a <br/>
red wig.  Either that or the tree ate the box.  Or the Tree Druids <br/>
stole it.  Your pick. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   And on a final note, I hope that BootsTex has left his Italian <br/>
ticks and mosquitoes at home!<br/>
