<div><font size="2">Okay! I feel your pain! I just hate it when I get a really fun idea for a letterbox but just can't seem to find an interesting place to hide it. I know I have some that are hidden in some pretty mundane spots, simply because I couldn't come up with an extraordinary location. I love it when I find a placeÂ I want to share, but that seems to happen all too rarely.Â  I'm one who believes strongly in placing a box in an interesting location, but I definitely recognize that it can't always be done. As far as your carvings not being good enough to lure people to your boxes, I don't think that's generally the case. There are some carvers out there that do such a nice job that I would make the extra effort to go hunt for their boxes, but I would not exclude a box because the stamp was not as intricately carved. I think most letterboxers just appreciate a truly good effort. Having said that, I think it's important to strive to improve the quality of your boxes as you continue, or else people will start to lose interest in finding them. There are some boxes that seem to hit on all the points: great location, great carve, wonderful logbook, wildly great clues, or a fantastic hike. But what makes those boxes so special is that they are rare. As far as my preference goes, while I admit I am delighted to find a beautifully carved stamp, that is probably the least thing that draws me to a box. The main thing for me are clues that are intriguing enough to draw me to a box - I just can't resist wonderful clues!</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>Â </div>
<div><font size="2">Here's my 2 cents worth: don't worry about people finding your plants right off. I have some boxes hidden in some pretty remote areas, so whenever I hear from someone who's gone to the trouble to find them, it makes it so much more exciting than the boxes that are visited regularly (plus there's the side benefit of not having to replace the logbooks very often). Also, don't be surprised if no one logs finding your box, but when you check on it, it has had quite a few visitors. I was totally surprised to find that happened with my Gene Autry box in Tioga. Gryzzled Gryphon is the only one who has logged a find, but I checked on it last week and it has had quite a few visitors.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>Â </div>
<div><font size="2">I know you would like to have some boxes hidden in your area. I live in McKinney and the majority of the boxes hidden in McKinney are mine (I think there are only three that aren't). However, just recently, there are quite a few boxes popping up in some of the nearby communities, so "if you build it, they will come". I just don't want you to get discouraged because there aren't a lot of boxers in your area right now. My best advice to you is to enjoy the process, and to use a quality that happens to allude me: patience! Good luck with that!</font></div>

<div>My very most favorite preference is a well-carved stamp in a nicely constructed box on a trail 1-3 miles long, in a placeÂ I never would've gotten to go had it not been for the box, all with a "Wow!Â  Cool!" spot at the box site.Â  I really like letterboxing because it gets me up and out of the house, on my feet and exercising, while enjoying the outdoors.Â  I like it too because it exercises my mind and piques my curiosity.Â  I like to go somewhere where I can see and notice cool little things that leafÂ cutter ants carrying little pieces of leaf back to their colony, or cool little red mushrooms growing in a little niche along the trail.Â  Those are the things that remind me that it is so very important that I tread lightly on the earth, being attentive to where I go and what I do so as to leave no evidence of my passage.Â  Yeah, I'mÂ a tree-hugger.Â  I prefer to think of myself as a LNT-er.</div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>One particular memory I have sticks in my head as being in Cameron Park in Waco, but I can't find the clues that match my memory, so I might be wrong.Â  I remember following a path uphill, working my way by very good directions to the box.Â  I reached the top of a hill, and when I stopped to begin looking in earnest, I looked out at a phenomenal view of the city - it took my breath away!Â  As I looked back down the hill from where I had come, the people were so small that I found it amusing watching them running around like tiny ants.Â  Having just been down there, I knew that it was quite loud down there amongst the people, but it was perfectly silent where I was - like a frozen moment.Â  I distinctly remember inhaling and thinking how perfectly perfect the air was - light and crisp, not too cold to hurt my lungs, nor too hot to be oppressive (I forgot to mention this is very important in a box - good weather).Â  I finally turned my attention to finding the box.Â  I spotted it and removed it from it's hiding place.Â  I noticed as I did some tiny mushrooms, very delicate - red with tiny white dots on the caps - and I didn't want to sit on them and crush them so I sat in the trail.Â  I had not seen or heard another soul on the trail, so I figured it would be okay to block the path.Â  As I was stamping in, I suddenly heard bike sounds!Â  Before I could react, the first bike rounded the corner and he immediately began doing his biker-speak to his buddies, and he swerved to miss me and stopped, the second bike ran me over, and the third bike swerved into the first and somehow or another, we all found ourselves intertwined on the ground.Â  As the extricated themselves and their bikes, we all apologized profusely to each other and they continued on down the trail, biker-speaking, I'm sure, about that crazy woman in the trail.Â  Sadly, I smushed the mushrooms after all, but in addition to a beautfiul location, I came away with a bit of adventure, and a really nice stamp.</div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>SO - a whole lot of what makes a box good for me anyway is a nice experience.Â  You can't create the experience, but you CAN set the stage for it.Â  You don't have to put a box somewhere notable or historic.Â  You can put it somewhere beautiful or quirky.Â  I think that if it says something to you, has some meaning to you, you can hardly go wrong with a box.</div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>I realize you probably think this sets an awfully high standard for a box, and maybe it does.Â  But especially since you are trying to lure boxers in, you really want to make sure your boxes are good, so don't rush them.Â  We could get really Zen hereÂ and I could say "Feel the box", but there really is some truth to that!</div>

<div>Â </div>
<div>As I read what she wrote about what makes a good box, I thought of something else I wanted to add to what I said.Â  While I love good carving, that comes a far second behind feeling like I'm catching a glimpse of the planter's point of view.Â  Letterboxing is an ironic game of socialization and isolation.Â  Quite often we are very isolated from each other while we are on the hunt, BUT - we are connecting with one another each time we take a set of clues and work our ways to a new box.Â  We connect with the placer and we connect with the other finders through their notes.Â </div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>And then she said that thing about improving - I love that too.Â  Yes - it is so cool to watch other boxers (and ourselves) develop as carvers and planters.Â  That's why lots of older boxers encourage new planters to go ahead and place their first carves even if they aren't happy with them.Â  It's terribly satisfying to look back at your own boxes, if nothing else, and see how you have improved!</div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>And then - don't worry whether other boxers find your plants.Â  Oh my goodness - I know that you will want to check your first box every single day to see if anyone found it.Â  Thankfully, my first successful box was 40 miles away or I would've been checking it constantly.Â  Also, it was planted before the day of online logging (say?Â  Did you new folk know that it's only been in the last threeÂ years or so that online logging was a big thing?Â  Used to be - we had to go check a box to see if we had had guests, unless someone was inclined to email us directly), so I waited seven months before the first finder...Â  I actually have a box in Arkansas that, to my knowledge, has never been found.Â  I LOVE the idea of it sitting there (it's about five miles in on a remote hike) and me sitting here, both waiting for a visitor.Â  How cool will it be for that boxer to be the FF on a two year old box????Â Â  WOW!<br/>

<div><font size="2">Okay! I feel your pain! I just hate it when I get a really fun idea for a letterbox but just can't seem to find an interesting place to hide it. I know I have some that are hidden in some pretty mundane spots, simply because I couldn't come up with an extraordinary location. I love it when I find a placeÂ I want to share, but that seems to happen all too rarely.Â  I'm one who believes strongly in placing a box in an interesting location, but I definitely recognize that it can't always be done. As far as your carvings not being good enough to lure people to your boxes, I don't think that's generally the case. There are some carvers out there that do such a nice job that I would make the extra effort to go hunt for their boxes, but I would not exclude a box because the stamp was not as intricately carved. I think most letterboxers just appreciate a truly good effort. Having said that, I think it's important to strive to improve the quality of your boxes as you continue, or else people will start to lose interest in finding them. There are some boxes that seem to hit on all the points: great location, great carve, wonderful logbook, wildly great clues, or a fantastic hike. But what makes those boxes so special is that they are rare. As far as my preference goes, while I admit I am delighted to find a beautifully carved stamp, that is probably the least thing that draws me to a box. The main thing for me are clues that are intriguing enough to draw me to a box - I just can't resist wonderful clues!</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>Â </div>
<div><font size="2">Here's my 2 cents worth: don't worry about people finding your plants right off. I have some boxes hidden in some pretty remote areas, so whenever I hear from someone who's gone to the trouble to find them, it makes it so much more exciting than the boxes that are visited regularly (plus there's the side benefit of not having to replace the logbooks very often). Also, don't be surprised if no one logs finding your box, but when you check on it, it has had quite a few visitors. I was totally surprised to find that happened with my Gene Autry box in Tioga. Gryzzled Gryphon is the only one who has logged a find, but I checked on it last week and it has had quite a few visitors.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font>Â </div>
<div><font size="2">I know you would like to have some boxes hidden in your area. I live in McKinney and the majority of the boxes hidden in McKinney are mine (I think there are only three that aren't). However, just recently, there are quite a few boxes popping up in some of the nearby communities, so "if you build it, they will come". I just don't want you to get discouraged because there aren't a lot of boxers in your area right now. My best advice to you is to enjoy the process, and to use a quality that happens to allude me: patience! Good luck with that!</font></div>

<div>I think that we would be able to come.Â  We're going to Austin in Sept. so don't think we'll be going back that soon.Â  I've never been to one either, but would be glad to help out.</div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>While I'm posting, I'd like to ask the group what their preferences are when going after a box.Â  As one of the "new planters"Â  ;o), I am faced with a lack of historic or particularly scenic sites in my area.Â  So what is a good site and box in your opinion?Â  What makes it worth to you?Â  We checked out Wolfe City today because I would like to try to carve a wolf stamp, but the cemetery, while large and nicely cared for, was unremarkable as was the town.Â  So I suppose I'll pass, although there are other boxes spread out in this general area.Â  My stamps aren't worth making the trip for at this point, maybe some day!Â  I would love to have the input of more experienced boxes and think it would be helpful for all of us newbies.Â  Thanks,</div>
