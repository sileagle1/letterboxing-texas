                    <html><body><p>Hmmm...thick and gray? That may be Mastercarve and it is really soft. I like to carve it sometimes, but it really isn't all that good. The one to stay away from is made by Speedball and is white. The pink stuff others have referred to is also made by Speedball and it is good. It's next best to PZ Kut, which is also my preference. PZ Kut orange would probably fall between white PZ Kut and pink stuff for me. <br/>
<br/>My Michael's keeps the pink stuff near painting supplies, as someone else mentioned. My Hobby Lobby keeps carving material and supplies near linocutting supplies, where they keep brayers and lino block.<br/><br/>I haven't ever done first finder prizes, although some folks do really nice ones. Just don't ever do food. I was first on a box a few years ago in late spring with a candy bar in it for a FF - ewwwwww! Imagine what it would've been later in the summer?<br/>
<br/>I have been the patch person for the Texas patch, but at the moment I haven't got any. Long story, but the last time I placed an order, I got ripped off, and it left a bad taste in my mouth. I'm about over it mentally, but I probably wouldn't be able to have any in time for the gather - for one thing, I gotta check my finances and see if I can put out the money between now and then.<br/>
<br/>But yeah, a lot of us have patch collections. They're cool. You CAN design your own and have them made, but it's kind of hard to find anyone that will do batches less than 50, and they are very expensive til you get over 100. I have a feeling that's not what you had in mind, but if it is, let me know off-list and I'll hook you up with some good companies (not the one that ripped me off). <br/>
