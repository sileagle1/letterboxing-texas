we planted 5 boxes today on a trip to Lufkin.  With gas being $3 per <br>
gallon, my car is going to be getting lots of rest in the garage - ha <br>
ha!!  I have listed them on LBNA but not on Atlas Quest yet.<br>
<br>
There are boxes now in Splendora, Livingston, Diboll and 2 in Lufkin <br>
(basically all down 59).  A couple are small little fun stamps that are not <br>
hand-carved but laser made.  But the others I did carve and I have to say - <br>
this is a 'LITTLE' addictive.<br>
<br>
I have a 50% off coupon to Michaels that I know what I am going to use it on)<br>
<br>
Thanks for letting me share the fun with everyone.<br>
