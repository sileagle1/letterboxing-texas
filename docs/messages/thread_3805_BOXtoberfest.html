                    <div class="plaintext-content">BOXtoberfest was a lot of fun.  We ended up with only about 25 folks <br/>
attending, but we all had a great time.  I didn't think that I would <br/>
get to actually "do" the event, because I was on the "committee", but <br/>
Cancan sent us all out to drive the route and find the boxes!  Just <br/>
because we carved them, didn't mean we knew where Cancan had hidden <br/>
them.  Plus, Cancan had created puzzles for us to solve at every <br/>
stop. I got to drive the event with AZRoadie from Arizona, and we <br/>
laughed a lot.  The route took us to or through the most scenic <br/>
and/or historical sites in Austin, and was a beautiful and <br/>
informative drive.  Kudos to the committe members who created the <br/>
route!  The boxes had lovely carves, and were fun finds, especially <br/>
Annabee's coffin in the Texas State Cemetery.  The final destination <br/>
was Scholtz Garten, a German beer garden built in 1866.  They let us <br/>
reserve a room for free, and took great care of us.  Almost everybody <br/>
won some kind of prize at the event.  Cancan procured lots of Texas-<br/>
themed prizes -- great books, t-shirts, mugs, magnets, fun stuff! I <br/>
asked Lionsmane and Astro D to hand-make a log book each to give as a <br/>
prize.  Lionsmane's book went to Bloomin' Gramma Jo, from Austin, <br/>
TX.  Astro D's book went to a Estes Ink, from Saginaw, TX.  And I <br/>
ordered two Cutter Bees to give as prizes.  My pharmacist husband, <br/>
Whiz Gee, and I also gave everyone a prank Texas Letterboxing Gift <br/>
Bag -- with sunscreen, aloe vera lotion for sunburns, Calamine lotion <br/>
for poison ivy, a snakebite kit for snakes, tweezers for the cactus <br/>
spines, latex gloves, aspirin, Tylenol, Claritin!  We thought we were <br/>
being really funny, and hoped others enjoyed the prank.  Wish you all <br/>
could have been there!  <br/>
I really want to thank Cancan for having the great idea of doing a <br/>
Letterboxing Road Rally, and for inviting us to be on her committee.  <br/>
I had no idea a Road Rally could be so much fun!<br/>

<div>BOXtoberfest was a lot of fun. We ended up with only about 25 folks <br/>attending, but we all had a great time. I didn't think that I would <br/>get to actually "do" the event, because I was on the "committee", but <br/>Cancan sent us all out to drive the route and find the boxes! Just <br/>because we carved them, didn't mean we knew where Cancan had hidden <br/>them. Plus, Cancan had created puzzles for us to solve at every <br/>stop. I got to drive the event with AZRoadie from Arizona, and we <br/>laughed a lot. The route took us to or through the most scenic <br/>and/or historical sites in Austin, and was a beautiful and <br/>informative drive. Kudos to the committe members who created the <br/>route! The boxes had lovely carves, and were fun finds, especially <br/>Annabee's coffin in the Texas State Cemetery. The final destination <br/>was Scholtz Garten, a German beer garden built in 1866. They let us <br/>reserve a room for free, and took great care of
 us. Almost everybody <br/>won some kind of prize at the event. Cancan procured lots of Texas-<br/>themed prizes -- great books, t-shirts, mugs, magnets, fun stuff! I <br/>asked Lionsmane and Astro D to hand-make a log book each to give as a <br/>prize. Lionsmane's book went to Bloomin' Gramma Jo, from Austin, <br/>TX. Astro D's book went to a Estes Ink, from Saginaw, TX. And I <br/>ordered two Cutter Bees to give as prizes. My pharmacist husband, <br/>Whiz Gee, and I also gave everyone a prank Texas Letterboxing Gift <br/>Bag -- with sunscreen, aloe vera lotion for sunburns, Calamine lotion <br/>for poison ivy, a snakebite kit for snakes, tweezers for the cactus <br/>spines, latex gloves, aspirin, Tylenol, Claritin! We thought we were <br/>being really funny, and hoped others enjoyed the prank. Wish you all <br/>could have been there! <br/>I really want to thank Cancan for having the great idea of doing a <br/>Letterboxing Road Rally, and for inviting us to be on her
 committee. <br/>I had no idea a Road Rally could be so much fun!<br/>-- Bell Motel<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@ yahoogroups. com</a>, "the carrascos" <br/>&lt;a.carrasco@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ok, Austin boxers, I've been waiting all week to hear how things <br/>turned out...how was the road rally?
