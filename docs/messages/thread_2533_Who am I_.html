Lois,  Welcome to letterboxing in Texas.  If you're interested in <br>
letterboxing in the Dallas-Ft. Worth metroplex area, you might also <br>
be interested in the Metroboxers Group (a regional letterboxing group <br>
formed recently when we had a small local gathering at Lake <br>
Grapevine).  You can access this group at <br>
metroboxers@yahoogroups.com.  Look us up!  <br>
