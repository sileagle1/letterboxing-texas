                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had quite an encounter today. I was at the Denton Dog Park with my <br>
dog "Belle" when an odd thing happened: I saw a bus pull into the <br>
parking lot. I thought it must be a whole club of dog lovers coming to <br>
enjoy a cool public space that has been set aside for puppy-kind. <br>
However, the bus didn't stop in the parking lot like I'd expected. It <br>
proceeded south to the actual park and turned right along the north <br>
fenceline. It bounced over two large rocks and continued to the <br>
northwest corner of the park. From there it turned to 200* and came to <br>
a stop within a bramble on the west side of a tall tree a short <br>
distance away. You'd never guess who came to play -- Hank the Cow Dog <br>
himself (along with a variety of fantastic Texas true-bloods)!  When I <br>
had to leave, they were still there in the leaves and sticks. They may <br>
be there still. If you hurry, maybe you could meet up with Hank and <br>
the gang before they get away!<br>
