<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial"> Today Stinky Monkey, Aslan, Sneaky Cat 
and I went to piano lessons in Canton early and took about two hours to 
leisurely letterbox. First we did Frogkisses Birthday Series which was great 
fun. Not only was the walk very enjoyable, it was on concrete which meant Stinky 
Monkey did his own walking with minimal falling down. The directions for the 
boxes were perfect. Stinky Monkey had to go everywhere the big boys went and if 
they bent over to look for something, he had to bend over as well. He mimicked 
everything. At one point Sneaky Cat was using a stick to scratch at a leaf pile 
and Stinky Monkey immediately picked up a stick and scratched at the ground. It 
was extremely amusing to all of us.</font></div>
<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial">We homeschool and on Tuesdays we go to 
Canton for piano lessons during the day. So the park was completely deserted. 
Because it kept threatening to rain and spit on us a bit (the downpour came 
later!) I let the kids stamp in the logbooks but I did the writing for the sake 
of time. Stinky Monkey and I shared a page, but Aslan and Sneaky Cat had to have 
their own.</font></div><font color="#800000" face="Arial">
<div><br/>At the second box we came across a great spider. It was huge and brown 
and running around with a blue/grey egg sack attached to it by a thread of web. 
It was greatness. We spent almost as much time watching the spider as we did 
stamping. But the absolute favorite thing of the day was the directions to box 
#3...it had us count cracks in the sidewalk. Sheer utter joy. I think boys like 
nothing better then yelling out the numbers as they jumped on the cracks. I 
figured that even though we were loud, the park was deserted and kids probably 
count cracks anyway, so I let them do it loudly. Even Stinky Monkey yelled 
"DAH!" with every crack.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the birthday series (Aslan wistfully asked, "Do you really think it's 
their birthday?" in a "wish it was my birthday" kind of way.) we went searching 
for two more boxes. We didn't find one (combination of mud/not being able to 
figure out the directions/possible stupidity on our part) but the other one 
(First Monday) was fun. The boys really liked reading the tombstones. They tried 
to lever up the top of a broken one back into place before deciding that it 
would probably cause an hernia. The box was sitting on the ground, completely 
exposed in the correct place, but all was well on the inside. So we buried it 
under leaves in the same spot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in all it was a lovely addition to our Tuesday outing. The weather spit 
at us but the torrential downpour didn't start until we were on our way home. My 
kids talked non-stop about the spider, the birdhouses, the gravestones and the 
rain. We can't wait to catch a few more. There are so many in that area that we 
are hoping to do a few each time we go to piano lessons for a while. Edom, Ben 
Wheeler, Wills Point, Kaufman...all can be picked up either coming or going.

<div>Such great fun! My thanks to all of you who added to our day!</div>

I'm in Tyler. We bowl on Tuesday mornings in Tyler but we'd be <br>
available to meet you in the afternoon.<br>

Let us know.  Next Tuesday is good for me but I will be out of town <br>
off and on for the next 2 weeks and May is looking pretty good for me <br>
