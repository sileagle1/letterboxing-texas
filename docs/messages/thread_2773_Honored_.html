I feel honored.  While I was away at the dog show, an all-out assault was<br/>
made on many of my letterboxes.  By none other than the Gryzzled Gryphon of<br/>
Coryell County!<br/>
<br/>
I was informed that one of my boxes is in need of repair.  My fake rock<br/>
isn't holding up as well as the fake cactus did.  Gotta do more work on<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
I was also paid what I consider to be a compliment:  <br/>
<br/>
A highly entertaining search in a fascinating location!   Best regards,<br/>

WOW!<br/>

Makes me want to put out another box.<br/>

<div>You are indeed honored! As you may be aware, he is a bit of an enigma in the Texas Letterboxing community. Meeting him face to face was actually unheard of until about a year and a half ago when he finally made an appearance at a small letterboxers' gathering at Lake Bardwell with some very cryptic clues. He is often (usually) the first finder of newly planted letterboxes. Sometimes I make a special effort to try to beat him to a box, just to prove to myself that it is possible from time to time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway... welcome to the wonderful world of letterboxing in Texas. It's a friendly group - we very rarely get grumpy! When you get a chance (between solving mathematical equations), go to the archives and read some of the history of the Texas list. It's very interesting. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have fun out there....</div>

<div>I had been letterbox for about a month before I finally "found" my trailname. I had been out seeking a box hidden by the Connecticut State Forestry Dept. in one of their state forests. It was in a swamp area where one actually had to identify trees growing in the swamp and drive through low-lying puddles to get to it (thank goodness most everyone in CT owns a Jeep). I was having so much fun that day, plowing through those puddles and having the water splash over my windshield. It was a difficult box for me to find because I was having trouble finding all the landmarks and locating the Eastern Cedars which were not native to CT, but eventually I did locate the letterbox. It has since been moved, but it was hanging on the back of a tree about six feet off the ground. You had to thrash through a swampy wooded area to find the right tree and I lost my shoes in the mud more than once. It was so much fun and so exciting when I finally found that box! The next day, my husband and I were driving over to West Point in NY, and I was explaining to him why my Jeep was covered in mud. I told him that it was truly exhilarating to splash through all those puddles. It seemed like all my adventures seemed to stem from splashing water. My sister, Viewfinder, and I had just returned from a river rafting trip in Colorado the summer before where we capsized our raft in the Royal Gorge and had to swim to the shore in a raging current, and I lived on a river in CT and took my canoe out for a paddle every morning as my black lab swam along beside me. All that rolled into one...  thus the name: Puddle Splasher.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I got my trail name after much thought and frustration when I first started venturing out on the internet and needed a screen name.  Finally, it hit me one days and it was suddenly as though I had finally decided to read my birth certificate...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I was a kid, I went barefooted constantly and I never wore shoes unless I was made to.  I would leave home early in the morning and would swing by the house for a quick sandwich unless I could bum food from one of my friends' moms.  I wouldn't come home for good until almost dark and I would spend the days running around in pastures and walking on hot asphalt and riding bikes on dirt roads and wading in ditches and creeks, and later riding horses or motorbikes.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My mother was a Petulah Clark fan and she loved the song, Put Your Shoes On Lucy.  So whenever it came time to go somewhere, my mother would lean out the back door and whistle as loud as she could and yell "Put your shoes on, Lucy, it's time to go!"  If she was LUCKY, I would come on home and get some shoes, but as often as not she had to drive around to find me and take me as I was - shoeless (why didn't she ever just bring shoes for me with her?  I have no idea, unless it was her endless desire to "match" and she never knew what I was wearing because I was usually dressed and out of the house at the crack of dawn).  I had forgotten this last part until she and I were talking recently about my childhood.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The big game as I got a little older was to try to get to church without shoes on Sunday evenings.  We lived very near our church, so I would head out to play after morning church in much the same way I did any other day in the morning.  If I could make it to the church or almost there before they started calling for me, I could get away with no shoes, but if I couldn't, I had to put shoes on, so I got very adept at telling what time it was without a watch.  The shoe buyer for Beall's Department Stores attended our church and he often offered to bring home samples to give to me, but my parents always turned him down, saying it wouldn't matter anyway.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, I don't go barefooted nearly as often as I used to since my good sense and my hobbies all seem to call for shoes, but give me half a chance to kick my shoes off, and I sure will!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>
