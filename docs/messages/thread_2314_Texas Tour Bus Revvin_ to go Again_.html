                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Bus is back in the Metroplex.  It made a brief stop yesterday at <br/>
the Many Meese Mini Meet in Flower Mound.  A moose tried to get on <br/>
board, but the bus is full up!  It almost closed the doors on his <br/>
antlers but got away just in time.  If you would like to find the <br/>
tour bus, you need to first become "Haunted by Waters"<br/>
<br/>
After you have been haunted, make your way back to the concrete <br/>
trail and continue on the concrete trail until it dead ends.  At the <br/>
dead end you need to go stand under the sign that warns about 2 <br/>
wheelers staying on the concrete.  From this sign make your way down <br/>
the dirt path leading into the woods.  Go 54 steps until you see a <br/>
split thin tree leaning against another tree on your left about 10 <br/>
or 15 feet from the path.  Stay on the path and go another 56 <br/>
steps.  On your left you should see a medium sized tree with its <br/>
trunk split into 2 and then three trunks about 5 feet from the <br/>
ground.  This tree should be 9 paces from the path.  Stand on the N <br/>
side of this tree and go 6 paces at a bearing of 60 degrees. You <br/>
should now be at a rather large oak tree entangled in a mass of <br/>
vines and broken branches.  On the east side of the oak is a fallen <br/>
tree about five feet away.  Look on the west side of the fallen tree <br/>
at the end closest to the big oak.  The box is hidden under a lot of <br/>
leaves and sticks.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are a couple of warnings for you:  this is a pretty long trek-<br/>
about 1 and 1/3 miles each way.  There are a lot of thorns between <br/>
the path and the box.  Wear long pants and sleeves and gloves.  I <br/>
apologize for the thorns, but I have found in my experience, that <br/>
thorns seriously discourage noxers, but are not going to keep a well <br/>
prepared LBer from the box.  I wanted to make absolutely sure that <br/>
all the hard work the TX group has put into these amazing stamps did <br/>
not get stolen or vandalized!  Finally, this box is HUGE and HEAVY! <br/>
I brought it in my backpack and rode my bike.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
