                    <html><body><p>The nice thing about the Marvy website is that you can buy individual colors for $1.89 each. I go through red and blue really quickly, so buying them in onesies is really nice! Also, Marvy has color selections that are beyond what I've ever seen in either Hobby Lobby or Michael's - they have eight different 12-marker sets. There is some duplication between sets, but with 108 individual colors, there isn't much overlap! <br/>
<br/>The twelve marker sets are all $22.78, which makes the everyday price of $16.99 at Hobby Lobby look real good, and makes that 30% off this week even better! Still though, if you want any specialty sets, or individual markers, check out the Marvy site and use the discount available this month.<br/>
<br/>I don't think my link earlier went through correctly, but here's the jump directly to their brush markers:<br/><br/><a href="https://www.uchida.com/eUchida/so/so_prod/so_prod_list.aspx?Cat1id=10100">https://www.uchida.com/eUchida/so/so_prod/so_prod_list.aspx?Cat1id=10100</a><br/>
