<div>I'm betting if you lookon <a href="http://geocaching.com">geocaching.com</a>, you'll be able to figure out that there is a GC nearby.  If you don't know how to do that, email me the name of the box you found and I'll help you figure it out.  Do it offlist though so we don't accidentally spoil anything for anyone!  My email is <a href="mailto:barefootlucy@gmail.com">barefootlucy@gmail.com</a></div>

the one you found sounds like something they did. Did you find it in <br/>
Athens? I believe they did put an email address in the hh so anyone <br/>
who found it could contact them. They asked me to list it on line as <br/>

have to do it themselves. I don't know if they got around to doing it <br/>
