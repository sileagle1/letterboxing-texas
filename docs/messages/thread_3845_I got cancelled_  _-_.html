Howdy all.<br/>
<br/>
	The overnight hike I was going to make this weekend got cancelled.  It<br/>
seems two of the hikers are doctors and were called to work in the hospital for<br/>
an emergency, and two others had a family emergency.  Additionally a few others<br/>
begged off - probably their gear was not rated for freezing temps overnight.  It<br/>
was 33.5F at my house at 0430 this morning.  You just gotta KNOW it was in the<br/>
20s out on the mountain.<br/>
<br/>
	My sleeping bag is rated for -30F, but I must admit after doing that<br/>
kind of thing for 20+ years in the Army, getting out of the bag at 0-dark-30<br/>
when it's below freezing is tough.  I can do it, but I was not looking forward<br/>
to THAT part of it.  So now we are on for 22-23 November.<br/>
<br/>
	NOTE:  If any of you want to come along - I will ask our guide if he has<br/>
room for more hikers on this trip.  Yeah - right.....  a warm day-hike -<br/>
maybe....  But a cold overnighter???  NOT!  <grin>.<br/>
<br/>
	I weighed my pack this morning.  50 pounds.  But I looked at my list and<br/>
couldn't think of a thing I didn't want to take.  I could shed a pound here or<br/>
there, but I really WANT to take my handheld ham-radio up there.  At 8000 feet I<br/>
can probably talk to people in Tucson and Albuquerque on 1-watt output.  Looking<br/>
at the load-plan, 22 pounds is just water.  So that means my entire gear is only<br/>
28 pounds.  I mentioned that to the hike leader and he said his pack was about<br/>
50 pounds too.  So I don't feel so bad.  Moni offered to let me use her IPOD so<br/>
I could watch a movie up there.  Naaaaa - rather play radio up there - I can<br/>
watch a movie any time.<br/>
<br/>
	Anyway - I am home.  My gear is packed and ready.  I did unpack some of<br/>
it, like the sleeping bag.  They keep their fluff longer when stored unpacked.<br/>
