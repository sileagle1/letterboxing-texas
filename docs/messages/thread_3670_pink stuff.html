<div><font size="2">I stopped by my "local" Asels today in Plano and the manager checked all the stores for big sheets (9 x 12"), but no one had any, so he told me he would go ahead and reorder some for his store, but..... it will probably take a month or so for it to come in from the company. However, if you're anywhere near Richardson (north of Dallas on 75) the Asel store there has the smaller 4 x 6" sheets. It's about $5.45 a sheet there which is about a dollar more than ordering it online. Obviously, you don't have to pay shipping, but then the gas price may equal out the cost of shipping if you order several sheets at once. Finding them at Hobby Lobby or Michaels is just hit and miss. PZ Kut (the orange stuff) is really great andÂ most people really love it. It's a little slicker to work with than the pink stuff, but once you get used to it, most people love it. You definitely have to order that online though.</font></div>

For the really intricate areas, I made a #1/2 by squeezing the #1 <br>
into a narrower groove.  I use a #1 for regular cuts, and a #5 to <br>
clear large areas.<br>
<br>
For my logbooks, it depends on how much time I'm able to invest.  I <br>
use the codex binding instructions from Atlas Quest, and love the <br>
professional looking results.  But when I need a quick logbook that <br>
still looks great, nothing beats my Bind-It-All. And if you're trying <br>
to justify the expense, you can also make a personalized photo <br>
calendar or family recipe book to give as gifts.  :)<br>

And now I'm trying to talk my mom into giving me her Crikut die-cut <br>
machine.  I LOVE crafty gadgets!<br>

<p>Thanks very much, MO5. Actually, I've been spending a lot of time lately 
  carving stamps for a few boxes that we plan on placing in San Antonio the end 
  of this month. I'm been using up some of that orange PZ Kut and it's really 
  not that bad. It makes a really nice image and you can get really crisp lines 
  with it. The only thing is the color; the transferred image is harder to see. 
  Oh, and Stampeaz is out of orange now, too. Where are we going to get carving 
  material? I really hate to go back to the "pink stuff", but may have

  I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my 
  letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, 
  Texas. I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and 
  is the official photographer for the state of Texas. In doing my usual 
  research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I 
  discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas. Most of the 
  county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild 
  turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's 
  my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by 
  Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the 
  letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and 
  I called it "Meinzer's Coyote". It had never been found until today when I got 
  a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Wyman and I found the box 
  with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, at the cemetery tonight. It was 
  loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind 
  words about Wyman's work. This was our first box to find, and will now search 
  for others and even place some of our own.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; How cool is that? As most of you know, the usual subjects of my 
  letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of 
  the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes! I'm 
  hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes. I'll try to beat 
  Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Boots

<p>Thanks very much, MO5. Actually, I've been spending a lot of time lately 
    carving stamps for a few boxes that we plan on placing in San Antonio the 
    end of this month. I'm been using up some of that orange PZ Kut and it's 
    really not that bad. It makes a really nice image and you can get really 
    crisp lines with it. The only thing is the color; the transferred image is 
    harder to see. Oh, and Stampeaz is out of orange now, too. Where are we 
    going to get carving material? I really hate to go back to the "pink stuff", 
    but may have to.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,

    I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my 
    letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, 
    Texas. I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin 
    and is the official photographer for the state of Texas. In doing my usual 
    research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I 
    discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas. Most of the 
    county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild 
    turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because 
    that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of 
    photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling 
    coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his 
    coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote". It had never been 
    found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as 
    follows:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>&gt; &gt; 
    &gt; Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, 
    at the cemetery tonight. It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time 
    and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work. This was our first 
    box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our 
    own.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; How cool is that? As most of you 
    know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas 
    in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have 
    ever found one of my boxes! I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some 
    letterboxes. I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;

I think it's easier to carve, holds an edge better and holds up better in a letterbox.  But, I stress the fact that this is only my opinion.  If you are comfortable with the pink stuff, by all means, use it, there's nothing wrong with that.  So, did I backpedal sufficiently :) ?  Really, I think if you ever carved PZ Kut, you'd see what I mean. The white stuff that you can buy at Michael's is really "bad stuff", though, because it's too crumbly and tends to break easily, so I wouldn't recommend it. I used MasterCarve for a while and it's really super easy to carve, but in my opinion, it's too soft and won't hold an edge very well, so I've settled for PZ Kut White because it's the one I've come to like more than the others.  Like I said, I've recently used the PZ Kut Orange because I couldn't get the white, and I really like it too (except for the color), but now I can't get the orange either. Having said all that, I might point out that I carve with an X-acto knife instead of gouges, so that might make a difference because I tend to cut deeper.<br>

&gt;     Thanks very much, MO5. Actually, I've been spending a lot of time lately carving stamps for a few boxes that we plan on placing in San Antonio the end of this month. I'm been using up some of that orange PZ Kut and it's really not that bad. It makes a really nice image and you can get really crisp lines with it. The only thing is the color; the transferred image is harder to see. Oh, and Stampeaz is out of orange now, too. Where are we going to get carving material? I really hate to go back to the "pink stuff", but may have to.<br/>
