                    <div class="plaintext-content">Apparently Parks &amp; Wildlife recently reduced staffing<br/>
at Rusk State Park so that the park is only staffed<br/>
Friday-Monday.  The result is that with no one at the<br/>
gate to tell them the park is full, folks are pouring<br/>
in tonight and setting up camp without reservations,<br/>
despite the fact the park has been booked for quite a<br/>
long time.  <br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle and Baby Bear are already here and are<br/>
going to attack the problem early on (they themselves<br/>
are having to share a site with someone else for the<br/>
night); however, if you have reservations at the park<br/>
for tomorrow, I suggest you get here as early as<br/>
possible so you can make sure to press the point that<br/>
you have a reservation.  If you can't be here early,<br/>
send me your reservation information and cell phone<br/>
number and I'll try to check you in at check-in time. <br/>
At the very least, I'll pressure them that you are on<br/>
your way and expect to have a site waiting for you. <br/>
<br/>
It'll get sorted out and we'll have a great weekend. <br/>
Looking forward to seeing all of you!<br/>

P.S.  I ran across this map today of Rusk and its<br/>
highlights.  For those of you planning on planting<br/>
boxes while you're here, this might give you some<br/>
ideas about where to plant:<br/>
