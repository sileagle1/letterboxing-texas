                    <div class="plaintext-content">Apparently Parks & Wildlife recently reduced staffing<br>
at Rusk State Park so that the park is only staffed<br>
Friday-Monday.  The result is that with no one at the<br>
gate to tell them the park is full, folks are pouring<br>
in tonight and setting up camp without reservations,<br>
despite the fact the park has been booked for quite a<br>
long time.  <br>
<br>
Silver Eagle and Baby Bear are already here and are<br>
going to attack the problem early on (they themselves<br>
are having to share a site with someone else for the<br>
night); however, if you have reservations at the park<br>
for tomorrow, I suggest you get here as early as<br>
possible so you can make sure to press the point that<br>
you have a reservation.  If you can't be here early,<br>
send me your reservation information and cell phone<br>
number and I'll try to check you in at check-in time. <br>
At the very least, I'll pressure them that you are on<br>
your way and expect to have a site waiting for you. <br>
<br>
It'll get sorted out and we'll have a great weekend. <br>
Looking forward to seeing all of you!<br>

P.S.  I ran across this map today of Rusk and its<br>
highlights.  For those of you planning on planting<br>
boxes while you're here, this might give you some<br>
ideas about where to plant:<br>
