Please do try to come! <br>
Gatherings are a great way to meet other letterboxers & swap tall tales<br>
about planting & hunting...who else would understand our fascination with<br>
Tupperware???<br>
We can't offer you a ride because we're combining this with family stuff,<br>
but I hope you'll come!<br>
This gathering looks as though it may be small, which is sometimes rather<br>
nice - we'll all really get to chat!<br>
Don't forget your recipe cards!<br>

I've gotten a couple of new RSVP's today and, of<br>
course, the possibility of a special guest, so at this<br>
moment we are looking at the possibility of about 35<br>
people.  12 of those are kiddos, so it's looking like<br>
a nice small group of folks!<br>
<br>
Come on...we'd love to have you!<br>
