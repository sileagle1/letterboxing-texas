Please do try to come! <br/>
Gatherings are a great way to meet other letterboxers &amp; swap tall tales<br/>
about planting &amp; hunting...who else would understand our fascination with<br/>
Tupperware???<br/>
We can't offer you a ride because we're combining this with family stuff,<br/>
but I hope you'll come!<br/>
This gathering looks as though it may be small, which is sometimes rather<br/>
nice - we'll all really get to chat!<br/>
Don't forget your recipe cards!<br/>

I've gotten a couple of new RSVP's today and, of<br/>
course, the possibility of a special guest, so at this<br/>
moment we are looking at the possibility of about 35<br/>
people.  12 of those are kiddos, so it's looking like<br/>
a nice small group of folks!<br/>
<br/>
Come on...we'd love to have you!<br/>
