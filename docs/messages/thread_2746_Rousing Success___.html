                    <html><body><div>I walked in the door about 8 p.m. Saturday night and started a sitrep on the Cub Scout campout, but I kept dozing off at the keyboard so I finally dragged myself to bed for more hours' sleep in a row than I've had in ages.  I awoke Sunday morning at 8 
a.m. (very late for me!) and then only because Lightning was standing over me whispering "Mom, Mom" in my face and shoving the phone at me...not quite sure who called or what I said, but either it wasn't important or I'll find out soon.  I just hope I didn't agree to DO anything else for awhile! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - the campout was unequivocally a success overall and letterboxing was the hit of the century it seemed as we read evaluations after the event was over.  If you were just waiting to hear the outcome, there it is, but let me tell you about the whole campout and how it went... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have to say - I love Camp Pirtle.  I think maybe the person I am most envious of in the world is the ranger's kid - they live right there on camp and he has the opportunity to roam over the whole camp every day! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, Lightning and I hit the road and sang camp songs all the way to Pirtle (about an hour's drive) as loudly as we could with the windows rolled down.  How can you show up to camp anything less than totally stoked and ready to go?  We got to camp just ahead of the boys so we didn't have time to go out and check boxes as we had hoped, so I sent Lightning with a load of stuff down to the staff camping area and I hung out in HQ and got ready to hand out stamps.  As other staff came in, we got them all pumped up too, so that by the time the boys started arriving, we were all riding the wave and nothing could have brought us down! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As the dads came in to sign in and do any last minute paperwork, the boys were directed to me and I had about 20 stamps at any given time laid out on the table for them to choose from.  I explained to them that they were choosing a team stamp for them and their dad and that they needed to hold on to it until breakfast, when they would get more explanation about the game we would be playing all day.  I was amazed first of all by how much thought they put into the selection and secondly by the fact that only a couple of times did I hear the words "I don't like any of them" or "what else do you have?".  After they chose, they test stamped their stamp and then, if they still liked it, they stamped it in to my Book of Record - a logbook I had especially for them to record their stamps in.  The boys kept pouring in and we kept handing out stamps.  The bag was pretty close to empty and there was still no sign of the end of the line.  Finally, suddenly, when I was down to about eight stamps, they quit showing up and it was campfire time - whew!  Still though, we knew we would have check-ins in the morning and we would need more stamps for those boys.  Yikes!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox was the MC for the campfire, and he did a great job of getting them totally rocking out of their seats and ready to go, then we sent them off to bed.  Hehe...glad I wasn't a daddy that night!   After campfire, we headed back to HQ for the last staff meeting until after the event.  I still hadn't met my staff (except for Lightning) but I was kind of bummed because I knew I wasn't getting boy scouts, which I had asked for because of their outdoor skills.  She Who Reads (SWR) started out with event heads to see who of us still had outstanding issues.   Since my event was the pivot point for the whole camp, she started with me, so I started out by asking who had ever heard of letterboxing.  One woman across the room raised her hand and told me her friend had found one once.  Well...that was a start anyway.  As it happened (and completely coincidentally I later learned), that woman - Angel - was to be on my staff!  YEA!  That was cool.  Her friend and her friend's 16 year old son were to be on staff with me also.  And that was okay - I guess - except that they just didn't seem to have the spirit I would've liked.  And I judged the kid for a punk.  Oh well.  One out of three, plus Lightning, could work, as long as the two didn't get in our way.  I explained to the rest of the staff exactly what letterboxing was and what I had for them - specifically, each station was to have a box of its own, and they were to find a way to make sure their box was either manned or prominent enough the boys could see it and access it for themselves.  The idea behind that was to occupy them briefly while they waited.  They were still pretty much clueless, but willing to give it a try, and that was cool!  I told my station staff that we would be striking out at 6 
a.m. to go letterboxing and invited anyone else who cared to join us to come along!  Angel said "Why are we waiting until in the morning?  Let's go now!"  I found me a new best friend - sorry, SWR!  Of course, I also still had to carve more stamps and print clues, but I needed to clarify a couple of points in the clues so it made sense to head out after the staff meeting so I could print clues before I went to bed.  A couple other staffers had been interested in carving and one was an artist, so they volunteered to carve some stamps for me.  I pushed the tools and the material at them and they set to work and turned out about 10 stamps before they turned in!  The two extra members of my staff had to go home for the night and Lightning had connected with members of a Henderson troop and was hanging out with them, so Angel and I headed out at 11 
p.m. to go letterboxing.  She didn't have a flashlight or anything, so we used my headlamp and I gave her the clues and I carried the stick and the gloves (snakes and stuff, you know).  While we were out, I knew we had to check those two clues and we had to remove a box I had inadvertantly placed on the area to be used for the sling shot range.  I kept getting this picture of little cub scouts dodging kibble lobbed by sling shots while trying to grab the box.  Funny as the picture was, I was pretty sure dog food could still hurt, so it seemed prudent to forego the humor factor and observe safety practices.  Oh well. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, off we went.  Now let me just say - I learned in the first five minutes that Angel is flat crazy!  Bear in mind - I was the one with the light and she was the one with the clues, so you would think she would want to stay close, but NOOOOO!  She stuck around long enough to read and remember the clues to the first box and she was off and going - in the dark - on a cloudy night - and into the most remote part of camp, where no one was camping and far off the main road.  Hmmm...I could tell this was gonna be an interesting night and I was really glad I had gone back for my cell phone.  Finally she reached the first point of decision and realized she didn't have enough light to know she was going right, so she stopped and waited for me.  I caught up with her and we had to go off the road, so then we were under heavy tree cover as well and it was REALLY dark!  Did that slow her down???   Noooo.  Did I mention she's crazy?  She was like a little kid, coming to a decision point and having to wait impatiently.  Finally, when she had to spot a hickory tree she was stumped (no pun intended) and was shuffling around every tree.  We were deep enough off-road that I was getting pretty worried about snakes, but she was making enough noise I guess they were probably all gone anyway (unless, of course, she had scared them INTO their homes all snuggled up around boxes).  She settled down after that and took things a little slower and I was breathing a little easier that maybe we would have no casualties that night after all.  We found a few boxes (and hunting in the dark WAS exhilarating - like finding boxes even though I had hidden them!) - and got the stuff taken care of that I needed and we were heading back to HQ.  I felt like we were home free when we got off trails and paths and back onto dirt roads.  And then - I fell.  I stepped into a hole with the side of my shoe and it was enough to send me rolling.  Now did I mention Angel is crazy?  She FREAKED smooth out!  I lay there for a moment to evaluate myself and thought through what I had taught the boys in Be Ready and Readyman - Be Brave, Be Calm, Be Clear, Be Careful.  And we always yelled it so they would remember it.  I was pretty sure I was okay, except for my left knee, so I lay there another moment while she kept tripping and finally I realized I was laying in the dark and hadn't yet moved, so she thought I had knocked myself out and she was stuck in the woods with me and didn't know how to get back.  Finally, I yelled at her "ANGEL!"  And started yelling "Be Calm Be Brave...." and then we both started laughing like mad women (which ONE of us was).  I finally decided to get up and see how bad my knee was, and I was able to stand up and put weight on it even though it hurt like hell.  Now I vowed a long time ago I wasn't ever gonna get carried out of the woods unless I was unconscious and I wasn't going to have that happen now, especially being as close to the event as we were and I knew nobody on staff needed the distraction.  So there was no choice but to walk on.  We were about a half mile from HQ and a quarter mile from the nearest campsite.  So we started walking.  And then we realized something was walking in the woods next to us.  Oh yes it was.  And then I thought about our recent thread here about scary moments.  And I thought - "Here I am with a banged up knee, a newbie, and an unknown creature.  And what were we doing out here?  Letterboxing!  YES...this makes a scary letterboxing moment!"  I turned my headlamp toward the woods and whatever it was seemed to move a little further into the woods, but as we walked on, it seemed to be walking along with us still, so I would periodically turn my lamp into the woods to see if it would move away.  Of course, it is very difficult to tell distance or size or anything else when something is tramping through leaves in the dark, so it could've been a field mouse or it could've been a bobcat or something, but it was unmistakably moving with us.  And even though Angel never said, I know what she was thinking:  "Here I am stuck in the woods with this fat injured woman, and something is about to jump out of the woods and I'm gonna have to protect her and me both."  and to her credit, she put herself between me and the woods - just in case, I'm sure.  Eventually we heard a whoosh and a squeal and a struggle, and then wings flying away and then silence.  We figure it must've been a small creature moving next to the road and an owl had just hunted down dinner.  We finally broke into the clearing and were in view of the HQ building and we both breathed sighs of relief and were a little giddy. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a little after midnight when we got back inside and Angel headed to bed and I settled in to my laptop to begin finalizing clues.  There was still a staff of about 8 up and working out last minute details that can't be handled until there is a final headcount.  Finally at 2 
a.m., SWR and FF and I, along with our professional scout guy, were the last staff still up and I was printing the very last of the clue sets.  SWR and FF made arrangements together to meet back at HQ at 6 a.m. to go lay out the sling shot range and we headed off to bed.  Now Lightning had much earlier headed down to staff camp for bed and all of our gear had wound up down there, but he had since returned to HQ because he "wanted to help us finish up" (he was scared to go to sleep in those open tents without us there with him) and we had sent him to sleep in the car.  There was a cabin much closer to HQ so we decided to crash there instead, and after a brief search for my car keys we headed to the cabin where we actually got hot showers and hit bed about 3 
a.m.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking perky at 7:30 a.m. breakfast with a seriously banged up knee and 3.5 hours of sleep is NOT easy and it is a good thing Lightning and I had gotten ourselves so pumped up, or I couldn't have done it.  I hit the nurse's cabin at 7 
a.m. and got an ACE bandage and a ride to the mess hall and I had left my stuff at HQ to be brought down by the transportation people.  As breakfast was ending, I realized my stuff had not arrived, but I had my handouts so I lined them out with letterboxing information and sent them up to HQ to pick up their logbook pages (which had been among the stuff that was supposed to be transported).  As I was bumming another ride back up to HQ, I heard on a radio that the transportation people had not shown up and the range staff was trying to do that job too, and the logbooks had been moved to Map and Compass.  So I had just turned 160 boys and their dads loose on HQ for something they weren't going to get there.   Meanwhile, they were sending someone to Map and Compass to move the logbooks to Handicrafts, so by the time the campers got to Map and Compass the books would have been moved again.  By the time I got to my area, I had a few very upset daddies, but my staff and I helped them get a little perspective on things and they cheered up.  Still though - it was a rocky way to start the day and I sure hoped things smoothed out or it was gonna be a long one.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so the moment of truth - it was time to start teaching my first round and I was about to find out what they thought of letterboxing.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had already gone about telling them HOW to letterbox in the mess hall so those that didn't have my class first off could get started anyway, so I began by talking very briefly about the history of letterboxing in England, then in the United States, then in Texas, and finally, in the counties that these boys were from.  Then I talked to them about LNT and respect and how scouts and letterboxers are alike in a lot of ways.  Then I showed them the material used for carving and so forth.    I talked to them for about 10-12 minutes, ended by reading a wonderful letter Corazon had written to them, then I turned them loose to go, and we sat down and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And they never came back, which was a good thing!  Not a single one came back grousing about clues or "this is stupid" or "this is too hard" - the most I saw from them was when they came back to start on another clue (they all keyed from my area) and - they were all SMILING!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the meantime, the other two members of my staff, Sharon and Justin, had shown back up and Angel and Lightning and I were orienting them to what was going on.  I felt a little better about them in the morning, but I changed my view entirely of them as we got kicked off good.  Through all the transportation confusion, my personal gear had never been moved away from HQ, so I sent the kid to go get my backpack at least so I could show my logbook and carry-along stuff.  The kid took off at a run and turned back up in a smooth 10 minutes - no small feat since we were deep in the woods.  I was impressed!  Angel wanted to find some more boxes and Sharon wanted to go as well.  Justin and I sat and talked for awhile and I realized there was a lot more to the young man than his appearance indicated, and I was once again reminded that it is never good to judge a book by his cover.  He was my designated runner from then on, and once he had made a trip around camp he could find his way anywhere he needed to go without taking roads and paths - that uncanny sense of direction I wish I had!  His mother, meanwhile, listened to one round of my class and had it figured out.  While I was talking, I didn't have to turn away to look for anything - stuff miraculously turned up at my fingertips at just the moment I needed it.  I really did wind up with the best staff there, even if they weren't exactly what I had hoped for to begin with.  And Lightning?  Well he saw everything was under control and he took off and had a  grand ol' time running around camp all day.  So much for staffing, but oh well.  It was his first time being at Pirtle without being under someone's thumb, so he had a good time and probably learned a lot about the camp that he never knew.  He was apparently very helpful wherever he went because I got several compliments on him; he just reassigned himself to be a floater I guess.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had planted 14 boxes but had to pick one up, so I had a loose box during the morning.  I told the boys that if they found all 13 boxes, I would give them the clues to a 14th, so I sent Justin to find a place to plant the extra box and he came back and told me where it was - it turned out to be a very good hiding place!  I thought 13 would be a challenge, even in a small area, but it turned out that about a third of the teams got the 13.  They came back to me and I gave them the clue verbally in the form of a riddle, so it was a lot different than the standard "turn right, turn left" they had been following.  Most of the boys got it pretty quickly and the dads had to struggle to figure it out!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It turns out - they almost universally loved letterboxing.  Some of them skipped other sessions to box, others skipped meals.  One team stopped by periodically to tell me exactly how far I had made them walk (the dad had a pedometer on).  One guy called me evil (while laughing), and another dad, one of them who was upset in the morning, stopped by and thanked me for helping him straighten his attitude out because he never would've had as much fun with his son if it hadn't been for my event.  But even if I never talked to them again after my class with them, they all smiled and waved as they walked by!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had purposely NOT told them much about letterboxing outside the boundaries of Pirtle, although I had told them it was out there.  I figured either they would be interested enough to ask, or they would find it on their own, but I didn't want to spoonfeed information to everyone.  Sure enough, I had about 7 teams that came back and wanted websites and email addresses.  Another woman who was staffing came over and hung out with me for an hour or so learning all about it, and she wants to participate in the May 12th planting initiative.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the end of the day, I sent Angel and Justin out to pick up boxes and figured that would be the proof of the pudding - IF they were able to recover all 14 and what condition they would be in when I got them.  I told them to very specifically look at how the boxes were sealed and rehidden and whether they were in the right places.  When they came back, they reported that all but one box was completely covered, and they were all sealed tightly except one, which I had made by camo taping a ziploc - I wanted to try that out.  As I opened the boxes to remove the ink pads I saw that  they were all very clean, so I was finally impressed that they had not muddied up the pads and had obviously cleaned their stamps between boxes. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm looking forward to seeing if any of these guys decide to pursue letterboxing because many, many of them enjoyed it enough to note it as their favorite activity on their evaluations (beating out shooting sports, which is always the top dog at district camps).  I think if they do get involved, they'll be very good boxers, if what we saw Saturday was any indication.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The camp overall was a huge success as well, with dads writing things on their evals like "I never thought my son and I could've bonded the way we did this weekend" and "I never knew my son was such a cool kid" and "My son told me he thought he was in heaven" and "We learned we make a pretty good team".  How can you get any better than that?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My thanks again to Puddle Splasher, JB Kokopelli, GingerCat, Corazon, TxDragonfly, and MoWizLiz for carving stamps.  It made quite an impression on the boys and dads that folks that weren't scouters were willing to contribute their artwork toward the event!

<div>Fearless Fox was the MC for the campfire, and he did a great job of getting them totally rocking out of their seats and ready to go, then we sent them off to bed.  Hehe...glad I wasn't a daddy that night!   After campfire, we headed back to HQ for the last staff meeting until after the event.  I still hadn't met my staff (except for Lightning) but I was kind of bummed because I knew I wasn't getting boy scouts, which I had asked for because of their outdoor skills.  She Who Reads (SWR) started out with event heads to see who of us still had outstanding issues.   Since my event was the pivot point for the whole camp, she started with me, so I started out by asking who had ever heard of letterboxing.  One woman across the room raised her hand and told me her friend had found one once.  Well...that was a start anyway.  As it happened (and completely coincidentally I later learned), that woman - Angel - was to be on my staff!  YEA!  That was cool.  Her friend and her friend's 16 year old son were to be on staff with me also.  And that was okay - I guess - except that they just didn't seem to have the spirit I would've liked.  And I judged the kid for a punk.  Oh well.  One out of three, plus Lightning, could work, as long as the two didn't get in our way.  I explained to the rest of the staff exactly what letterboxing was and what I had for them - specifically, each station was to have a box of its own, and they were to find a way to make sure their box was either manned or prominent enough the boys could see it and access it for themselves.  The idea behind that was to occupy them briefly while they waited.  They were still pretty much clueless, but willing to give it a try, and that was cool!  I told my station staff that we would be striking out at 6 a.m. to go letterboxing and invited anyone else who cared to join us to come along!  Angel said "Why are we waiting until in the morning?  Let's go now!"  I found me a new best friend - sorry, SWR!  Of course, I also still had to carve more stamps and print clues, but I needed to clarify a couple of points in the clues so it made sense to head out after the staff meeting so I could print clues before I went to bed.  A couple other staffers had been interested in carving and one was an artist, so they volunteered to carve some stamps for me.  I pushed the tools and the material at them and they set to work and turned out about 10 stamps before they turned in!  The two extra members of my staff had to go home for the night and Lightning had connected with members of a Henderson troop and was hanging out with them, so Angel and I headed out at 11 p.m. to go letterboxing.  She didn't have a flashlight or anything, so we used my headlamp and I gave her the clues and I carried the stick and the gloves (snakes and stuff, you know).  While we were out, I knew we had to check those two clues and we had to remove a box I had inadvertantly placed on the area to be used for the sling shot range.  I kept getting this picture of little cub scouts dodging kibble lobbed by sling shots while trying to grab the box.  Funny as the picture was, I was pretty sure dog food could still hurt, so it seemed prudent to forego the humor factor and observe safety practices.  Oh well. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, off we went.  Now let me just say - I learned in the first five minutes that Angel is flat crazy!  Bear in mind - I was the one with the light and she was the one with the clues, so you would think she would want to stay close, but NOOOOO!  She stuck around long enough to read and remember the clues to the first box and she was off and going - in the dark - on a cloudy night - and into the most remote part of camp, where no one was camping and far off the main road.  Hmmm...I could tell this was gonna be an interesting night and I was really glad I had gone back for my cell phone.  Finally she reached the first point of decision and realized she didn't have enough light to know she was going right, so she stopped and waited for me.  I caught up with her and we had to go off the road, so then we were under heavy tree cover as well and it was REALLY dark!  Did that slow her down???   Noooo.  Did I mention she's crazy?  She was like a little kid, coming to a decision point and having to wait impatiently.  Finally, when she had to spot a hickory tree she was stumped (no pun intended) and was shuffling around every tree.  We were deep enough off-road that I was getting pretty worried about snakes, but she was making enough noise I guess they were probably all gone anyway (unless, of course, she had scared them INTO their homes all snuggled up around boxes).  She settled down after that and took things a little slower and I was breathing a little easier that maybe we would have no casualties that night after all.  We found a few boxes (and hunting in the dark WAS exhilarating - like finding boxes even though I had hidden them!) - and got the stuff taken care of that I needed and we were heading back to HQ.  I felt like we were home free when we got off trails and paths and back onto dirt roads.  And then - I fell.  I stepped into a hole with the side of my shoe and it was enough to send me rolling.  Now did I mention Angel is crazy?  She FREAKED smooth out!  I lay there for a moment to evaluate myself and thought through what I had taught the boys in Be Ready and Readyman - Be Brave, Be Calm, Be Clear, Be Careful.  And we always yelled it so they would remember it.  I was pretty sure I was okay, except for my left knee, so I lay there another moment while she kept tripping and finally I realized I was laying in the dark and hadn't yet moved, so she thought I had knocked myself out and she was stuck in the woods with me and didn't know how to get back.  Finally, I yelled at her "ANGEL!"  And started yelling "Be Calm Be Brave...." and then we both started laughing like mad women (which ONE of us was).  I finally decided to get up and see how bad my knee was, and I was able to stand up and put weight on it even though it hurt like hell.  Now I vowed a long time ago I wasn't ever gonna get carried out of the woods unless I was unconscious and I wasn't going to have that happen now, especially being as close to the event as we were and I knew nobody on staff needed the distraction.  So there was no choice but to walk on.  We were about a half mile from HQ and a quarter mile from the nearest campsite.  So we started walking.  And then we realized something was walking in the woods next to us.  Oh yes it was.  And then I thought about our recent thread here about scary moments.  And I thought - "Here I am with a banged up knee, a newbie, and an unknown creature.  And what were we doing out here?  Letterboxing!  YES...this makes a scary letterboxing moment!"  I turned my headlamp toward the woods and whatever it was seemed to move a little further into the woods, but as we walked on, it seemed to be walking along with us still, so I would periodically turn my lamp into the woods to see if it would move away.  Of course, it is very difficult to tell distance or size or anything else when something is tramping through leaves in the dark, so it could've been a field mouse or it could've been a bobcat or something, but it was unmistakably moving with us.  And even though Angel never said, I know what she was thinking:  "Here I am stuck in the woods with this fat injured woman, and something is about to jump out of the woods and I'm gonna have to protect her and me both."  and to her credit, she put herself between me and the woods - just in case, I'm sure.  Eventually we heard a whoosh and a squeal and a struggle, and then wings flying away and then silence.  We figure it must've been a small creature moving next to the road and an owl had just hunted down dinner.  We finally broke into the clearing and were in view of the HQ building and we both breathed sighs of relief and were a little giddy. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a little after midnight when we got back inside and Angel headed to bed and I settled in to my laptop to begin finalizing clues.  There was still a staff of about 8 up and working out last minute details that can't be handled until there is a final headcount.  Finally at 2 a.m., SWR and FF and I, along with our professional scout guy, were the last staff still up and I was printing the very last of the clue sets.  SWR and FF made arrangements together to meet back at HQ at 6 a.m. to go lay out the sling shot range and we headed off to bed.  Now Lightning had much earlier headed down to staff camp for bed and all of our gear had wound up down there, but he had since returned to HQ because he "wanted to help us finish up" (he was scared to go to sleep in those open tents without us there with him) and we had sent him to sleep in the car.  There was a cabin much closer to HQ so we decided to crash there instead, and after a brief search for my car keys we headed to the cabin where we actually got hot showers and hit bed about 3 a.m.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking perky at 7:30 a.m. breakfast with a seriously banged up knee and 3.5 hours of sleep is NOT easy and it is a good thing Lightning and I had gotten ourselves so pumped up, or I couldn't have done it.  I hit the nurse's cabin at 7 a.m. and got an ACE bandage and a ride to the mess hall and I had left my stuff at HQ to be brought down by the transportation people.  As breakfast was ending, I realized my stuff had not arrived, but I had my handouts so I lined them out with letterboxing information and sent them up to HQ to pick up their logbook pages (which had been among the stuff that was supposed to be transported)<wbr>.  As I was bumming another ride back up to HQ, I heard on a radio that the transportation people had not shown up and the range staff was trying to do that job too, and the logbooks had been moved to Map and Compass.  So I had just turned 160 boys and their dads loose on HQ for something they weren't going to get there.   Meanwhile, they were sending someone to Map and Compass to move the logbooks to Handicrafts, so by the time the campers got to Map and Compass the books would have been moved again.  By the time I got to my area, I had a few very upset daddies, but my staff and I helped them get a little perspective on things and they cheered up.  Still though - it was a rocky way to start the day and I sure hoped things smoothed out or it was gonna be a long one.  </wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so the moment of truth - it was time to start teaching my first round and I was about to find out what they thought of letterboxing.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had already gone about telling them HOW to letterbox in the mess hall so those that didn't have my class first off could get started anyway, so I began by talking very briefly about the history of letterboxing in England, then in the United States, then in Texas, and finally, in the counties that these boys were from.  Then I talked to them about LNT and respect and how scouts and letterboxers are alike in a lot of ways.  Then I showed them the material used for carving and so forth.    I talked to them for about 10-12 minutes, ended by reading a wonderful letter Corazon had written to them, then I turned them loose to go, and we sat down and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And they never came back, which was a good thing!  Not a single one came back grousing about clues or "this is stupid" or "this is too hard" - the most I saw from them was when they came back to start on another clue (they all keyed from my area) and - they were all SMILING!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the meantime, the other two members of my staff, Sharon and Justin, had shown back up and Angel and Lightning and I were orienting them to what was going on.  I felt a little better about them in the morning, but I changed my view entirely of them as we got kicked off good.  Through all the transportation confusion, my personal gear had never been moved away from HQ, so I sent the kid to go get my backpack at least so I could show my logbook and carry-along stuff.  The kid took off at a run and turned back up in a smooth 10 minutes - no small feat since we were deep in the woods.  I was impressed!  Angel wanted to find some more boxes and Sharon wanted to go as well.  Justin and I sat and talked for awhile and I realized there was a lot more to the young man than his appearance indicated, and I was once again reminded that it is never good to judge a book by his cover.  He was my designated runner from then on, and once he had made a trip around camp he could find his way anywhere he needed to go without taking roads and paths - that uncanny sense of direction I wish I had!  His mother, meanwhile, listened to one round of my class and had it figured out.  While I was talking, I didn't have to turn away to look for anything - stuff miraculously turned up at my fingertips at just the moment I needed it.  I really did wind up with the best staff there, even if they weren't exactly what I had hoped for to begin with.  And Lightning?  Well he saw everything was under control and he took off and had a  grand ol' time running around camp all day.  So much for staffing, but oh well.  It was his first time being at Pirtle without being under someone's thumb, so he had a good time and probably learned a lot about the camp that he never knew.  He was apparently very helpful wherever he went because I got several compliments on him; he just reassigned himself to be a floater I guess. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had planted 14 boxes but had to pick one up, so I had a loose box during the morning.  I told the boys that if they found all 13 boxes, I would give them the clues to a 14th, so I sent Justin to find a place to plant the extra box and he came back and told me where it was - it turned out to be a very good hiding place!  I thought 13 would be a challenge, even in a small area, but it turned out that about a third of the teams got the 13.  They came back to me and I gave them the clue verbally in the form of a riddle, so it was a lot different than the standard "turn right, turn left" they had been following.  Most of the boys got it pretty quickly and the dads had to struggle to figure it out! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It turns out - they almost universally loved letterboxing.  Some of them skipped other sessions to box, others skipped meals.  One team stopped by periodically to tell me exactly how far I had made them walk (the dad had a pedometer on).  One guy called me evil (while laughing), and another dad, one of them who was upset in the morning, stopped by and thanked me for helping him straighten his attitude out because he never would've had as much fun with his son if it hadn't been for my event.  But even if I never talked to them again after my class with them, they all smiled and waved as they walked by!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had purposely NOT told them much about letterboxing outside the boundaries of Pirtle, although I had told them it was out there.  I figured either they would be interested enough to ask, or they would find it on their own, but I didn't want to spoonfeed information to everyone.  Sure enough, I had about 7 teams that came back and wanted websites and email addresses.  Another woman who was staffing came over and hung out with me for an hour or so learning all about it, and she wants to participate in the May 12th planting initiative.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the end of the day, I sent Angel and Justin out to pick up boxes and figured that would be the proof of the pudding - IF they were able to recover all 14 and what condition they would be in when I got them.  I told them to very specifically look at how the boxes were sealed and rehidden and whether they were in the right places.  When they came back, they reported that all but one box was completely covered, and they were all sealed tightly except one, which I had made by camo taping a ziploc - I wanted to try that out.  As I opened the boxes to remove the ink pads I saw that  they were all very clean, so I was finally impressed that they had not muddied up the pads and had obviously cleaned their stamps between boxes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm looking forward to seeing if any of these guys decide to pursue letterboxing because many, many of them enjoyed it enough to note it as their favorite activity on their evaluations (beating out shooting sports, which is always the top dog at district camps).  I think if they do get involved, they'll be very good boxers, if what we saw Saturday was any indication. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The camp overall was a huge success as well, with dads writing things on their evals like "I never thought my son and I could've bonded the way we did this weekend" and "I never knew my son was such a cool kid" and "My son told me he thought he was in heaven" and "We learned we make a pretty good team".  How can you get any better than that? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My thanks again to Puddle Splasher, JB Kokopelli, GingerCat, Corazon, TxDragonfly, and MoWizLiz for carving stamps.  It made quite an impression on the boys and dads that folks that weren't scouters were willing to contribute their artwork toward the event! <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>
</p><div>I walked in the door about 8 p.m. Saturday night and started a sitrep on the Cub Scout campout, but I kept dozing off at the keyboard so I finally dragged myself to bed for more hours' sleep in a row than I've had in ages.  I awoke Sunday morning at 8 a.m. (very late for me!) and then only because Lightning was standing over me whispering "Mom, Mom" in my face and shoving the phone at me...not quite sure who called or what I said, but either it wasn't important or I'll find out soon.  I just hope I didn't agree to DO anything else for awhile! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - the campout was unequivocally a success overall and letterboxing was the hit of the century it seemed as we read evaluations after the event was over.  If you were just waiting to hear the outcome, there it is, but let me tell you about the whole campout and how it went... </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have to say - I love Camp Pirtle.  I think maybe the person I am most envious of in the world is the ranger's kid - they live right there on camp and he has the opportunity to roam over the whole camp every day! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, Lightning and I hit the road and sang camp songs all the way to Pirtle (about an hour's drive) as loudly as we could with the windows rolled down.  How can you show up to camp anything less than totally stoked and ready to go?  We got to camp just ahead of the boys so we didn't have time to go out and check boxes as we had hoped, so I sent Lightning with a load of stuff down to the staff camping area and I hung out in HQ and got ready to hand out stamps.  As other staff came in, we got them all pumped up too, so that by the time the boys started arriving, we were all riding the wave and nothing could have brought us down! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As the dads came in to sign in and do any last minute paperwork, the boys were directed to me and I had about 20 stamps at any given time laid out on the table for them to choose from.  I explained to them that they were choosing a team stamp for them and their dad and that they needed to hold on to it until breakfast, when they would get more explanation about the game we would be playing all day.  I was amazed first of all by how much thought they put into the selection and secondly by the fact that only a couple of times did I hear the words "I don't like any of them" or "what else do you have?".  After they chose, they test stamped their stamp and then, if they still liked it, they stamped it in to my Book of Record - a logbook I had especially for them to record their stamps in.  The boys kept pouring in and we kept handing out stamps.  The bag was pretty close to empty and there was still no sign of the end of the line.  Finally, suddenly, when I was down to about eight stamps, they quit showing up and it was campfire time - whew!  Still though, we knew we would have check-ins in the morning and we would need more stamps for those boys.  Yikes!  </div>

<div>It was a little after midnight when we got back inside and Angel headed to bed and I settled in to my laptop to begin finalizing clues.  There was still a staff of about 8 up and working out last minute details that can't be handled until there is a final headcount.  Finally at 2 a.m., SWR and FF and I, along with our professional scout guy, were the last staff still up and I was printing the very last of the clue sets.  SWR and FF made arrangements together to meet back at HQ at 6 a.m. to go lay out the sling shot range and we headed off to bed.  Now Lightning had much earlier headed down to staff camp for bed and all of our gear had wound up down there, but he had since returned to HQ because he "wanted to help us finish up" (he was scared to go to sleep in those open tents without us there with him) and we had sent him to sleep in the car.  There was a cabin much closer to HQ so we decided to crash there instead, and after a brief search for my car keys we headed to the cabin where we actually got hot showers and hit bed about 3 a.m.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking perky at 7:30 a.m. breakfast with a seriously banged up knee and 3.5 hours of sleep is NOT easy and it is a good thing Lightning and I had gotten ourselves so pumped up, or I couldn't have done it.  I hit the nurse's cabin at 7 a.m. and got an ACE bandage and a ride to the mess hall and I had left my stuff at HQ to be brought down by the transportation people.  As breakfast was ending, I realized my stuff had not arrived, but I had my handouts so I lined them out with letterboxing information and sent them up to HQ to pick up their logbook pages (which had been among the stuff that was supposed to be transported)<wbr>.  As I was bumming another ride back up to HQ, I heard on a radio that the transportation people had not shown up and the range staff was trying to do that job too, and the logbooks had been moved to Map and Compass.  So I had just turned 160 boys and their dads loose on HQ for something they weren't going to get there.   Meanwhile, they were sending someone to Map and Compass to move the logbooks to Handicrafts, so by the time the campers got to Map and Compass the books would have been moved again.  By the time I got to my area, I had a few very upset daddies, but my staff and I helped them get a little perspective on things and they cheered up.  Still though - it was a rocky way to start the day and I sure hoped things smoothed out or it was gonna be a long one.  </wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so the moment of truth - it was time to start teaching my first round and I was about to find out what they thought of letterboxing.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had already gone about telling them HOW to letterbox in the mess hall so those that didn't have my class first off could get started anyway, so I began by talking very briefly about the history of letterboxing in England, then in the United States, then in Texas, and finally, in the counties that these boys were from.  Then I talked to them about LNT and respect and how scouts and letterboxers are alike in a lot of ways.  Then I showed them the material used for carving and so forth.    I talked to them for about 10-12 minutes, ended by reading a wonderful letter Corazon had written to them, then I turned them loose to go, and we sat down and waited.  And waited.  And waited.  And they never came back, which was a good thing!  Not a single one came back grousing about clues or "this is stupid" or "this is too hard" - the most I saw from them was when they came back to start on another clue (they all keyed from my area) and - they were all SMILING!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the meantime, the other two members of my staff, Sharon and Justin, had shown back up and Angel and Lightning and I were orienting them to what was going on.  I felt a little better about them in the morning, but I changed my view entirely of them as we got kicked off good.  Through all the transportation confusion, my personal gear had never been moved away from HQ, so I sent the kid to go get my backpack at least so I could show my logbook and carry-along stuff.  The kid took off at a run and turned back up in a smooth 10 minutes - no small feat since we were deep in the woods.  I was impressed!  Angel wanted to find some more boxes and Sharon wanted to go as well.  Justin and I sat and talked for awhile and I realized there was a lot more to the young man than his appearance indicated, and I was once again reminded that it is never good to judge a book by his cover.  He was my designated runner from then on, and once he had made a trip around camp he could find his way anywhere he needed to go without taking roads and paths - that uncanny sense of direction I wish I had!  His mother, meanwhile, listened to one round of my class and had it figured out.  While I was talking, I didn't have to turn away to look for anything - stuff miraculously turned up at my fingertips at just the moment I needed it.  I really did wind up with the best staff there, even if they weren't exactly what I had hoped for to begin with.  And Lightning?  Well he saw everything was under control and he took off and had a  grand ol' time running around camp all day.  So much for staffing, but oh well.  It was his first time being at Pirtle without being under someone's thumb, so he had a good time and probably learned a lot about the camp that he never knew.  He was apparently very helpful wherever he went because I got several compliments on him; he just reassigned himself to be a floater I guess. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had planted 14 boxes but had to pick one up, so I had a loose box during the morning.  I told the boys that if they found all 13 boxes, I would give them the clues to a 14th, so I sent Justin to find a place to plant the extra box and he came back and told me where it was - it turned out to be a very good hiding place!  I thought 13 would be a challenge, even in a small area, but it turned out that about a third of the teams got the 13.  They came back to me and I gave them the clue verbally in the form of a riddle, so it was a lot different than the standard "turn right, turn left" they had been following.  Most of the boys got it pretty quickly and the dads had to struggle to figure it out! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It turns out - they almost universally loved letterboxing.  Some of them skipped other sessions to box, others skipped meals.  One team stopped by periodically to tell me exactly how far I had made them walk (the dad had a pedometer on).  One guy called me evil (while laughing), and another dad, one of them who was upset in the morning, stopped by and thanked me for helping him straighten his attitude out because he never would've had as much fun with his son if it hadn't been for my event.  But even if I never talked to them again after my class with them, they all smiled and waved as they walked by!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had purposely NOT told them much about letterboxing outside the boundaries of Pirtle, although I had told them it was out there.  I figured either they would be interested enough to ask, or they would find it on their own, but I didn't want to spoonfeed information to everyone.  Sure enough, I had about 7 teams that came back and wanted websites and email addresses.  Another woman who was staffing came over and hung out with me for an hour or so learning all about it, and she wants to participate in the May 12th planting initiative.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At the end of the day, I sent Angel and Justin out to pick up boxes and figured that would be the proof of the pudding - IF they were able to recover all 14 and what condition they would be in when I got them.  I told them to very specifically look at how the boxes were sealed and rehidden and whether they were in the right places.  When they came back, they reported that all but one box was completely covered, and they were all sealed tightly except one, which I had made by camo taping a ziploc - I wanted to try that out.  As I opened the boxes to remove the ink pads I saw that  they were all very clean, so I was finally impressed that they had not muddied up the pads and had obviously cleaned their stamps between boxes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm looking forward to seeing if any of these guys decide to pursue letterboxing because many, many of them enjoyed it enough to note it as their favorite activity on their evaluations (beating out shooting sports, which is always the top dog at district camps).  I think if they do get involved, they'll be very good boxers, if what we saw Saturday was any indication. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The camp overall was a huge success as well, with dads writing things on their evals like "I never thought my son and I could've bonded the way we did this weekend" and "I never knew my son was such a cool kid" and "My son told me he thought he was in heaven" and "We learned we make a pretty good team".  How can you get any better than that? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My thanks again to Puddle Splasher, JB Kokopelli, GingerCat, Corazon, TxDragonfly, and MoWizLiz for carving stamps.  It made quite an impression on the boys and dads that folks that weren't scouters were willing to contribute their artwork toward the event! <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
