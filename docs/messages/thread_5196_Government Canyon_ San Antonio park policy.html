<<<message to webmasters: I have just become aware of a letterbox(es) placed within our State Natural Area <br>
(Government Canyon State Natural Area, or GCSNA.)As an SNA that harbors and <br>
protects many federally-listed endangered species we have fairly strict land <br>
management regulations and restrictions on the placement of anything within our <br>

without our knowledge or completion of necessaary permits to do so. I will be <br>
removing it/them and attempting to contact the person(s) who placed it/them in <br>
order for the "placer" to follow proper protocol and procedure. It is my hope <br>
that we can simply have the person who placed it complete the necessary permits <br>
and then we can re-place the letterbox(es.) Any assistance you can provide in <br>

<div>Sounds like Government Canyon (NW San Antonio, BTW) is welcoming 
letterboxes—as long as they have approval.  It is a huge park with lots of 
great hiking and some biking.  And you can use your state park pass.  
The downside is that they are closed Tuesday-Thursday.  I always seem to 
forget that and haven’t been in the park for years because I always show up on 
the wrong days.</div>
