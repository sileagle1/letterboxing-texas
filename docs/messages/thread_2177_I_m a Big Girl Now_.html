<div>I'll gladly give you permission to plant a box in Bedford Boys Ranch (where 
Allie's duck is located), and since PS is currently in CT, I'll suggest that 
she'd be happy for you to put one in Chisholm Park as well.  They're both 
pretty big parks, but having scouted all over in deciding where to plant our 
boxes in those parks, I'll have to say, the choices are few - watch out for 
water run-off and flooding places (yes, it will rain again!  a 
gully-washer!).  And both of those are very popular parks for kids to play 
in, too, and for family outings and cross-country meets and all sorts of things 
(like the fireworks!), so finding a really good place will be tricky.  I 
think I've said before, I had to rescue Allie's Duck once from beneath the feet 
of some boys playing war right almost on top of it, but they didn't even notice 
it.  Lucky for me! - VF</div></font></body></html>

<div>I think each of us really wanted to plant a box in one or the other of 
those two parks, pretty much for the same reasons you do - that's where our kids 
used to play with their grandparents, and now our grandkids sometimes go there 
with us - but it wasn't so easy to find good places in either park.  That 
doesn't mean you couldn't find one, though - I've often scouted an area and 
found what I thought was the only possible location that was safe, and then 
later, discovered another, possibly even better, place.  Good luck!

<div>I'll gladly give you permission to plant a box in Bedford Boys Ranch (where Allie's duck is located), and since PS is currently in CT, I'll suggest that she'd be happy for you to put one in Chisholm Park as well.  They're both pretty big parks, but having scouted all over in deciding where to plant our boxes in those parks, I'll have to say, the choices are few - watch out for water run-off and flooding places (yes, it will rain again!  a gully-washer!<wbr>).  And both of those are very popular parks for kids to play in, too, and for family outings and cross-country meets and all sorts of things (like the fireworks!), so finding a really good place will be tricky.  I think I've said before, I had to rescue Allie's Duck once from beneath the feet of some boys playing war right almost on top of it, but they didn't even notice it.  Lucky for me! - VF</wbr></div></font>

<div><font size="2">Yes, I'm back from Connecticut, now waiting <u>not</u> so patiently for the birth of my granddaughter - anytime now, but she seems to be as stubborn as her mother was! I didn't get to do ANY letterboxing while in CT this time. That's like sitting in a great pastry shop and never getting to taste the goodies. BUT... I am flying back up there at the end of the month to finish packing our apartment, and then driving back across the eastern portion of our country with my husband. Now I'll really see how tolerant he is to my letterboxing addiction. It will probably go something like this: Me: "Oh! There's a great letterbox hidden just three miles off the interstate at the next exit!" Him: "Cool" (as he speeds past the exit staring glassy eyed at the highway ahead). Me: (staring forlornly down the exit as we zoom past it) "Oh well, there's another box in 112 miles."........ and so on and so on and so on....... If I can just locate some of those boxes listed as hidden at various rest stops, I can always pretend nature is calling.</font></div>
