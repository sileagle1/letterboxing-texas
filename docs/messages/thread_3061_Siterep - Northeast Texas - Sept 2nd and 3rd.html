Well after the long letterboxing adventure with Wag Time on <br>
Saturday, my navigator JR and I got up Sunday morning and took off <br>
for Nacogdoches.   My first stop was to pick up the Lamp Lite <br>
Playhouse. This was a really cool location and a very nice stamp.  <br>
Next we went to Maroney Park  and  found the Good Job! box in really <br>
good shapeand a really nice location.  Our next stop was the SFA <br>
duck pond to look for the Happy Easter box.  However after trying to <br>
dodge a couple on the pier that really needed to get a room,<br>
we had no success finding this box.  So, on we went to the Stern <br>
Hoya soccer complex and found the Farm House box exactly where it <br>
should be.  We then left Nacogdoches and drove to Hemphill to the <br>
Willow Oak Recreation Area to find the Willow Warbler Microbox by <br>
Silver Eagle.  I am sad to report that this box is no longer there.  <br>
The bridge is still not passable.  Next we went to Logansport, LA to <br>
find A Unique Landmark.  I did manage to find a geocache but no sign <br>
of the letterbox.  This was a real disappointment that I was unable <br>
to find it..but it was a wonderful location.  Just to know what that <br>
piece of granite truly symbolized..really neat.  That was our last <br>
stop for the day <br>
<br>
Monday - Sept 3<br>
I really needed to go to Tyler today and pick up a few items, so <br>
decided to pick up a few boxes on the way. My navigator, JR, decided <br>
that our first stop should be in Gallatin to pick up Pap-pa's <br>
Community Center box.  This was a really good first stamp for a new <br>
young letterboxer.  Our next stop was in Whitehouse at the city park <br>
to pick up another stamp by this new young letterboxer called My Old <br>
Stamp.  The trick to this box was actually getting it out from under <br>
the building.  JR could get under the building pretty easy, but he <br>
hasnt quite learned yet to get the boxes for me (of course I really <br>
want him to learn to bring them to me and return them and hide then <br>
in their spots).  After finally getting down on all fours (that is me<br>
getting down on all fours, not JR)  I finally managed to retrieve <br>
the box.  Again, nice stamp for a young boxer.   We then proceeded <br>
to Tyler to Rose Rudman Recreation Area and found the How Hot Is It? <br>
East Texas box.  Wonderful stamp.  Tx Dragonfly did a really great <br>
job.  We then continued around the trail and found the Ring the Bell <br>
box.  This box really got me, since it was at a bell that was in <br>
honor of cancer patients.  It has been almost a year since my best <br>
friend lost her battle to cancer and I have to admit this<br>
box brought tears to my eyes.  It was a beautiful stamp also done by <br>
Tx Dragonfly.  Both of these were so intricately carved.  After <br>
running my couple of errands, we went to Faulkner Park in Tyler.  <br>
This is a really pretty nature trail.  I had seen the signs numerous <br>
times, and never made it out there.  I was glad that I<br>
finally did.   When I first saw the name for the box there (15 <br>
Minutes) I really had to wonder what the theme of the stamp would <br>
be.  Well, I won't give it away, but it was really one of those AHA <br>
moments. Again, it was nicely done.  From there, we went home.  <br>
