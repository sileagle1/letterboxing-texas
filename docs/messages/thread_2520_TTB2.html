They consulted a map and determined the next leg of their tour would be the area around New London, TX where a tragic explosion brought grief to the local community and new legislation which added an odor to natural gas. They visited the cemetary where the victims were laid to rest. They also paid their respects at the memorial in New London. From there they headed South on Hwy. 42, then turned East on Hwy. 323. They traveled nearly 2 1/2 miles before seeing a sign directing them to turn south in order to see an Historical Marker. They turned onto Haywood Worrell Rd. also known as County Road 4136. They traveled about a mile and half before finding a white iron fence and a monument to a Daisy Bradford pump on the right hand side of the road. They stopped the bus to take in the sites. They noticed a gate in the white iron fence to the left of the monument. Looking out from this<br/>
 gate they saw an oak tree standing a part from the rest of the woods. The tour group walked to this tree and could still see the oil well at the bottom of the hill in front of them and a little to their right. Looking to their left, they noticed the pine tree nearest them. As they stepped up to the pine to inspect it closer, they found the needles and debris to be deeper than they thought. You'll find them there still, up to their ankles in pine needles just behind that pine tree. Will you help them out?<br/>
