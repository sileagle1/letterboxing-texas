First - let me explain something.  I got a few questions about this - so to help<br>
you better understand.<br>
<br>
We entered River and I at the Alamogordo Dog shows for PRACTICE.  The idea was<br>
to give River some experience in the ring, and to get me back into it too.<br>
Since Parker couldn't compete the last 3 years I had him, I had lost my edge<br>
also.  And I didn't want to Break Parker's heart by training up another dog<br>
while Parker was still alive.  I have one dog - we are devoted to each other<br>
until death.<br>
<br>
I hoped that River would like being at the shows (he did) and would not be<br>
afraid in the ring (he was not).  I had a very small spark of hope that maybe by<br>
day three we might get in a qualifying score - and with some practice maybe even<br>
enter some other shows later in the year.  What I did not expect was to have a<br>
dog so sharp that he was qualifying right from the start.  Not from a 1-year old<br>
puppy - the youngest dog competing that weekend.  It was supposed to be fun...<br>
Just practice!<br>
<br>
Having said all of this - I could not be prouder of River.  Not only did he give<br>
me two wins the first two days - he also earned his Rally Novice Title on the<br>
third day.  His first time in the ring - his first real entry - and we did 3<br>
runs and finished.<br>
<br>
The competition was very tough on Sunday.  There were 8 in the class, some other<br>
people showed up for Sunday's trials.  And they were good.  And River was not so<br>
good.  We started late, it was very windy, I didn't let River rest - I maybe<br>
walked him too much, and I could go on making excuses.  But the fact is, River<br>
scored an 84.  Yes - an 84.  The very score he WON with on Friday didn't even<br>
get in the running on Sunday.  But an 84 is passing, and we did pick up a green<br>
ribbon.  The judge told me River did very well for such a young pup.  Then when<br>
she found out he completed his title already - she was shocked.<br>
<br>
So - he is now.<br>

How can you not be proud of that???<br>
<br>
I gotta add - he liked the shows so much that he left half of his breakfast in<br>
the dish and raced outside to jump in the van.  He sat in the van for 30 minutes<br>
before we left.  He didn't want to be left at home.  Silly puppy, I want you<br>
with me where-ever I can take you.  It is us two together - until death.  You<br>
cudda finished your breakfast - I would have waited for you.<br>
<br>
Watch for a DOG-BLOG in the coming week.<br>
