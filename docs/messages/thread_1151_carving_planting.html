As I mentioned in my post - it's an ongoing debate. <br/>
Some folks are looking for art and some are looking<br/>
for experience.  It isn't WRONG to expect art, but<br/>
you'll probably be disappointed a lot more often than<br/>
not if that's the focus.  I have to confess that while<br/>
my focus is on the experience, it heightens my<br/>
experience to find a very nice stamp.  But I also<br/>
appreciate the work of anyone who places a hand-carved<br/>
stamp, especially knowing the level where my<br/>
beginnings were.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't you suggest to your hubby that he carve a<br/>
stamp to be planted?  I'm betting he'll carve<br/>
something that is something less than Dega and he'll<br/>
be proud of it!  And then you can venture out in the<br/>
extreme heat again and plant it....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was carving a stamp at lunch the other day and a<br/>
coworker was saying "I could never do that - I'm such<br/>
a perfectionist, I would never be happy with my work."<br/>
<br/>
I told her that that is exactly what carving has<br/>
taught me - that everything I do doesn't have to be<br/>
perfect, and that if I can't be happy with what I've<br/>
done, I can recarve it.  It's freed me from<br/>
perfectionism.  There are stamps I've carved 8 or 10<br/>
times before I could step back and be proud of them. <br/>
But that's okay, because as long as I have more<br/>
material to carve and I don't have time constraints or<br/>
standards besides my own to meet.  I can still see<br/>
imperfections in every stamp I've done, but I can<br/>
appreciate the character they lend to the piece.<br/>
<br/>
Oddly, I've been really under the gun on a couple of<br/>
big projects lately, and yet I've been at my best<br/>
creatively in terms of boxing.  I think it's become my<br/>
pressure valve that keeps me from blowing a gasket -<br/>
the thing I can stop and do when I feel like my head<br/>
is going to explode.<br/>

box: the new stamp is better!<br/>
Although I was carving from the same basic flamingo image for the new<br/>
stamp...it was actually quite a bit more artistic than the original.<br/>
When I held the two stamp images side-by-side there were definite<br/>
improvements in the new stamp: I did a bit better in planning my<br/>
negative/positive space; I added a few fine line details; I improved upon<br/>
the clarity of the image.<br/>
I always consider my sons the carvers in the family, but I'm actually<br/>
feeling okay about my efforts on this one...;-)<br/>
<br/>
(Not that I'm hoping to have to improve upon any other missing stamps, you<br/>
understand, but it was a small silver lining!)<br/>
