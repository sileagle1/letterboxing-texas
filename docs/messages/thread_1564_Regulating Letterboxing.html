&gt; I think that's a hard thing to prove, that we<br/>
&gt; shouldn't be regulated. <br/>
<br/>
****Well first of all, I said "unduly" regulated.  The<br/>
problem with poor regulations is that they are often<br/>
written by people with clean hands - folks who don't<br/>
understand what they are regulating and who don't see<br/>
the bigger picture themselves.  I spent several years<br/>
as the CFO of a state-funded (NOT state-operated, just<br/>
state-funded) mental health facility.  Every<br/>
legislative year I would spend the majority of my time<br/>
in Austin trying to protect our funding so we could do<br/>
what needed to be done in our community.  I saw it<br/>
happen over and over again, that someone who had no<br/>
idea what the needs of mentally ill or retarded people<br/>
were would set themselves up to dictate through legal<br/>
code and funding how it should be done.  Regulatory<br/>
type folks sometimes like to think that if they make<br/>
enough rules everything will be all right, when quite<br/>
often the reverse is true - create minimal regulation<br/>
to address broad issues and it will be enough.  I<br/>
think Mike's idea to make friends with people like<br/>
rangers and get them to see the value of having us<br/>
around is a valid approach - win them over and they<br/>
will lobby with us instead of against us when the time<br/>
comes.<br/>
<br/>
I suppose we could refer<br/>
&gt; people to various individual boxing sites that<br/>
&gt; stress the Leave No Trace guidelines, tell them to<br/>
&gt; look at some of the smaller area lists (NOT the big<br/>
&gt; one for pete's sake or they'll think we''re all a<br/>
&gt; bunch of angry nuts!-lol) and see how people are<br/>
&gt; concerned with not harming the surrounding area. We<br/>
&gt; could invite them to gatherings so they could meet<br/>
&gt; some of the people involved in boxing. Though I<br/>
&gt; suppose that might not be practical....them coming I<br/>
&gt; mean. <br/>
*****While I can sure see that letting them know us en<br/>
masse could be a very good approach, I fear that they<br/>
will somehow single out and talk to the one fruit loop<br/>
in the whole bunch - or does the fruit loop gravitate<br/>
to them?  How does that always seem to happen?  LOL<br/>
<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess taken on the surface, boxing looks to an<br/>
&gt; outsider like something that needs to be regulated. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
*****Exactly.  To an outsider, we look like<br/>
litterbugs!<br/>
