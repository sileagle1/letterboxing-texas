<br>
****Well first of all, I said "unduly" regulated.  The<br>
problem with poor regulations is that they are often<br>
written by people with clean hands - folks who don't<br>
understand what they are regulating and who don't see<br>
the bigger picture themselves.  I spent several years<br>
as the CFO of a state-funded (NOT state-operated, just<br>
state-funded) mental health facility.  Every<br>
legislative year I would spend the majority of my time<br>
in Austin trying to protect our funding so we could do<br>
what needed to be done in our community.  I saw it<br>
happen over and over again, that someone who had no<br>
idea what the needs of mentally ill or retarded people<br>
were would set themselves up to dictate through legal<br>
code and funding how it should be done.  Regulatory<br>
type folks sometimes like to think that if they make<br>
enough rules everything will be all right, when quite<br>
often the reverse is true - create minimal regulation<br>
to address broad issues and it will be enough.  I<br>
think Mike's idea to make friends with people like<br>
rangers and get them to see the value of having us<br>
around is a valid approach - win them over and they<br>
will lobby with us instead of against us when the time<br>
comes.<br>

*****While I can sure see that letting them know us en<br>
masse could be a very good approach, I fear that they<br>
will somehow single out and talk to the one fruit loop<br>
in the whole bunch - or does the fruit loop gravitate<br>
to them?  How does that always seem to happen?  LOL<br>

*****Exactly.  To an outsider, we look like<br>
litterbugs!<br>
