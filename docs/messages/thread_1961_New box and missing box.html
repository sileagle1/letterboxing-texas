                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought that was such a great little hiding spot, too!  But you<br>
never know who's going to wander around, particularly in a busy park<br>
like that.  I hope you'll replace Fire Tower, though, so I can find it!<br>
<br>
I've had about 10 go missing (or be discovered missing) in the last<br>
couple of months.  Most of these won't be replaced, except for<br>
possibly Little Stamp Mystery .  I'm not all that interested in<br>
recarving images, so instead I'll try to put my efforts into putting<br>
new boxes out there.<br>
<br>
Sometimes it's hard to know what happens to the boxes--vandals,<br>
mischievious kids, bad rehides?!?  I personally have ongoing troubles<br>
with raccoons. . .I believe the ones in Memorial Park can sniff out<br>
boxes.  They seem to like to find them and drag them out of their<br>
hiding places.<br>
<br>
When we go on our vacation at the end of next month, I'll have the<br>
chance to check our box in Abita Springs, Louisiana.  It survived<br>
hurricane Katrina, although there was extensive damage to the park. <br>
But somehow, the smaller tree it was hidden beneath survived and so<br>
did the box.  <br>

With that many of us stomping around the hill country, maybe we'll run<br>
into each other.  If you ever see us on the trails, you can ask for<br>
our personal travelers, including my son Batrick's brand-new one, just<br>
debuting today!<br>
<br>
And, just for general information, if we have coffee together, I have<br>
a special PT for that.  I also carve a special coffee PT only<br>
available at each gathering, so look for "book and a mug" at the Great<br>
Book Adventure if you get there early enough to have coffee! (TeamKing<br>
will be having tea).<br>
