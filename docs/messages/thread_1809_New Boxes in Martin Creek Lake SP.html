<br>
Blue Butterfly and I wanted to let you know that there are some new <br>
boxes in Martin Creek Lake SP in East Texas.  <br>
<br>
Blue Butterfly planted a great series of 7 boxes called Spring Flower <br>
Trail Series on Friday.  This series features a variety of flowers <br>
that will make a nice little bouquet in your log book. <br>
<br>
While I was there today, I left a box called Coffee Break.  <br>
<br>
Happy Trails! <br>

<div>My sis-in-law dragged her reluctant hubby (my LSS's brother, so I guess LSS-dom is genetic) along with her to Daingerfield for the weekend thinking she would grab clues on the run - only to learn when she called me to feed 'em to her that there were none to be had!  She has now determined that we will be planning a planting weekend to get some boxes up that direction!  In sharing that story with BB, she told me she has plans for a more northern box, and I'm sure LL will jump on the wagon with us too, so that hopefully there will be new territory to cover East of Greenville and North of I-20 in the not too distant future!

The mosquitos were bad!! Also on the way back around the trail, I <br>
stepped over a snake. So, please be careful. Thankfully, it was a <br>
friendly snake :) We took bug spray the next day to find the boxes. <br>
Hope you all enjoy!<br>
