 If you have other questions, feel free to email me or post them here!<br>
<br>
The Literary Traveler aspect of the event seems to be going well, with<br>
great participation.  The easiest way to find the clues for these<br>
travelers is to go to atlasquest.com and find the event (it's now on<br>
the right hand side of the page).  When you click on the event (or<br>
follow this link):<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=173<br>
you'll see a list of all of the personal traveler boxes.  You'll want<br>
to study the clues for them before hand, because it depends on whether<br>
you've read the book, or can remember reading the book, in question.  <br>
<br>
I've had some people ask what a traveler is, so a quick definition. <br>
It is a stamp that you carry on your person that you offer to others<br>
when you meet them.  Sometimes, it's very secretive, sometimes you<br>
have to say a code word or do something, sometimes all you have to do<br>
is ask.  This is a bit different than an exchange, which is usually<br>
when two boxers trade signature stamps.<br>
<br>
AQ and letterboxing.info both have good glossaries.<br>
<br>
We will be preparing clue packets for all rsvp'ed attendees (or<br>
really, for families) with a few extra.  These are the boxes that<br>
we've pre-hidden on the walks and in a special area for children that<br>
we won't be hiding until that day.  A few boxes, I've already listed<br>
on AQ, but those boxes aren't in place and won't be until that day,<br>
just the hiding places are set.  <br>
<br>
Now, if you're bringing a box to hide that day and haven't sent it to<br>
me or Teamking, that's fabulous (but not required).  You can feel free<br>
to hide them, either permanently in the park or temporarily for that<br>
day.  Even though we've set up the walks, there is still a large area<br>
in the back of the trails that would be great for more boxes.<br>
<br>
If you do hide a box, I will have bulletin boards where you will be<br>
able to pin up your clue.  Others can copy the clue down.  Low-tech,<br>
but workable.<br>
<br>
There will be fun surprises.  Keep your eyes open.  Probably no box on<br>
Mother of Five's license plate for this one, but you never know.<br>

ps--Mother of Five and I (and the littlest of the 5) had a beautiful<br>
day in Tomball today.  If the weather's like what we had today, we're<br>
in for a terrific event. <br>
