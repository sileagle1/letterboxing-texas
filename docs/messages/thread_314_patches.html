<p></p><div class="im">Well I really hadn't intended to bring this up in the whole group, but 
  since you mentioned it, I'll go ahead. <br/><br/>I ordered patches about a 
  month and a half ago and was waiting until they arrived to begin notifying 
  everyone who had spoken for them. They have yet to arrive, and at this 
  time the company I ordered from (a company I have ordered patches and other 
  printed material from several times and always received the goods within 10 
  days or less) is not responding. I feel very badly because I've dealt 
  with this company numerous times and their customer service has always been 
  outstanding and their product very good. I'm sure they were a victim of 
  the economy, and apparently, so was I in this case.<br/><br/>It appears I lost 
  my money on the deal and at the moment I'm not inclined to sink more money 
  into patches until I've exhausted my efforts in getting my money back or feel 
  not so irked about dropping my cash down the drain. If you would like to 
  pursue it, go right ahead.<br/><br/>Thanks for the 
  inquiry.<br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
