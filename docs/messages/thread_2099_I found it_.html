<div>That is way cool!  What a thrill that is!  Now - just think about looking through your logbooks in five years' time, and as you are looking through your very first logbook, you'll enjoy looking at all those early stamps, but you will remember that one with a certain fondness that comes from going the extra mile to find it.  It's one that, when you have someone held captive looking at your logbook, you'll just HAVE to tell them the story...

<div>I know what you mean.  It's frustrating but after several unsuccessful 
attempts, it's extremely satisfying to achieve your goal!  Way to go.
