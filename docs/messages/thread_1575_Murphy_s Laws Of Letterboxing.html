go wrong, will go wrong", and I have noticed similar<br/>
laws while letterboxing.  On our recent trip, Baby Bear<br/>
and I experienced a few and I'd like to share them:<br/>
<br/>
1.  "No matter how remote a box is, someone will come by<br/>
just as you are retrieving or replacing it".<br/>
<br/>
This happened to us way more than we thought normal, and<br/>
it resulted in some hard-to-explain situations.  We made<br/>
sure nobody ever saw the box, but I'm sure they wondered <br/>
why 2 guys were going into the woods together.  It's not<br/>
the first time my brother and I have been suspected of<br/>
being more than we are.<br/>
<br/>
2.  "The better a box is hidden, the more likely it will<br/>
be missing".<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds backwards, but it was amazing how many<br/>
times we would not find a box that was off-trail and in a<br/>
secluded area, yet find boxes totally uncovered in busy<br/>
areas.  One box that was in a downtown alley park in a <br/>
well-maintained planter had Christmas light cord running<br/>
right over it for lights in the garden.  Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
3.  "If there is more than one entrance to a park, you<br/>
will always go to the wrong one".<br/>
<br/>
Several clues did not give directions to parks, so we<br/>
just picked a street on the map that looked correct.  More<br/>
times than not, we had to drive around looking for another<br/>
part of the same park to match the clues.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's possible these laws only apply to Baby Bear and I, but<br/>
if you have some I would love to hear them.  BTW, these laws<br/>
in no way stopped us from enjoying ourselves.<br/>

<div>I have been a victim of #3 many times, and like you said, if there are two entrances, I'll definitely pick the wrong one first.</div>
<div>Oh, and your #1? My sister and I have laughed several times about how we look when we are stepping out of the woods together. When I'm caught coming out of the woods alone, I assume people must think I was answering the "call of nature", but when there are two of us?</div>

<div>These rule apply to me, too! This weekend, we were in San Antonio for just a quick trip and found a new box (First Finders!!) just planted by Runs For Chocolate- Jack &amp; Adams Box. While my two boys were putting it back, with a whole lot of energy and digging around and poking with sticks and goofing off, as only 13 year olds can, someone came by. I looked at her, smiled and rolled my eyes, and said "Boys!"  She laughed and said "I know what you mean". Perfect cover! I have used it many times, and it always works. So, Silver Eagle, maybe you guys should take the wives, who could then smile and roll their eyes and say "Men!". LOL</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also found Keep Austin Weird. Cool box!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then, under the Murphy's Law category, we realized that in order to make it back to Houston in time for karate class, we had to leave RIGHT NOW- meaning we did not have time to do the maintenance on our boxes, so that will have to be done the next time.</div>

<br/>
1) Wear shirt that says "He is my brother" in the future.<br/>
2) Printing mapquest directions to a park isn't good enough (some <br/>
parts of Dallas are not good to be lost in, as well as any large <br/>
city).<br/>
3) Realize it does not get light until 6:30am, and dark at 6pm <br/>
(letterboxing in the dark is interesting).<br/>
4) Always plan the trip, thus you are the navigator and avoid <br/>
driving!!!<br/>
5) Plan bathroom breaks!<br/>
6) When you pick your trail name, put some thought into it. Enough <br/>
said.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait for the event to hear more stories!!!<br/>
Take care,<br/>
Baby Bear<br/>

<p><span>Baby Bear's Laws<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>1) Wear shirt that says "He is my brother" in the future.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>2) Printing mapquest directions to a park isn't good enough (some <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>parts of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dallas</st1:place></st1:city>
are not good to be lost in, as well as any large <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>city).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>3) Realize it does not get light until 6:30am, and dark at 6pm <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>(letterboxing in the dark is interesting).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>4) Always plan the trip, thus you are the navigator and avoid <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>driving!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>5) Plan bathroom breaks!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>6) When you pick your trail name, put some thought into it. Enough <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>said.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Can't wait for the event to hear more stories!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Take care,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>&gt; The original Murphy's Law states:  "Anything that can<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; go wrong, will go wrong", and I have noticed similar<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; laws while letterboxing.  On our recent trip, Baby Bear<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; and I experienced a few and I'd like to share them:<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; 1.  "No matter how remote a box is, someone will come by<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; just as you are retrieving or replacing it".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; This happened to us way more than we thought normal, and<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; it resulted in some hard-to-explain situations.  We made<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; sure nobody ever saw the box, but I'm sure they wondered <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; why 2 guys were going into the woods together.  It's not<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; the first time my brother and I have been suspected of<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; being more than we are.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; 2.  "The better a box is hidden, the more likely it will<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; be missing".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; I know this sounds backwards, but it was amazing how many<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; times we would not find a box that was off-trail and in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; secluded area, yet find boxes totally uncovered in busy<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; areas.  One box that was in a downtown alley park in a <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; well-maintained planter had Christmas light cord running<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; right over it for lights in the garden.  Go figure.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; 3.  "If there is more than one entrance to a park, you<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; will always go to the wrong one".<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; Several clues did not give directions to parks, so we<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; just picked a street on the map that looked correct.  More<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; times than not, we had to drive around looking for another<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; part of the same park to match the clues.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; It's possible these laws only apply to Baby Bear and I, but<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; if you have some I would love to hear them.  BTW, these laws<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; in no way stopped us from enjoying ourselves.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
