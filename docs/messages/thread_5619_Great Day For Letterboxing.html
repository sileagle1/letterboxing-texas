                    <html><body><p>Yesterday I took advantage of the nice weather to plant some boxes north of Austin. I was very impressed with the places I went and wanted to let y'all know about them. First I went to Twin Lakes Park in Cedar Park and placed some on the Brushy Creek Regional Trail that starts there. This is a great trail that can be hiked or biked for over 6 miles along Brushy Creek, and there are plans to extend it even further. Next I went to two units of Balcones Canyonlands NWR that I had never been to:  Warbler Vista and Doeskin Ranch.  There are several trails at each unit with great views and possible wildlife sightings. Finally, I placed another of my Bull boxes at Spicewood Valley Trail, an obscure trail near Upper Bull Creek Trail that was quite scenic.<br/><br/>On the way home I stopped in Bee Cave to find a few new boxes in the area. At the Falconhead West primitive trails I saw that two other letterboxers had stamped in that same day:  Mosaic Butterfly and Screamin' Meemie. It reminded me of the past when this occurred so often it wasn't worth mentioning, but it gave me thrill to know I just missed seeing them.  Once again I thought it would be nice to include time of day, along with date, when stamping in. By the way, that park has quite a flock of birds now and is well worth visiting.<br/><br/>I hope everyone gets a chance to letterbox during this great weather!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle  <br/></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>

So sorry we missed you! I think we left around 2. That would have been fun to run into you.
