Since the huge double-trunk pine tree that it was hiding behind was cut to the ground, I had to move the box slightly.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unfortunately, Lone Star Quilters box, "Sally Carrera",  was lost as well among all the downed and chopped up trees and sawdust, and we weren't prepared to replace it.  I haven't figured out what the purpose was in cutting down good trees, some of them quite large, in that spot, which is cut off from the rest of the area by the large pond.  My new boxes are "Temple Houston, the Son of Sam", already posted and "Walker, Texas Ranger", to be posted later today.  Check out Huntsville State Park for other boxes.<br/>
