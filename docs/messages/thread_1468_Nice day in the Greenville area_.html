<div>Puddle-Splasher and I took advantage of that crisp one-day-of-fall we had 
this week on Thursday and went to Greenville to find the 4 letterboxes planted 
by Catpawz, and then to Sister Grove Park near McKinney to find those 2 boxes, 
and all 6 were alive and in good condition.  We visited 2 pretty parks in 
Greenville, a beautiful sculpture in a Meditation Garden in a cemetery, and a 
memorial to Audie Murphy that has taunted me every time I've driven past on I 30 
because I knew there was a letterbox there somewhere - and now we've found 
it!  And then we discovered this pretty wooded park on an island at Lake 
Lavon east of McKinney, where the leaves were beginning to show red and gold and 
the hiking trails wound through the woods toward the lake, and 2 
letterboxes!  And all of these boxes have good stamps, really good 
stamps!  Thanks, Catpawz!  We know Barefoot Lucy will enjoy all of 
these if she comes that way!  -- Viewfinder </div></body></html>
