A week or so ago I mentioned that I was seeing magellan roadmate 700 GPS<br>
units selling out cheap.  Even thought it is a french company - I held my<br>
nose and bought one.  A big display at a reasonable price - I was dazzled by<br>
that BIG display!<br>
<br>
WHAT A P.O.S!!!!!<br>
<br>
I have owned it about 24 hours now.  It arrived - BROKE.  Everything worked<br>
- except one thing.  It would not initialize and find satellites.  Just no<br>
way!  I let it sit on my patio for an hour.  No satellite lock.  It sat on<br>
my window sill overnight.  No satellite lock.<br>
<br>
Well - that can happen.  OK.  The killer was trying to deal with magellan<br>
support.<br>
<br>
On my fourth call to them I told them to close my trouble ticket.  The lady<br>
asked if I got it working.  I said no - the store that sold it to me agreed<br>
to let me send it back and trade it in - for a GARMIN!  She was not amused.<br>
<br>
Yeah - it will cost me more.  But I will have something that will WORK!<br>
<br>
If any of you were looking at the magellan deal, buyer beware!<br>
<br>
For me - NEVER AGAIN.<br>
