My second choice was “Pirvert”, who would chain all his boxes to a tree,  but she didn’t like that one either.  The only other thing to do was to create a new letterboxer that I could use for a while to place a few boxes and become an obnoxious presence on this group site.  He would be “I are a” boxer, which evolved into IRA Boxer.  The name led to the signature stamp.  Next, I needed a group of suspects, so I started taking pictures at some of the events that Dewberry used to have around Houston and I picked out several that I thought I could carve stamps of and who I was pretty sure wouldn’t be too upset about being suspected of murdering a fellow letterboxer. It actually took me a few months to set it all up and have IRA Boxer get acquainted with the letterboxing community.  He even attended events and stamped the event posters.  When it was all set up, I checked out the arboretum for good hiding places for the boxes and wrote out the clues to make sure they all worked, then filled in the details to make the story interesting.  I’m still not sure where I got the picture for the murderer or why I chose him.  I think when I made the stamps, he just fit the part.  Typecasting, I guess. My plan was that, after IRA Boxer was murdered, he would simply disappear and would never be heard from again.  I liked him so much that I couldn’t let him rest, so he has enjoyed an afterlife.   The rest is history.  I’m glad you all enjoyed it</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Boots Tex</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal">Sent from <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=550986">Mail</a> for Windows 10</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><div style="mso-element:para-border-div;border:none;border-top:solid #E1E1E1 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 0in 0in 0in"><p class="MsoNormal" style="border:none;padding:0in"><b>From: </b><a href="mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com">Heather Carnes heathercarnes@sbcglobal.net [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS]</a><br/><b>Sent: </b>Wednesday, October 10, 2018 8:39 AM<br/><b>To: </b><a href="mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com">LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com</a><br/><b>Subject: </b>Re: [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Re: Murder at the Arboretum</p></div><p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="display:none"> </span> <o:p></o:p></p><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Thank you for the history!

My second choice was “Pirvert”, who would chain all his boxes to a tree,  but she didn’t like that one either.  The only other thing to do was to create a new letterboxer that I could use for a while to place a few boxes and become an obnoxious presence on this group site.  He would be “I are a” boxer, which evolved into IRA Boxer.  The name led to the signature stamp.  Next, I needed a group of suspects, so I started taking pictures at some of the events that Dewberry used to have around Houston and I picked out several that I thought I could carve stamps of and who I was pretty sure wouldn’t be too upset about being suspected of murdering a fellow letterboxer. It actually took me a few months to set it all up and have IRA Boxer get acquainted with the letterboxing community.  He even attended events and stamped the event posters..  When it was all set up, I checked out the arboretum for good hiding places for the boxes and wrote out the clues to make sure they all worked, then filled in the details to make the story interesting.  I’m still not sure where I got the picture for the murderer or why I chose him.  I think when I made the stamps, he just fit the part.  Typecasting, I guess. My plan was that, after IRA Boxer was murdered, he would simply disappear and would never be heard from again.  I liked him so much that I couldn’t let him rest, so he has enjoyed an afterlife.   The rest is history.  I’m glad you all enjoyed it</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o> </o></p><p class="MsoNormal">Boots Tex</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o> </o></p><p class="MsoNormal">Sent from <a href="https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=550986">Mail</a> for Windows 10</p><p class="MsoNormal"><o> </o></p><div style="border-top:solid #E1E1E1 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 0in 0in 0in;"><p class="MsoNormal" style="padding:0in;"><b>From: </b><a href="mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com">Heather Carnes heathercarnes@sbcglobal.net [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS]</a><br/><b>Sent: </b>Wednesday, October 10, 2018 8:39 AM<br/><b>To: </b><a href="mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com">LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com</a><br/><b>Subject: </b>Re: [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Re: Murder at the Arboretum</p></div><p class="MsoNormal"><o> </o></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span> </span> <o></o></p><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt;">Thank you for the history!
