                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well hello there boxers! It's your old friend Strawberry6703. Due to<br/>
pursuing my career (read: attending school and work like mad), I<br/>
haven't been an avid boxer.<br/>
<br/>
I finally finished school and can now proudly claim that I'm an<br/>
official teacher (without an actual teaching position - but I'm<br/>
working on that). I found myself a little bored and lonely and decided<br/>
to embark on a boxing adventure while the weather was nice.<br/>
<br/>
I went to Arbor Hills in Plano today and found the following boxes:<br/>
400 tongues<br/>
Good Luck<br/>
Hoppin down the bunny trail<br/>
Welcome to the world baby girls<br/>
<br/>
I attempted the Endangered species: Houston Toad but couldn't find the<br/>
three evergreen trees that the path crossed through.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I had a wonderful time today and I intend to "keep on truckin"<br/>
for the season.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I'll see ya out there!<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I was wondering about you the other day!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Congratulations on your new accomplishment - I know it won't be long before you get a teaching position.  I've considered several times going back to school to get credentialed, but I guess the long and short of it is that I'm just too lazy to do it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Glad you're still around!</div>
