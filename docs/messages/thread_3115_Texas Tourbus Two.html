Start at the Bull Creek Greenbelt trailhead closest to the <br/>
intersection between Spicewood Springs and Old Spicewood Springs <br/>
Road just south of Loop 360. Park in the UNPAVED lot. Cross the road <br/>
from parking lot and walk down main trail, with fences on both <br/>
sides. Go down and cross the creek and go up the hill on other side. <br/>
When you get to the top of the first rise, about 68 steps up the <br/>
trail from the creek, there is small path that splits off from the <br/>
main trail to the left that goes further up the hill and a small <br/>
boulder on the right. You are very near the BULL CREEK BOO letterbox <br/>
hidden by REDS. Take the smaller trail to the left going uphill for <br/>
48 steps to a group of small oaks on the left. There will be an old, <br/>
red, plastic ribbon tied around the trunk closest to the trail about <br/>
head high. With this red ribbon just over your left shoulder look <br/>
left and perpendicular to the trail for a dead juniper trunk about <br/>
10 steps uphill. This tree is slightly uprooted so that it leans to <br/>
the north. The bus is nestled in the cavity caused by the uprooting <br/>
on the uphill side of this tree and covered by branches and leaves.<br/>

<div>1) You should ONLY post the clues to the Texas Talk List (this list) (which, by definition, means finders will be members of this list and will have access to the guidelines).  </div>
<div>2) You should post the clues so everyone has a chance for the box.</div>
<div>3) When you find the box, report back to this list right away so that anyone who is planning to go after it can know it has been taken. <br/>4) It should not ever leave Texas.</div>
<div>5) If you take it from its hiding place, you should place a stamp based on a character from Texas in it before rehiding it.  They can be living or dead, real or imaginary (although if I recall properly, they seem to always wind up being real)
</div>
<div>6) Rehide it somewhere different from where you found it, and hopefully, different from where it's ever been before (but you're going to have to do a little research in the archives for that one!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, the first TTB was lost because some of the above guidelines were not observed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's understood that finders may keep the box for awhile - as it grows, it takes longer and longer to stamp in completely; but just as with a hitchhiker, try not to keep it any longer than is necessary.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As to reporting number of stamps, there's nothing that says you can't say, but I would suggest you email the person that asked privately - some folks (myself included) would rather be surprised!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would say the spirit of the box is to spread it around as much as possible, to keep it in Texas, to foster the fun of the mad dash, and to add your own view of Texas through your contribution.</div>

&gt; 3) When you find the box, report back to this list right away so<br/>
that anyone<br/>
&gt; who is planning to go after it can know it has been taken.<br/>
&gt; 4) It should not ever leave Texas.<br/>
&gt; 5) If you take it from its hiding place, you should place a stamp<br/>
based on a<br/>
&gt; character from Texas in it before rehiding it.  They can be living<br/>
or dead,<br/>
&gt; real or imaginary (although if I recall properly, they seem to<br/>
always wind<br/>
&gt; up being real)<br/>
&gt; 6) Rehide it somewhere different from where you found it, and hopefully,<br/>
&gt; different from where it's ever been before (but you're going to have<br/>
to do a<br/>
&gt; little research in the archives for that one!)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sadly, the first TTB was lost because some of the above guidelines<br/>
were not<br/>
&gt; observed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's understood that finders may keep the box for awhile - as it<br/>
grows, it<br/>
&gt; takes longer and longer to stamp in completely; but just as with a<br/>
&gt; hitchhiker, try not to keep it any longer than is necessary.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As to reporting number of stamps, there's nothing that says you<br/>
can't say,<br/>
&gt; but I would suggest you email the person that asked privately - some<br/>
folks<br/>
&gt; (myself included) would rather be surprised!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would say the spirit of the box is to spread it around as much as<br/>
&gt; possible, to keep it in Texas, to foster the fun of the mad dash,<br/>
and to add<br/>
&gt; your own view of Texas through your contribution.<br/>
