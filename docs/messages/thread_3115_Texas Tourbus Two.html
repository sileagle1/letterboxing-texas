the state (well, sort of). Austin to be exact. Clues:<br>
<br>
Start at the Bull Creek Greenbelt trailhead closest to the <br>
intersection between Spicewood Springs and Old Spicewood Springs <br>
Road just south of Loop 360. Park in the UNPAVED lot. Cross the road <br>
from parking lot and walk down main trail, with fences on both <br>
sides. Go down and cross the creek and go up the hill on other side. <br>
When you get to the top of the first rise, about 68 steps up the <br>
trail from the creek, there is small path that splits off from the <br>
main trail to the left that goes further up the hill and a small <br>
boulder on the right. You are very near the BULL CREEK BOO letterbox <br>
hidden by REDS. Take the smaller trail to the left going uphill for <br>
48 steps to a group of small oaks on the left. There will be an old, <br>
red, plastic ribbon tied around the trunk closest to the trail about <br>
head high. With this red ribbon just over your left shoulder look <br>
left and perpendicular to the trail for a dead juniper trunk about <br>
10 steps uphill. This tree is slightly uprooted so that it leans to <br>
the north. The bus is nestled in the cavity caused by the uprooting <br>
on the uphill side of this tree and covered by branches and leaves.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations on finding TTB2!  As far as I know, no one has <br>
answered your question.  I don't think there are any rules about <br>
disclosing the number of passengers on the bus.  As the number of <br>
passengers increases, finding the bus will become more desirable.  I <br>
am glad to see that you are aware of your responsibilities to hide <br>
the box well and report the new location only on this board.  It <br>
sure would be nice if TTB1 would show up somewhere!<br>
