<br/>
This year I got some lock n lock boxes and carving material, so I <br/>
guess there are more placed boxes in my future.  I hope everyone got<br/>
something nice from your letterboxing list, but if you didn't, you <br/>
can always give yourself the gift of time.  Time to get out of the <br/>
house and reconnect with nature as you pursue this great hobby of <br/>
ours.  Merry Christmas, y'all!<br/>

Lucy, I'm so happy to hear that Fearless Fox is "suffering from good health" again (wasn't it Mark Twain who said that?) Enjoy!<br/>

<p>I didn't get anything specifically letterboxing-related, but I did get a
very nice low profile blue-tooth speaker to go on my workbench in the garage
where I go to carve and so forth.  I can pair it with my phone and play
music from it while I work.  It's so much better than my previous setup,
where I took some old computer speakers and had to position them for power and
the connecting wire, meaning they were IN MY WAY!  This is like going from
a big console television to going to a flat panel.<br/>
<br/>
As some of you know, we've had some pretty big things we've been contending
with over the past year or so, the biggest being an elusive health problem that
has been plaguing Fearless Fox.  After numerous doctor's appointments,
countless tests, a few procedures, referrals from one doc to another and one
clinic to another, medications galore, many hypotheses, much research on the
doctors' part and mine (every time they mentioned a specific possibility, I
read about it until I knew as much as I could possibly know), and no real
diagnosis, whatever has been going on seems to have resolved itself and he is
his old self again.  I suppose we could worry that "it" will
come back, but they very effectively ruled out the things that are really scary
and were focusing on long-term chronic type stuff when the symptoms quit. 
If it comes back, so be it, but today the best gift I received was to celebrate
this Christmas with him making it through the holidays happy and healthy and at
full power (for the last few Christmases, the stress and schedule of the
holidays has resulted in him being home in bed on this day). <br/>

Merry Christmas!<br/>

<div>I'm the type of person who enjoys reading and learning, so when I first 
heard about letterboxing I did a lot of research before we ever found our first 
box. I read all of the "getting started" and "history of letterboxing" 
articles on LbNA, browsed the old messages on the yahoo groups, and also bought 
a copy of The Letterboxers Companion.  I would be glad to bring that 
book along with the Smithsonian magazine to TALE.   Who knows, 
there may be a special stamp for anyone who asks to see them.  <img alt="Smiley emoticon" msnnonuserimageoremoticon="true" src="cid:014b01ca85e3$ab0d81e0$3FF5271A@homedfh7h77ox9" tabindex="-1" title="Smiley emoticon"/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>So is anyone going letterboxing tomorrow on Boxing Day?</div>
