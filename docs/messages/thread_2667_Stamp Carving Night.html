Are any of the Houston area boxers interested in a stamp carving night? <br>
I have had some great ideas for stamps but I am hesitant to start <br>
carving. It would be like a scrapbook night just with carving stamps <br>
and other stuff. It would be very casual,maybe meeting in a <br>
neighborhood club house. Anyone interested let me know.<br>

We are in Spring as well and I have much to learn about carving.  <br>
Would be a neat chance to meet some more experienced boxers as <br>
well.   I can do any of the dates mentioned except the 13th.  We are <br>
camping, but if it works better for everyone else I'll catch you <br>
another time.  Let me know the consensus.<br>

Thanks,<br>
