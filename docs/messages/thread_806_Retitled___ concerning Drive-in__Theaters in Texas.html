Actually... the series idea was WOWMOM’s.<br/>
<br/>
I’m still just constantly amazed at the amount... and quality... of information that is available on the Internet.  If you were born before the 80s, you probably have a better idea about what I’m talking about.  Before then, I would have had to go to the library, and then a couple more, and MAYBE someone would have written a book about Drive-in Theatres.  And then, to tell you about it, I would have typed it up, made copies, and mailed it to all of you.  AND, it’s very possible that without the Internet, this book on Drive-ins would have been close to impossible... they relied a lot on people sending in information to them... over the Internet.  It still amazes me.  Think for a second what Letterboxing would be like without the Internet...  <br/>
<br/>
Next, I think I’ll spend some time being thankful for the wheel.<br/>
<br/>
Busy appreciating the obvious,<br/>

<br/>
ps. I DO claim the “Appreciating the Obvious” letterbox series.  I want to find a place for the first one in Zipperlandville, TX.  Guess what the subject is.  <br/>

They have such great names.  Krohm's right, the drive-ins would make <br/>
terrific letterboxes.  Wonder if we could get a group of people to <br/>
carve different ones and make a series?  Too many of them are in <br/>
West Texas though, a looooong way from me, but it's still a really <br/>
cool idea.  Like the clue game, fun to see how different folks <br/>
interpret the same idea.<br/>
<br/>
Count on Krohm to have all the answers!  He is our walking, talking, <br/>
googling, fact-seeking letterboxer!<br/>

these cities<br/>

it would<br/>
&gt; make it even more interesting.<br/>
