                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, since everyone seems to be telling stories about<br>
how they started letterboxing, I figured I would add<br>
my story to the list.<br>
<br>
I first heard about letterboxing from Krohm, who was<br>
not boxing at the time, but thought it sounded<br>
interesting. I thought the concept sounded fun, and I<br>
was going on a trip to Massachusetts, so I found some<br>
clues for boxes in the Plymouth area, where I would be<br>
spending a couple of days in July of 2004.<br>
<br>
Plymouth proved to be historical, beautiful, full of<br>
genealogy information (which I was seeking), and<br>
cursed with rain the entire time I was there.<br>
Fortunately, the two brave souls that were with me<br>
(believe it or not, it was Hudson and Mysterious<br>
Stranger!) had a pretty good sense of humor and<br>
adventure, and they went hunting for boxes with<br>
me...in the rain. The first box was missing, so the<br>
three of us were quite discouraged. The second box<br>
required a long walk (in the rain). Mysterious<br>
Stranger was carrying packages, so stopped in a shop<br>
to stay dry. Hudson and I pushed on, and finally found<br>
our first box! It was Grist Mill, and it was such a<br>
thrill to find that box that I've been letterboxing<br>
ever since. We also found Town Brook while in<br>
Plymouth.<br>
<br>
When I returned to Houston, I started searching for<br>
boxes like a maniac (don't laugh, y'all have done it,<br>
too!). My third box was Park Angel (the original, by<br>
Baby Bear), then Zube Zephyre (Silver Eagle), Lady<br>
Justice (Baby Bear), and Farmer's Lair (Baby Bear). I<br>
finally found boxes by Mother of Four, Fluffy Fury,<br>
and Tall Texan. I decided that I would add my own<br>
boxes to the hunt, and planted Candlelight Park (still<br>
alive, but temporarily pulled because the tree it was<br>
hidden in is scheduled to be cut down), The Bell of<br>
Montrose (missing X2), Little Brown Bird (missing),<br>
and Impossible Triangle (missing).<br>
<br>
As of now, I have found over 200 boxes and have placed<br>
nearly 75 (in four states). I am planning to replace<br>
some of the missing boxes before planting more new<br>
ones. I have met some wonderful people through<br>
letterboxing, and am happy that Krohm, Hudson, and<br>
Mysterious Stranger are willing to join in the fun<br>
whenever they can.<br>
<br>
Though I have been on a bit of a break from<br>
letterboxing (not by choice!), I plan to carve more<br>
stamps and then return to leaving my usual plethora of<br>
"hawk droppings" for folks to find as soon as I can<br>
get a break!<br>

<div>My first LB was in Newtown, CT, at the Sugar Maple Demonstration Area of the Paugausett Forest. I found it on July 4th, 2004, so my first anniversary of boxing is coming up. Since I will be leaving CT for TX on July 3rd, I thought it woud be appropriate to leave a HH behind in that box before I go - especially since it was also my sister's (2txchic, Viewfinder) first letterbox (October, 2004). So as tribute, last night, very, very late, after spending thirteen hours cleaning out the house we are moving out of, I decided to carve an appropriate HH stamp. After I finished and was quite pleased with the result, I did a test stamp and realized I had made the same mistake Baby Bear had mentioned in his "story" yesterday, I forgot to reverse the letters! At that point, all I could do was laugh and put it away until this weekend when I'm a bit more rested and can do it right! </div>
<div>I love reading everyone's stories - keep 'em coming.</div>

<div>...and then, after she's settled back here in Texas, both of the tx2chic 
girls will plant a new anniversary letterbox somewhere - just won't be in a CT 
sugar bush maple demonstration area!  (maybe in a Texas pecan grove?)
