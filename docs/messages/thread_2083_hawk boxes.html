As much as we miss her and wish she'd return, it doesn't really look<br>
like Hawk is going to return to letterboxing any time soon.  But,<br>
she's got more than 80 boxes out there, most of them in the Houston<br>
area.  Some of these have gone missing (some for as long as a year)<br>
and there's no way to update them.  So people continue to look for<br>
them fruitlessly.  That's just frustrating.<br>
<br>
I can fix the problem on Atlasquest.  Because she hasn't logged in<br>
there in more than a year, I can adopt her boxes, change the status<br>
and then reassign them back to her, (I'm not really interested in<br>
being the owner long-term, I just want to change the status).  I can't<br>
change the clues on LBNA, so for these boxes you would need to check<br>
status on AQ.<br>
<br>
Does this sound workable?  <br>
<br>
If you know of a Hawk box that is definitely missing (or definitely<br>
found within the last few months), let me know either by posting her<br>
or sending my gmail account a mail.  I'm not going to run around<br>
checking on all of them (can't seem to keep up with my own maintenance<br>
as quickly as I'd like), but if it could be more of a collaborative<br>
effort, we could make it work.<br>
<br>
I tried it out on Flight of Fancy, which I know is missing, and it<br>
worked great.<br>

<br>
'Dodge the 'Dillo, Koala-T-Time Together and Sitting Duck were all <br>
okay on 4-10-06.  Sea Aggie and Celtic Cross in Galveston were okay <br>
on 5-2-06, but Cavalla in Galveston is missing on that date.  <br>
Believe it or not, Squirelly Camper in Martin Dies, Jr. State Park <br>
was perfectly fine on 5-1-06 despite Hurricane Rita and climbing <br>
over and through some very large trees to get to it.<br>

                    <html><body><div>I like your solution Dewberry.  I think that, even with potential pitfalls, it is the best solution we can hope for for the moment.  I really like that it all goes back to her name, so that a search on either site would yield the same information, except that AQ would have a current status.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My biggest issue with making a change on AQ that can't be made on LBNA is that LBNA is the standard still - the point where virtually all newbies start.  And they are the ones who will go looking for missing boxes because they haven't heard or seen the discussion about specific boxes.  And they are the ones that are most susceptible to frustration and discouragement that this particular problem poses. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It seems to me that LBNA is the sticking point - every solution I've thought of has come back to the record being stuck in LBNA without updated information.  How to fix that...</div>

Village Creek State Park, down near Beaumont, about a<br>
month or two ago, I forget exactly when, and we were<br>
not able to get to it.  I could see where it was<br>
supposed to be, but the trees down from the hurricane<br>
completely covered the area.....since we were only in<br>
shorts and sandals, we did not try for it.  It may be<br>
there, or it may not be, we could not tell one way or<br>
the other, because of the trees.  I emailed Hawk back<br>
then, but got no reply at all.  I also am curious (as<br>
was someone else who mentioned it??), about a wee bit<br>
more info about Hawk, if anyone in the know feels<br>
there is info that is appropriate to share.  It seems<br>
odd for someone to have been obviously quite involved<br>
in letterboxing, to have placed 80!?, wow!, and now,<br>
no more!??<br>
