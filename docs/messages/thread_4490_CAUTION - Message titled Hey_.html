                    <html><body><p>Starseeker did NOT send that message out. As has happened so often on the internet in the past few months, this sort of message is sent out to entire contact lists when someone's email is hijacked. <br/><br/>Don't try the link - at the very least, it will harvest your email addresses, at the very worst, it will hijack YOUR contact list and send to everyone you know! And I guess that's not the very worst that could happen, but anyway, don't hit the link.<br/>
<br/>We'll be deleting the message from the archives and putting Starseeker on moderation until she is able to get the situation resolved, but rest assured, she herself had no part of sending it.<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>-- <br/>
