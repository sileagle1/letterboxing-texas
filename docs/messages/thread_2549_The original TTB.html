                    <html><body><div>Since we woke up and it was a bright and sunny day and the weather hasn't been this nice on a weekend in a long, long time, PomPom Bear and I decided to head out and see if we couldn't catch a ride on the TTB. We traveled down to Lake Brownwood and lo and behold there we found the whole gang parked up by the Lake taking in the sunshine and having a good ol time! After a few hours of enjoying the scenery (and a fast moving cold front headed our way) we decided to make it on back up to Cowtown. The bus decided to tag along so it is on the road again and will be stopping off at the Fort Worth Rodeo while its here but only temporarily so when the gang decides to head out, we will let you know their destination. Thanks to Gryzzled Gryphon for excellent clues from PomPom Bear.</div> <div>Monarch B</div> <div>(Carolyn)</div></body></html>
