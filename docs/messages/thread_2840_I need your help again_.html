                    <html><body><div>Hey Lois!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You have actually several issues all wrapped up under one situation:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can rename a box anytime you want - however, bear in mind that there may be some folks walking around with the clues that won't know that you've renamed it when they go to log it.  My suggestion is when you edit the box, you leave the old name in paranthesis for a little while: Nice Box Name (was Yukky Box Name).  After a month or two, you can go back and edit out the old box name and leave just the new name. That should give anyone who is in the process of finding your box time to log it.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>No, you will not have to retire the box, and in fact, you really shouldn't retire it.  Consider it this way: When you got married and changed your name, it didn't change the person you are, it just changed how you are called.  In fact, if you want to carry on the marriage analogy, you could even say that retiring a box just because it has a name you don't like is sort of like a fella getting rid of the first wife in favor of a younger woman.  The old one was perfectly fine but had a few miles, but the new one is more attractive (okay, maybe that was a stretch - LOL!) 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The standard definition of a new box is: </div>
<div> </div>
<div>new location (and hence, different clues) + new stamp = new box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This definition is why many boxers, when one of their boxes goes missing, will recarve the stamp and rehide the box, but they will rehide it in a different place in the same vicinity.  You'll notice that Silver Eagle particularly has several boxes that are named with sequel numbers , like Rocky I, Rocky II, Rocky III, Rocky IV, Rocky V - oops sorry, almost couldn't stop.  Anyway, that way previous finders can come and get the new image and also be able to record the find as a new find.
