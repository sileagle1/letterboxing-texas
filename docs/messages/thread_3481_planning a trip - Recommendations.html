                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm more into "the place" instead of "the box", so I recommend Kleb <br>
Woods in northwest Harris county, Mercer Arboretum near Spring just <br>
north of Houston, and Memorial Park right in the heart of Houston.  <br>
On your way to Houston you can detour through Brenham/Navasota area <br>
for beautiful wildflowers and many boxes, especially in Washington-On-<br>
The-Brazos State Park.  All of these parks are nice, free and full of <br>
boxes.  On LBNA you can search Texas boxes with the park name in the <br>
clues to find many of them.  Have fun!<br>

any letterboxes we don't want to miss. What happens every time I plan <br>
something is I go to both lists (Letterboxing.org and Atlasquest.com) <br>
and print up all the boxes that I find in the area...then I come home <br>
and someone mentions the same area and boxes that I didn't even know <br>
existed because I somehow missed them!! So I'm planning to research <br>
the different boxes in the next week or so, but if anyone knows of <br>
some that they've enjoyed, please mention them by name so I can look <br>
the clues up!<br>
