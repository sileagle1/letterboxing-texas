<body id="compText">I've been coming to the events for about ten years now, but I had the privilege of experiencing TALE from a new perspective this year. I brought my 11 year old grandson, Trail Ripper with me. I was so pleasantly surprised to find how inclusive and friendly everyone was with him. I've only experienced the events from an adult role, so this was my first time to see it through the eyes of a kid! He was so happy. Listening to him report to his mom how fun it was, and how friendly and great everyone was just filled me with joy. I just can't let this opportunity pass without thanking each and everyone of you who attended TALE for making our experience so wonderful. Obviously, I admire Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for all their effort to bring us together each year, and I have so many friends I look forward to seeing each time, but it's also wonderful to meet so many new letterboxers. Thank you for everyone who made this event so wonderful, whether it was by planning the event, planting the amazing boxes or just your bright and wonderful smiles! This is a very, very special group of individuals! Puddle Splasher<br/><br/>
