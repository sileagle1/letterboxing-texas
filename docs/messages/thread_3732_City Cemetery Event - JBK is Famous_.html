<p>Local woman 
catalogues those buried in old Jacksonville cemetery</p>
<p><span>By Cristin 
Ross<br/><br/>cross@jacksonvilleprogress.com<br/><br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>Jacksonville resident Bindi 
Caveness isn’t letting her home town’s history stay buried in the past.<span class="921005923-16082008">  </span>Caveness and several of her friends 
recently catalogued names, dates and other pertinent information included on the 
headstones located in Jacksonville’s City Cemetery on Kickapoo 
Street. <br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>“I’ve 
always been a big cemetery buff,” Caveness, who teaches science at New 
Summerfield Independent School District, said. “My mom used to tease me about 
it, but now she’s sort of into it, too, since she helped us on this 
project.”<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>After 
transcribing the data into a coherent list, Caveness plans to donate the list to 
the city of Jacksonville.<span class="921005923-16082008">  </span>“The city 
has names of those who owned the deeds to the cemetery’s plots,” Caveness 
explained. “That doesn’t necessarily tell you who’s buried where or even how 
many people might be buried there.”<span class="921005923-16082008">  
</span>Caveness said she’s also planning to provide her lists to the Web site 
http://www.cemeteries-of-tx.com/Etx/Cherokee/ListCherokee.html, to help make 
local genealogy searches a little easier.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>“This is an immense benefit 
to the city,” Jacksonville City Secretary Betty Thompson said. “And we 
especially appreciate them all volunteering their time and efforts. This kind of 
documentation is priceless.”<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>Caveness began the project 
after getting involved with another project regarding local famous people.<span class="921005923-16082008">  </span>“I was researching Fred Lowery, the 
world-famous whistler, and wanted to find his grave,” Caveness said. “After 
walking the cemetery for a couple of hours and not finding it, I called the city 
to see if they knew where it was. That’s when I found out the city only had a 
list of plot deed owners — no lists of who’s actually in the cemetery.”<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>Barry Autry, a local funeral 
home director, helped Caveness find Lowery’s grave, but the idea of Caveness’s 
mission had already taken root.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>“It’s important,” Caveness 
said. “If we lose these names, then we lose part of our history.<span class="921005923-16082008">  </span>There’s so much local history right here 
in our cemeteries. It’s interesting to me to see the names of our streets 
attached to something as personal as a headstone. It links those everyday names 
to the people who had them.”<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>City records show the 
cemetery was first incorporated in 1872 and is still in use today. Three or four 
of the oldest graves contained people born in the 1700s.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>“There were a lot of unmarked 
stones,” she said. “We weren’t sure if they were actually graves or just graves 
that have been reserved for someone who isn’t there yet.”<span class="921005923-16082008">  </span>There are even some graves that are 
marked with a simple iron ore rock.<span class="921005923-16082008">  
</span>“Some of those stones are very hard to read,” Caveness said.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>It took Caveness and a group 
of friends — some of whom traveled from as far away as Corpus Christi and Ben 
Wheeler to help — 10 days to cover the entire cemetery. The group catalogued 
5,006 recognized grave markers. The last stone was catalogued Monday 
morning.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>“At first, 
I was like, ‘Where do I even start and what have I gotten myself into?’” 
Caveness said with a laugh. “We started at Mother Templeton’s plot, since I’ve 
always liked it.”<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    
</span>Legend has it the statue used as a Templeton family grave marker talks 
and even moves around on occasion.<span class="921005923-16082008">  
"</span>I’ve never seen or heard it do anything,” Caveness said. “But there have 
been people who say they have.”<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>Other historic names found at 
the cemetery include Jacksonville’s founder Jackson Smith, Bolton, Nichols, 
Alexander, Whitehead, Pearman, Slover, Newburn, O’Keefe, Tilley, Fry, Trantham 
and Troutman.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>One 
personal discovery Caveness made while completing her project concerned her 
great-aunt’s grave.<span class="921005923-16082008">   </span>“She was 
buried here and when we found her marker, we realized no one had ever come back 
and added the date of her death on her marker,” Caveness said.<br/><span class="921005923-16082008">    </span>Caveness said she’s 
especially glad to have found something she could give back to her home 
town.<span class="921005923-16082008">  "</span>Jacksonville’s been good to 
me,” she said. “I’m proud to be able to do something for my 
hometown.”</span></p>

&gt; Local woman catalogues those buried in old Jacksonville cemetery<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By Cristin Ross<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; cross@...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;     Jacksonville resident Bindi Caveness isn't letting her home <br/>
town's<br/>
&gt; history stay buried in the past.  Caveness and several of her <br/>
friends<br/>
&gt; recently catalogued names, dates and other pertinent information <br/>
included on<br/>
&gt; the headstones located in Jacksonville's City Cemetery on Kickapoo <br/>
Street. <br/>
&gt;     "I've always been a big cemetery buff," Caveness, who teaches <br/>
science at<br/>
&gt; New Summerfield Independent School District, said. "My mom used to <br/>
tease me<br/>
&gt; about it, but now she's sort of into it, too, since she helped us <br/>
on this<br/>
&gt; project."<br/>
&gt;     After transcribing the data into a coherent list, Caveness <br/>
plans to<br/>
&gt; donate the list to the city of Jacksonville.  "The city has names <br/>
of those<br/>
&gt; who owned the deeds to the cemetery's plots," Caveness <br/>
explained. "That<br/>
&gt; doesn't necessarily tell you who's buried where or even how many <br/>
people<br/>
&gt; might be buried there."  Caveness said she's also planning to <br/>
provide her<br/>
&gt; lists to the Web site<br/>
&gt; http://www.cemeteries-of-tx.com/Etx/Cherokee/ListCherokee.html, to <br/>
help make<br/>
&gt; local genealogy searches a little easier.<br/>
&gt;     "This is an immense benefit to the city," Jacksonville City <br/>
Secretary<br/>
&gt; Betty Thompson said. "And we especially appreciate them all <br/>
volunteering<br/>
&gt; their time and efforts. This kind of documentation is priceless."<br/>
&gt;     Caveness began the project after getting involved with another <br/>
project<br/>
&gt; regarding local famous people.  "I was researching Fred Lowery, the<br/>
&gt; world-famous whistler, and wanted to find his grave," Caveness <br/>
said. "After<br/>
&gt; walking the cemetery for a couple of hours and not finding it, I <br/>
called the<br/>
&gt; city to see if they knew where it was. That's when I found out the <br/>
city only<br/>
&gt; had a list of plot deed owners - no lists of who's actually in the<br/>
&gt; cemetery."<br/>
&gt;     Barry Autry, a local funeral home director, helped Caveness find<br/>
&gt; Lowery's grave, but the idea of Caveness's mission had already <br/>
taken root.<br/>
&gt;     "It's important," Caveness said. "If we lose these names, then <br/>
we lose<br/>
&gt; part of our history.  There's so much local history right here in <br/>
our<br/>
&gt; cemeteries. It's interesting to me to see the names of our streets <br/>
attached<br/>
&gt; to something as personal as a headstone. It links those everyday <br/>
names to<br/>
&gt; the people who had them."<br/>
&gt;     City records show the cemetery was first incorporated in 1872 <br/>
and is<br/>
&gt; still in use today. Three or four of the oldest graves contained <br/>
people born<br/>
&gt; in the 1700s.<br/>
&gt;     "There were a lot of unmarked stones," she said. "We weren't <br/>
sure if<br/>
&gt; they were actually graves or just graves that have been reserved <br/>
for someone<br/>
&gt; who isn't there yet."  There are even some graves that are marked <br/>
with a<br/>
&gt; simple iron ore rock.  "Some of those stones are very hard to read,"<br/>
&gt; Caveness said.<br/>
&gt;     It took Caveness and a group of friends - some of whom traveled <br/>
from as<br/>
&gt; far away as Corpus Christi and Ben Wheeler to help - 10 days to <br/>
cover the<br/>
&gt; entire cemetery. The group catalogued 5,006 recognized grave <br/>
markers. The<br/>
&gt; last stone was catalogued Monday morning.<br/>
&gt;     "At first, I was like, 'Where do I even start and what have I <br/>
gotten<br/>
&gt; myself into?'" Caveness said with a laugh. "We started at Mother <br/>
Templeton's<br/>
&gt; plot, since I've always liked it."<br/>
&gt;     Legend has it the statue used as a Templeton family grave <br/>
marker talks<br/>
&gt; and even moves around on occasion.  "I've never seen or heard it do<br/>
&gt; anything," Caveness said. "But there have been people who say they <br/>
have."<br/>
&gt;     Other historic names found at the cemetery include <br/>
Jacksonville's<br/>
&gt; founder Jackson Smith, Bolton, Nichols, Alexander, Whitehead, <br/>
Pearman,<br/>
&gt; Slover, Newburn, O'Keefe, Tilley, Fry, Trantham and Troutman.<br/>
&gt;     One personal discovery Caveness made while completing her <br/>
project<br/>
&gt; concerned her great-aunt's grave.   "She was buried here and when <br/>
we found<br/>
&gt; her marker, we realized no one had ever come back and added the <br/>
date of her<br/>
&gt; death on her marker," Caveness said.<br/>
&gt;     Caveness said she's especially glad to have found something she <br/>
could<br/>
&gt; give back to her home town.  "Jacksonville's been good to me," she <br/>
said.<br/>
&gt; "I'm proud to be able to do something for my hometown."<br/>

<div class="Wj3C7c"><br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Jacksonville resident Bindi Caveness isn't letting her home <br/>town's<br/>&gt; history stay buried in the past. Caveness and several of her <br/>friends<br/>&gt; recently catalogued names, dates and other pertinent information <br/>
included on<br/>&gt; the headstones located in Jacksonville's City Cemetery on Kickapoo <br/>Street. <br/>&gt; "I've always been a big cemetery buff," Caveness, who teaches <br/>science at<br/>&gt; New Summerfield Independent School District, said. "My mom used to <br/>
tease me<br/>&gt; about it, but now she's sort of into it, too, since she helped us <br/>on this<br/>&gt; project."<br/>&gt; After transcribing the data into a coherent list, Caveness <br/>plans to<br/>&gt; donate the list to the city of Jacksonville. "The city has names <br/>
of those<br/>&gt; who owned the deeds to the cemetery's plots," Caveness <br/>explained. "That<br/>&gt; doesn't necessarily tell you who's buried where or even how many <br/>people<br/>&gt; might be buried there." Caveness said she's also planning to <br/>
provide her<br/>&gt; lists to the Web site<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.cemeteries-of-tx.com/Etx/Cherokee/ListCherokee.html," target="_blank">http://www.cemeteries-of-tx.com/Etx/Cherokee/ListCherokee.html,</a> to <br/>help make<br/>

<div class="Wj3C7c"><br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Jacksonville resident Bindi Caveness isn't letting her home <br/>town's<br/>&gt; history stay buried in the past. Caveness and several of her <br/>friends<br/>&gt; recently catalogued names, dates and other pertinent information <br/>
included on<br/>&gt; the headstones located in Jacksonville's City Cemetery on Kickapoo <br/>Street. <br/>&gt; "I've always been a big cemetery buff," Caveness, who teaches <br/>science at<br/>&gt; New Summerfield Independent School District, said. "My mom used to <br/>
tease me<br/>&gt; about it, but now she's sort of into it, too, since she helped us <br/>on this<br/>&gt; project."<br/>&gt; After transcribing the data into a coherent list, Caveness <br/>plans to<br/>&gt; donate the list to the city of Jacksonville. "The city has names <br/>
of those<br/>&gt; who owned the deeds to the cemetery's plots," Caveness <br/>explained. "That<br/>&gt; doesn't necessarily tell you who's buried where or even how many <br/>people<br/>&gt; might be buried there." Caveness said she's also planning to <br/>
provide her<br/>&gt; lists to the Web site<br/></div></div>&gt; <a href="http://www.cemeteries-of-tx.com/Etx/Cherokee/ListCherokee.html," rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.cemeteri es-of-tx. com/Etx/Cherokee /ListCherokee. html,</a> to <br/>
<div>
<div></div>
<div class="Wj3C7c">help make<br/>&gt; local genealogy searches a little easier.<br/>&gt; "This is an immense benefit to the city," Jacksonville City <br/>Secretary<br/>&gt; Betty Thompson said. "And we especially appreciate them all <br/>
volunteering<br/>&gt; their time and efforts. This kind of documentation is priceless."<br/>&gt; Caveness began the project after getting involved with another <br/>project<br/>&gt; regarding local famous people. "I was researching Fred Lowery, the<br/>
&gt; world-famous whistler, and wanted to find his grave," Caveness <br/>said. "After<br/>&gt; walking the cemetery for a couple of hours and not finding it, I <br/>called the<br/>&gt; city to see if they knew where it was. That's when I found out the <br/>
city only<br/>&gt; had a list of plot deed owners - no lists of who's actually in the<br/>&gt; cemetery."<br/>&gt; Barry Autry, a local funeral home director, helped Caveness find<br/>&gt; Lowery's grave, but the idea of Caveness's mission had already <br/>
taken root.<br/>&gt; "It's important," Caveness said. "If we lose these names, then <br/>we lose<br/>&gt; part of our history. There's so much local history right here in <br/>our<br/>&gt; cemeteries. It's interesting to me to see the names of our streets <br/>
attached<br/>&gt; to something as personal as a headstone. It links those everyday <br/>names to<br/>&gt; the people who had them."<br/>&gt; City records show the cemetery was first incorporated in 1872 <br/>and is<br/>&gt; still in use today. Three or four of the oldest graves contained <br/>
people born<br/>&gt; in the 1700s.<br/>&gt; "There were a lot of unmarked stones," she said. "We weren't <br/>sure if<br/>&gt; they were actually graves or just graves that have been reserved <br/>for someone<br/>
&gt; who isn't there yet." There are even some graves that are marked <br/>with a<br/>&gt; simple iron ore rock. "Some of those stones are very hard to read,"<br/>&gt; Caveness said.<br/>&gt; It took Caveness and a group of friends - some of whom traveled <br/>
from as<br/>&gt; far away as Corpus Christi and Ben Wheeler to help - 10 days to <br/>cover the<br/>&gt; entire cemetery. The group catalogued 5,006 recognized grave <br/>markers. The<br/>&gt; last stone was catalogued Monday morning.<br/>
&gt; "At first, I was like, 'Where do I even start and what have I <br/>gotten<br/>&gt; myself into?'" Caveness said with a laugh. "We started at Mother <br/>Templeton's<br/>&gt; plot, since I've always liked it."<br/>
&gt; Legend has it the statue used as a Templeton family grave <br/>marker talks<br/>&gt; and even moves around on occasion. "I've never seen or heard it do<br/>&gt; anything," Caveness said. "But there have been people who say they <br/>
have."<br/>&gt; Other historic names found at the cemetery include <br/>Jacksonville's<br/>&gt; founder Jackson Smith, Bolton, Nichols, Alexander, Whitehead, <br/>Pearman,<br/>&gt; Slover, Newburn, O'Keefe, Tilley, Fry, Trantham and Troutman.<br/>
&gt; One personal discovery Caveness made while completing her <br/>project<br/>&gt; concerned her great-aunt's grave. "She was buried here and when <br/>we found<br/>&gt; her marker, we realized no one had ever come back and added the <br/>
date of her<br/>&gt; death on her marker," Caveness said.<br/>&gt; Caveness said she's especially glad to have found something she <br/>could<br/>&gt; give back to her home town. "Jacksonville's been good to me," she <br/>
said.<br/>&gt; "I'm proud to be able to do something for my hometown."<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div></div></div>

&gt; Congratulations JBK. This is an honor that is well deserved. You <br/>
&gt; put many hours cateloging the names on the headstones. I'm glad <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; I could help for the few hours that I did. <br/>

&gt; &gt; I know she won't do it herself, so as her cousin it is my <br/>
privilege <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; responsibility to brag on JBKokopelli for the recognition she has <br/>
&gt; received<br/>
&gt; &gt; for her Jacksonville City Cemetery project. My aunt (JBK's Mom) <br/>
&gt; turned her<br/>
&gt; &gt; in to the newspaper (she's too modest to call attention to <br/>
&gt; herself), but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; located the article today and just wanted you all to see it. <br/>
&gt; Jacksonville<br/>
&gt; &gt; is sort of my "second home" since most of my Mom's side of the <br/>
&gt; family lives<br/>
&gt; &gt; out that way, so my thanks also goes out to JBK and to all of you <br/>
&gt; who helped<br/>
&gt; &gt; her in this endeavor. I wish I could've been there to help!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Local woman catalogues those buried in old Jacksonville cemetery<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jacksonville resident Bindi Caveness isn't letting her home <br/>
&gt; town's<br/>
&gt; &gt; history stay buried in the past. Caveness and several of her <br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; recently catalogued names, dates and other pertinent information <br/>
&gt; included on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the headstones located in Jacksonville's City Cemetery on <br/>
Kickapoo <br/>
&gt; Street. <br/>
&gt; &gt; "I've always been a big cemetery buff," Caveness, who teaches <br/>
&gt; science at<br/>
&gt; &gt; New Summerfield Independent School District, said. "My mom used <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; tease me<br/>
&gt; &gt; about it, but now she's sort of into it, too, since she helped us <br/>
&gt; on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; project."<br/>
&gt; &gt; After transcribing the data into a coherent list, Caveness <br/>
&gt; plans to<br/>
&gt; &gt; donate the list to the city of Jacksonville. "The city has names <br/>
&gt; of those<br/>
&gt; &gt; who owned the deeds to the cemetery's plots," Caveness <br/>
&gt; explained. "That<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't necessarily tell you who's buried where or even how many <br/>
&gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; might be buried there." Caveness said she's also planning to <br/>
&gt; provide her<br/>
&gt; &gt; lists to the Web site<br/>
&gt; &gt; http://www.cemeteri es-of-tx. com/Etx/Cherokee /ListCherokee. <br/>
html, to <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; help make<br/>
&gt; &gt; local genealogy searches a little easier.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "This is an immense benefit to the city," Jacksonville City <br/>
&gt; Secretary<br/>
&gt; &gt; Betty Thompson said. "And we especially appreciate them all <br/>
&gt; volunteering<br/>
&gt; &gt; their time and efforts. This kind of documentation is priceless."<br/>
&gt; &gt; Caveness began the project after getting involved with another <br/>
&gt; project<br/>
&gt; &gt; regarding local famous people. "I was researching Fred Lowery, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; world-famous whistler, and wanted to find his grave," Caveness <br/>
&gt; said. "After<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking the cemetery for a couple of hours and not finding it, I <br/>
&gt; called the<br/>
&gt; &gt; city to see if they knew where it was. That's when I found out <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; city only<br/>
&gt; &gt; had a list of plot deed owners - no lists of who's actually in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cemetery."<br/>
&gt; &gt; Barry Autry, a local funeral home director, helped Caveness find<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lowery's grave, but the idea of Caveness's mission had already <br/>
&gt; taken root.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "It's important," Caveness said. "If we lose these names, then <br/>
&gt; we lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; part of our history. There's so much local history right here in <br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; cemeteries. It's interesting to me to see the names of our <br/>
streets <br/>
&gt; attached<br/>
&gt; &gt; to something as personal as a headstone. It links those everyday <br/>
&gt; names to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the people who had them."<br/>
&gt; &gt; City records show the cemetery was first incorporated in 1872 <br/>
&gt; and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; still in use today. Three or four of the oldest graves contained <br/>
&gt; people born<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the 1700s.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "There were a lot of unmarked stones," she said. "We weren't <br/>
&gt; sure if<br/>
&gt; &gt; they were actually graves or just graves that have been reserved <br/>
&gt; for someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; who isn't there yet." There are even some graves that are marked <br/>
&gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; simple iron ore rock. "Some of those stones are very hard to <br/>
read,"<br/>
&gt; &gt; Caveness said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; It took Caveness and a group of friends - some of whom traveled <br/>
&gt; from as<br/>
&gt; &gt; far away as Corpus Christi and Ben Wheeler to help - 10 days to <br/>
&gt; cover the<br/>
&gt; &gt; entire cemetery. The group catalogued 5,006 recognized grave <br/>
&gt; markers. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; last stone was catalogued Monday morning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "At first, I was like, 'Where do I even start and what have I <br/>
&gt; gotten<br/>
&gt; &gt; myself into?'" Caveness said with a laugh. "We started at Mother <br/>
&gt; Templeton's<br/>
&gt; &gt; plot, since I've always liked it."<br/>
&gt; &gt; Legend has it the statue used as a Templeton family grave <br/>
&gt; marker talks<br/>
&gt; &gt; and even moves around on occasion. "I've never seen or heard it do<br/>
&gt; &gt; anything," Caveness said. "But there have been people who say <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; have."<br/>
&gt; &gt; Other historic names found at the cemetery include <br/>
&gt; Jacksonville's<br/>
&gt; &gt; founder Jackson Smith, Bolton, Nichols, Alexander, Whitehead, <br/>
&gt; Pearman,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Slover, Newburn, O'Keefe, Tilley, Fry, Trantham and Troutman.<br/>
&gt; &gt; One personal discovery Caveness made while completing her <br/>
&gt; project<br/>
&gt; &gt; concerned her great-aunt's grave. "She was buried here and when <br/>
&gt; we found<br/>
&gt; &gt; her marker, we realized no one had ever come back and added the <br/>
&gt; date of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; death on her marker," Caveness said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Caveness said she's especially glad to have found something she <br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; give back to her home town. "Jacksonville's been good to me," she <br/>
&gt; said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "I'm proud to be able to do something for my hometown."<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I know she won't do it herself, so as her cousin it is my <br/>
&gt; privilege <br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsibility to brag on JBKokopelli for the recognition she <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; &gt; received<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for her Jacksonville City Cemetery project. My aunt (JBK's Mom) <br/>
&gt; &gt; turned her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in to the newspaper (she's too modest to call attention to <br/>
&gt; &gt; herself), but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; located the article today and just wanted you all to see it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jacksonville<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is sort of my "second home" since most of my Mom's side of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; family lives<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out that way, so my thanks also goes out to JBK and to all of <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; who helped<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her in this endeavor. I wish I could've been there to help!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Local woman catalogues those buried in old Jacksonville cemetery<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Jacksonville resident Bindi Caveness isn't letting her home <br/>
&gt; &gt; town's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; history stay buried in the past. Caveness and several of her <br/>
&gt; &gt; friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; recently catalogued names, dates and other pertinent <br/>
information <br/>
&gt; &gt; included on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the headstones located in Jacksonville' s City Cemetery on <br/>
&gt; Kickapoo <br/>
&gt; &gt; Street. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "I've always been a big cemetery buff," Caveness, who teaches <br/>
&gt; &gt; science at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; New Summerfield Independent School District, said. "My mom used <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; tease me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about it, but now she's sort of into it, too, since she helped <br/>
us <br/>
&gt; &gt; on this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; project."<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; After transcribing the data into a coherent list, Caveness <br/>
&gt; &gt; plans to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; donate the list to the city of Jacksonville. "The city has <br/>
names <br/>
&gt; &gt; of those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who owned the deeds to the cemetery's plots," Caveness <br/>
&gt; &gt; explained. "That<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't necessarily tell you who's buried where or even how <br/>
many <br/>
&gt; &gt; people<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; might be buried there." Caveness said she's also planning to <br/>
&gt; &gt; provide her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lists to the Web site<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.cemeteri es-of-tx. com/Etx/Cherokee /ListCherokee. <br/>
&gt; html, to <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; help make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; local genealogy searches a little easier.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "This is an immense benefit to the city," Jacksonville City <br/>
&gt; &gt; Secretary<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Betty Thompson said. "And we especially appreciate them all <br/>
&gt; &gt; volunteering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their time and efforts. This kind of documentation is <br/>
priceless."<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Caveness began the project after getting involved with another <br/>
&gt; &gt; project<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; regarding local famous people. "I was researching Fred Lowery, <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; world-famous whistler, and wanted to find his grave," Caveness <br/>
&gt; &gt; said. "After<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walking the cemetery for a couple of hours and not finding it, <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; called the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; city to see if they knew where it was. That's when I found out <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; city only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had a list of plot deed owners - no lists of who's actually in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery."<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Barry Autry, a local funeral home director, helped Caveness find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lowery's grave, but the idea of Caveness's mission had already <br/>
&gt; &gt; taken root.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "It's important," Caveness said. "If we lose these names, then <br/>
&gt; &gt; we lose<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; part of our history. There's so much local history right here <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cemeteries. It's interesting to me to see the names of our <br/>
&gt; streets <br/>
&gt; &gt; attached<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to something as personal as a headstone. It links those <br/>
everyday <br/>
&gt; &gt; names to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the people who had them."<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; City records show the cemetery was first incorporated in 1872 <br/>
&gt; &gt; and is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; still in use today. Three or four of the oldest graves <br/>
contained <br/>
&gt; &gt; people born<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the 1700s.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "There were a lot of unmarked stones," she said. "We weren't <br/>
&gt; &gt; sure if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they were actually graves or just graves that have been <br/>
reserved <br/>
&gt; &gt; for someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; who isn't there yet." There are even some graves that are <br/>
marked <br/>
&gt; &gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simple iron ore rock. "Some of those stones are very hard to <br/>
&gt; read,"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Caveness said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It took Caveness and a group of friends - some of whom traveled <br/>
&gt; &gt; from as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; far away as Corpus Christi and Ben Wheeler to help - 10 days to <br/>
&gt; &gt; cover the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; entire cemetery. The group catalogued 5,006 recognized grave <br/>
&gt; &gt; markers. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last stone was catalogued Monday morning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "At first, I was like, 'Where do I even start and what have I <br/>
&gt; &gt; gotten<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; myself into?'" Caveness said with a laugh. "We started at <br/>
Mother <br/>
&gt; &gt; Templeton's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; plot, since I've always liked it."<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Legend has it the statue used as a Templeton family grave <br/>
&gt; &gt; marker talks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and even moves around on occasion. "I've never seen or heard it <br/>
do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anything," Caveness said. "But there have been people who say <br/>
&gt; they <br/>
&gt; &gt; have."<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Other historic names found at the cemetery include <br/>
&gt; &gt; Jacksonville' s<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; founder Jackson Smith, Bolton, Nichols, Alexander, Whitehead, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pearman,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Slover, Newburn, O'Keefe, Tilley, Fry, Trantham and Troutman.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; One personal discovery Caveness made while completing her <br/>
&gt; &gt; project<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; concerned her great-aunt's grave. "She was buried here and when <br/>
&gt; &gt; we found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her marker, we realized no one had ever come back and added the <br/>
&gt; &gt; date of her<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; death on her marker," Caveness said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Caveness said she's especially glad to have found something she <br/>
&gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; give back to her home town. "Jacksonville' s been good to me," <br/>
she <br/>
&gt; &gt; said.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "I'm proud to be able to do something for my hometown."<br/>
