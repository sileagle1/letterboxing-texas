<p><font face="Arial" size="2">It's been a little while since JBKokopelli and I were able to do one of our marathon days, so we decided to take advantage of the long weekend to venture out.   JBK left her house at 6am Saturday morning and I left DFW at 6:32; we met up at the good old Dairy Queen in Mabank (where smoking is allowed inside!) at 7:45 to see how far we could get on the list of 30-something boxes JBKokopelli had mapped out for us.  Our 4-legged companion, J.R., moved over to let me in, and off we went.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our first stop was just down the road to pick up "Blue Daisy" by Adams Trails.  The box was completely exposed next to its rock and tree, but was in good condition so we recovered well.   Remember BFLucy describing the tall grass she and JBK waded through on their last outing?  Well we had knee-high grass getting to this box, so J.R. was swimming in grass again.  We had intended to head over to the library for "A Butterfly", but had forgotten the library isn't open on Saturdays.   Down the road a piece to Gun Barrel City, we picked up "Time in a…Barrel??" by Holmes Trekkers; creative packaging and location!   Next we went out to the boat ramp to pick up "Have Fun Matte'" but were unsuccessful.  We suspect that the lake level was high enough this summer to wash the box away and will email more info to Adams Trails about what we found there.  We went next door to Seven Points to pick up "Harts on Fire" and found it right where it was supposed to be.  While in town we made a visit to the library to check out "The Adventure of Adams Trails Vol. 2".  I was really impressed by the imagination that went into this one.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">After finishing up in the "tri cities area", we drove over to Kemp to pick up "Kemp Calaboose".  I had heard so much about this spot but hadn't taken the time to go see it.  It was definitely worth the wait.  I sure would've hated to be in that little cell, especially in the summer!  It was 9:26 am now and we had found 5 out of 6 (if you don't count the library).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">On to Kaufman and the Veteran's Memorial Park to get "Celebrate Our Military Day".  We spent a good little bit of time wandering around looking at the engraved names, quotes, and images.  If you haven't been to this memorial, please go.  Kaufman did an amazing job with this special tribute and I took the time to record several of the quotes I found there.  The next stop was Terrell and "Nana's Hummingbird".  This was another great stamp by Stargazer (so much detail!) and hiding place.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JBK and I have noticed a trend about the trips we make together.  We ALWAYS see unusual "big" things on our journey….things like 20-foot tall paint cans outside a paint store, a gigantic inflatable Elvis on top of a car dealership, and so on.  This time, we happened across a huge wooden chair on the roof of a building in Canton, followed by a big Mexican man made out of rusty metal and named Pedro!  Before we got to Canton, we drove past some kind of ranch where they had ostriches, zebras, camels, llamas, and Texas Longhorns!  Later we saw a herd of miniature goats, and another one of miniature horses.  So apparently it was "big stuff day" as well as "critter day".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We almost missed Hillcrest Cemetery in Canton because we were still ogling Pedro, but saw the driveway just in time.  We had no problems finding "First Monday Canton".   The stamp had been broken in two, but was still useable.  We also picked up the "Endeavor to Space" hitchhiker in this box.   We then got to learn about the dipping vats used by the county in the early 1900s; neither of us expected it to look like it did.  The "Dipping Vat" box was safe and sound, but the stamp's design did add to my constant case of the willies related to little creepy-crawly things.  ;-)   We found another HH here ("Hit the Road Jack" by Puddle Splasher).  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our next stop was Grand Saline and the "Salt Palace" box at the Salt Palace.  I liked the creativity of the container used for this box.  The little salt house didn't look like it used to but it was pretty cool.  They had some wonderful memorabilia inside and we got little salt crystals for free.  We drove to Phalba while we ate lunch in the car (we don't waste any time on these trips) to pick up "An Apple for the Teacher" at the old Pleasant Grove School.  I enjoyed getting to see the old school house.  I could imagine kids from "The Waltons" going to school there and fighting over who got to ring the bell.  It was 12:49 pm by now, and we both had leash-burns  from stopping J.R.'s escape attempt, I had blue ink on both hands and dirt on my shirt (which is what happens when J.R. wants his seat back and you're in it).  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We then headed over to Purtis Creek State Park to pick up its boxes.  The first box was "Lions, Tigers, and Frogs"; the only troubles we had were the two big spider webs across the trails (complete with spiders…did I mention my aversion to creepy-crawly things?) that JBK had to destroy for me.  I'm a city girl…she humors me and allows me to be girly about bugs and poison ivy.   She made me look at the spiders though - one had a white smiley face on it that she thought was cool.  I thought it was evil.  Next we found "The Great Outdoors" and another spider, this time with an orange smiley face on it…evil in time for Halloween.    We then picked up "Swimming Upstream" with no problems except that we were hot and sticky and tired by now.    Across the road we picked up "Captain Zach's Box" and "The Drifter" and both were safe and sound.  What neat finds.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">The next stop on our marathon was Athens.  I love Athens…it has my favorite county courthouse except for "Old Red" in Dallas.  This was my first time to really wander around town off the beaten path though.   We found peach icees at the Chevron station; we both grew up drinking Peach Nehi sodas, so this was a throwback to those days and really hit the spot.  We picked up "The Old Fiddler" at a pretty little park, "Black Eyed Uncle Fletcher" in a wonderful shady arbor with huge wisteria, and "The Sheriff", all safe and sound and happy to be found.   We also saw a day-glow yellow/green neon metallic 1978-ish land yacht as it passed us in town.  Weird stuff, I tell ya.   Next we picked up "United We Stand" in another pretty arbor, and while I was stamping in, JBK found a shortcut to "Don't Rocket Till You've Tried It" so I was able to get that one quickly too.  We went to the city cemetery to get "We Remember" next, then visited Trinity Valley Community College to get "The Cardette" and "TVCC Cardinal".  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We drove out to get "Scuba Dude" but had to drive on past him because some divers had set up their campsites very near the Dude's tree but inside the park.  There was no way we could've gotten the box without being seen, so I'll try him again next time I come through town.  The water sure looked pretty though!  We picked up "Just Call Him Jess", then found "Texas Longhorns" at the Cain Center but decided to skip "Candi Cane" because I was tired and grumpy and it required a longer walk than I wanted to make.  We also skipped "Texas Passport Series 1 - Athens" and the "Children's Stories and Rhymes Series" at the arboretum.  It will take a cooler day to make those walks.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Next we went out to Frankston so I could get an impression of the box that JBK planted there for me (since I forgot to keep one before sending the box out into the world), then picked up "All Aboard?" at the old Depot.  This was a neat stamp and location too.  We got "Kickapoo Battlefield" and decided to wait on "Pine Hill"; our copy of the clue was old and it seemed like it hadn't been found in ages and we wanted to see if there were any updates (of course now I know it was found in May so we should've just done it anyway).  "In Memoriam C.A.P." was our next destination but JBK had taken over the navigational responsibilities (as well as still driving).  I had no idea where we were as she took us down some tiny little county roads to avoid backtracking on the highway.  Our bumpy little blacktop/gravel road was okay, then became really smooth and nice and we noticed the super large houses…the rich people had their road improved…cool!  As quickly as it had improved though, the road returned to its blacktop/gravel bumpy self, and then deteriorated to a red dirt road.  Where the heck are we?  JBK continued to insist she knew where we were, but when the road forked right down the middle with no signs, I really started to worry.  Then when we drove over a cattle guard, I just knew Larry, his brother Darryl, and his other brother Darryl were going appear over the hill on 3-wheelers with their shotguns, but JBK just kept on going.  Eventually we crossed another cattle guard and reached paved road again, and the bubbas never appeared.   Somehow or another, JBK got us to Foster Cemetery near Poyner, by way of BFE.  I'm still shaking my head in bewilderment.  ANYway, we were at "In Memoriam C.A.P." and the original burial location of Cynthia Ann Parker.  Neat, neat location.  More little county roads took us to "Of Pines and Prayers" in Brushy Creek where we saw 5 or 6 adorable little puppies, all of which I wanted to take home.  We found the box with no trouble and loved the view of the church on the top of the hill.  We made it out without being attacked by mama-dog, papa-dog, or sister-dog, and without puppy-napping any of the puppies (sigh).   Our last stop was "Little Bunny Fu Fu" in Malakoff, then we headed back to the Dairy Queen.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We arrived back in Mabank at 7:30 pm…12 full hours of boxing (plus drive time between our houses and the Dairy Queen).  We attempted 32 boxes.  I found 31 (1 was MIA), JBK found 5 (she had the other 26), and we got 2 hitchhikers (boxes, not people).   Miles - 267.7 (plus distances from our houses to the Dairy Queen).   We were both pretty worn out but it was a beautiful day and we had a great time.  Now we can start thinking about where to go next!</font></p>
