This was our ninth TALE, and as someone has already mentioned, they have gotten better each year. Lots of great memories are always made when we gather together. To all the out of state Boxers, thank-you for attending, and helping make this one to remember. I was very happy to hear a rumor that the Wild, Wild West Show was about to make it's appearance once again. I have not had the privilege of stamping in this one, and kept watching for clues to be posted. As I am now retired, I have the flexibility of picking up my back pack and racing off to retrieve it at a moments notice. I have found out from past experiences, that a moments hesitation can cost you that which you are looking for. It was so nice of (well, if you can him nice) The Ghost of Ira to share his boxer's with Baby Bear. The look on his face was priceless! Thanks Mosiac Butterfly and Silver Eagle for giving us yet another story to add to the legacy of Texas Letterboxing.<br/><br/>As most of you know, the hurricanes that came through Katrina, Rita,(2005) and Ike (2008) wiped out so many letterboxing in Jefferson, andÂ  Orange County as well as others as they swept their way North. There are a few boxes left pre-hurricane, but since that time, Boxers have been busy planting. In Orange, Lucky Libra has placed a couple of series that are fun and easy to get. Grumpy Grinch came through, and planted a box in Orange also. There is one at the Library in Orange that is awesome. Boots Tex and Silver Eagle each have active boxes here also. This is just my plug to say, this is a great place to box! Lots of fun things to do as well. I will be adding some boxes soon as well.<br/>Enough rambling, see ya on the trail!<br/>Blue Butterfly<br/></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>
