<br>
You can't image how glad I am to hear that someone...ANYONE...in <br>
Midland is letterboxing!<br>
<br>
My family is from Midland and I grew up there.  Last summer, with my <br>
husband working overseas, I took my kiddos to Midland for an <br>
extended vacation with Nana and Papa.  We toured Midland like we <br>
were "tourists" and I created several letterboxes to leave in <br>
Midland.  Knowing of no letterboxers in Midland, I contacted several <br>
West Texas geocachers to see if they would "adopt and maintain" my <br>
letterboxes, but never really got much commitment from them.<br>
<br>
Would you brother-in-law be interested in adopting and maintaining <br>
boxes if I planted them?  I should be traveling to that area <br>
sometime in April, and would be DELIGHTED to plant these boxes if I <br>
could know they would be well-tended.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Batty b<br>
