<br/>
You can't image how glad I am to hear that someone...ANYONE...in <br/>
Midland is letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
My family is from Midland and I grew up there.  Last summer, with my <br/>
husband working overseas, I took my kiddos to Midland for an <br/>
extended vacation with Nana and Papa.  We toured Midland like we <br/>
were "tourists" and I created several letterboxes to leave in <br/>
Midland.  Knowing of no letterboxers in Midland, I contacted several <br/>
West Texas geocachers to see if they would "adopt and maintain" my <br/>
letterboxes, but never really got much commitment from them.<br/>
<br/>
Would you brother-in-law be interested in adopting and maintaining <br/>
boxes if I planted them?  I should be traveling to that area <br/>
sometime in April, and would be DELIGHTED to plant these boxes if I <br/>
could know they would be well-tended.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Batty b<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I have a brother in <br/>
&gt; law in Midland who is into letterboxing and he has to travel a <br/>
&gt;long <br/>
&gt; way to find one.<br/>

&gt; "Wills World" is my son.  We're all new to letterboxing, but are <br/>
&gt; having a great time with it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Okay, so if El Lobo is your brother in law, how is Wills World <br/>
&gt; related<br/>
&gt; &gt; to you?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Batty b, I'm sure he would be glad to do that.  His letterboxing <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; name is El Lobo.  You can reach him on this site or I'll give <br/>
&gt; you <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his email address.  My wife, Lone Star Quilter, and I are also <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; native Midlanders until we moved to the Houston area about 15 <br/>
&gt; years <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ago.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Boots Tex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You can't image how glad I am to hear that <br/>
&gt; someone...ANYONE...in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Midland is letterboxing!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My family is from Midland and I grew up there.  Last summer, <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; husband working overseas, I took my kiddos to Midland for an <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extended vacation with Nana and Papa.  We toured Midland like <br/>
&gt; we <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were "tourists" and I created several letterboxes to leave in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Midland.  Knowing of no letterboxers in Midland, I contacted <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; several <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; West Texas geocachers to see if they would "adopt and <br/>
&gt; maintain" my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxes, but never really got much commitment from them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you brother-in-law be interested in adopting and <br/>
&gt; maintaining <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes if I planted them?  I should be traveling to that area <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometime in April, and would be DELIGHTED to plant these boxes <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could know they would be well-tended.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, Batty b<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I have a brother in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; law in Midland who is into letterboxing and he has to travel <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;long <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way to find one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome.<br/>
