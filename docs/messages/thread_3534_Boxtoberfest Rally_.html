                    <html><body><p>Good Afternoon,<br/><br/>RE Road Rallies: Of the time we have posted for the event on AQ,  I hoped to set it up so about half is hunting on the road rally and half is spent at the "secret place" where we can gather, eat and exchange.  I prefer not to award <b>points for time </b>because I don't want to promote people racing around the city of Austin.  There will however need to be some time <b>limits</b> , so if someone gets lost, can't break the code for the secret venue etc.<br/>
<br/>I still have some doubts about having a road rally because they are not "kid friendly,"  Even though our kids are grown I don't want to alienate anyone, especially out-of-towners.  On the flip side I logged a query out into the AQ board and our group and have had a <b>wonderful </b>outpouring of ideas from LOTS of nice people around the country, several of whom have hosted a similar event and sent me <b>all</b> there information including clues!<br/>
<br/>It appears the Gunslinger Sweethearts need to meet again soon, unfortunately I am traveling on business starting Tues and will only return periodically until May 21, when (hopefully)  I get to stay home for a good long while.<br/>
<br/>Kind Regards,<br/>Cancan<br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Sat, May 3, 2008 at 3:19 PM, Abbie Beck &lt;<a href="mailto:abbiembeck@sbcglobal.net" target="_blank">abbiembeck@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt; wrote:<br/><blockquote>
