<br/>
As for finding caches... well, not with the GPS unit but I have found <br/>
two to date! I mainly want to use it to hike unknown trails, drive <br/>
around to all these great boxes where I am completely unfamiliar... <br/>
and in my own plants. My "A Walk Through Middle Earth" series box #4 <br/>
has a cache in it's area but I REALLY wanted to plant there and only <br/>
discovered this info after my lovely Toad's adventure -who's back <br/>
BTW! So I just went to the area and looked in the "obvious" place and <br/>
sure enough! Then I headed in the other direction and found a nice <br/>
little niche for Samwise -FAR away! =) <br/>
<br/>
I DO hope I'm able to get this GPS figured out soon though so I can <br/>
take it on an adventure! <br/>
<br/>
- King Beeloved LOVES the backpack/carrier he got for Christmas! <br/>
Thanks for the recomendation MO5! -Now to get the littlest cha cha <br/>
interested =)<br/>

Merry Christmas to all!!! <br/>

&gt; I have the Garmin 60CS. I admit I haven't gotten to everything it <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; on it... which is ALOT. But I've played with the compass and see a <br/>
&gt; problem. How do I get the pointer arrow? For some reason when I go <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the menu for that page the first three options aren't clickable?! <br/>
&gt; (Sight 'N Go, Stop Navigation, and Recalculate)I can't figure out <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; this previous owner set it to block that. I've looked through the <br/>
&gt; manuals but haven't found the answer yet. -I have calibrated it <br/>
&gt; though. (-two turns and all) Hmmm. that's just off the top of my <br/>
&gt; frazzled, sugar induced, miss-firing gray matter. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've come to the conclusion I need to get the City Navigator <br/>
software <br/>
&gt; extra. THe maps that it comes with seem too basic. -Or I just <br/>
haven't <br/>
&gt; figured that part out yet. That will have to be something I invest <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; after the post-Christmas crazies die down! -If anyone sees any <br/>
deals <br/>
&gt; on Garmin software while they are out and about LET ME KNOW!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll check it out in more detail and take you up on that offer of <br/>
&gt; advice once I really know specifics. Thanks BTW! I've been bummed <br/>
&gt; with having a new "toy" and have yet to take it out to test drive. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; just know it's going to be a great tool once I know how to use it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, I have parts of it figured out and parts of it are still <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; frustrating to me! Being second hand, I'm trying to put it all <br/>
&gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to the defaults so I can learn my own preferances! It's proving <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; bit <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more than I'd bargained for but I am directionally challenged <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; &gt; this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; does not surprise me! Plus I've had the biggest distraction.. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CHRISTMAS =) to deal with so I haven't really given it my <br/>
&gt; &gt; undivided. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I CAN say with confidance that I know which end is up! =)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for finding caches... well, not with the GPS unit but I have found <br/>
&gt; two to date! I mainly want to use it to hike unknown trails, drive <br/>
&gt; around to all these great boxes where I am completely unfamiliar... <br/>
&gt; and in my own plants. My "A Walk Through Middle Earth" series box #4 <br/>
&gt; has a cache in it's area but I REALLY wanted to plant there and only <br/>
&gt; discovered this info after my lovely Toad's adventure -who's back <br/>
&gt; BTW! So I just went to the area and looked in the "obvious" place and <br/>
&gt; sure enough! Then I headed in the other direction and found a nice <br/>
&gt; little niche for Samwise -FAR away! =) <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I DO hope I'm able to get this GPS figured out soon though so I can <br/>
&gt; take it on an adventure! <br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, I have parts of it figured out and parts of it are still <br/>
&gt; &gt; frustrating to me! Being second hand, I'm trying to put it all <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; &gt; to the defaults so I can learn my own preferances! It's proving a <br/>
bit <br/>
&gt; &gt; more than I'd bargained for but I am directionally challenged so <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; &gt; does not surprise me! Plus I've had the biggest distraction.. <br/>
&gt; &gt; CHRISTMAS =) to deal with so I haven't really given it my <br/>
undivided. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I CAN say with confidance that I know which end is up! =)<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As for finding caches... well, not with the GPS unit but I have <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; &gt; two to date! I mainly want to use it to hike unknown trails, <br/>
drive <br/>
&gt; &gt; around to all these great boxes where I am completely <br/>
unfamiliar... <br/>
&gt; &gt; and in my own plants. My "A Walk Through Middle Earth" series box <br/>
#4 <br/>
&gt; &gt; has a cache in it's area but I REALLY wanted to plant there and <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; &gt; discovered this info after my lovely Toad's adventure -who's back <br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW! So I just went to the area and looked in the "obvious" place <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; sure enough! Then I headed in the other direction and found a <br/>
nice <br/>
&gt; &gt; little niche for Samwise -FAR away! =) <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I DO hope I'm able to get this GPS figured out soon though so I <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; &gt; take it on an adventure! <br/>

<p>Ok. I know I have 5 satellites that are locked on and two more up <br/>there 
  somewhere! I might not have it in navagation mode. I am soooo <br/>sorry to 
  leave the conversation last night. You've been so helpful! <br/>I've been 
  nursing two babies who came down with 104.6 degree <br/>temperatures on 
  Christmas morning! I've gotten the fever's down to <br/>102 but they still are 
  pretty miserable. It doesn't look like I'll be <br/>able to play much on here 
  or figure anything out with the GPS today. <br/>I'll get back with you in a day 
  or two after these kiddos are over <br/>this crud. Thank you SO much for this 
  info! I see the light at the <br/>end of the tunnel with someone helping me 
  figure this out. I keep <br/>thinking it wouldn't be so bad if the previous 
  owner didn't have it <br/>set up to his preferences.<wbr/>.. which may be wrong 
  of me to think.. But <br/>I'm having to figure out what he's done first before 
  I can really <br/>decide how I want everything. And there is ALOT on this 
  mechine! -<br/>that and I am new to the consept of GPS! I can't wait to take it 
  out <br/>on the bike trails though! My husband and I used to mountain bike and 
  <br/>hike all the time before our kiddos, and the little ones are just now 
  <br/>getting to a point where they can put on some mileage so we're really 
  <br/>looking forward to taking this GPS out and find some new 
  trails!<br/><br/>~QB<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>,

  - we will work through this.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; OK - lets back up. How many 
  satellites are you getting locked in? <br/>You must<br/>&gt; have at least a 2-D 
  fix before you can site-n-go. This requires at <br/>least 4<br/>&gt; satellites 
  with a steady lock. If you are working indoors and <br/>cannot get at<br/>&gt; 
  least 3 satellites to lock, it will not work.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Also, the 
  compass page will not show you a compass arrow unless you <br/>have<br/>&gt; 
  some navigation function working. This means you must have <br/>selected 
  a<br/>&gt; waypoint to "GOTO" before you get an arrow, or invoke a site-n-go 
  <br/>to get an<br/>&gt; arrow.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I just pulled mine out and tried 
  it. It would do nothing without <br/>at least 3<br/>&gt; satellites locked. Once 
  I got a 2-D fix, site-n-go works.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I need to get to bed - got 
  to be in the shop at 0500. But I will <br/>work with<br/>&gt; you until you get 
  it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike - KD9KC.<br/>&gt;

  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; No. I haven't removed batteries yet. I keep looking through 
  the <br/>book <br/>&gt; and don't see anything for this either. And it's my 
  first GPS so I <br/>am <br/>&gt; absolutley clueless!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
