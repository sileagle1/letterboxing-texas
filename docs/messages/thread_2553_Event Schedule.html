                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have updated the Event website with a rough schedule.  It is meant to <br>
be a guide to activites and is not cast in stone.  Thanks to Sandibox <br>
and Barefoot Lucy for volunteering to give Logbook and Dremel <br>
demonstrations, respectively.  I allocated 30 minutes for each, but if <br>
you need more time that should be no problem.  The lunch will be <br>
potluck, so if you want to participate be sure to bring food to share.  <br>
Baby Bear & I will bring the usual chili and bowls & spoons.  Everyone <br>
should bring their own drinks.  Somebody should bring paper plates and <br>
plastic forks if needed.  Here is the website, which is also in the <br>
