                    <div class="plaintext-content">While I was adding the subterfuge clause to one of my boxes, a <br/>
thought occurred.  Any of you coming to find these boxes would be <br/>
strangers to Victoria, coming from many miles away.  You may want to <br/>
know a little about my town. You may wonder what else there is to <br/>
do. You may be hungry.  What to do?<br/>
<br/>
To make your letterboxing excursions to my little town as pleasant <br/>
as possible, I added a guide to Victoria to my webpage and linked it <br/>
to all my boxes.  It has my favorite local resturaunts that are in <br/>
close proximity to each box.  That way, you won't have to suffer a <br/>
pre-cooked McMeal.  <br/>
<br/>
It also has a very brief history of Victoria, and I will add other <br/>
places of interest that do not have a box nearby, in case you want <br/>
to hang out around town (and maybe place your own box).  Please <br/>
consult at your leasure before any Victoria day trips you may have.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought this would be a good idea to share with everyone.  <br/>
Most of us not in Houston, (Lucky B***ards!) are not familiar with <br/>
the areas we box in and clues to things other than area boxes would <br/>
make a welcome addition.<br/>

things (not just letterboxing) as we go.  <br/>
<br/>
I personally would like to place a box in Victoria in memory of one of <br/>
my dearest friends who was born and raised there and who had deep <br/>
roots in that community.  This fall will be two years since she died <br/>
of breast cancer (leaving 3 children under 7) so that would be a <br/>
perfect (and cooler) time to place a box.  I don't know the town at <br/>
all, and I'd appreciate being steered toward good plantable parks.<br/>

hiding spots.  Ethyl Lee Tracy Park has a lot of brush, but it's not <br/>
as big. There's quite a few block sized parks, but those two are the <br/>
main ones.<br/>
   I'd be happy to take care of whatever box you decide to plant.  <br/>
Maybe we could even do a swap.<br/>
