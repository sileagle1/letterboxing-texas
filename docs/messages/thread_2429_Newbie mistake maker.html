 Whoa whoa whoa - easy people.<br>
  <br>
 I am just an outsider.  I have no horse in this race.  So please <br>
let me try<br>
 to smooth over the ruffled feathers.<br>
  <br>
 I am not one of the lucky ones either.  I was not born a <br>
letterboxer.  In<br>
 fact, I spent a number of years as a GEOCACHER <GASP> before I ever <br>
heard of<br>
 letterboxing.<br>
  <br>
 I too have tried to be the best letterboxer I can be.  I have taken <br>
in a box<br>
 that was nearly washed away in the El Paso floods.  I have replaced <br>
boxes<br>
 for owners of ones stolen.  And I have planted a few.  Of course, <br>
who can<br>
 forget the EXTENSIVE searches for Hueco Tanks - I <recovered and <br>
soon to be<br>
 replaced> and Hueco Tanks - II <never found -<br>
 http://www.photoshow.net/KD9KC/adventure >.<br>
  <br>
 Have I made mistakes?  Heh heh heh - sometimes I wonder how I <br>
survived 20<br>
 years of soldiering.  My parachutes always opened, and the bullets <br>
always<br>
 missed me.  And somehow - my bullets mostly found the target.  My <br>
one<br>
 aircraft accident I walked away from.  Other than being nearly deaf <br>
in one<br>
 ear from an AT-4 and a back injury kept in check by exercise, I was <br>
lucky.<br>
  <br>
 So whats my point?  Just THIS.<br>
  <br>
 Who on this list was born letterboxing?  If you were not, you too <br>
were once<br>
 a newbie.  Who on this list never made a mistake?  Even made a snap-<br>
judgment<br>
 that you regretted later?  If you have - welcome to the club.  We <br>
have a lot<br>
 of members.<br>
  <br>
 What has been done here that cannot be fixed?  We have some people <br>
upset<br>
 about their boxes.  From the report, they were trashed before being <br>
found.<br>
 We have some boxes destroyed and needing to be replaced.  And we <br>
have a<br>
 newbie who was excited about boxing and when faced with a situation <br>
made a<br>
 snap judgment to try and help.  A newbie who is now ready to pack <br>
it in and<br>
 quit over trying to be nice.<br>
  <br>
 Can we all just take a step back - and take a deep breathe - and <br>
admit maybe<br>
 some mistakes were made all around?  A little mentoring.  A little <br>
box<br>
 repair.  A little "I'm sorry" too.<br>
  <br>
 Hey PutpleInTex - come letterbox in El Paso.  I won't bite.<br>
  <br>
 The rest of you - Happy New Year.<br>
