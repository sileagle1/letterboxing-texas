Wilderness Park in San Antonio requesting me to remove<br>
this box and the clues from LBNA.  They were nice about<br>
it and their reasons were sound (off-trail paths to boxes<br>
cause damage and disturb wildlife) so I will comply.  <br>
Instead of removing the clues, I will probably convert it<br>
to an Online Box, where you can use my modified clues to<br>
still enjoy the park (though not off-trail), but instead<br>
of a physical box, you can print the stamp image and log<br>
your find on my webpage.  I have done this before with<br>
some of my other boxes, and even though it is not quite the<br>
same as finding a real box, at least it introduces people<br>
to some great places while letting them log a "Find" of sorts.<br>
I call it Online since Virtual has already been used and<br>
means something else.<br>
<br>
As far as the box goes, I will not be able to remove it any<br>
time soon, so if you want to get it, be sure to print the<br>
clues now before I change them, and go in the next month or so.<br>
