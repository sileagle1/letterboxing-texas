Georgetown called "To Hell and Back".  This box hadn't been found in <br/>
over a year and has been attempted 3 times.  I tagged it as "missing" <br/>
last March, I believe.  She was looking for LSQ's box, "Square Dance" <br/>
and found mine in the same general area.  Since she wasn't looking for <br/>
it, and didn't have the clues, she put it back where she found it.  <br/>
When we're down that way for the TALE event, we plan to go by and try <br/>
to find it and rehide it.  The clues will be updated at that time.  <br/>
Thanks to Pathfinder, and lost box has been found.<br/>
