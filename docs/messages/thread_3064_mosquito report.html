<div>Hey Boots Tex!  
First, I am glad everything worked out at Mercer.  You may have to change 
your trail name to "The Ambassador".  Thanks for being such a great 
representative for us all!  Second, I was wondering if you could give us a 
mosquito report on Mercer.  Dewberry and I are considering a trip out 
there, but if they are really bad right now we may wait a bit.  My two year 
old has real issues with mosquitoes (and with may other things as well :)  
Thanks for any info you can give!  MO5</div></body></html>

<div>Thanks, Boots!  I 
actually am sort of fascinated by those yellow garden spiders.  And I 
really like them, because once they start appearing, it isn't too much longer 
before the cool weather shows up!  MO5</div>
