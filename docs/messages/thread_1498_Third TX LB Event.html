have our next Event on Saturday, 03/18/06 in the NE<br>

We can discuss details when we get closer to the date.<br>
Sorry to all that voted for other regions and/or dates,<br>
but hopefully you can make it anyway.  The good news is<br>
that sooner or later we will have the Event in the other<br>
Regions.  Also, next year Daylight Savings will occur<br>
earlier in March, so we will get more daylight without<br>
moving the Event into April.  Thanks for your participation.<br>

thrilled to have the event in my area so we can show<br>

everyone an opportunity to see how letterboxing has<br>
really grown up here in East Texas in the past year or<br>
so!  But on the other hand, Im a little bummed<br>
because it means we dont get to go out and explore<br>
somewhere weve never been!<br>
<br>
All you fine East Texas boxers, yall hear it  Silver<br>
Eagle may be hosting the event, but its up to us to<br>
help him make this a blow out event!  <br>

For grins, here is a list of train-themed songs.  Lots of fun ideas <br>
