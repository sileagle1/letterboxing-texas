<div>Boots,  definitely "unretire" the boxes and attach the explanations you just shared to the original clues.

Looks like a route we could take back home in the spring from NM.  It's always worth a slightly longer drive for a Boots Tex box.<br/>

We just had baby 4 a few weeks ago.  So the Children of the Forest are slowly taking over the forest. 
<br/>
<br/>
Do you remember what size lock n lock it would need?   I'll be sure to bring one in case we get to stop.
