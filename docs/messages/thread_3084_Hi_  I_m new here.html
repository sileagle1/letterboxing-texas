year with a handful of clues and only found 1 box. As<br/>
far as the rain is concerned, we went to Grapvine and<br/>

and around the lake. I've also been keeping up with<br/>
alot of the comments from this yahoo group and found<br/>
that there are some that were lost but others are<br/>

<div>Thank you for taking a few minutes to introduce yourself, Kerry. I know what you mean about not letterboxing much this summer since it went straight from the monsoon season to intense heat. But now it seems like the perfect weather in the north Texas area for letterboxing, so I hope you and your family have fun and success. I think I've indicated in my clues which of my boxes in the DFW area were unavailable due to floods. Since the water has been receding, some of my boxes are available again so I took the "unavailable" tag off those, but will leave the others marked unavailable until I get a chance to check on them. Unfortunately, it is the nature of the game that some boxes will go missing, and there is not always a prize at the end of the rainbow, but hopefully, when planters realize their boxes are missing, they will mark them accordingly. I don't want to sound "preachy" here, but if you look for a box and can't find it, you <em>might</em> be looking in the wrong place, or it may in fact actually be missing, but the chances are that those clues led you to some really neat place you've never been before. To me, that's the best part about letterboxing. Happy hunting, and welcome to the group. Glad to have another boxer in the DFW area!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I figured that weather plays a big role in letterboxing.  Be it too<br/>
hot, too buggy or too wet to let us get to the boxes.  The trip to<br/>
Granbury was great for us.  It helped me teach Z that winning isn't<br/>
everything.  He spent lots of time play with rocks and throwing stuff<br/>
into the water and the ice cream cones made his day.  I haven't given<br/>
up on these boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm currently assuming that we were way off or missing something in<br/>
the clues.  That's why I took pictures.  This way the planter can tell<br/>
me for sure that we were in the wrong spot or looking under the wrong<br/>
tree or wait! Half the bank is gone where I planted the box.  The fun<br/>
part is that we could always go back.<br/>
<br/>
My biggest problem at this point is training the kid.  I still don't<br/>
feel comfortable with his subterfuge abilities, so there are many<br/>
boxes that I wouldn't even think about trying.  Yesterday was<br/>
entertaining.  I purposely dressed us in out of state tshirts so we<br/>
could act like silly northerners.  Then we reduced our kit to a couple<br/>
of index cards, a pen and a small ink pad.  Z suggested that we use<br/>
our fingerprints, because it was faster than pulling out stamps.  I<br/>
think the fact that we were there in the afternoon, just before school<br/>
got out, helped because we were pretty much alone in the parks.  We're<br/>
not ready for Downtown Dallas, but I think we don't have to only go to<br/>
secluded parks.  :)<br/>
