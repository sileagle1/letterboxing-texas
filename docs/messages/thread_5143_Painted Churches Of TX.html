A few weeks ago I saw an article in the paper about a new book showcasing TX architecture and the sample picture showed an old iron bridge that looked really cool.  I decided I wanted to see the bridge if at all possible, so I read further to see where it was.  Turns out it is just outside the small town of Dubina and it is called the Piano bridge because it used to make musical sounds when crossed by wagons.  It also said it was on the road between two of the famous Painted Churches of Texas, so now I was really interested. I had heard of the churches a few years ago and thought about visiting but never got around to it, so this article served as a wake-up call for me to quit procrastinating. I also decided that if I was going to visit then y'all should too, so I started carving and planned a trip to put boxes at several of them.  I completed the trip this weekend and posted the clues today so they are ready for you to see.  I visited 5 of them and they were all beautiful inside.  Oh, and I did cross that bridge after placing a box underneath.<br>
<br>
For more into on the churches you can see my clues or look them up.  Most are around the Schulenburg area which is not too far from TALE 10, so you could see them before or after the Event.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Silver Eagle. These churches are indeed wonderful. I took my parens there several years ago, then their siblings as they visited. Always ending with a stop at Elgin for BBQ! But those were BLB days (Before LetterBoxing). Your boxes are an excuse to return.d And bluebonnet season is best time to go! Altho any time to hunt for boxes works too!<br>
