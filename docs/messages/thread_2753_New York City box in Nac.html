<br>
Thanks to everyone who has looked for Random's New<br>
York City box in Nac and has rehidden it so carefully.<br>
 We went to check on it today and it is STILL there --<br>
over a year so far!   The log book was full, so I am<br>
fixing that up this morning, so there will be more<br>
empty pages for whoever comes next.  Thanks for being<br>
such a fun group of people, who demonstrate the idea<br>
that "fun" does not have to mean "irresponsible and<br>
destructive".  I appreciate you all very much (and<br>
letterboxing, too).<br>

                    <html><body><p>Lightning and I had a good time going after that box the first time, and we had a good time watching the folks we were with find it the second time.  When we went the second time, there was a soccer game going on just feet from the box, so it was a lot of fun trying to cover for the person getting the box.  This one is a good example of a box that requires some subterfuge at times but that isn't foolishly placed so it is too difficult to get without discovery.
