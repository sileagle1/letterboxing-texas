                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got two emails today from the Ranger at Dinosaur Valley State Park.  They were about my two boxes there, Digging Up Bones and Howling at the Moon, which is an old box that I adopted from DrooP.  Both of them were permitted in the summer of 2009, but expired after a year and were never renewed.  He had the old permit for Howling at the Moon, but didn't have the old permit for the other one (I do have a copy).  Lone Star Quilter has a box there, too, but he didn't mention it. That makes me wonder how he even knew about my two boxes.  I answered him asking what I needed to do and pointed out that the new combination permit forms don't say anything about expiration after a year and asked if that would apply to old boxes.  I'll wait to see what he says.<br>

First off I am treating all the letterboxes and the geocaches in our park equally, asking them all to renew or fill out a permit. I do have your permit for howling moon but it doesn't say that it is for digging up bones as well. I will make a note on it so that we know this. I am not real sure what the policy is with TPWD, but I know that in our park when it comes to geocach or letterbox or any other types of these things, we want to permit them so that we know exactly where each one is as to make sure that it doesn't interfere with any cultural or natural resources.  We do not mind having this things(letterbox/geocach) in our park, in fact it helps us bring in customers, but we just need to make sure that they are in places where people will not get hurt or disturb anything of importance.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">His title is Maintenance Specialist III, which is low man on the totem pole.  He does everything from mowing and picking up trash to cleaning restrooms, so he's probably been assigned to look for letterboxes and geocaches and make sure they're permitted.  He's probably new to the job, so chances are he really doesn't know TPWD policies, he's just following directions from the park superintendent.  I just wish the park policies were consistent so we would know what to expect.  <br>
