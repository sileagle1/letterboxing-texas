We went out to Jesse Jones Park and tried to find some boxes we had a <br/>
50% result.<br/>
<br/>
We found - big bug and Hills are alive, both we great places for kids <br/>
to take a break and have some fun.<br/>
<br/>
Can't find - Sstep ssafely -- you can see that there was a path with <br/>
the weeds stepped down on - but no box.<br/>
Gator Gazer -- I am not sure if we were in the right spot, there was a <br/>
couple of splits in trail, one by the pond with a bench, we search the <br/>
fallen tree to the right and nothing -- went farther up and search all <br/>
over that area where the pavement meets the sand, a couple of fallen <br/>
trees , or course they seemed a little more then a few paces from the <br/>
path -- no luck -- I am thinking that perhaps they cleared they tree, <br/>
because there was a clear spot you can tell.  I am really not sure.<br/>
<br/>
Still had a great time.   ANITA<br/>
