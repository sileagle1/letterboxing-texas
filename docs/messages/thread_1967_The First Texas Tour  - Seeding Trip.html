additional side notes of the early days of Texas Letterboxing, and a <br>
history of Silver Eagle and my (Baby Bear) first trip to seed boxes <br>
around the state.<br>
<br>
* My first finds were all out of state letterboxes, in Washington, <br>
New Mexico and Colorado.<br>
* My oldest surviving "original" letter box is "Old 300" placed <br>
12/08/02 at Stephen F. Austin State Historical Park.<br>
* My first Placed box was actually put in LA, "Cypress Bend" - it is <br>
gone.<br>
* My second box, "Texas Birth" is my oldest named box still around, <br>
but had to be replaced once. Originally placed 11/16/02, and replace <br>
the next year.<br>
<br>
<br>
The First Trip - 2 days (1/30/03 - 1/31/03)<br>
<br>
Silver Eagle and I headed out from Cypress, up I-45 to Huntsville.  <br>
We stopped at the statue for Sam Houston, and I placed "The Raven".  <br>
This box is now gone (state prisoners clean the area, and was picked <br>
up by guards worried about drugs being left for prisoners).  We then <br>
heading to Sam Houston's home, where Silver Eagle placed "Steamboat <br>
Sam".  After quit side trip to cemetery to see Sam's grave, we <br>
headed up to Crockett and I place "Davy Crockett" box at Davy <br>
Crockett Springs (box recently reported still in place).  On to <br>
Weches, and Mission Tejas S.P.   We each placed boxes here, "Tejas" <br>
and "Spanish Flag".  On to Alto, and Caddoan Mounds SHP.  I <br>
placed "Stone Celt", which is now gone.  Next was Rusk, and Jim Hogg <br>
SHP, where I placed "Hogg", which is still in place.  On to Rusk <br>
S.P. and Silver Eagle placed "Texas State RR" (replaced since).  <br>
Next came Palestine S.P., and I placed Texas Dogwood (gone).  East <br>
to Old Fort Parker in Mexia, and I placed "Comanche" box (which I <br>
had to replace later, and has gone missing again).  On to <br>
Confederate Reunion Grounds SHP and we each placed boxes, "Val Verde <br>
Cannon" (has been replaced) and "Confederate Flag".  Then to Waco, <br>
and the Texas Ranger Hall of Fame, where we each placed boxes <br>
("Texas Ranger #1" and "Baylor Bear" - both went missing, and were <br>
replaced in other locations).  North to Mother Neff S.P. and I <br>
placed "Horned Owl", which went missing and has been replaced <br>
by "Horned Owl #2".  On to Belton, where we finally had a chance to <br>
find boxes.  We found "4ID" at Chalk Ridge Falls as it was getting <br>
dark (yes we had done all of this on 1/30/03).<br>
<br>
The next morning we found "Dana's Peak", "Mama Turtle", "Baby <br>
Turtle", and "Patriotic Pug" all at Harker Heights.  Now we went to <br>
Bend, and Colorado Bend S.P. and found the 6 boxes ("Six Flags over <br>
Texas") and I placed "Guadelupe Bass" (gone).  On to Austin, where <br>
after wasting an hour trying to figure out the clues we finally <br>
found "Barbed wire & the Galopagos of Texas".   Then back to Houston.<br>
<br>
Not to many placing, as at that time we did not want to put boxes <br>
anywhere close to another one of our boxes, and we were still fairly <br>
new at carving stamps.  We then began doing weekend trips to other <br>
areas to place boxes in parks we liked.<br>
<br>
Our 2003 Trip along the Lewis and Clark route from Missouri to North <br>
Dakota is were we found and placed more than ever before.<br>
<br>
Okay, that's enough for one day. Thanks for your interest in our <br>
journeys!<br>
