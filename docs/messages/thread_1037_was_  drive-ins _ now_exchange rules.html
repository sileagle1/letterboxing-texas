                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is a little different than a usual series.  In this format, one <br>
letterboxer carves the stamp and creates the box and another <br>
letterboxer places it in his/her city or town and then serves as <br>
a "foster parent"--doing maintenance as need be.  The idea is to <br>
give boxers in one part of the state (or country) the opportunity to <br>
enjoy stamp images from letterboxers whose boxes they may not <br>
otherwise be able to find.  The Drive-in theme may not work with <br>
this, but at this point we're just brainstorming.<br>
<br>
The point is to have fun with it and to get to know other boxers a <br>
little better.  <br>
