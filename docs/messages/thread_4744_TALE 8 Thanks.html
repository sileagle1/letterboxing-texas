<div>SandiBox, I want you to know that I am now the proud owner of the April 
1998 Smithsonian Magazine which you so generously donated to the TALE8 
raffle.  My husband, Whiz Gee, gallantly bought it for me from the raffle 
winner, a startled Pocahontas (daughter of Spyker and KerrMark), who had no idea 
that a grownup would pay that much for an old magazine!  (Then again, 
someone just paid $1.1 million for a comic book.)  I treasure it.  
Since I have never had a personal traveler stamp, I am considering carving the 
cover for my personal traveler, with the clue being, “What did my husband 
purchase for me after the TALE8 raffle?”  Wish you could have been 
there!  And thanks for the treasure!  -- Bell Motel</div>

<div>SandiBox, I want you to know that I am now the proud owner of the April 
1998 Smithsonian Magazine which you so generously donated to the TALE8 
raffle.  My husband, Whiz Gee, gallantly bought it for me from the raffle 
winner, a startled Pocahontas (daughter of Spyker and KerrMark), who had no idea 
that a grownup would pay that much for an old magazine!  (Then again, 
someone just paid $1.1 million for a comic book.)  I treasure it.  
Since I have never had a personal traveler stamp, I am considering carving the 
cover for my personal traveler, with the clue being, What did my husband 
purchase for me after the TALE8 raffle?  Wish you could have been 
there!  And thanks for the treasure!  -- Bell Motel</div>

You Texas Letterboxers sure know how to make an out-of-stater feel welcome. Thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for a great event and thanks to all of you for planting such great boxes to find. I am hoping I can make it back next year.<br/>

&gt; Well, another TALE has come and gone and I hope everyone enjoyed it; I know I did.  Thankfully, nobody went to the hospital this year and I hope everyone made it home safely.  I want to thank everyone for helping make it a success, but especially the following:  Open Space for going to the Ranger Office and booking the warm Activity Center for us to use, Sandibox for donating the Smithsonian Magazine for the raffle, Boots Tex &amp; Lone Star Quilter for bringing the copy machine and several nice table boxes, and Blue Butterfly &amp; Lucy Lockett for another creative way of passing on the TX Traveling Circus.  I also want to thank everyone that donated raffle prizes.  We hope to do it again and bring even better prizes next year.  Also thanks to Bell Motel for making eagle &amp; bear treats.  They were great to look at and even better to eat, though I felt like a cannibal :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have posted pictures from the Native Feast Event dinner and 8th TX Event in the Photos section of this list:<br/>

That Whiz Gee is a great guy!  I'm glad that you are enjoying the magazine.   I'm fortunate to have a copy of my own and treasure it as well.   Although the original magazine can difficult to come by, reprints of the "We Live and Breathe Letterboxing" article are easily accessible online.   I hope every letterboxer has a chance to read it and learn more about the history of our hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
