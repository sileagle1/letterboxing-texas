She was having problems with an especially difficult one. I said I would go back to my desk and work on it. I attempted to solve it FOR AN HOUR. I gave up (for now) and looked at some other virtuals. I solved a couple. Then, I got trapped into another one FOR OVER 15 MINUTES. At that point, I walked away from my computer.<br/><br/>Last night, pretty much the same scenario. But, this time, some chewing out to Wermbo. I actually had a headache on a couple of those virtuals. <br/><br/>All the virtuals I had done in the past were simple. Read clue, google answer,
 plug in answer, solve. I actually thought all virtuals were that easy. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>So, today as I was thinking about those two unsolved virtuals I had a duh moment. It happens.<br/><br/>If I can do virtuals (besides those two nasty ones) I can probably attempt mystery clues. So, I'm going to dive in. What's the worst that can happen? I could actually solve some or I could go crazy and get put in a loony bin. Is that so bad? I hear you get fed 3 times a day and you get to wear your pajamas all day. <br/><br/>So, seeing as how nothing catastrophic could go wrong. I'm going to do it.<br/><br/>Wish me luck,<br/>Janet, BF<br/><br/><b><i>Maribeth Jagger &lt;cjagger405@earthlin<wbr/>k.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:   <blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div></div> <div> <div>Oh how I want to hop in my car and come right down there and look for these!!!!
