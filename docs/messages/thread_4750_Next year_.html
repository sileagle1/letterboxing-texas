<br/>
Nothing but a picture of him photographing a bull at the Houston Rodeo!!!<br/>
<br/>
My comment was Darn and you went without ME???  Now all I can hope is that Silver Eagle picks somewhere near to Houston side of the state and I can sneak away for both!!!<br/>
<br/>
Glad you all had fun.  Missed you but can only hope for next year.  Right now we just got out this week for a day...then it was 3 days of rain and one of snow!!  Whew we can't seem to get rid of winter this year.<br/>
