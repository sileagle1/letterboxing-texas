<div>I love the story with the clues!  I'm curious though, since Bear on a Tear requires that finders email you for clues, why did you decide to go ahead and post the clues for this one?  Do you think the situation in Huntsville has changed so that it is more amenable now to boxes?  Just wondering - no inside knowledge on my part.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Whoops!  thanks Lucy, good point.  A couple of years<br>
ago when we visited the park ALL the boxes were<br>
missing!  So Bear On A Tear is no big secret, I send<br>
out the clues to anyone who asks.  Just once did I<br>
decline as the folks had no AQ or LBNA profile.  Maybe<br>
I will do the same with the new  box.... Huntsville SP<br>
is beautiful, I'm surprised there aren't more boxes. <br>
Not sure what the  problem is..????<br>
So if you think you might go soon copy the clues asap<br>
or email me later.  Nor<br>
