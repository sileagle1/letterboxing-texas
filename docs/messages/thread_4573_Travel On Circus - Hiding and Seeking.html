                    <html><body><div>That circus. Well. Not much more to say.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A debate has been raging here in Jacksonvillefor the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my house. It seems the clowns have decided they are thesmartest membersof the circus. Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company disagrees. As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact that clowns go to college. Clown College. The first clown college was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron Morris. You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>As we were driving through town early this morning, they had a better than usual view of their surroundings because I couldn't tolerate them in my van anymore so I tied them to the bumper instead. In the course of our meanderings, we happened to pass the rodeo grounds and that's where this debate began. It seems the circus clowns also think they aresmarter than rodeo clowns and they boisterously proclaimed that - as the rodeo clowns were practicing. As you can imagine, the rodeo clowns disagreed and they jumped on their horses and followed us in hot pursuit with their little water pistols drawn.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Aminivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly. I decided I couldn't risk being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind their manners or be revealed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And now fora bit of twistedhappenstance- as we were trying to hide from the rodeo clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were. Lon Morris College. Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found ourselves to the original clown college. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational Center on Peeples Street. They are hidden in a group of bushes next to the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec Center.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why was this wicked? Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns. So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college? Can they beat the rodeo clowns? Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?</div>
<div></div>
<div>In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys. </div>

<div>A minivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly.  I decided I couldn't risk being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind their manners or be revealed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now for a bit of twisted happenstance <wbr/>- as we were trying to hide from the rodeo clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were.  Lon Morris College.  Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found ourselves to the original clown college.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational Center on Peeples Street.  They are hidden in a group of bushes next to the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Why was this wicked?  Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns.  So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college?  Can they beat the rodeo clowns?  Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys.  </div>

&gt; That circus.  Well.  Not much more to say.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; A debate has been raging here in Jacksonville for the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my house.  It seems the clowns have decided they are the smartest members of the circus.  Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company disagrees.  As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact that clowns go to college.  Clown College.  The first clown college was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron Morris.  You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.<br/>

Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns.  So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college?  Can they beat the rodeo clowns?  Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?<br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys.  <br/>

<div>
<div>That circus.  Well.  Not much more to say.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A debate has been raging here in Jacksonville  for the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my house.  It seems the clowns have decided they are the smartest members of the circus.  Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company disagrees.  As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact that clowns go to college.  Clown College.  The first clown college was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron Morris.  You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we were driving through town early this morning, they had a better than usual view of their surroundings because I couldn't tolerate them in my van anymore so I tied them to the bumper instead.  In the course of our meanderings, we happened to pass the rodeo grounds and that's where this debate began.  It seems the circus clowns also think they are smarter than rodeo clowns and they boisterously proclaimed that - as the rodeo clowns were practicing.  As you can imagine, the rodeo clowns disagreed and they jumped on their horses and followed us in hot pursuit with their little water pistols drawn.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A minivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly.  I decided I couldn't risk being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind their manners or be revealed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now for a bit of twisted happenstance  - as we were trying to hide from the rodeo clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were.  Lon Morris College.  Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found ourselves to the original clown college.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational Center on Peeples Street.  They are hidden in a group of bushes next to the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Why was this wicked?  Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns.  So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college?  Can they beat the rodeo clowns?  Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys.  </div>

<div>That circus. Well. Not much more to say.</div>
<div></div>
<div>A debate has been raging here in Jacksonville for the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my house. It seems the clowns have decided they are thesmartest membersof the circus. Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company disagrees. As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact that clowns go to college. Clown College. The first clown college was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron Morris. You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.</div>

<div>As we were driving through town early this morning, they had a better than usual view of their surroundings because I couldn't tolerate them in my van anymore so I tied them to the bumper instead. In the course of our meanderings, we happened to pass the rodeo grounds and that's where this debate began. It seems the circus clowns also think they aresmarter than rodeo clowns and they boisterously proclaimed that - as the rodeo clowns were practicing. As you can imagine, the rodeo clowns disagreed and they jumped on their horses and followed us in hot pursuit with their little water pistols drawn.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Aminivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly. I decided I couldn't risk being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind their manners or be revealed.</div>
<div></div>
<div>And now fora bit of twistedhappenstance - as we were trying to hide from the rodeo clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were. Lon Morris College. Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found ourselves to the original clown college. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational Center on Peeples Street. They are hidden in a group of bushes next to the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec Center.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Why was this wicked? Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns. So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college? Can they beat the rodeo clowns? Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?</div>
<div></div>
<div>In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys. </div>

I immedately proclaimed to my girls to finish getting there shoes on quickly because we had a circus to save. We weren't very far from them but they had been left on there own for over an hour! As we pulled up on Collage St. we saw a ruckus going on! There were circus folk hidding in bushes as Rodeo clowns were throwing tomatoes at them! The campus security was heading down the road because they heard there was someone fighting on school property. Oh no! I had to act fast. I swung my car up between the rodeo clowns and parked
 near the bushes the Circus was hidding in. I threw open my door and ushered everyone into my car clown style. I couldn't belive they could all fit but we were jamed in. Security came up to me and asked if I knew anything about a fight, and I told them I was just leaving and had only seen rodeo clowns throwing tomatoes my way. So they headed over to talk to the rodeo clowns and we quickly left and headed for the Tomatoe Fest. I tried to explain to everyone, on the way, that they were all a family and it didn't matter who was smarter, but I think there was still a lot of tension between the group. I couldn't just leave them cramed in my car all day but they said they would behave if I would just keep them safe from the rodeo clowns. So they set up camp with me and we all had a great weekend boxing together. They said they would come home with me and hopefully find a new place to set up for a show. </div>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>
</p><div>That circus.  Well.  Not much more to say.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A debate has been raging here in Jacksonville  for the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my house.  It seems the clowns have decided they are the smartest members of the circus.  Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company disagrees.  As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact that clowns go to college.  Clown College.  The first clown college was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron Morris.  You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we were driving through town early this morning, they had a better than usual view of their surroundings because I couldn't tolerate them in my van anymore so I tied them to the bumper instead.  In the course of our meanderings, we happened to pass the rodeo grounds and that's where this debate began.  It seems the circus clowns also think they are smarter than rodeo clowns and they boisterously proclaimed that - as the rodeo clowns were practicing.  As you can imagine, the rodeo clowns disagreed and they jumped on their horses and followed us in hot pursuit with their little water pistols drawn.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A minivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly.  I decided I couldn't risk being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind their manners or be revealed.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now for a bit of twisted happenstance  - as we were trying to hide from the rodeo clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were.  Lon Morris College.  Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found ourselves to the original clown college.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational Center on Peeples Street.  They are hidden in a group of bushes next to the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec Center.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Why was this wicked?  Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns.  So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college?  Can they beat the rodeo clowns?  Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys.  </div>
<div> </div>

<p><span>At 8:45am, as we were getting ready to leave Camp
Jacksonville for the Tomatoe Fest, Dreamwalker checked his phone and saw a
message from Barefoot Lucy proclaiming that she had left the poor circus folk
to fend for themselves. I immedately proclaimed to my girls to finish getting
there shoes on quickly because we had a circus to save. We weren't very far
from them but they had been left on there own for over an hour! As we
pulled up on Collage St. we saw a ruckus going on! There were circus folk
hidding in bushes as Rodeo clowns were throwing tomatoes at them! The campus
security was heading down the road because they heard there was
someone fighting on school property. Oh no! I had to act fast. I swung my car
up between the rodeo clowns and parked near the bushes the Circus was
hidding in. I threw open my door and ushered everyone into my car clown
style. I couldn't belive they could all fit but we were jamed in. Security came
up to me and asked if I knew anything about a fight, and I told them I was just
leaving and had only seen rodeo clowns throwing tomatoes my way. So they headed
over to talk to the rodeo clowns and we quickly left and headed for the
Tomatoe Fest. I tried to explain to everyone, on the way, that they were
all a family and it didn't matter who was smarter, but I think there was still
a lot of tension between the group. I couldn't just leave them cramed in my car
all day but they said they would behave if I would just keep them safe from the
rodeo clowns. So they set up camp with me and we all had a great weekend boxing
together. They said they would come home with me and hopefully find a new place
to set up for a show. </span></p>

Travel On Circus - Hiding and Seeking<br/>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<div>
<p><span>That circus.  Well.  Not much more to say.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>A debate has been raging here in Jacksonville 
for the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my
house.  It seems the clowns have decided they are the smartest members of
the circus.  Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company
disagrees.  As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact
that clowns go to college.  Clown College.  The first clown college
was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron
Morris.  You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>As we were driving through town early this morning,
they had a better than usual view of their surroundings because I couldn't
tolerate them in my van anymore so I tied them to the bumper instead.  In
the course of our meanderings, we happened to pass the rodeo grounds and that's
where this debate began.  It seems the circus clowns also think they
are smarter than rodeo clowns and they boisterously proclaimed that - as
the rodeo clowns were practicing.  As you can imagine, the rodeo clowns
disagreed and they jumped on their horses and followed us in hot pursuit with
their little water pistols drawn.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>A minivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is
not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I
made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly.  I decided I couldn't risk
being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them
back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind
their manners or be revealed.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>And now for a bit of
twisted happenstance  - as we were trying to hide from the rodeo
clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were.  Lon Morris
College.  Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets
weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found
ourselves to the original clown college.  </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo
grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational
Center on Peeples Street.  They are hidden in a group of bushes next to
the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the
basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec
Center.</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>Why was this wicked?  Because those boisterous
clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them
back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to
the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those
bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns.  So -
do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college?  Can they beat the
rodeo clowns?  Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find
themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?</span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span> </span></p>
</div>
<div>
<p><span>In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon
Morris College security are pretty thorough guys.  </span></p>

<div>Thanks, BlueButterfly! I really missed being there this year too! It was the same day as our dance school recital. Let me just say: 450 students, roughly equates to 900 parents and 1800 grandparents.... and all that implies. But it was a great success and our kids were wonderful. Next year, we will definitely have our recital earlier in the spring so I can come play tomatoes with everyone.</div>

Well. Not much more to say.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A debate has been raging here in Jacksonville for the last few weeks amongst the circus folk who have been staying in my house. It seems the clowns have decided they are the smartest members of the circus. Needless to say, every other member of the traveling company disagrees. As evidence of their claim, they frequently mention the fact that clowns go to college. Clown College. The first clown college was formed by a man whose clown name was Blubber, but his real name was Ron Morris. You don't even have to ask - they'll tell you all this.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As we were driving through town early this morning, they had a better than usual view of their surroundings because I couldn't tolerate them in my van anymore so I tied them to the bumper instead. In the course of our meanderings, we happened to pass the rodeo grounds and that's where this debate began. It seems the circus clowns also think they are smarter than rodeo clowns and they boisterously proclaimed that - as the rodeo clowns were practicing. As you can imagine, the rodeo clowns disagreed and they jumped on their horses and followed us in hot pursuit with their little water pistols drawn.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A minivan dragging a crowd of circus performers is not as fast as horses and it was inevitable that we would be overtaken, so I made a couple of quick turns and hid quickly. I decided I couldn't risk being seen with this rowdy group any longer, so I untied them and shoved them back in their box and hid them in a place where they would be forced to mind their manners or be revealed.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And now for a bit of twisted happenstance - as we were trying to hide from the rodeo clowns, the circus clowns noticed where they were. Lon Morris College. Only they (and this is where their claim of intelligence gets weak) kept reading it as Ron Morris College and they were certain we had found ourselves to the original clown college. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Feeling a bit wicked, I hid them in view of the rodeo grounds and on the backside of the college - next to the LMC Recreational Center on Peeples Street. They are hidden in a group of bushes next to the basketball goals to the left of the Rec Center - bushes between the basketball court and the street, under the two bushes furthest from the Rec Center.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Why was this wicked? Because those boisterous clowns really want to go meet Ron Morris and I very nearly couldn't get them back in their box because of their zeal, but when the circus clowns return to the rodeo grounds in just a few minutes, they will have a clear view of those bushes and I think they'll still have it in for the circus clowns. So - do the circus clowns go for it and run for the college? Can they beat the rodeo clowns? Or do they stay hidden and hope the rodeo clowns find themselves a Saturday rodeo and then sneak up to the college?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In any event, they may ALL be in trouble because Lon Morris College security are pretty thorough guys. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; __________________________________________________________<br/>&gt; Hotmail has tools for the New Busy.
