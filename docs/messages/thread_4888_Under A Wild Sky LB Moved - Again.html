&gt; This letterbox was taken by a Geocacher after they placed a cache in the same stump.  After contacting me I suggested the cache be moved, but instead they moved my box and gave me new directions.  The log is evidently damaged so I will need to replace it and possibly move the box again if I think it is too close to the cache.  For now, I just wanted to let you know in case you already printed out the clues and were planning on looking for it.<br/>
