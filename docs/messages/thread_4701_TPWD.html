<p>I know you've been working on this with the TPWD for a long while, and I just want to say thank you for your effort. I'm disappointed that you didn't get the result we'd hoped for, but I'm sure you've represented us well and planted a seed that may eventually grow to fruition. Thanks Boots!!</p>

<p>As you know, I've had ongoing discussions about
letterboxing in state parks with various folks at Texas Parks and Wildlife for
the last couple of years. I don't mind telling you that the response from them

had with a park ranger, who had been asked by a state director to meet with me,

with a response which effectively told me that our activity was too small and
trivial to warrant the wasting of their time and resources. All I seem to have
accomplished is raising their awareness of the sport of letterboxing, and for
that, I apologize. As I told them, letterboxing has been going on in the state
parks for 10 years now with no known problems or harm to any cultural or
natural resources. They even acknowledged that fact. While I'm not advocating
that you place boxes in state parks without a permit, I doubt that anyone would
notice. I would say that if you want to letterbox in state parks, you should
decide for yourself which way you want to go. If, in the future, TPWD decides
to make a policy for letterboxing, I'll remind them that we tried to work with
them and were rebuffed. As for me, I'll probably still try the permitting
process in individual parks occasionally, but I'm giving up on my efforts to
educate the powers that be in Austin.<br/>

<br/>
First - please excuse the delay in my reply.    My excuse is that as you all<br/>
know - I have started a new job.  As a "Trainee", I have been putting in<br/>
extra time to get up to speed.  The training has been "challenging".  This<br/>
is an extremely accelerated schedule.  They expect me to be fully capable in<br/>
60 days, normally they give 1 year.  These are not normal times.  I hope I<br/>
make it.  When home, I have been typing and organizing my scribbled notes<br/>
every night, then studying until I fall asleep.  On top of that Moni has<br/>
been very sick, and I think I am coming down with it now too.  So again,<br/>
please excuse the delay.<br/>
<br/>
I am sorry this didn't work out for you.  Perhaps I had better luck locally<br/>
because I have always combined letterboxing AND geocaching, not worrying too<br/>
much about the difference.  I know the rangers don't see the difference.  As<br/>
you have noticed, the difference is lost on all but those you make the time<br/>
to learn.  I am lucky here in that a local ranger has taken up geocaching,<br/>
so he has also taken the time to learn the difference.  While he is not<br/>
currently letterboxing, there is hope.  But he does act in the best interest<br/>
of both, knowing that they both exist.  That has been helpful.  Particularly<br/>
these last two years when my work schedule has kept me from being as active<br/>
as I could have been.<br/>
<br/>
Boots... Your efforts WERE NOT WASTED!  You brought attention to the fact<br/>
that there IS a difference.  And they just knowing that is a start.  One<br/>
that can be used and built upon in the future as letterboxing grows.<br/>
<br/>
EVERYONE - consider this.  Do you really WANT letterboxing to have the<br/>
following that geocaching has?  Be careful what you wish for.  There really<br/>
can be too much of a good thing.  I am not saying we do not need more.  Some<br/>
areas do.  But there can come a point where some areas do have too much.<br/>
Some geocaches are really lame, placed in strange locations just because<br/>
someone wanted "more".<br/>
<br/>
I do not have all the answers.  I only know what has worked out here.  Out<br/>
here, the parks are huge - and the letterboxing population is small.  There<br/>
is room for a lot more.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I am making sense.  I am going to take some (legal) drugs and go back<br/>
to bed.  And I hope I feel good enough to make training tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Y-all have a GREAT Sunday.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all of you who have responded to this post and for your kind words.  It's not that I think my efforts have failed, I have had a lot of success at the park level.  My experience has been that (in the parks where I have permitted boxes) the employees have not been familiar with letterboxing, so they make up their own rules on the fly.  In every case, the rangers and employees have been extremely nice and welcoming. However, no two parks interpret the rules (geocaching rules as they apply to letterboxing) the same.  One may hand me a permit application and say "Place your letterbox anywhere you want, fill out the form, and drop it back at the office as you leave."  The next one may tell me that I have to meet with the park manager, but he's not available, so you need to make an appointment because he's the only one that can approve your application. Still another may say that they'll have to check out the location when they have time and will email you when it is approved. If they do that, I wouldn't leave the box. The main reason that I was taking this as far up the chain as I could was to get some uniformity at the park level, so we would know what to expect when we went to a park to place a box.  I thought the way to do that was to be recognized as separate but equal to geocaching, so we might have some say in the policy writing.  That didn't happen, so there's where the failure lies.  Even after all that, I still think that we can place letterboxes in state parks as long as we just go along with each parks interpretation of the rules.  If you don't agree with what they want you to do, just don't leave your box in that park.  Save it for another park, where the rules may be different.  If you don't want to do that, just be sure your box is well placed, so it isn't likely to be found accidentally.  Hey, it's worked for 10 years.  I've learned one thing from this experience: the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. is not interested in spending time and resources hunting down letterboxes.  If one is found accidentally and reported to them, they may email you and give you an opportunity to permit it or come get it.  You can always consider it expendable and just tell them to throw it away.  I guarantee you that they don't have anyone searching LbNA or Atlas Quest looking for your letterbox. It's up to you how you want to play the game. <br/>
