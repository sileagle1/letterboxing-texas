                    <html><body><p>It had been over 6 years since I letterboxed in San Antonio, so about 6 months ago I decided to rectify that situation.  Since then I have made several forays into and around the Alamo city and have been quite pleased with the quantity and quality of boxes there.  Not only that, it has lead me to nice parks I had never heard of before, which is one of my favorite things about letterboxing.  Of course I couldn't resist adding a few boxes of my own as a small thank you to all the placers there.<br/><br/>While boxing, I couldn't help thinking back to the early days when there were no boxes in San Antonio at all.  In January, 2003, Baby Bear and I embarked on our first letterbox "seeding" trip across a swath of Texas in the hopes of luring other potential boxers into the hobby.  As part of that trip I placed one of my Six Flags Of TX boxes (Spanish Flag) in San Antonio.  Being the newby I was and being ignorant of the National Park restrictions on boxes, I placed it at one of the missions where it promptly got confiscated.  I later replaced and relocated it to Mission Tejas SP, but I wanted a box in San Antonio, so I started researching potential parks to put one in.  I decided on McAllister park and in late 2003 placed one of my Beer Series boxes (Lone Star Beer) there.  In the following years I tried placing boxes in other San Antonio parks but they were either confiscated or lost fairly quickly so I gave up.  That is why I was surprised and pleased to see so many parks with letterboxes that I never new existed and I highly recommend a visit. <br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/></p><p><span><br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>
