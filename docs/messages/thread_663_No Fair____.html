We are sooo glad you're a part of our group - even if<br/>
you are some distance from us!<br/>
<br/>
I feel for ya - I'm in a box-scarce zone myself, and<br/>
I'm so excited to finally get to be going to a more<br/>
box-rich place, even if just for a weekend.  I keep<br/>
thinking back to Bastrop last year and actually<br/>
racking up a few stamps!  It was very cool!<br/>

You'll just have to pack it up and move, Steve! LA just isn't getting <br/>
it! or work for an airline so you can travel to other places. . .<br/>
<br/>
Where you going to for those 35+ boxes? Are those all Houston boxes?<br/>

The coffee and beignets are still on for around 8 am.  I don't know <br/>
which campsite I'll be in, so it will a mystery on where to go.  <br/>
I'll try to make it obvious and there will be a stamp for those who <br/>
find it.<br/>

If folks down here in Texas had any idea of how amazing your stamps are,<br/>
they would be beating a path to your door!!! There would be clogged arteries<br/>
going in to the state of Louisiana (and I don't mean from eating at<br/>
Emeril's...) and LA would stand for Letterboxing Abundance!!!<br/>
<br/>
Wait...you only have clues for 35 + boxes...that's not even half of<br/>
Hawk's!!!<br/>

Oh stop I'm blushing.  Well just so happens I have a series I'll be <br/>
planting along the way, kinda like leaving bread crumb trail of <br/>
stamps.  <br/>

I won't be getting many in the Houston area since I'll be hugging <br/>
the the shore line coming in, and non stop going home.  Also I'll <br/>
only be in town two days and one of those will be filled with a <br/>
stamping frenzy with beignets,bailey's,chilli,and clue.<br/>

Hi Boxdn!<br/>
<br/>
I have a theory about the lack of letterboxers in LA.  I'm going to <br/>
preface this theory by letting you know that I was born in a bar in <br/>
the French Quarter and raised in Morgan City...so I mean no <br/>
offense.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Could it be because there are great areas (at least in southern LA) <br/>
that are a tad bit "swampy"?  Also, could be a few too many gators, <br/>
water moccasins and even hurricanes?  I find that I run into <br/>
these "friends" rather frequently when out 'n about.<br/>
<br/>
If it makes you feel any better, though....the next time I'm home <br/>
visiting family, I'll plant a box just for you.  Probably around <br/>
Baton Rouge or Covington.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
