have a missing box right now, it is only 50 miles away.  I just got the 
last of the pieces to replace it, but I do not have the time - and don't know 
when I will have the time to get out there.  It is Cattle on the Mesa - 
missing a second time now.  I am considering separating the letterbox from 
the Geocache.  I will be moving it to a better spot - when I get the 
chance....  With the spring overhaul season nearly over, we can start 
expecting time to be more available - until the fall EPA inspections

<div><br/>Hi Mike, Oh that's ok...lol.  We're not wanting to replace any ones boxes.  I think I might have crossed some wires in my first email and gave the assumption that I was wanting to replace missing boxes... we just were wondering if we could share the location (park or trails ) that another box was planted.  I think I might go back into hiding now...lol.</div>

<div>Michelle, no reason to go into hiding. You asked a good question, and got some thoughtful answers. Actually, you made a nice contribution to the list. When someone asks a question about letterboxing, (whether we may have misinterpreted what you were actually asking or not) and it opens up a nice line of letterboxing discussion, we all benefit by hearing each other's points of view. That is one of the reasons for this list. Had I thought to ask more questions when I first started letterboxing, I may have saved myself from making some mistakes. There are some great folks on this list who are happy to answer your questions. That's how we learn.</div>
