Lone Star Quilter is thrilled that you were able to find her little Patchwork Girl of Oz, I still don't know how you managed that, considering the circumstances.  I'm glad you were spared the heavy rains.  Maybe I can get down there again and look for some of those that you couldn't get to.  The Pratt Family has found many of my boxes, they seem like a great addition to our letterboxing family.<br/>

&gt; Red/Blue/Purple trail area<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kayak Girl (NLW) - found with box open and full of water -- no stamp in<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nada Clue (Boots Tex) - fabulous as ever and we loved the new location!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NFL Series - Houston Texans (Gators88) - No box found, trees around it cut<br/>
&gt; down.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cola Wars series (Wills World) - Choice B&amp;C are there (maybe wet?), The home<br/>
&gt; for Choice A is destroyed but MB found it in a bush by accident.  The box<br/>
&gt; was damaged.  Planted in new location with a new box and logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cola Wars: Choice D (Open Space) - Ok<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rain Deer (Gators88) - Location has been cleared, box lost<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bones (LSQ) - Found the location with brick but the box is missing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Risk: Horseman Card - Found box, current location was at a dead tree near a<br/>
&gt; cleared area so we decided to move it to a live tree.  Plastic jar is bent<br/>
&gt; but dry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Patchwork Girl of Oz (LSQ)-- was buried in and amongst an acre of debris<br/>
&gt; from the recent tree removals. The lid was creased, the box cracked, the<br/>
&gt; logbook soaked and slimy and felt sopping. The stamp, however, is wonderful.<br/>
&gt; You would never believe where this box was found, with barely a corner<br/>
&gt; poking out of the broken limbs, in a clearing with no landmarks from the<br/>
&gt; clues visible. Still singing a victory dance. MB is rehabilitating the<br/>
&gt; logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cowardly lion of Oz (Boots Tex) - Alive and well<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jabberwocky (Open Space/Dreamwalker) - OK<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Writing's on the wall (dewberry)- Found the writing but not the wall<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Green Trail <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oz: The Gatekeeper (dewberry) - missing, stump is mostly gone and area<br/>
&gt; behind it is completely cleared out<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The games closet - Mousetrap - stamp missing although it's hiding spot<br/>
&gt; looked undisturbed<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Washington State Flower (TeamKing) - alive and well (location for this on<br/>
&gt; the map needs to be updated)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bingo and Bingo piece (Baby Bear) - we couldn't find Bingo, but it could be<br/>
&gt; under a fallen tree or lots of debris along the log.  A shovel would help.<br/>
&gt; Bingo Piece is there but the clues don't make much sense anymore (and the<br/>
&gt; tree is dead - just the trunk is left)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MOM (AstroD) - Alive and damp.  We cleaned it up and donated a new bag.<br/>
&gt; It's stump is slowly meeting it's demise and overgrowth is partially hiding<br/>
&gt; the stump.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Irish Blessing - boxes are long gone <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Season's Greetings (dewberry) - replanted in it's original location<br/>
&gt; (although we are concerned that the spot gets too much attention). Dewberry<br/>
&gt; plans to update clues on AQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Blue Marlin 06 - missing, probably washed away by Ike (based on comments I<br/>
&gt; received about that area)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Toadally Hoppy - couldn't find landmarks, but we didn't check out the bottom<br/>
&gt; loop of the green trail, so there is still hope<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Puzzle Mystery boxes (not on the main list I shared Saturday)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Puzzle Queen - Alive and well<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GG's box - I couldn't find the landmarks, but I think I started at the wrong<br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Surrender Dorothy - I checked this one last week.  It's alive and well but<br/>
&gt; in a slightly different spot (dewberry knows where it is J).  It's original<br/>
&gt; hiding place is destroyed.  One tab on the L&amp;L is broken.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd like to thank everyone who came out and braved the weather and mud<br/>
&gt; yesterday.  I couldn't do much about the mud, but the weather certainly<br/>
&gt; cooperated!  We had a great time, made new friends and saved some boxes<br/>
&gt; which lost their homes.  Several had to be repaired and moved to new homes,<br/>
&gt; and sadly there were some classics we couldn't find.  I suspect we checked<br/>
&gt; on less than half of the boxes so there is still a lot of work to do.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've posted the highlights of the day on my blog:<br/>
&gt; http://anopenspacelife.blogspot.com/2013/05/memorial-park-maintenance.html,<br/>
&gt; and uploaded the pictures on the event page on AQ.  I'll be posting a<br/>
&gt; detailed report of all the boxes we checked later today and correcting the<br/>
&gt; map for general use.  Thanks again for all your help. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for organizing this event and helping the boxes you found.  I had found my Risk: Horseman Card a while back, buried in debris and battered but not broken, and moved it to nearby location.  Glad to hear it is still alive and dry, and thanks for moving it to a better location.  Just let me know where and I will update the clues.  BTW, my other two Risk boxes were gone last time I looked so I archived the clues.<br/>
