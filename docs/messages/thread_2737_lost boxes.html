<div> </div>
<div>I haven't heard from you in AGES!  But I can always count on you to think of a way to move forward...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think for my part I am really good at spotting good hiding places that are safe from natural elements, but being rural, that's my biggest concern.  Where I fail a little I think is in finding hiding spots that are people safe and that's where you city sorts of folks are better.  I did, though, really think Killough was people-safe.  It was a hiding spot that just sort of faded into the woodwork as soon as it was recovered and it didn't even really require a real precise rehide.  Do you know - the last time I was out there I dropped the rock back on top and stepped back and looked and said out loud "Now THAT's a good hiding place!"
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For a rural hiding spot - I watch for water lines on nearby trees and I try to be sure to hide where there are no water lines, or above the water lines.  Keep to high ground.  Hide on the back sides of trees from the trail, and try to find a tree with a couple of exposed roots that can nestle the box so that covering is easier.  I stay away from holes in trees because animals tend to get those boxes quicker, and I also avoid anything at eye level.  TexLuvBug (a former player, for those who don't know who she is) used to love to put boxes in the Y's of trees - right at eye level!  When she hid them, they looked great, but the hiding spot would deteriorate really rapidly because the material wouldn't stay put and didn't look right and it was hard to rehide them naturally.  I also try to look for a spot that is going to have a lot of natural fodder close at hand to use for rehiding.  And avoid clean places.  If you find a clean place you like, hide to the edges where it is less likely to be clean.
<br/><br/>I also try to think like a kid - if I were a little kid standing around waiting for my mother to FINALLY quit talking to Mrs. So-and-So and I'm bored out of my mind, where might I be inclined to stick my hand?  Avoid that place.  And I try to avoid anywhere where people naturally congregate (okay, you Nac Boxing Day folk - I missed the boat on THAT one with the Java Jack's box!) and stand around and so their eye has time to naturally wander around.  Even though I'm not a little kid, I tend to fidget with my hands, so down time for someone like me spells disaster for anything that is trying to hide in a spot that catches my eye.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I say all this, BUT - I have a box in the bottom of a hole, a box that lived in a very clean area right next to a high traffic building for nearly two years, two that are under bridges, two in bottomlands, and probably a few others I'm not thinking about that violate my current thoughts on hiding spots.  But heck - who am I to claim to know where to hide a box?  I just lost two stinking boxes!

<div><font size="2">ROCKS! I thought that was the secret. I was convinced that a box hidden under a substantial rock would be concealed from view, difficult for small animals to drag away, and safe from wind, weedwackers and water. I was so convinced that was the answer, I even carried a few nice size flat rocks in my Jeep for when I needed to hide a box and there were no available rocks lying around. The difficult part of that scheme was having to carry  them in my backpack to the desired location on a trail. However, the element I had not taken into consideration was the <u>human</u> element. Often when I've gone to check on one of my boxes, I've found that the rock has not been replaced, and the box is sitting out in plain view with no covering at all.... and my lovely rock is sitting off to the side.
