lost<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rumor has it on the Southeast list that he has been heard <br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is getting back on track. I'm really glad for that because <br/>
he was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a culture<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all to himself and yet another character in Texas <br/>letterboxing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; history -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even though he wasn't a Texan!<br/>

<div>Actually, I've wondered if he might not actually BE an alien (and I don't 
just mean a non-Texan by birth).  I mean, he seemed to be sort of 
suspiciously in tune with those BEA's, now wasn't he?  And who supplied the 
B's in the first place?  I ask you . . . </div>
