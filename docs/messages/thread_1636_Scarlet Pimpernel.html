I was contemplating suggesting we have a Scarlet<br>
Pimpernel work session at the gathering - I know<br>
several of us are losing quite a lot of sleep over it!<br>

And to think I had finally consoled myself that my<br>

by convincing myself I could dedicate my time to<br>

I'm still gonna buckle down and focus on it again this<br>
weekend though, and if I figure that one out, I'm<br>
going for Dorothy!<br>

around the corner, there's no weekend for boxing that far afield.  I<br>

Some local boxers, RFC & Co have been threatening me with a devious<br>
local mystery box and I have to say, that would make my day!  Or,<br>
maybe one of the Lucys might think of something that will stump us all<br>
when we're in East Texas?  If you guys can't think of something for my<br>
brain to do so I can avoid all housework, I will have to come up with<br>
more tricky puzzles for you!<br>

And now, I want to brag on Silver Eagle and TeamKing, both of whom<br>
have solved Dorothy.  They deserve to take a bow as well.<br>

<div></div>
<div>I happened to see your message regarding The Scarlet Pimpernel on my daily digest from AQ, but I didn't have time to log on to AQ so I could answer your question.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That's a box by Celtic Lions, Ruby Tuesday being their ringleader. Ruby passed away last year. Many of us spent months solving the SP and it is a box of particular appeal to many of us! I've not been to collect itsince Isolved it, so I don't know if it's there or not. I know the general area where it is and it wouldn't be difficult to find once you solve the clues, and I know there are several other boxes in that park, so it would be worth a shot to look for it!<br/>

&gt; &gt; as all of you know this letterbox is the holy grail of texas letterboxing and for those few who have found it, i know that it has tremendous meaning.  i have been working on this clue and have a lot of it figured out, but i am having a rough time polishing it up.  i have planned a trip to that area friday and as last resort i am appealing to this group for any advice.  this box has not been found since 2006 (at least no one has posted a find) and not only would i like to finally conquer finding it, but also to check on it to make sure it is still there.  if you are willing to help (i am not looking for the answer, just more on how to make what i have make a little more sense) then please email me at tigger32167@<br/>
&gt; &gt; thanks so much<br/>
