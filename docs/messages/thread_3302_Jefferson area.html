Funny you mentioned these two.<br>
They do not know this but they are the reason for my boxing obsession.<br>
One of my other hobbies is visiting haunted locations. Jefferson, TX<br>
is full of them.<br>
My girlfriends and I were there a couple of years ago and did several<br>
ghost tour in this quaint little town. "The Grove" was one of the<br>
places on the list. This is Mitch & Tami's home.<br>
He gives the tours. And yes their house is haunted.<br>
At the end of the tour he tells of his writing. Some of his books are<br>
about haunted places he's been and some are normal reading. I bought<br>
one of his books and he even signed it for me. (They are such down to<br>
earth people)<br>
Anyway, after getting home and reading my new book (another hobby-reading)<br>
I wanted to find other books he had done. I logged on the computer and<br>
looked him up.<br>
I bounced on to his site that had some of his resent vacations. I<br>
decided to read on, and to <br>
my surprise he had gone to some of the places he had asked my group<br>
about. He had learned from us about some of the locations we had been<br>
to in Mississippi.<br>
They had posted pictures of these places and had one snap shot that<br>
said something about taking a little time out to do some letterboxing.<br>
What on earth is letterboxing I wondered?<br>
He had a link to LNA. The more I read on the more excited I got. This<br>
really sounded like fun. I sat on pins & needles until Hobby Lobby<br>
opened up the next morning to get a stamp & logbook. Then I had to go<br>
onto work. (Bummer) But, there was lunch. So when 12 o'clock  rolled<br>
around I was off in search of the first box.<br>
And this is how one hobby can snowball into another.<br>
