The Cruisers would like to thank you for planting so many wonderful <br>
boxes!<br>
<br>
We were able to cover allot of ground on our overnight trip and visit <br>
a slew of boxes thanks mostly to quality driving directions provided <br>
in the clues.  This makes a big difference coming from out of town <br>
(even if it is only from Ft. Worth).  We also never would have <br>
realized the rich history and wonderful parks that east Texas has to <br>
offer without your help!  <br>
<br>
Unfortunately we are not going to be able to attend the gathering in <br>
Tomball to meet some of the folks we have heard so much about but <br>
maybe next time.<br>
<br>
Thanks again and Happy Boxing!<br>
The Cruisers<br>
