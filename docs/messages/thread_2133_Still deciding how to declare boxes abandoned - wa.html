                    <div class="plaintext-content">&gt;   Actually, I've been thinking about LSQ &amp; Boots Tex a lot during <br/>
the group's discussions about "abandoned" boxes and boxers that <br/>
have "dropped out".  You both travel so much and are so willing to <br/>
plant along the way...I think it could be very easy for someone to <br/>
assume that you might have dropped out of the game if several boxes <br/>
in widely spread out areas go missing and you're not able to run <br/>
right out and replace them.  <br/>
<br/>
*****This is one of my concerns too, Batty.  And throw Silver Eagle <br/>
and Baby Bear in that mix - there are many, many of their boxes they <br/>
can't get back to soon or readily!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Yes, thankfully, both LSQ and Boots Tex respond immediately to <br/>
email, but what if there was a family emergency and they weren't <br/>
available?  What if they were on one of their long trips and didn't <br/>
have access to email?<br/>
<br/>
******I don't think you could declare someone "out of the game" in <br/>
less than 3 months, more practically six months.  And frankly, if <br/>
LSQ and BT, or SE and BB, or anyone else had to go that long without <br/>
contact, I think we would have to consider the possibility that they <br/>
ARE out of the game, at least temporarily.  I know I was in what <br/>
could have been that situation last year - I had a family member who <br/>
was very ill and I was burning the candle at both ends managing to <br/>
work, take care of my family, and tend to her.  I was off the list <br/>
and out of letterboxing for about six weeks, AND it happened <br/>
suddenly enough that I didn't have an opportunity to tell anyone or <br/>
plan ahead.  If her health had continued to deteriorate, it would've <br/>
been longer, and y'all would have had to look at my boxes as <br/>
possibly abandoned.  Of course, the option is always there for <br/>
someone to return and reclaim their boxes if they must take a <br/>
hiatus.  I think declaring boxes as abandoned is not necessarily <br/>
punitive, but alerts the community that maybe they need to jump in <br/>
and take on extra duties.  I know in my case, I check my own boxes <br/>
and the boxes of folks who live at a distance somewhat regularly, <br/>
but I don't check the boxes of locals.  I don't check them because I <br/>
feel like the more often the box is uncovered, the greater the <br/>
likelihood is it will be at risk, and it should be the owner's <br/>
privilege to check the box.  Had I realized sooner that TexasLuvBug <br/>
wasn't playing any more, I probably would've checked some of her <br/>
boxes earlier than I did and possibly could've saved some of them.  <br/>
One in particular was a real shame to lose.  The key, though, is not <br/>
pulling the trigger and declaring them to have quit too soon.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;I think the best way to declare any particular box as <br/>
actually "missing" is to have a local boxer that is in the area go <br/>
out and check on it.  Not only will it go you a definite "Yes...it's <br/>
there," or "No...it's gone," answer (especially for an informal-type <br/>
list), but it will also foster goodwill and a sense of community, at <br/>
least among Texas boxers.<br/>
<br/>
******While I agree with you - to a certain extent - this isn't <br/>
always practical or possible.  There are still enough areas of Texas <br/>
that have very low concentrations of letterboxers that there may <br/>
well not be a local who can run check.  And if the local hasn't <br/>
actually, personally found the box before, it could happen that they <br/>
are simply looking in the wrong place and they compound the missing <br/>
reports by offering a "confirmation".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Now I know that this is already a good, close community...but if <br/>
we're going to actually consider declaring someone's <br/>
box "missing"...I think it's a good idea to verify by a boxer that's <br/>
already found it.<br/>
<br/>
*****Ooops.  You said it already.  I think you are right - this is <br/>
absolutely the only way to positively confirm a box is missing if <br/>
the owner is out of the picture.  I know I have folks who report a <br/>
box of mine missing all the time, and every time they report it, I <br/>
zip the few blocks to it to check up on it and find it happily in <br/>
place.  I email them back and say "try again".  Only after they find <br/>
it do they realize what they were doing wrong!   Many of them, <br/>
however, would swear it was missing right up until they find it.<br/>
<br/>
There IS a difference between declaring a box missing and declaring <br/>
it abandoned.  <br/>
<br/>
A box can only be declared missing if the owner says it is missing, <br/>
or in the absence of the owner, someone who has found it before says <br/>
it isn't where they found it before.  I, and probably all of us, <br/>
have been guilty of insisting a box was missing because "I followed <br/>
the clues exactly and everything fit perfectly, but it wasn't <br/>
there!" - only to go back and realize there were other landmarks <br/>
that fit MORE perfectly and lo and behold - there IS the box!  So of <br/>
course, it wouldn't do to rely solely on the report of a prospective <br/>
finder.<br/>
<br/>
An abandoned box only means that the owner of the box is gone and <br/>
not playing any more and has left the box in the wild without anyone <br/>
to care for it.  An abandoned box can function healthily for quite a <br/>
long time if it is well stocked and well-hidden when the owner goes <br/>
AWOL.  Saying a box is abandoned warns that it is more at risk than <br/>
a box with parents.  And I think that a box can be considered as <br/>
having parents if there is someone who checks it regularly, even if <br/>
it isn't the finder.  I know I consider it a small token of my <br/>
appreciation to check on boxes in my area that were planted by folks <br/>
passing through - if it weren't for them, I would've had precious <br/>
little to find for quite a long time!  And I know that many other <br/>
boxers do the same thing.<br/>
<br/>
I think the confusion of terms comes about when someone can't find a <br/>
box so they email the owner and don't get a response.  It's usually <br/>
only because there is a problem with the box that we find out the <br/>
owner has left the game.<br/>
<br/>
I still don't see any really good answer to the problem, but I'm <br/>
really glad all of us are thinking about it.  <br/>
<br/>
I do believe the key is to go at it in a slow and reasoned manner <br/>
before calling anything or anyone missing or abandoned.<br/>
<br/>
Nice post, Batty, and by the way, ditto your comments on LSQ and <br/>
BT.  They ARE awesome!<br/>

Oooooooh!  I'm so glad you said that!  Currently, in my backpack, <br/>
I've got "Black Gold", "Buffalo Basin", "Tribute to Spud Webb" <br/>
and "Star Gazing" to be planted around the Permian Basin Petroleum <br/>
Museum, somewhere around Bicentenial Plaza (if possible), Midland <br/>
College and the Planetarium.<br/>
<br/>
I also believe that my mother is going to try to plant a little <br/>
cactus that we carved just to show her how it works.  She's just <br/>
waiting on me to mail her a box and logbook for it (I know...why <br/>
can't she put it together...?!?).  This should be interesting since <br/>
she's usually not interested in the BusyBeesFamily's extracurricular <br/>
activities unless they involve shopping!  This time, however, she <br/>
seemed pretty intrigued by the whole concept, so I suspect that <br/>
pretty soon I'm going to have to carve her a sig stamp!<br/>
<br/>
I'll email and let you know whenever we get out there next. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks so much, Batty B of the BusyBeesFamily  :-)<br/>
