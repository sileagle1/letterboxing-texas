<div>I'm a little fuzzy-headed myself - we thought we had our A/C going, but something has gone haywire - AGAIN!  I'm not sure I understand your question - you click the box on AQ but it doesn't list your box on LBNA?  I have a box I need to list on AQ - I'll see what happens with mine.  Of course, I already posted it on LBNA - creature of habit that I am, I just can't get used to going first to AQ to post boxes.

<div> </div>
<div>And now that I have, I have a question.  When you, dewberry (or anyone else that prefers AQ over LBNA), say you like AQ better for mapping and search capabilities, are you referring to the mapping on the clue page?  The one that takes you to Google, or Yahoo, or Mapquest?  So that you have to have an intersection or a street address?  Or are you talking about something else?  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I haven't ever been too successful with the mapping features, and I have to think it is probably because I do more rural boxing where there just aren't street addresses (heck, none of those map sites even recognize a lot of the roads where boxes I look for are).  Is that an accurate assessment?  Or is it just because I haven't spent enough time playing with it?
<br/> </div>
<div><a href="http://Geocaching.com">Geocaching.com</a> has a map feature that I really like - you log in your location, and you can click a little map button and it will show you where there are caches around you.  You can then zoom in and out and pan about.  Of course, by virtue of using waypoints geocaching has that whooped easily, but I would love to be able to pull a map similar to that for letterboxes, especially when we go out of town.  Jeff's map isn't exact enough (or I don't think it is) to tell me the detail I would want, so I've played around with making my own.  Of course, it seems like when I start planning a bigger trip - like a weekend trip - the planning of it becomes a military action with maps strewn about and markers and sticky notes and coded clue pages strung together to create a route.  My LSS is getting a little tired of opening up paper maps to find them all marked up with letterboxes.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I'm wondering if there are features buried deep in AQ that I haven't found yet.  I lean toward thinking it is better for more urban boxing, but I'm curious what y'all think....</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like how if you're planning a trip, you can use the trip planner to<br>
search within XXX miles (you decide) of the Interstate and it'll find<br>
the boxes for you.  I also like how if you search with a given city as<br>
your centerpoint, you will find all the boxes within a X radius<br>
(again, you decide), even if they're in another county, another LBNA<br>
region designation, or another state. I loathe looking up boxes by<br>
county--because my geography skills are not that precise--and because<br>
I just don't think like that.  I want the boxes closest to where I'm<br>
going to be.  I find flipping back and forth between regions on the<br>
LBNA map, figuring out what cities are in which county, etc. to be a<br>
huge time drain.  And, then, to find out that you missed a box you<br>
were within 2 miles of, simply because it was in the "other" county. <br>
Just Arrgh.<br>
<br>
So, with the recent upgrade of the mapping function on AQ, all you<br>
have to do is put in an intersection or an address if there is one. <br>
Sometimes it doesn't take the exact address, so I try to put in the<br>
closest intersection.  Then, when someone clicks on the map link,<br>
they're in the general area at least.  This is particularly helpful<br>
for a sprawled out city like Houston, where boxes can be in the same<br>
"city" but be 60 miles apart.  In a rural area, where the cities/towns<br>
aren't so big, just using the closest town is good enough in my<br>
opinion.  When I'm planning trips, I just want to know how far out of<br>
my route a given box is, and the closest town pretty much tells me that.<br>
<br>
The funny thing is, people always say that AQ has more bells and<br>
whistles, but I'm not really a bells and whistles techno-freak kind of<br>
person.  What I am unabashedly is is a map geek.  I love maps, I like<br>
to look at them, I study them, etc.  Thinking graphically is so much<br>
more helpful (for me) than reading linear directions--take this<br>
highway here, turn onto this one for .6 miles, etc--I'd rather see the<br>
map myself and figure out how to get there.<br>
<br>
I would love it if there would be a little map that would pop up<br>
showing you the locations of all the letterboxes.  I've seen that on<br>
the geocaching site and I think it's great.  Ryan keeps upgrading AQ,<br>
so maybe one day that site will get there.  <br>

<div>I guess what I've found to be the problem on the trip planner on AQ is that I rarely go near an interstate.  I know that sounds odd, but even on longer trips we just don't "do" interstates. I cross over them and I ever so occasionally actually travel on one, but using interstates to plan a trip isn't a practical approach for us, although I realize it makes perfect sense for most folks!  Maybe if Ryan would add US Highways.... 
<br/><br/>I do agree with you about being able to plug in a town and get letterboxes within "xxx" miles.  THAT's a nice feature.  The only real problem with it is that there are still quite a few boxers who don't list their boxes on AQ, but that will come with time and then that will be a great feature.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm like you with respect to maps.  I really need the visual orientation.  If you try to tell me how to get somewhere, I'm a lot less likely to get there than if you show me where I'm going on a map and let me figure it out.  Consequently, I love maps, even though it wasn't until I started letterboxing that I learned that.  Quite honestly, I don't know that I'll give up paper maps even if we eventually get a site that works perfectly - I do think I like to be able to run my finger along the route and I also like being able to pan out and in visually instead of having to wait on the computer to do it.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to have to play a little more with the mapping on AQ, but one thing I realize - I need to go back and make sure my address information is as good as it can be on AQ for those folks who rely on it.  I've kind of glossed over the address lines in the past.  And that's the big problem with either LB site - they rely on people to put in good data in the first place!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree about the regions being illogical.  Another example:  I have <br>
an interest in West Texas because Midland is my hometown.  The "West <br>
Texas Letterboxer", El Lobo, has placed boxes in Midland (Midland <br>
County), Odessa (Ector County) and Stanton (Martin County).  Odessa <br>
is 20 miles west of Midland and Stanton is 20 miles east of Midland <br>
and the three counties are adjacent. According to the LbNA map, <br>
Ector County is in West Texas, Midland is in Central Texas and <br>
Martin County is in The Panhandle.  Another interesting thing is <br>
that his Midland box is listed in the West Texas region (which is <br>
logical), even though the map shows Midland County to be in Central <br>
Texas.  It does get confusing and you have to be on your toes when <br>
you're planning your letterboxing expedition, don't you?<br>

                    <html><body><div>I've gotten to where I don't even really consider the regions.  I look things up on LBNA by county or town after I've figured out which counties are adjacent.  As dewberry pointed out, it can wind up being quite a time drain.  For Texas, the most reliable graphic representation is still Birds of a Feather's site, IMO.  That site, like all the others, has its pros and cons too!  I find myself using all three in conjunction with one another, which is sometimes enough to make my head swim!
