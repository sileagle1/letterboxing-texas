<div>Dear All, Could someone 
please tell me why I cannot get a URL that you can just click on for the last 
two boxes I have listed on AQ?  I know I have been able to accomplish this 
task in the past, but I think having 5 kids home ALL DAY ALL SUMMER has done 
something bad to my thinker.  (By the way, there is a new Houston sort of 
mystery box I just listed, "Eye Spy Houston")  What ever happened to that 
box you could check on AQ to have boxes automatically listed on LBNA, 
anyway?  Thanks!  MO5</div></body></html>

<div>I'm a little fuzzy-headed myself - we thought we had our A/C going, but something has gone haywire - AGAIN!  I'm not sure I understand your question - you click the box on AQ but it doesn't list your box on LBNA?  I have a box I need to list on AQ - I'll see what happens with mine.  Of course, I already posted it on LBNA - creature of habit that I am, I just can't get used to going first to AQ to post boxes.

<div> </div>
<div>And now that I have, I have a question.  When you, dewberry (or anyone else that prefers AQ over LBNA), say you like AQ better for mapping and search capabilities, are you referring to the mapping on the clue page?  The one that takes you to Google, or Yahoo, or Mapquest?  So that you have to have an intersection or a street address?  Or are you talking about something else?  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I haven't ever been too successful with the mapping features, and I have to think it is probably because I do more rural boxing where there just aren't street addresses (heck, none of those map sites even recognize a lot of the roads where boxes I look for are).  Is that an accurate assessment?  Or is it just because I haven't spent enough time playing with it?
<br/> </div>
<div><a href="http://Geocaching.com">Geocaching.com</a> has a map feature that I really like - you log in your location, and you can click a little map button and it will show you where there are caches around you.  You can then zoom in and out and pan about.  Of course, by virtue of using waypoints geocaching has that whooped easily, but I would love to be able to pull a map similar to that for letterboxes, especially when we go out of town.  Jeff's map isn't exact enough (or I don't think it is) to tell me the detail I would want, so I've played around with making my own.  Of course, it seems like when I start planning a bigger trip - like a weekend trip - the planning of it becomes a military action with maps strewn about and markers and sticky notes and coded clue pages strung together to create a route.  My LSS is getting a little tired of opening up paper maps to find them all marked up with letterboxes.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I'm wondering if there are features buried deep in AQ that I haven't found yet.  I lean toward thinking it is better for more urban boxing, but I'm curious what y'all think....</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I like how if you're planning a trip, you can use the trip planner to<br/>
search within XXX miles (you decide) of the Interstate and it'll find<br/>
the boxes for you.  I also like how if you search with a given city as<br/>
your centerpoint, you will find all the boxes within a X radius<br/>
(again, you decide), even if they're in another county, another LBNA<br/>
region designation, or another state. I loathe looking up boxes by<br/>
county--because my geography skills are not that precise--and because<br/>
I just don't think like that.  I want the boxes closest to where I'm<br/>
going to be.  I find flipping back and forth between regions on the<br/>
LBNA map, figuring out what cities are in which county, etc. to be a<br/>
huge time drain.  And, then, to find out that you missed a box you<br/>
were within 2 miles of, simply because it was in the "other" county. <br/>
Just Arrgh.<br/>
<br/>
So, with the recent upgrade of the mapping function on AQ, all you<br/>
have to do is put in an intersection or an address if there is one. <br/>
Sometimes it doesn't take the exact address, so I try to put in the<br/>
closest intersection.  Then, when someone clicks on the map link,<br/>
they're in the general area at least.  This is particularly helpful<br/>
for a sprawled out city like Houston, where boxes can be in the same<br/>
"city" but be 60 miles apart.  In a rural area, where the cities/towns<br/>
aren't so big, just using the closest town is good enough in my<br/>
opinion.  When I'm planning trips, I just want to know how far out of<br/>
my route a given box is, and the closest town pretty much tells me that.<br/>
<br/>
The funny thing is, people always say that AQ has more bells and<br/>
whistles, but I'm not really a bells and whistles techno-freak kind of<br/>
person.  What I am unabashedly is is a map geek.  I love maps, I like<br/>
to look at them, I study them, etc.  Thinking graphically is so much<br/>
more helpful (for me) than reading linear directions--take this<br/>
highway here, turn onto this one for .6 miles, etc--I'd rather see the<br/>
map myself and figure out how to get there.<br/>
<br/>
I would love it if there would be a little map that would pop up<br/>
showing you the locations of all the letterboxes.  I've seen that on<br/>
the geocaching site and I think it's great.  Ryan keeps upgrading AQ,<br/>
so maybe one day that site will get there.  <br/>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to have to play a little more with the mapping on AQ, but one thing I realize - I need to go back and make sure my address information is as good as it can be on AQ for those folks who rely on it.  I've kind of glossed over the address lines in the past.  And that's the big problem with either LB site - they rely on people to put in good data in the first place!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree about the regions being illogical.  Another example:  I have <br/>
an interest in West Texas because Midland is my hometown.  The "West <br/>
Texas Letterboxer", El Lobo, has placed boxes in Midland (Midland <br/>
County), Odessa (Ector County) and Stanton (Martin County).  Odessa <br/>
is 20 miles west of Midland and Stanton is 20 miles east of Midland <br/>
and the three counties are adjacent. According to the LbNA map, <br/>
Ector County is in West Texas, Midland is in Central Texas and <br/>
Martin County is in The Panhandle.  Another interesting thing is <br/>
that his Midland box is listed in the West Texas region (which is <br/>
logical), even though the map shows Midland County to be in Central <br/>
Texas.  It does get confusing and you have to be on your toes when <br/>
you're planning your letterboxing expedition, don't you?<br/>

&gt; give up paper maps even if we eventually get a site that works <br/>
perfectly - I<br/>
&gt; do think I like to be able to run my finger along the route and I <br/>
also like<br/>
&gt; being able to pan out and in visually instead of having to wait on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; computer to do it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm going to have to play a little more with the mapping on AQ, <br/>
but one<br/>
&gt; thing I realize - I need to go back and make sure my address <br/>
information is<br/>
&gt; as good as it can be on AQ for those folks who rely on it.  I've <br/>
kind of<br/>
&gt; glossed over the address lines in the past.  And that's the big <br/>
problem with<br/>
&gt; either LB site - they rely on people to put in good data in the <br/>
first<br/>
&gt; place!<br/>

&gt; &gt;    I like how if you're planning a trip, you can use the trip <br/>
planner to<br/>
&gt; &gt; search within XXX miles (you decide) of the Interstate and it'll <br/>
find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the boxes for you. I also like how if you search with a given <br/>
city as<br/>
&gt; &gt; your centerpoint, you will find all the boxes within a X radius<br/>
&gt; &gt; (again, you decide), even if they're in another county, another <br/>
LBNA<br/>
&gt; &gt; region designation, or another state. I loathe looking up boxes <br/>
by<br/>
&gt; &gt; county--because my geography skills are not that precise--and <br/>
because<br/>
&gt; &gt; I just don't think like that. I want the boxes closest to where <br/>
I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; going to be. I find flipping back and forth between regions on <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; LBNA map, figuring out what cities are in which county, etc. to <br/>
be a<br/>
&gt; &gt; huge time drain. And, then, to find out that you missed a box you<br/>
&gt; &gt; were within 2 miles of, simply because it was in the "other" <br/>
county.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Just Arrgh.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, with the recent upgrade of the mapping function on AQ, all <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to do is put in an intersection or an address if there is <br/>
one.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes it doesn't take the exact address, so I try to put in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; closest intersection. Then, when someone clicks on the map link,<br/>
&gt; &gt; they're in the general area at least. This is particularly <br/>
helpful<br/>
&gt; &gt; for a sprawled out city like Houston, where boxes can be in the <br/>
same<br/>
&gt; &gt; "city" but be 60 miles apart. In a rural area, where the <br/>
cities/towns<br/>
&gt; &gt; aren't so big, just using the closest town is good enough in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; opinion. When I'm planning trips, I just want to know how far <br/>
out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; my route a given box is, and the closest town pretty much tells <br/>
me that.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The funny thing is, people always say that AQ has more bells and<br/>
&gt; &gt; whistles, but I'm not really a bells and whistles techno-freak <br/>
kind of<br/>
&gt; &gt; person. What I am unabashedly is is a map geek. I love maps, I <br/>
like<br/>
&gt; &gt; to look at them, I study them, etc. Thinking graphically is so <br/>
much<br/>
&gt; &gt; more helpful (for me) than reading linear directions--take this<br/>
&gt; &gt; highway here, turn onto this one for .6 miles, etc--I'd rather <br/>
see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; map myself and figure out how to get there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I would love it if there would be a little map that would pop up<br/>
&gt; &gt; showing you the locations of all the letterboxes. I've seen that <br/>
on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the geocaching site and I think it's great. Ryan keeps upgrading <br/>
AQ,<br/>
&gt; &gt; so maybe one day that site will get there.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And now that I have, I have a question. When you, dewberry (or<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone else<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that prefers AQ over LBNA), say you like AQ better for mapping <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; search<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; capabilities, are you referring to the mapping on the clue <br/>
