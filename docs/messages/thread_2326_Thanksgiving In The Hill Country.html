                    <div class="plaintext-content">While Barefoot Lucy was camping in Arkansas, my family and I were <br/>
visiting relatives in Austin.  On the way up, I finally got a chance to <br/>
visit McKinney Roughs Park just outside Bastrop.  The weather was <br/>
perfect for hiking and it was a great place for it.  I managed to hide <br/>
a box there to entice some of you to visit.  It is one of the Lower <br/>
Colorado River Authority Parks and I plan to visit others in the future.<br/>
<br/>
While in Austin, I did not think I would get a chance to letterbox <br/>
since I wanted to spend time with relatives, but as luck would have it <br/>
a new letterbox was posted the day after Thanksgiving that was less <br/>
than 1 mile from where I was staying!  Luckily I had Internet access <br/>
and just happened to check New Letterboxes and there it was.  So, I <br/>
told everyone I was going to walk off all the turkey and headed to the <br/>
box.  Needless to say I was First Finder and I felt fortunate, indeed.<br/>
<br/>
That night we drove part of the Hill Country Christmas Trail to see all <br/>
the lights and it was great, as usual.  We have done this a few times <br/>
before and I highly recommend it.  From Austin we drove on Hwy 71 <br/>
toward Marble Falls and stopped at a scenic winery called Stone House.  <br/>
It was a nice place but we got there too late to stay long.  In Marble <br/>
Falls I tried to find the 2 boxes that have been there for years but <br/>
failed on both.  We then ate at Blue Bonnett Cafe and had good ole <br/>
Country Cooking.  It is ranked as the number 1 place to eat breakfast <br/>
in TX by at least 1 magazine and you can have breakfast any time of day.<br/>
After eating it was finally dark enough to see the lights, so we drove <br/>
down to the river park where they put all kinds of decorations.  The <br/>
whole thing is free (donations requested) and well worth a visit.  As we<br/>
left town heading south to Johnson City, the view of all the lights <br/>
reflecting on the river was spectacular!<br/>
<br/>
Johnson City is my favorite place to see Christmas lights and it did<br/>
not disappoint.  The courthouse is covered in lights and the area around<br/>
LBJ Birthplace is amazing, with lights going all the way up huge trees<br/>
in white, red and green.  There is even a free hayride to see it all.<br/>
We then headed back to Austin ready for Christmas to arrive.<br/>
<br/>
Before heading home I did manage to find a few boxes in Zilker Park <br/>
while my wife shopped downtown, and they were a lot of fun.  All in all<br/>
it was a great Thanksgiving and I hope all of you have a great one, too!<br/>

<div>I LOVE the Bluebonnet Cafe - especially their PIES. I've been trying to talk my husband into a drive down to the Hill Country by enticing him with pie at the Bluebonnet cafe! Now I really want to go see the lights at the LBJ Ranch too.</div>

Did you see any blood spatter?  Apparently some of those trees have it<br/>
in for certain letterboxers-who-shall-remain nameless!<br/>

It's such a great outdoor/restaurant/movie/music/shopping town.  <br/>

After moving to Amarillo a couple of months ago I went back to Austin<br/>
for Thanksgiving and got in some boxing at Zilker Park.  Apparently I<br/>

Also got to go to the new Ikea in Round Rock.  Mmmmm... Ikea...<br/>
