nasty from Houston.<br>
<br>
Just wanted to let everyone know that this is one fine<br>
group of folks! Thanks for all the work everyone put<br>
in to make it happen: Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, the<br>
Celtic Lions, Boxdn, and everyone else that made it<br>
wonderful by carving stamps, placing boxes, driving<br>
long (and short) distances and making the time to<br>
attend, finding boxes, making food, telling great<br>
stories, sharing travelers and personal stamps,<br>
reserving areas, being creative, designing CLUE<br>
booklets, finding prizes, etc., etc., etc. It takes a<br>
LOT of work by a lot of people to make something like<br>
this happen, and it was just FANTASTIC FUN!!!!<br>
<br>
I am so glad I got to meet people that I have chased<br>
on the trail and heard from through email. It's always<br>
nice to put a name with a face. I am still looking<br>
through my books of new stamps and marveling at the<br>
quality, quantity, and people behind the stamps. All<br>
y'all are good people!<br>

<div>Since there are some new members on the TaDa list, I just wanted to make sure you knew about it. There are a lot of people signed up so it should be a wonderful opportunity to get to meet all those boxers you haven't had to the opportunity to meet before and see some old friends as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can sign up for the potluck at this site: <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TA_DA/database?method=reportRows&amp;tbl=1">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/TA_DA/database?method=reportRows&amp;tbl=1</a> or just show up and bring a little something for the "feast".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Beneficus Rex, can you tell us where we are meeting. Is there a pavilion reserved or what?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, it's a lot of fun for the attendees if you can slip up to the area before the event and hide a box or two. The theme is Camelot, but your box can be anything you want it to be!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking forward to seeing everyone there!</div>

I'll be thinking about all of that great food and letterboxing that <br>
will be going on.  I will be letterboxing in the Sacramento area in <br>
between bowling.<br>
