I've been working on this German Immigrant trail series for a while <br/>
now, and I think I've finally got a good idea on how to procede.  <br/>
There are six identical historical markers commemorating German <br/>
immigrants and the founding of New Braunfels.  One of each marker is <br/>
located in Indianola, Victoria, Cuero, Gonzales, Segiun, and New <br/>
Braunfels.  A box will be hidden in each city and each set of clues <br/>
will start at that marker. Now for the advice part...<br/>
<br/>
While researching, I came across a great and heartbreaking first <br/>
hand story of one immigrant who travelled this path.  My idea is to <br/>
devide the story into six parts and put multiple copies of one part <br/>
in the pertinent box.  The stamps I'm working on also relate to that <br/>
part of the story. The finders could take a copy from each box. Once <br/>
you find all six boxes, you will have collected the entire story.  <br/>
<br/>
What do you all think about that?  Would it be worth it to you?  <br/>
Would the suspense be too much to take?  Would you care about the <br/>
story or just getting the stamps?  <br/>
<br/>
I thought about leaving a codeword on the inside of the box for the <br/>
finder to email me and I would then send that section of story. <br/>
Maybe that would be a good backup if all the copies get taken. <br/>
<br/>
I couldn't get to Seguin or NB very often for maintenance, so I was <br/>
hoping to find a caretaker for those two.<br/>
<br/>
So much to think about.  This idea has haunted me since I found <br/>
Silver Eagle's "French Flag" box.<br/>

Technically you could do it in a day if that's all you did.  Each <br/>
town is pretty evenly spaced with about 30 minutes of drive time <br/>
from one to the next.  It might be more of a weekend thing, or get <br/>
them as you come across them.  Each town has a little something to <br/>
offer so I'd hate to rush.<br/>

WOW, Monkeytoes! This sounds like a fantastic idea! I would take off <br/>
and search for them as much, if not more, for the continuing story <br/>
aspect, as for the stamps. And yes, leave a code word in case the <br/>
copies are gone from the boxes. But do leave copies in the boxes <br/>
because when I find the boxes I want to read the installment right <br/>
away, in the area where it actually happened. This is just such a <br/>
creative idea - a whole new dimension to letterboxing here. <br/>

<tt>I've been working on this German Immigrant trail
series for a while </tt><br/>
<tt>now, and I think I've finally got a good idea on
how to procede.  </tt><br/>
<tt>There are six identical historical markers
commemorating German </tt><br/>
<tt>immigrants and the founding of New
Braunfels.  One of each marker is </tt><br/>
<tt>located in Indianola, Victoria, Cuero, Gonzales,
Segiun, and New </tt><br/>
<tt>Braunfels.  A box will be hidden in each city
and each set of clues </tt><br/>
<tt>will start at that marker. Now for the advice
part...</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>While researching, I came across a great and
heartbreaking first </tt><br/>
<tt>hand story of one immigrant who travelled this
path.  My idea is to </tt><br/>
<tt>devide the story into six parts and put multiple
copies of one part </tt><br/>
<tt>in the pertinent box.  The stamps I'm working
on also relate to that </tt><br/>
<tt>part of the story. The finders could take a copy
from each box. Once </tt><br/>
<tt>you find all six boxes, you will have collected
the entire story.  </tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>What do you all think about that?  Would it
be worth it to you?  </tt><br/>
<tt>Would the suspense be too much to take? 
Would you care about the </tt><br/>
<tt>story or just getting the stamps?  </tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I thought about leaving a codeword on the inside
of the box for the </tt><br/>
<tt>finder to email me and I would then send that
section of story. </tt><br/>
<tt>Maybe that would be a good backup if all the
copies get taken. </tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I couldn't get to Seguin or NB very often for
maintenance, so I was </tt><br/>
<tt>hoping to find a caretaker for those two.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>So much to think about.  This idea has

Thank you all for your input.  It looks like you like the idea, so <br/>
I'm going ahead with it.  I've already carved two stamps , and am <br/>
working on a third.  The story has been transcribed and divided.  I <br/>
probably won't be able to get to New Braunfels until Spring/Summer <br/>
but I may plant the others before then.  When I do, I'll take <br/>
Corazon up on her gracious offer.  Thanks to all,<br/>
