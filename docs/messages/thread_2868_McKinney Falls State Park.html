you, what do the regulations say about letterboxing specifically <br/>

state parks, or does each park decide on its own?  I'm being <br/>
serious, because I know I need to be educated on the subject, as <br/>
does, obviusly, anyone else who has a box in a Texas state park.  <br/>
Can you get the permit applications through the mail or online?  <br/>
Since letterboxes don't have gps coordinates, do you have to furnish <br/>
the clues to the ranger?  Do you have to place it first, then wait <br/>
for approval and, if so, how long does the process take?  Share your <br/>
expertise on the subject with us if you don't mind.<br/>

&gt; Let me ask you,<br/>
&gt; what do the regulations say about letterboxing specifically (not<br/>
&gt; geocaching)?  Are their letteboxing rules the same for all state<br/>
&gt; parks, or does each park decide on its own? <br/>
<br/>
I'm here in Florida, which may be ahead of you guys on this subject.  <br/>
When the bureaucrats in charge of the state parks, forests, wildlife <br/>
management areas, etc., first heard about geocaching and <br/>
letterboxing, they came up with a permit process.  I initially <br/>
accepted this and applied for some permits for some of my existing <br/>
boxes.  After several months, I eventually actually received the <br/>
permits, and spent a couple of days driving around to my caches <br/>
applying these little stickers under the lid.<br/>
<br/>
Since then, they've piled on more and more regulations.  Each <br/>
organization -- there are several separate state organizations <br/>
involved -- has its own version of the regulations, but basically all <br/>
of them:<br/>
<br/>
A) stipulate that the owner is responsible for any objectionable <br/>
materials inside the container.  If you own a geocache and some <br/>
visitor drops off a pocket knife, it's your fault.<br/>
<br/>
B) clarify that the owner is responsible for any litter in the <br/>
vicinity of the hide.<br/>
<br/>
C) require that the owner visit the hide at least once a month.  A <br/>
couple of them require a visit every two weeks.<br/>
<br/>
D) require that you reapply annually for new permits, and go out and <br/>
apply the stickers inside the container.<br/>
<br/>
As much as I appreciate all the good things the park officials do for <br/>
us, I eventually decided that such tangles of red tape are not what I <br/>
became a geocacher and letterboxer for.  I will never again apply for <br/>
a permit.<br/>
<br/>
With geocaching, that means I won't be planting any in such areas, <br/>
and when my existing permits expire I will be pulling those caches.  <br/>
Someone else is welcome to hide in those areas and deal with the <br/>
permit process.  With letterboxes I have the additional option of <br/>
hiding a box and not telling the authorities.  That works, but <br/>
unfortunately very few letterboxers find the clues either so I don't <br/>
get many finders.<br/>

ask what their policy is.  I know they allow geocaches, to the point <br/>
that they hand out a list of the geocaches in the park, along with <br/>
gps coordinates.  Of course, I want mention anyone else's <br/>
letterboxes, just find out what I need to do in order to place a box.<br/>

  was letterboxing-<wbr/>specific. I don't want to <br/>antagonize anyone, just 
  searching for the truth. If the <br/>restrictions are too severe, I just won't 
  place any more boxes in <br/>state parks. I'm going to Mission Tejas SP Monday 
  and I'm going to <br/>ask what their policy is. I know they allow geocaches, to 
  the point <br/>that they hand out a list of the geocaches in the park, along 
  with <br/>gps coordinates. Of course, I want mention anyone else's 
  <br/>letterboxes, just find out what I need to do in order to place a 
  box.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>,

  rule - it is a state rule. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It was brought about by a 
  geocacher who put his cache on a cliff. <br/>One of<br/>&gt; the cache hunters 
  tried for it and decided it was too dangerous. <br/>He<br/>&gt; reported it to 
  the rangers. The rangers agreed.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The owner was asked to move 
  it to a safer place. He refused to <br/>move it when<br/>&gt; asked to do so. He 
  started a smear campaign against the ranger <br/>who asked<br/>&gt; him to move 
  the cache to a safer location. The complaints were <br/>investigated<br/>&gt; 
  all the way to Austin. They were found groundless, but suddenly <br/>our 
  games<br/>&gt; were on the radar scope.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So they asked him to 
  remove it totally and they banned him from <br/>the parks.<br/>&gt; He refused. 
  This went on for 6 months and nearly got <br/>all "scavenger" games<br/>&gt; 
  banned in all Texas parks. Geocachers lobbied long and hard, and <br/>the 
  "form"<br/>&gt; was the best compromise they could get. The meeting sorta went 
  -<br/>"take the<br/>&gt; forms or be banned".<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The form is the 
  same for all 4 state parks in the El Paso area. I <br/>have not<br/>&gt; 
  investigated parks outside my area - but I am told the form is a <br/>state 
  form<br/>&gt; and is the same all through Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I am sorry 
  you seem to think the rules don't need to be followed <br/>if you are<br/>&gt; 
  not a geocacher. You do as you see fit. If enough letterboxers <br/>just 
  put<br/>&gt; their boxes in parks and don't bother with the rules, eventually 
  <br/>the state<br/>&gt; will see the wisdom of the placers and just get rid of 
  the form. <br/>Right?<br/>&gt; Work with them - or work against them.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; I've said my piece. You do as you see fit, you'll hear nothing 
  <br/>more about<br/>&gt; it from me.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike -

  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The way I look at it, my clues are posted on the Internet, 
  which <br/>&gt; doesn't fit the description of "using stealth". If the ranger 
  has <br/>&gt; nothing better to do than search the web for my letterboxes, 
  <br/>that's <br/>&gt; his business, and I'll accept the loss. I am assuming that 
  you <br/>have <br/>&gt; letterboxes in more than one state park, so, obviously, 
  and I mean <br/>&gt; this respectfully, you are the expert on the subject. Let 
  me ask <br/>&gt; you, what do the regulations say about letterboxing 
  specifically <br/>&gt; (not geocaching)? Are their letteboxing rules the same 
  for all <br/>&gt; state parks, or does each park decide on its own? I'm being 
  <br/>&gt; serious, because I know I need to be educated on the subject, as 
  <br/>&gt; does, obviusly, anyone else who has a box in a Texas state park. 
  <br/>&gt; Can you get the permit applications through the mail or online? 
  <br/>&gt; Since letterboxes don't have gps coordinates, do you have to 
  <br/>furnish <br/>&gt; the clues to the ranger? Do you have to place it first, 
  then wait <br/>&gt; for approval and, if so, how long does the process take? 
  Share <br/>your <br/>&gt; expertise on the subject with us if you don't 
  mind.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In letterboxingtexas@

  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmmmmm . . . why?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Everybody has 
  some rules. If you play within the rules, it <br/>&gt; works. I have a<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; number of letterboxes and geocaches inside Texas Parks. They <br/>have 
  <br/>&gt; been<br/>&gt; &gt; there - some of them for 5 or more years. The 
  rangers keep an <br/>eye <br/>&gt; on them<br/>&gt; &gt; for me too - cause I 
  play by their rules. If you don't like the <br/>&gt; rules, you<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  can place your letterbox anywhere that the rules suit you.<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; Some use stealth and hope they are not caught. I use open dialog 
  <br/>&gt; and don't<br/>&gt; &gt; worry about being caught. They are happy to 
  see me the rangers <br/>&gt; and I get<br/>&gt; &gt; along well. I even put a 
  geocache/letterbox within sight of the <br/>&gt; ranger<br/>&gt; &gt; station. 
  It is called Make the Ranger Smile. And they do..... <br/>&gt; when 
  they<br/>&gt; &gt; see someone circling the bushes out there, they just know 
  what <br/>&gt; they are<br/>&gt; &gt; doing.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; All in 
  the way you look at it I guess. At least they gave you 60 <br/>&gt; days 
  to<br/>&gt; &gt; pick it up - they could have just tossed it in the 
  trash.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Mike - KD9KC.<br/>&gt; &gt;
