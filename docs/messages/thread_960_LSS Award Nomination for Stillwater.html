                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, those of you who have a Long-Suffering Spouse, raise your hands!<br>
<br>
My husband (Stillwater) is the best of companions for letterboxing - left to<br>
his own devices, I don't think he would continue in the sport, but he's<br>
always ready to jump in the car and go hunt boxes. He often is the one who<br>
actually finds them, because he seems to have far better instincts than I do<br>
for directions, and often has a fresh approach to the clues.<br>
Yesterday, though, he earned a special Long Suffering Spouse award...<br>
We went to downtown Dallas to replace the Shawnee Trail box - in a little<br>
park called Pioneer Plaza. It's a spectacular place for photographs, so it<br>
is often busy with tourists - and it's a kid magnet because of the stepping<br>
stones across water and huge bronze statues of longhorns.<br>
I hit on the brilliant idea (IMHO)of bringing Stumpy the Sock Monkey to take<br>
his photo there...if you haven't heard of Stumpy, he is a traveling Sock<br>
Monkey belonging to TX letterboxer MonkeyToes, and he has skirted the U.S.,<br>
having his photo taken at various historical and otherwise interesting<br>
places.<br>
So...please picture my L.S.S., trying to prop Stumpy up in various<br>
attractive poses on top of the gigantic bronze longhorns in this very public<br>
park....as groups of tourists from other countries watched in stunned<br>
silence. (Don't tell my husband, but I actually saw someone taking a photo<br>
of HIM, posing the sock monkey...can you imagine the commentary when that<br>
tourist returns to his hometown with documentation of weird & scary<br>
Americans?)<br>
<br>
(Oh yes, and we relocated the Shawnee Trail box...but I was still laughing<br>
so hard that Stillwater actually had to do that, too...)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My husband needs to belong to this club too!  I've<br>
never asked him to pose anything, but I'll bet he<br>
would!  What a great guy Stillwater must be...<br>
<br>
My LSS loves to hike, but for whatever reason hasn't<br>
quite latched on to LB'ing.  He'll go and he'll not<br>
complain, especially if we all agree to make it a long<br>
hike and not a short hop.<br>
<br>
He too is actually probably a better letterboxer than<br>
I am in terms of skills it takes, but he blithely adds<br>
his suggestions only after the rest of us have tried<br>
for a bit- almost like he is secretly taking pleasure<br>
in our fervent efforts to find a box when to him it is<br>
soooo clear where it is.  I'm envious of his ability<br>
to home in on a box without ever actually digging for<br>
it.<br>
<br>
I don't really know what motivates him to keep going<br>
with us, but I'm really glad he does.  I've noticed,<br>
though, that he's happy enough to let me carry the<br>
backpack.  <br>
<br>
I've asked him before to check on boxes for me when I<br>
know he's hiking near where one of mine is, and he<br>
does it-without complaint.  I asked him to give me<br>
carving supplies for my birthday the first year I<br>
boxed, and he went out and found every possible tool<br>
and material that was available in our area - and<br>
spent a lot more on it than I would've ever done for<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
Just when I thought I wasn't going to get to go to the<br>
Brazos Bend gathering because of a collision of<br>
circumstances, he pulled it out for me, took on extra<br>
duty, and MADE me go and told me not to feel guilty<br>
for leaving him with all I left him with.<br>
<br>
But still, I think Stillwater should have the LSS of<br>
the Year award for accepting without complaint the<br>
assignment of being made to look silly in the interest<br>
of letterboxing.<br>

<div>I personally understand totally. My ex has a sock monkey his mother made for him when he was born. He, and the monkey will celebrate their 52nd birthday in a couple of months. When I was pregnant, I asked my mother-in-law (a wonderful woman, whom I loved dearly, and who died of cancer when my son was 2) to make a sock monkey for The Patriot. She did, and I have two very treasured photos- one of my ex, at age 3 mos laying next to his sock monkey, and one of my son, age 3 mos, laying with his dad's sock monkey on one side and his own on the other side! </div>

Reminds me of a similar situation when we were taking pictures of  <br>
Flat Stanley. . .standing there holding a paper doll and taking  <br>

I think Shawnee Trail gets the award for MOST urban box in Texas (or  <br>
at least a top contender). There's seems to always be people around  <br>
there.<br>

<div>LOVE the Shawnee Trail box and was so sad when it went missing, because 
that's the first one I took MY husband back to see.  Not only is the 
sculpture just magnificent, but the old cemetery is interesting too, and the 
fact that both are smack in the center of downtown Dallas, well, that's just a 
wonderful location.  And then, the stamp was beautiful and the LB cleverly 
placed, so I am so glad I can now send (or take) Puddle-Splasher there as soon 
as she's here and begins her TX LB odyssey!  GREAT!  -- oh, and the 
sock monkey story is too good.  I've had the same experiences with Flat 
Lauren (based on Flat Stanley, only named for the little girl it represents) all 
over NE last fall, nearly risking my neck to pose FL everywhere!  --

<div>That's such a great story, Ruby Tuesday!  My own LSS hasn't had to 
enjoy anything quite like that, but I'm guessing he would - he's a good sport, 
too.  </div>
<div>Why do you think it is that the one who is less involved or interested in 
letterboxing, who doesn't research all the clues and locate the areas to 
letterbox and plan the outings and bring along all the stuff is the very person 
who can listen to the clues or look at them once and say, why, it's right over

                    <div class="plaintext-content">While my LSS is not into the LBing at all, he listens quietly as <br>
the kids and I ramble on about our latest finds and tell all our <br>
friends/family about our newest hobby.  LSS hears the same stories <br>
over and over, but manages to smile and look interested.  He even <br>
waits in the car sometimes while we dash to a box nearby.  <br>
We too had an encounter with Flat Stanley and LSS was a real sport <br>
about F. S. (as LSS travels for a living and was asked to take <br>
Flat Stanley on one of his travels).  By the end of the trip, Flat <br>
Stanley had flown a plane, served drinks and peanuts to passengers <br>
(because the Flight Attendants thought it was too cute), had gone <br>
to Canada, Mexico, through customs, wore a sombrero, hung out at a <br>
hotel restaurant/bar and wore an oxygen mask on the plane.  All <br>
with photographs to prove that LSS is a softie at heart!  Maybe <br>
one day he'll get the hang of LBing.  If for nothing else than to <br>
get me to button my lip about all the neat places we find during <br>
our hunts!!<br>
