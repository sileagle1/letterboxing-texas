                    <div class="plaintext-content">     I  got a chance to get out in the fresh air today. I headed <br/>
down to Martin Creek Lake SP to replace my Daffodil box. They have <br/>
changed a lot in the area of the Daffodil since I planted it,so that <br/>
is why no one could find it. The signs are changed and there is a <br/>
small clearing there now. I did find the box intact and it is <br/>
waiting for the next boxer to stamp in it. I had a replacement box, <br/>
but thankfully I did not need it. The clue has been updated. I am <br/>
sorry several of you did not get that stamp. If anyone wants it, I <br/>
can sen you a picture of it throuhg email. Just let me know. <br/>
    I also replaced a cracked box at Harmony Hills. I tried very <br/>
hard to re-plant the Great Texas Ballon Race Box, but it will have <br/>
to wait for another day. The sun went down before I could find a <br/>
safe place. Hopefully I will get back to it soon. While in Longview, <br/>
we saw several hot air ballons in the sky! I am not sure why they <br/>
were up but, I loved seeing them! <br/>
    I have two more boxes to place so look for new clues soon. One <br/>
for Smith County and one for Rusk County. It was a beautiful day and <br/>
I loved walking the trails on a cool Saturday morning.<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
