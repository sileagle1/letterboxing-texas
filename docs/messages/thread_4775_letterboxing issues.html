</p><div>I haven't posted too often recently, because I have enjoyed seeing "new voices" being established on the Texas list. I love that it is growing and more people are becoming actively involved. I like discussions like the one currently going on. My only 2 cents is just to suggest that as letterboxers, we continue to have fun, and not to take things too seriously (with the exception of respecting each other and each other's boxes). We have two really super letterboxing sites where we can gather information and clues, and really there's no point in picking a favorite. I like them both - I use them both. When I first started letterboxing (eight or so years ago?), I was thrilled to find LBNA, then a year or so later, was also thrilled to discover AQ. Both wonderful! Enjoy.... have fun.... respect each other.... take care of all the boxes!</div>
