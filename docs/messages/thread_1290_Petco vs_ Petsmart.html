                    <div class="plaintext-content">Both of them sell birds, fish, small mammals &amp; reptiles.  Petsmart <br/>
used to not sell any animals at all, but then they started about 10 <br/>
years ago too.  We probably don't want to get into the ethics of <br/>
this on this list.<br/>
<br/>
I worked for an animal shelter for a while and they were both <br/>
relatively good corporate citizens--hosting adopt a shelter animal <br/>
fairs and helping us raise money, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Now that Kroger and Target carry the specific kind of IAMS I like, I <br/>
never go to either.<br/>

&gt; Actually, I believe I made a mistake on that. Sorry. :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Petco was in trouble with PETA for a long time - they sold <br/>
animals and had<br/>
&gt; many poor practices with animals suffering. I believe now though <br/>
they have<br/>
&gt; come around and PETA supports them for new policies and <br/>
procedures - I hadn<br/>
&gt; t realized things had changed.)<br/>

&gt; This is off the letterboxing subject, but wanted to let you all <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; that our Hawk could use a bit of help.  Her household has grown <br/>
&gt; exponentially as she is now sheltering her cousin &amp; several other <br/>
&gt; friends from NO who have been left temporarily (?) homeless, along <br/>
&gt; with their animals (although they are still trying to locate some <br/>
&gt; animals who had to be left behind).  First she had to go through <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; ordeal of trying to find them (they ended up in San Antonio), so <br/>
I'm <br/>
&gt; sure you can imagine what this has been like.  Just one story in <br/>
many, <br/>
&gt; of course, but one that has affected someone we know.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They are doing their best to get along.  However, if anyone wanted <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; assist with gift cards to places like Kroger, Walmart, Target, <br/>
PETCO, <br/>
&gt; or a gas station know that the human and animal companions sharing <br/>
&gt; Hawk's Aerie would be very appreciative.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just email me off-list and I'll give you a ma! iling address.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>
