                    <div class="plaintext-content">Both of them sell birds, fish, small mammals & reptiles.  Petsmart <br>
used to not sell any animals at all, but then they started about 10 <br>
years ago too.  We probably don't want to get into the ethics of <br>
this on this list.<br>
<br>
I worked for an animal shelter for a while and they were both <br>
relatively good corporate citizens--hosting adopt a shelter animal <br>
fairs and helping us raise money, etc.<br>
<br>
Now that Kroger and Target carry the specific kind of IAMS I like, I <br>
never go to either.<br>
