getting our LB season going!  I have been enjoying your great state and <br/>
thought I'd stop in to say hi while I had a minute.  <br/>
<br/>
I wish I had more time for boxing.  I did manage to find all four of <br/>
the boxes in Greenville the other day.  I haven't even had a moment <br/>
since then though.  I hope to get at least two tomorrow.  If I have <br/>
more time I will venture out further.  I have no idea what the schedule <br/>
is though since I'm here for a musical performance that has taken most <br/>
of my time.  I just wanted to say thanks for your Texas hospitality.  I <br/>
have had several very nice responses from a few letterboxers from <br/>
around here.  You guys are great!<br/>
