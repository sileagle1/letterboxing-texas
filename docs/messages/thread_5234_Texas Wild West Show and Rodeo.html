<div>Hi, everybody!  I had not initially listed the Texas Wild West Show 
and Rodeo on either letterboxing forum, thinking it was a box for only those 
in-the-know.  But, now I have listed it on AQ and LBNA.  So, you may 
officially list your finds, if you’d like.  -- Bell

                    <html><body><p>The show arrived in Spring this morning.  We set up on the old Mercer place, on the banks of Cypress Creek, in the woods that they call the Arboretum.  We turned into the Arboretum off of old Aldine-Westfield Road and drove back to the old settlers grounds, commonly known as the picnic area, parked near the outhouses and the kids play area.  Looking for a suitable place, we checked out the trails in the area.  We found the signpost behind where all the covered tables are gittin' set up for chow and took the trail to the Hawthorne Loop on the left, then took a right at the "Y" and continued on to the the next "T".  We got out of the wagon and walked up the loop to the left for about 90 steps and saw a good spot on the left, about 15 steps into the woods.  There was a good-lookin' fellow standing there, and he introduced himself to us as Sterling Seagull, right nice fellow.  He said he reckoned that was as good a spot as any.  When he found out we was a Wild West Show and Rodeo, he said he could use some work and had some experience locally as a rodeo clown. I told him I didn't think we'd be here that long.  If any of y'all out there want to meet the stars of the rodeo, you'd best hurry.  We could be movin' out agin any time now. </p><p><br/></p><p>Boots</p> <div class="ygroups-quoted"><br/><br/>--- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/><div><div>From the San Jacinto News, Saturday, September 7, 1893</div><div><br/></div>"The last performance of the Texas Wild West Show and Rodeo was held this afternoon, and it was a good one.  The Bearback competition was special, and featured that great cowboy, IRA "Ghost" Ryder, to the great amusement of the rodeo clown.  The troup will be packing up this weekend for their next engagement, which will be in the little town of Spring on Cypress Creek.  If you missed it in Coldspring, you might plan on catching it in Spring.  More news will follow."<div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></div></body></html>

<div>Well I just couldn't leave them out there is this rain!!! They are pretty ornery this morning. I was hoping to get Basketcase's box at the same time but that is clearly not going to happen in this downpour... Time for some coffee and towels.

<p>This motley crew has now overstayed its welcome and is anxiously awaiting an invitation to its next engagement.  I really wanted to leave them at the Lewisville Rodeo Arena, but didn't really see anywhere nearby that I felt comfortable with.  So I decided to leave it in in the vicinity of a seldom-visited box that I planted nearby in the Fox-Hembry Cemetery.  </p><p><span>To get to the cemetery:  From I35E, take the Valley Ridge exit (#453).  Go East on Valley Ridge to Mill Street.  Turn left on Mill Street.  Just before you get to the overhead railroad tracks there is a gravel road (Whitmore Lane) on the left.  It's easy to miss and comes right after you turn onto Mill Street.  You'll have to make a u-turn to get to it. This gravel road will lead right to the Fox-Hembry Cemetery.  You can't miss it.     The box is underneath some evergreen boughs at the right side of the gate.<br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Please let us know when the Show has accepted its next engagement.  I'm a little nervous that the cemetery is past due for some landscaping and don't really want to leave it out there very long.</span></p><p><br/></p><p>Basketcase!</p><p><span></span></p><br/><p></p><p></p>

If you are interested in a visit from a local rodeo just keep reading... <br/>
<br/>
Just head on over to the Longview Rodeo Arena.  <br/>
<br/>
Enter the Maud Cobb Convention Center from the West Cotton street entrance.  Look around until you find the gazebo on the Maude Cobb grounds and the pond.  Go to the gazebo and admire the view and realize that this is where you need to have some family photos taken next time everyone is in town.<br/>
<br/>
Once you have completed the admiring of the view proceed to leave the gazebo and turn to the right and walk down the sidewalk.  Immediately after you have turned to the right after exiting the gazebo look to the right and notice that there is a large round bush with a second bush that is taller sticking out of the same area.  Nestled in the middle of the bushes is a concrete bench... Sit down on the bench and the box is directly behind you when you are sitting on the bench.  It might be easier to go around to the other side and tucked up under between the two bushed you will find the rowdy crew chomping at the bit for the next adventurous crew member.<br/>

Happy Hunting,<br/>

This is Echo I found the Wild West show and Rodeo just about 20 minutes ago in Longview, Texas. My friend Stitches of Longview has eagerly been awaiting the box.Due to family issues she is out of town so I am taking care of the box and will be carving a stamp and waiting for Stitches to return so she can do her part.<br/>
Thanks for sharing with the Piney Woods of East Texas. Sometimes we feel lonely way out here in the land of pine trees and lakes.<br/>
If you climb in the saddle, be ready for the ride.     (Old cowboy quote)<br/>
So when the Wild West Show is ready to ride I will let ya know!<br/>
