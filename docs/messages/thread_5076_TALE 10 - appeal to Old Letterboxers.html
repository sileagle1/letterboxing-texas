                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I worked through 2 years of old post to this talk list to find emails for old boxers and see if we could get them to come to TALE 10.  Unfortunately most of the emails failed, thus no longer active and I have no way to reach them.   If anyone has contact with any of our old friends please send them a special invite to join us next year!<br/>
<br/>
Also, working on place to eat Friday night, but Smithville probably does not have a place that can handle our group (or close at 5pm - BBQ place I was going to check in on).  So, will probably either do Roadhouse just outside of Bastrop SP entry, or something in Bastrop.   Please share any suggestions you may have!!!<br/>
<br/>
Not many signed up for the event.  Hopefully that will change as we get closer.   Can't wait!   <br/>
