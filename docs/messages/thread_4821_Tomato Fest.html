                    <html><body><p>I'm so glad everyone had fun at yesterday's event! I had a great time planning it, especially since I had a "team" this year - my Mom, NacTrailCat (this IS her correct trail name!), was great help for those midnight (or later) moments when I woke up with ideas and needed some help figuring things out - a quick email to her and she came through with ideas! She came up with several of the "quest ideas" and the images that I carved. Draconis viridis, who has been my constant letterboxing compadre since we started this insanity, was his normal laid-back calm self who understands letterboxing and letterboxers AND his mom - I would bounce ideas off him and he would say "Interesting", or "Ummm...Mom?" or "Nice!" And Happy Feet, SJZ's boyfriend who has only recently been introduced by us to letterboxing but who seems to have gotten a handle on it and was ready and willing to help any way I asked of him. He had a great time yesterday! Happy Feet and d'vir were both on the ready to jump in the car with letterboxers if they needed help finding parks or locations, or to go bail someone out if they needed some help at the festival, or whatever was needed.<br/>
<br/>I thought that maybe those of you who weren't there would like to hear a little about the event: The premise this year was a scavenger hunt followed by a treasure hunt. Letterboxers participated as teams and had to work together to achieve 12 "quests" (list following) to earn the clues to five letterboxes. In the past, I've hidden boxes in the festival area, but we had so many letterboxers originally RSVP'd for the event that I was hesitant to hide boxes for so many people to find in such a high traffic area. SO - boxers had to work their quests at the festival, then were able to leave and find boxes in the community.<br/>
<br/>Here's a list of the list of quests:<br/><br/>
</p><p><span></span></p>
<ol start="1" type="1"><li><span>Find the event
     registration table  there you go, one down already!</span></li><li><span>Make a donation
     to our local food pantry.<span> </span>I HOPE
     you will recognize their booth when you see it.<span> </span>Tell em Wendy sent you.</span></li><li><span>One member of
     your team must present themselves to the dunking booth as the Mayor of
     Dartmoor and ask if they may sit in the dunking booth for one time slot.
     (THIS COUNTS AS TWO QUESTS)</span></li><li><span><span></span>Identify a local elected official and ask
     them to autograph your tomato.</span></li><li><span>Ask one of the
     street vendors to show you their loveliest hat  in Spanish.</span></li><li><span>Have a team
     photo taken in front of the nocturnally illuminated indigenous symbol of
     kinsmanship.</span></li><li><span>Have a team
     photo taken of the team red carding a soccer referee.</span></li><li><span>Kiss a fish.</span></li>
<li><span>Find Boogie Butt
     and show him your best disco moves.<span>
</span>Get him to sign your tomato.</span></li><li><span>Take a team
     picture with a news team or news reporter.<span>
</span>Get them to sign your tomato.</span></li><li><span>Talk to the
     tomato vendors and get them to tell you ten tomato varieties and write
     them down.<span> </span>Get one or all of them
     to sign your tomato.</span></li><li><span>Get a photo with
     the most distant visitor you can find who is not a letterboxer holding
     your boxing buddy.</span></li><li><span>Get one member
     of your team handcuffed by a police officer.<span> </span>Get the officer to sign your tomato.
     (getting the team member unhandcuffed is at the discretion of the team)</span></li><li><span>Find a current
     local newspaper and take a photo of its headline.</span></li><li><span>Get a photo of
     one of the water truck drivers holding your boxing buddy.</span></li><li><span>Get a photo of
     one team member in the drivers seat of a classic car holding your boxing
     buddy.</span></li><li><span>Tome una
     fotografa del equipo delante del Tazn de Tomate</span></li></ol><br/>
<p><span>We gave each team a bag with some items that would help them achieve some of these quests and we also asked them to bring some items themselves. <br/>
</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>I talked to various members of the community that would be able to help our boxers. They were incredibly enthusiastic about interacting with participants, even while not entirely understanding what they were up to. I encouraged them to hassle the questors, but they wound up being too nice to take advantage of the opportunity (and the couple of folks who were really going to work on them didn't get "found"). Our group wound up helping out two fundraising/charity groups - our local food pantry and also a youth group that was raising money to buy mosquito nets to go to missions in Africa. They helped the youth group by sitting in the dunking booth, which I thought was really over and above!<br/>

&gt; I'm so glad everyone had fun at yesterday's event!  I had a great time<br/>
&gt; planning it, especially since I had a "team" this year - my Mom, NacTrailCat<br/>
&gt; (this IS her correct trail name!), was great help for those midnight (or<br/>
&gt; later) moments when I woke up with ideas and needed some help figuring<br/>
&gt; things out - a quick email to her and she came through with ideas!  She came<br/>
&gt; up with several of the "quest ideas" and the images that I carved.  Draconis<br/>
&gt; viridis, who has been my constant letterboxing compadre since we started<br/>
&gt; this insanity, was his normal laid-back calm self who understands<br/>
&gt; letterboxing and letterboxers AND his mom - I would bounce ideas off him and<br/>
&gt; he would say "Interesting", or "Ummm...Mom?" or "Nice!"  And Happy Feet,<br/>
&gt; SJZ's boyfriend who has only recently been introduced by us to letterboxing<br/>
&gt; but who seems to have gotten a handle on it and was ready and willing to<br/>
&gt; help any way I asked of him.  He had a great time yesterday!  Happy Feet and<br/>
&gt; d'vir were both on the ready to jump in the car with letterboxers if they<br/>
&gt; needed help finding parks or locations, or to go bail someone out if they<br/>
&gt; needed some help at the festival, or whatever was needed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thought that maybe those of you who weren't there would like to hear a<br/>
&gt; little about the event:  The premise this year was a scavenger hunt followed<br/>
&gt; by a treasure hunt.  Letterboxers participated as teams and had to work<br/>
&gt; together to achieve 12 "quests" (list following) to earn the clues to five<br/>
&gt; letterboxes.  In the past, I've hidden boxes in the festival area, but we<br/>
&gt; had so many letterboxers originally RSVP'd for the event that I was hesitant<br/>
&gt; to hide boxes for so many people to find in such a high traffic area.  SO -<br/>
&gt; boxers had to work their quests at the festival, then were able to leave and<br/>
&gt; find boxes in the community.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's a list of the list of quests:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    1. Find the event registration table  there you go, one down already!<br/>
&gt;    2. Make a donation to our local food pantry.  I HOPE you will recognize<br/>
&gt;    their booth when you see it.  Tell `em Wendy sent you.<br/>
&gt;    3. One member of your team must present themselves to the dunking booth<br/>
&gt;    as the Mayor of Dartmoor and ask if they may sit in the dunking booth for<br/>
&gt;    one time slot. (THIS COUNTS AS TWO QUESTS)<br/>
&gt;    4.  Identify a local elected official and ask them to autograph your<br/>
&gt;    tomato.<br/>
&gt;    5. Ask one of the street vendors to show you their loveliest hat  in<br/>
&gt;    Spanish.<br/>
&gt;    6. Have a team photo taken in front of the nocturnally illuminated<br/>
&gt;    indigenous symbol of kinsmanship.<br/>
&gt;    7. Have a team photo taken of the team red carding a soccer referee.<br/>
&gt;    8. Kiss a fish.<br/>
&gt;    9. Find Boogie Butt and show him your best disco moves.  Get him to sign<br/>
&gt;    your tomato.<br/>
&gt;    10. Take a team picture with a news team or news reporter.  Get them to<br/>
&gt;    sign your tomato.<br/>
&gt;    11. Talk to the tomato vendors and get them to tell you ten tomato<br/>
&gt;    varieties and write them down.  Get one or all of them to sign your<br/>
&gt;    tomato.<br/>
&gt;    12. Get a photo with the most distant visitor you can find who is not a<br/>
&gt;    letterboxer holding your boxing buddy.<br/>
&gt;    13. Get one member of your team handcuffed by a police officer.  Get the<br/>
&gt;    officer to sign your tomato. (getting the team member unhandcuffed is at the<br/>
&gt;    discretion of the team)<br/>
&gt;    14. Find a current local newspaper and take a photo of its headline.<br/>
&gt;    15. Get a photo of one of the water truck drivers holding your boxing<br/>
&gt;    buddy.<br/>
&gt;    16. Get a photo of one team member in the driver's seat of a classic car<br/>
&gt;    holding your boxing buddy.<br/>
&gt;    17. Tome una fotografa del equipo delante del Tazn de Tomate<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We gave each team a bag with some items that would help them achieve some of<br/>
&gt; these quests and we also asked them to bring some items themselves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I talked to various members of the community that would be able to help our<br/>
&gt; boxers.  They were incredibly enthusiastic about interacting with<br/>
&gt; participants, even while not entirely understanding what they were up to.  I<br/>
&gt; encouraged them to hassle the questors, but they wound up being too nice to<br/>
&gt; take advantage of the opportunity (and the couple of folks who were really<br/>
&gt; going to work on them didn't get "found").  Our group wound up helping out<br/>
&gt; two fundraising/charity groups - our local food pantry and also a youth<br/>
&gt; group that was raising money to buy mosquito nets to go to missions in<br/>
&gt; Africa.  They helped the youth group by sitting in the dunking booth, which<br/>
&gt; I thought was really over and above!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Through the planning process, Fearless Fox would shake his head and say "I<br/>
&gt; think you may be taking things too far."  I was sure hoping I didn't, and if<br/>
&gt; I did, I hope y'all will forgive me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to take this opportunity to thank JBK for getting out there and<br/>
&gt; diligently checking all her boxes around town to make sure they were in good<br/>
