                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we finally got home late Sunday after 4 days of intense<br/>
letterboxing in East TX, and it has taken me this long to post<br/>
clues, log finds and type this trip report.  Of course, spending<br/>
time with my neglected family had something to do with it, too.<br/>
As some of you know, Baby Bear and I try to make at least one<br/>
letterboxing trip each year and it has become sort of a tradition<br/>
ever since our first "seeding" trip back in January, 2003.  On<br/>
that trip, the main objective was to place boxes and see the sights,<br/>
since there weren't many boxes placed at that time.  Now our trips<br/>
are more about Finds, but we still place a few along the way.<br/>
We usually go in late Fall, but our 2006 trip kept getting delayed<br/>
until it was now or never, so just last week we got the green light<br/>
to go and hoped for good weather. <br/>
<br/>
Since we have gone to the Dallas area the last 2 years, we decided<br/>
to go somewhere else this time, and East TX looked good to us.<br/>
Even though we had just been there for last year's Event, there<br/>
were many new boxes to find, plus, I wanted to place a box in<br/>
Sabine county, one of the few virgin ones left in that area.  I <br/>
planned the trip way back in November of last year, assuming we<br/>
would go in early December.  I plotted a route and printed all<br/>
the clues, but then we waited, and waited, and waited.  About the<br/>
time we decided to go this weekend I saw BL was setting up a<br/>
non-gathering near where we would be.  Alas, since I had already<br/>
plotted the route and made camping reservations, I knew we would<br/>
not be able to attend.  While they were flirting with Green Shirt<br/>
Guy, we were prowling through cemeteries in the Jacksonville area.<br/>
<br/>
We got an early start Thursday morning to beat the Houston traffic<br/>
(4:00 wake up for me) and headed up Hwy 59 toward Coldspring.  The<br/>
first few boxes were on the Lone Star Trail and it was still dark, <br/>
so we put on our trusty headlamps and headed out.  It was pretty<br/>
eerie walking in the woods with just a small beam of light and<br/>
all kinds of animal noises around us, but waiting for daylight was<br/>
not an option since we had a schedule to keep.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, a quick word about our trip philosophy.  Even though it is<br/>
usually more enjoyable to take your time and find a few boxes in<br/>
a given area, our trips are the complete opposite.  We find as<br/>
many boxes as we can, as fast as we can.  We still take the time<br/>
to appreciate the area and perform the appropriate letterboxing<br/>
rituals, but stopping to smell the flowers too long is frowned upon.<br/>
The main reason we do this is because we so seldom get to letterbox<br/>
together that we want to take full advantage of it.  We hate to<br/>
"Burn Daylight".  Our trips are not for the average letterboxer<br/>
and I sometimes feel like I train for them as much as I used to<br/>
train for races.  Running on trails is not unheard of.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we continued boxing in the Coldspring area, finally getting<br/>
to the town itself.  After finding one in town, we made a wrong <br/>
turn and at the outskirts of town we finally realized it.  As we<br/>
were turning around, I noticed a big red building off the road that<br/>
said The Big Red Barn, and I remembered that Boots Tex and Lone<br/>
Star Quilter had a retreat nearby and figured this must be it.  We<br/>
thought about stopping to say Hi, but there were no cars visible<br/>
and since it was a weekday I figured they were out letterboxing.<br/>
It would have been fun to see them, especially since it was their<br/>
boxes we were finding.  Also, I have become a big fan of their<br/>
stamps.  His Governor series is great!<br/>
<br/>
We then headed up the west side of Lake Livingston where I placed<br/>
a new box in San Jacinto county for Boots &amp; Quilter, and continued<br/>
around the Lake to Lake Livingston SP.  After finding a few there<br/>
we headed east on Hwy 190 to the LPC Dogwood trail where we placed<br/>
boxes.  There were only a few dogwoods blooming but they were<br/>
beautiful.  After a stop at Coushata Reservation, we made it to<br/>
Martin Dies SP, our destination for our first night camping.  The<br/>
place was deserted because the lake had been drained (no fishing),<br/>
and there was still considerable damage from Hurricane Rita.  After<br/>
setting up the tent, we decided to try for the boxes hidden there<br/>
while it was still light.  I did not have much hope of finding them<br/>
because of Rita, but we found all 4, though some had wet logs.  It<br/>
was quite a challenge climbing over downed trees and looking for<br/>
landmarks mentioned in the clues that no longer existed, but we<br/>
did it.  If you decide to go, here is a helpful clue for Wading<br/>
Bird:  go 190 steps from the big bridge, then look for the large<br/>
tree with no top.  Since I don't know if Droop still participates,<br/>
she might not change her clues, so this should help.  Ironically,<br/>
the only box I could not find was my own.  It was getting dark<br/>
so I might have missed it, but everything looked so different it<br/>
will be a challenge to ever find it, if it still exists.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning we broke camp and were on the road by 6:30 heading<br/>
east to Newton.  We kept hearing things hitting the windshield and<br/>
it got hard to see out.  Finally I realized it was thousands of<br/>
June Bugs kamikazeing our car.  I have never seen such carnage on<br/>
a windshield!  Not sure what it means when June Bugs are already<br/>
out in March, but we wiped them off and kept going.  We couldn't <br/>
find the box at Caney Creek Park since it looked like a flood got<br/>
it, so we continued on to Burkeville where we both placed boxes at<br/>
the Canyon Rim Woodlands Trail.  I wish we could have taken more<br/>
time at this place and if you go for our boxes I highly recommend<br/>
spending some time here.<br/>
<br/>
Next up was Willow Oak Recreation Area in Sabine County.  Now I<br/>
had looked online for a place to put a box in this county since<br/>
it did not have one yet and decided on this place.  I carved a<br/>
specific stamp for it and was committed to going there.  Well,<br/>
imagine my surprise, and dejection, when we saw that the park was<br/>
closed because the bridge was unsafe for cars.  This is the problem<br/>
with carving a stamp for a specific place; it makes you want to<br/>
place it there no matter what.  So Baby Bear and I parked the car<br/>
and checked out the bridge.  There was a huge tree laying across<br/>
it and the far side had some erosion, but it looked ok for foot <br/>
travel.  We climbed over the tree and scampered across with no<br/>
problem, feeling like Huck and Tom.  I placed the box pretty close<br/>
so if you decide to go it should not take too long.  It doesn't<br/>
look like they will fix the bridge any time soon so you can enjoy<br/>
the same experience we did!<br/>
<br/>
After that is was on to San Augustine for some interesting history<br/>
and a box, then Nacogdoches.  We had already gotten many in this<br/>
town last year, but we did a few new ones.  Unfortunately, we did<br/>
not find several and it turns out it was because my clues were<br/>
outdated.  Remember I had printed them out last November and even<br/>
though I did check to see if the clues still existed before we <br/>
left, I did not read every line to see if subtle changes had been<br/>
made.  Sure enough when I got back I noticed slight changes in<br/>
some of the clues where the boxes had been moved.  Oh well, we<br/>
still had fun in this great town.  And the Azaleas were just awesome<br/>
everywhere!  We knew the non-gatherers would really enjoy it the<br/>
next day and we thought about leaving notes to them in logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
We then worked our way through a few back road cemeteries before<br/>
arriving at Rusk SP, our home for the next 2 days.  We wanted to<br/>
arrive before 5:00 so we could register with the ranger, even<br/>
though we had already reserved and paid for a site.  Last<br/>
time someone took our site before we got there and we didn't want<br/>
to go through that again.  We just made it as she was locking up <br/>
and we had no problem.  After setting up the tent we headed out to <br/>
do the boxes west of town in I.D. Fairchild SF.  We found them all<br/>
and placed some ourselves just as it was getting dark.  Time to<br/>
go back to camp and cook dinner, then retire early for the big<br/>
day tomorrow in the Jacksonville/New Summerfield area... <br/>

<br/>many boxes as we can, as fast as we can. We still take the time<br/>to appreciate the area and perform the appropriate letterboxing<br/>rituals, but stopping to smell the flowers too long is frowned upon.<br/>The main reason we do this is because we so seldom get to letterbox
<br/>together that we want to take full advantage of it. We hate to<br/>"Burn Daylight". Our trips are not for the average letterboxer<br/>and I sometimes feel like I train for them as much as I used to<br/>train for races. Running on trails is not unheard of.
<br/><br/>Anyway, we continued boxing in the Coldspring area, finally getting<br/>to the town itself. After finding one in town, we made a wrong <br/>turn and at the outskirts of town we finally realized it. As we<br/>were turning around, I noticed a big red building off the road that
<br/>said The Big Red Barn, and I remembered that Boots Tex and Lone<br/>Star Quilter had a retreat nearby and figured this must be it. We<br/>thought about stopping to say Hi, but there were no cars visible<br/>and since it was a weekday I figured they were out letterboxing.
<br/>It would have been fun to see them, especially since it was their<br/>boxes we were finding. Also, I have become a big fan of their<br/>stamps. His Governor series is great!<br/><br/>We then headed up the west side of Lake Livingston where I placed
<br/>a new box in San Jacinto county for Boots &amp; Quilter, and continued<br/>around the Lake to Lake Livingston SP. After finding a few there<br/>we headed east on Hwy 190 to the LPC Dogwood trail where we placed<br/>boxes. There were only a few dogwoods blooming but they were
<br/>beautiful. After a stop at Coushata Reservation, we made it to<br/>Martin Dies SP, our destination for our first night camping. The<br/>place was deserted because the lake had been drained (no fishing),<br/>and there was still considerable damage from Hurricane Rita. After
<br/>setting up the tent, we decided to try for the boxes hidden there<br/>while it was still light. I did not have much hope of finding them<br/>because of Rita, but we found all 4, though some had wet logs. It<br/>was quite a challenge climbing over downed trees and looking for
<br/>landmarks mentioned in the clues that no longer existed, but we<br/>did it. If you decide to go, here is a helpful clue for Wading<br/>Bird: go 190 steps from the big bridge, then look for the large<br/>tree with no top. Since I don't know if Droop still participates,
<br/>she might not change her clues, so this should help. Ironically,<br/>the only box I could not find was my own. It was getting dark<br/>so I might have missed it, but everything looked so different it<br/>will be a challenge to ever find it, if it still exists.
<br/><br/>The next morning we broke camp and were on the road by 6:30 heading<br/>east to Newton. We kept hearing things hitting the windshield and<br/>it got hard to see out. Finally I realized it was thousands of<br/>June Bugs kamikazeing our car. I have never seen such carnage on
<br/>a windshield! Not sure what it means when June Bugs are already<br/>out in March, but we wiped them off and kept going. We couldn't <br/>find the box at Caney Creek Park since it looked like a flood got<br/>it, so we continued on to Burkeville where we both placed boxes at
<br/>the Canyon Rim Woodlands Trail. I wish we could have taken more<br/>time at this place and if you go for our boxes I highly recommend<br/>spending some time here.<br/><br/>Next up was Willow Oak Recreation Area in Sabine County. Now I
<br/>had looked online for a place to put a box in this county since<br/>it did not have one yet and decided on this place. I carved a<br/>specific stamp for it and was committed to going there. Well,<br/>imagine my surprise, and dejection, when we saw that the park was
<br/>closed because the bridge was unsafe for cars. This is the problem<br/>with carving a stamp for a specific place; it makes you want to<br/>place it there no matter what. So Baby Bear and I parked the car<br/>and checked out the bridge. There was a huge tree laying across
<br/>it and the far side had some erosion, but it looked ok for foot <br/>travel. We climbed over the tree and scampered across with no<br/>problem, feeling like Huck and Tom. I placed the box pretty close<br/>so if you decide to go it should not take too long. It doesn't
<br/>look like they will fix the bridge any time soon so you can enjoy<br/>the same experience we did!<br/><br/>After that is was on to San Augustine for some interesting history<br/>and a box, then Nacogdoches. We had already gotten many in this
<br/>town last year, but we did a few new ones. Unfortunately, we did<br/>not find several and it turns out it was because my clues were<br/>outdated. Remember I had printed them out last November and even<br/>though I did check to see if the clues still existed before we 
<br/>left, I did not read every line to see if subtle changes had been<br/>made. Sure enough when I got back I noticed slight changes in<br/>some of the clues where the boxes had been moved. Oh well, we<br/>still had fun in this great town. And the Azaleas were just awesome
<br/>everywhere! We knew the non-gatherers would really enjoy it the<br/>next day and we thought about leaving notes to them in logbooks.<br/><br/>We then worked our way through a few back road cemeteries before<br/>arriving at Rusk SP, our home for the next 2 days. We wanted to
<br/>arrive before 5:00 so we could register with the ranger, even<br/>though we had already reserved and paid for a site. Last<br/>time someone took our site before we got there and we didn't want<br/>to go through that again. We just made it as she was locking up 
<br/>and we had no problem. After setting up the tent we headed out to <br/>do the boxes west of town in I.D. Fairchild SF. We found them all<br/>and placed some ourselves just as it was getting dark. Time to<br/>go back to camp and cook dinner, then retire early for the big
<br/>day tomorrow in the Jacksonville/New Summerfield area... <br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></span></div>
