Tulips and daffodiles are so PRETTY!! I can't wait either. It gives us <br>
something to look forward to after the holidays! If you haven't ever <br>
seen them, you are really missing out!<br>

couldn't believe the size of their bulbs - huge! All last winter I kept <br>
thinking about those bulbs and couldn't wait to come back in the <br>
spring. I wasn't disappointed! Now you've got me excited for NEXT <br>
spring - which isn't that far away now.<br>
