lists about good clue writing and I ran across a great<br/>
write-up last night.<br/>
<br/>
TexasLuvBug and BlueButterfly have planted boxes in my<br/>
county in the last couple of weeks.  That fact, and<br/>
Catpawz' amazing call to box last night has me worked<br/>
up to getting out in the heat and going boxing anyway!<br/>
 You'd have to know me to know what an accomplishment<br/>
it is that I would even consider it!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, as I was reading the clues, this one struck my<br/>
fancy (well, they all did, but this one is really<br/>
nice!):<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=16401&amp;boxname=A_Family_Affair<br/>
<br/>
In these clues, TexasLuvBug leads us out through her<br/>
family land, the place of her personal history.  Now<br/>
this would all mean very little to most of you, and it<br/>
doesn't mean much to me because my little part of the<br/>
county extended in a different direction (although<br/>
when she mentioned Mr. Walker - my heart paused<br/>
because he was a man I've known all MY life too,<br/>
although not well enough to get quarters from him<br/>
apparently!).  However, as she describes different<br/>
points along the trip to the box and tells why each<br/>
spot is important, it is easy to visualize what must<br/>
have happened in those places in the past.  It made me<br/>
wistful for my childhood and proud to be from Cherokee<br/>
County where we can grow up with roots that run deep<br/>
and strong.  Knowing that this particularly road is a<br/>
gorgeous stretch of highway, I can't wait to go find<br/>
the box and I'm going to enjoy her imagery as I go.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, I really enjoyed just reading the clues<br/>
for this box, and I thought they were worthy of<br/>
mentioning as one style that makes good clues.<br/>
