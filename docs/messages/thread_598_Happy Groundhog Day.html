letterboxing! My goal was to find Groundhog Day 2 on<br>
Groundhog Day, and I met my goal!<br>
<br>
I also checked the No Problem Houston HitchHiker<br>
Hostel, and it had several HHs in it. The lid was not<br>
sealed, and had shifted off the top a bit, so the box<br>
was filled with water. It was a strong reminder that<br>
we all need to be very sure to seal up boxes well<br>
before replacing them. None of the HHs were wet (all<br>
were sealed in baggies), and I was able to dry out the<br>
box and the baggies fairly well.<br>
<br>
I also found Brown Mouse and The Lost Rope Swing. Both<br>
were in excellent condition.<br>
<br>
Though it was a cold, wet, miserable day, I was glad<br>
to get out and do some 'boxing.<br>
