                    <html><body><div>hehe...goes wayyyy back.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My very good friend's dad was a football coach, her two brothers were football players, and she and her mother loved the game (in self-defense I'm sure).  Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed football during the fall.  If they weren't at the game on Friday night, it was only because someone was in a bad way.   
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of us didn't travel to out of town games.  Fall fever and boredom set in about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to TP the coach's yard.  The first time we did it, we took about ten rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught.  Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees.  We were sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of town game.  In the meantime, we realized that because of where they lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught.  We also realized the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of the family so we could be out well in advance.  
<br/><br/> So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took about 40 rolls of TP.  Although it looked much better, it still needed work.  There was so much potential and not nearly enough material to work with.  We also learned from the first experience that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the house, all three kids had to help clean up.  I felt guilty about that because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in TP.  Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better armed than before and with more manpower in tow.  This time we took a couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the trees.  It was impressive!  And we tried the name thing again - this time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up all by himself.  That served more than one purpose because not only did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the son who picked on me incessantly.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was telling.  And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs!  They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP rolls around.  Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very much.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring.  We were in the store to buy our stock of toilet paper when somebody noticed the plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks into someone's yard.  We all jumped on board with that and took the TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic forks.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how best to fork.  We had no idea how many forks it would take to make a showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks.  By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of white.  I figure they were much relieved to come home that one night and not see the blanket of TP covering their yard, until they discovered the subtle but deadly alternative!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground.  None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again by the exposed tines.  The oldest boy was carefully saving every fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them.  I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling I was involved I figured I was in for trouble.  Ironically, he did get even - with the only kid I knew who WASN'T involved in the TP'ing!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thankfully, forking was a rare event around here, although I have occasionally heard of other people who knew about it!</div>

<p>I must say, I DO like the Christmas tree thing.  Forking, while it is hilariously funny, is also a major pain in the rear and doesn't usually leave the victim laughing in the end...<br/><br/>

<div>OK - this story pulled me out of lurking!  LOVE the forks!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were frequent participators in the "yard decorations" as well.  Personal favorites included "Campaigning" - we would gather every election sign we could find and "artfully" arrange them in the chosen yard.  Boxes of soap suds all over the yard and beans spread all over the yard were other great "decorations" - and major points must be given for the delayed and repeated gratification of those two.  I just loved seeing my ex-boyfriend out trying to "mow" down all those beans over and over!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Memories are great!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks - Take care, The Boxalots</div>

</p><div>hehe...goes wayyyy back.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My very good friend's dad was a football coach, her two brothers were football players, and she and her mother loved the game (in self-defense I'm sure).  Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed football during the fall.  If they weren't at the game on Friday night, it was only because someone was in a bad way.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of us didn't travel to out of town games.  Fall fever and boredom set in about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to TP the coach's yard.  The first time we did it, we took about ten rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught.  Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees.  We were sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of town game.  In the meantime, we realized that because of where they lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught.  We also realized the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of t
he family so we could be out well in advance.  <br/><br/> So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took about 40 rolls of TP.  Although it looked much better, it still needed work.  There was so much potential and not nearly enough material to work with.  We also learned from the first experience that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the house, all three kids had to help clean up.  I felt guilty about that because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in TP.  Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better armed than before and with more manpower in tow.  This time we took a couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the trees.  It was impressive!  And we tried the name thing again - this time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up all by himself.  That served more than one purpose because not only did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the son who picked on me incessantly. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was telling.  And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs!  They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP rolls around.  Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very much.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring.  We were in the store to buy our stock of toilet paper when somebody noticed the plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks into someone's yard.  We all jumped on board with that and took the TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic forks. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how best to fork.  We had no idea how many forks it would take to make a showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks.  By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of white.  I figure they were much relieved to come home that one night and not see the blanket of TP covering their yard, until they discovered the subtle but deadly alternative! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground.  None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again by the exposed tines.  The oldest boy was carefully saving every fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them.  I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling I was involved I figured I was in for trouble.  Ironically, he did get even - with the only kid I knew who WASN'T involved in the TP'ing! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thankfully, forking was a rare event around here, although I have occasionally heard of other people who knew about it!</div>

<div>When my daughter was in high school, we woke up one Saturday morning with about twenty "For Sale" signs in our yard which had been gathered from various other homes. I have no idea how they got those things out of people yards and hammered into ours in the middle of the night without someone hearing or noticing. At first I was insulted thinking my neighbors were sending me a message! Luckily, my daughter's boyfriend confessed that he and his friends on the basketball team did it as a joke, and they came by later to retrieve them. I imagine some people ended up with the wrong signs returned to their houses. That must have been a real nightmare sorting those signs out. </div>

</p><div>hehe...goes wayyyy back.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My very good friend's dad was a football coach, her two brothers were football players, and she and her mother loved the game (in self-defense I'm sure).  Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed football during the fall.  If they weren't at the game on Friday night, it was only because someone was in a bad way.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of us didn't travel to out of town games.  Fall fever and boredom set in about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to TP the coach's yard.  The first time we did it, we took about ten rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught.  Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees.  We were sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of town game.  In the meantime, we realized that because of where they lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught.  We also realized the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of t he family so we could be out well in advance.  <br/><br/> So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took about 40 rolls of TP.  Although it looked much better, it still needed work.  There was so much potential and not nearly enough material to work with.  We also learned from the first experience that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the house, all three kids had to help clean up.  I felt guilty about that because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in TP.  Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better armed than before and with more manpower in tow.  This time we took a couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the trees.  It was impressive!  And we tried the name thing again - this time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up all by himself.  That served more than one purpose because not only did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the son who picked on me incessantly. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was telling.  And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs!  They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP rolls around.  Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very much.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring.  We were in the store to buy our stock of toilet paper when somebody noticed the plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks into someone's yard.  We all jumped on board with that and took the TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic forks. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how best to fork.  We had no idea how many forks it would take to make a showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks.  By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of white.  I figure they were much relieved to come home that one night and not see the blanket of TP covering their yard, until they discovered the subtle but deadly alternative! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground.  None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again by the exposed tines.  The oldest boy was carefully saving every fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them.  I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling I was involved I figured I was in for trouble.  Ironically, he did get even - with the only kid I knew who WASN'T involved in the TP'ing! </div>

<div>Ok, here's another lurker! lol </div>
<div>I wish I had a picture for this one.</div>
<div>Our son played baseball in high school and he and his teammates would go TP rolling every year during homecoming.</div>
<div>They would go to Sam's Club and purchase several cases of TP each to prepare for their annual assault on unsuspecting yards.</div>
<div>I need to point out here; that this is a rural town and "everybody" lives in the country more or less. They would unload an entire case of 144 rolls on one yard.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>His senior year, he made the mistake of getting a date for homecoming..... oh yeah! you guessed. Now, we live at the end of a dirt road surrounded by 100 foot trees. Think "baseball player" - they used the TP that my son had purchased....4 cases! ALL OF IT! When we came home there was a 100 foot, solid white curtain completely covering our entire yard. We could not even see the house. There was so much, we used matches to lite the paper and let it burn off.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yeah, it's funny now.</div>
<div>Thanks for making me laugh,</div>

<div>I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground.  None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again by the exposed tines.  The oldest boy was carefully saving every fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them.  I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling I was involved I figured I was in for trouble.  Ironically, he did get even - with the only kid I knew who WASN'T involved in the TP'ing! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thankfully, forking was a rare event around here, although I have occasionally heard of other people who knew about it!</div>

<div>I must say, I DO like the Christmas tree thing.  Forking, while it is hilariously funny, is also a major pain in the rear and doesn't usually leave the victim laughing in the end...<br/><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have participated in both TPing and Forking but not in very many<br/>
times.  Forking is SOOOOO much easier to clean up, so I guess TP the<br/>
people you REALLY want to get at and Fork the people you like!  ha ha!<br/>
<br/>
As for the flamingos, I was coordinator of a "flamingo invasion"<br/>
fundraiser several years ago.  We tried a couple things that didn't<br/>
work (including one procedure that had us accused of extortion!) but<br/>
finally settled on one that did work.  Just FYI, this is what worked<br/>
for us ...<br/>
<br/>
We drew up a little "order form" and people would pay for the<br/>
privilege of having their friend/neighbor/relative's yard "flocked." <br/>
(I don't know ... $20-25 or so?  Or by donation?   I can't remember<br/>
... it has been more than 10 years ago now.)<br/>
<br/>
Then, late at night we would go with our truck full of flamingos and<br/>
"flock" the yard, and leave a nice doorhanger on the front door that<br/>
said something like, "You've been flocked!!!"  and explained that<br/>
someone had sent us to flock them and donated money to ____ cause. <br/>
They were instructed to call a particular phone number to have the<br/>
flamingos "rounded up and removed by professionals."  The bottom of<br/>
the door hanger was a similar order form that allowed that person to<br/>
"flock back" or "flock person X" or whatever (a donation envelope was<br/>
attached).  They could leave the doorhanger and envelope on their door<br/>
if they wanted us to flock another person and we would pick it up when<br/>
we removed the birds.  Otherwise, they could place their order another<br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
People really enjoyed this!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
(Oh, and we did it in Arizona, so we had to build bases for the<br/>
flamingos to stand in - most of our customers don't have grass!! <br/>
Bases took effort to make, but made the set-up and tear down easier.)<br/>
<br/>
We were doing this fundraiser before and after the time I got married.<br/>
 Believe it or not, my wedding was even flocked!!! Only by two birds<br/>
though ... one with a toulle veil and the other with a bowtie ...<br/>
sitting right up there on the stage.  Yes, you can see them in the<br/>
wide angle shot of the wedding party!  <br/>
<br/>
Happy flocking for your 3day!  :-)<br/>

 her mother loved the game (in self-defense I'm sure).  Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed football during the fall.  If they weren't at the game on Friday night, it was only because someone was in a bad way.   </div> <div> </div> <div>Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of us didn't travel to out of town games.  Fall fever and boredom set in about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to TP the coach's yard.  The first time we did it, we took about ten rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught.  Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees.  We were sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of town game.  In the meantime, we realized that because of where they
 lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught.  We also realized the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of t he family so we could be out well in advance.  <br/><br/> So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took about 40 rolls of TP.  Although it looked much better, it still needed work.  There was so much potential and not nearly enough material to work with.  We also learned from the first experience that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the house, all three kids had to help clean up.  I felt guilty about that because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in TP. 
 Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up. </div> <div> </div> <div>Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better armed than before and with more manpower in tow.  This time we took a couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the trees.  It was impressive!  And we tried the name thing again - this time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up all by himself.  That served more than one purpose because not only did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the son who picked on me incessantly. </div> <div> </div> <div>Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was telling.  And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs! 
 They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP rolls around.  Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very much.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring.  We were in the store to buy our stock of toilet paper when somebody noticed the plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks into someone's yard.  We all jumped on board with that and took the TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic forks. </div> <div> </div> <div>We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how best to fork.  We had no
 idea how many forks it would take to make a showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks.  By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of white.  I figure they were much relieved to come home that one night and not see the blanket of TP covering their yard, until they discovered the subtle but deadly alternative! </div> <div> </div> <div>I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground.  None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again by the exposed tines.  The oldest boy was carefully saving every fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them.  I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling I was involved I figured

I can't remember<br/>... it has been more than 10 years ago now.)<br/><br/>Then, late at night we would go with our truck full of flamingos and<br/>"flock" the yard, and leave a nice doorhanger on the front door that<br/>said something like, "You've been flocked!!!" and explained that<br/>someone had sent us to flock them and donated money to ____ cause. <br/>They were instructed to call a particular phone number to have
 the<br/>flamingos "rounded up and removed by professionals.<wbr/>" The bottom of<br/>the door hanger was a similar order form that allowed that person to<br/>"flock back" or "flock person X" or whatever (a donation envelope was<br/>attached). They could leave the doorhanger and envelope on their door<br/>if they wanted us to flock another person and we would pick it up when<br/>we removed the birds. Otherwise, they could place their order another<br/>time.<br/><br/>People really enjoyed this! :-)<br/><br/>(Oh, and we did it in Arizona, so we had to build bases for the<br/>flamingos to stand in - most of our customers don't have grass!! <br/>Bases took effort to make, but made the set-up and tear down easier.)<br/><br/>We were doing this fundraiser before and after the time I got married.<br/>Believe it or not, my wedding was even flocked!!! Only by two birds<br/>though ... one with a toulle veil and the other with a bowtie ...<br/>sitting right up there on the stage. Yes, you can see them in

an entire case of 144 rolls on one yard.<br/>

&gt;   His senior year, he made the mistake of getting a date for <br/>
homecoming..... oh yeah! you guessed. Now, we live at the end of a <br/>
dirt road surrounded by 100 foot trees. Think "baseball player" - <br/>
they used the TP that my son had purchased....4 cases! ALL OF IT! <br/>
When we came home there was a 100 foot, solid white curtain <br/>
completely covering our entire yard. We could not even see the house. <br/>
There was so much, we used matches to lite the paper and let it burn <br/>
off.  <br/>

well.  Personal favorites included "Campaigning" - we would gather <br/>
every election sign we could find and "artfully" arrange them in the <br/>
chosen yard.  Boxes of soap suds all over the yard and beans spread <br/>
all over the yard were other great "decorations" - and major points <br/>

&gt; From: "Barefoot Lucy" <barefootlucy@...> <br/>
&gt;       hehe...goes wayyyy back.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   My very good friend's dad was a football coach, her two brothers <br/>
were football players, and she and her mother loved the game (in self-<br/>
defense I'm sure).  Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed <br/>
football during the fall.  If they weren't at the game on Friday <br/>
night, it was only because someone was in a bad way.   <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of <br/>
us didn't travel to out of town games.  Fall fever and boredom set in <br/>
about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to <br/>
TP the coach's yard.  The first time we did it, we took about ten <br/>
rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught.  <br/>
Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, <br/>
especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees.  We were <br/>
sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a <br/>
poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of <br/>
town game.  In the meantime, we realized that because of where they <br/>
lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught.  We also realized <br/>
the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know <br/>
exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could <br/>
even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of t <br/>
he family so we could be out well in<br/>
&gt;  advance.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took <br/>
about 40 rolls of TP.  Although it looked much better, it still <br/>
needed work.  There was so much potential and not nearly enough <br/>
material to work with.  We also learned from the first experience <br/>
that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the <br/>
house, all three kids had to help clean up.  I felt guilty about that <br/>
because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning <br/>
up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when <br/>
we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in <br/>
TP.  Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was <br/>
destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become <br/>
a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better <br/>
armed than before and with more manpower in tow.  This time we took a <br/>
couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the <br/>
trees.  It was impressive!  And we tried the name thing again - this <br/>
time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up <br/>
all by himself.  That served more than one purpose because not only <br/>
did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the <br/>
son who picked on me incessantly. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before <br/>
long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was <br/>
telling.  And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs!  <br/>
They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that <br/>
wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP <br/>
rolls around.  Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their <br/>
house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have <br/>
it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never <br/>
showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in <br/>
the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very <br/>
much.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring.  We were in the <br/>
store to buy our stock of toilet paper when somebody noticed the <br/>
plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks <br/>
into someone's yard.  We all jumped on board with that and took the <br/>
TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic <br/>
forks. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how <br/>
best to fork.  We had no idea how many forks it would take to make a <br/>
showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks.  <br/>
By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of <br/>
white.  I figure they were much relieved to come home that one night <br/>
and not see the blanket of TP covering their yard, until they <br/>
discovered the subtle but deadly alternative! <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all <br/>
three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground.  <br/>
None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only <br/>
had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again <br/>
by the exposed tines.  The oldest boy was carefully saving every <br/>
fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them.  <br/>
I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access <br/>
to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling <br/>
I was involved I figured I was in for trouble.  Ironically, he did <br/>
get even - with the only kid I knew who WASN'T involved in the <br/>
TP'ing! <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Thankfully, forking was a rare event around here, although I have <br/>
occasionally heard of other people who knew about it!<br/>

<p>Hi! all, Just wanted to let you know that we got papered one year <br/>when my kids were in High School. But we were so poor. How poor were <br/>we? you ask. We were so poor that I had the kids to go get the paper <br/>off the trees and lawn and roll it again and bring it in. We used it 
<br/>for at least a month. I thought I would never tell this but there you <br/>have it. Now I feel so much better. Confessing all that. Whew the air <br/>is fresh again.

<div><span class="e" id="q_110ea7e83807230e_5">&gt; From: "Barefoot Lucy" &lt;barefootlucy@...&gt; <br/>&gt; hehe...goes wayyyy back. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My very good friend's dad was a football coach, her two brothers 
<br/>were football players, and she and her mother loved the game (in self-<br/>defense I'm sure). Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed <br/>football during the fall. If they weren't at the game on Friday <br/>
night, it was only because someone was in a bad way. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of <br/>us didn't travel to out of town games. Fall fever and boredom set in <br/>about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to 
<br/>TP the coach's yard. The first time we did it, we took about ten <br/>rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught. <br/>Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, <br/>especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees. We were 
<br/>sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a <br/>poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of <br/>town game. In the meantime, we realized that because of where they <br/>lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught. We also realized 
<br/>the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know <br/>exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could <br/>even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of t <br/>he family so we could be out well in
<br/>&gt; advance. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took <br/>about 40 rolls of TP. Although it looked much better, it still <br/>needed work. There was so much potential and not nearly enough 
<br/>material to work with. We also learned from the first experience <br/>that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the <br/>house, all three kids had to help clean up. I felt guilty about that <br/>
because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning <br/>up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when <br/>we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in 
<br/>TP. Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was <br/>destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become <br/>a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better 
<br/>armed than before and with more manpower in tow. This time we took a <br/>couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the <br/>trees. It was impressive! And we tried the name thing again - this <br/>time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up 
<br/>all by himself. That served more than one purpose because not only <br/>did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the <br/>son who picked on me incessantly. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before 
<br/>long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was <br/>telling. And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs! <br/>They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that <br/>wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP 
<br/>rolls around. Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their <br/>house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have <br/>it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never <br/>showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in 
<br/>the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very <br/>much. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring. We were in the <br/>store to buy our stock of toilet paper when somebody noticed the 
<br/>plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks <br/>into someone's yard. We all jumped on board with that and took the <br/>TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic <br/>forks. 
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how <br/>best to fork. We had no idea how many forks it would take to make a <br/>showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks. 
<br/>By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of <br/>white. I figure they were much relieved to come home that one night <br/>and not see the blanket of TP covering their yard, until they <br/>discovered the subtle but deadly alternative! 
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I ambled out to their house the next day and arrived to see all <br/>three kids stooping over repeatedly pulling forks out of the ground. <br/>None of them were very happy at all about it, since they had not only 
<br/>had to clean it all up, but they had been poked over and over again <br/>by the exposed tines. The oldest boy was carefully saving every <br/>fork, and when I asked him why, he only said he had plans for them. <br/>I was a little worried, because he worked for my dad and had access 
<br/>to OUR house pretty much whenever he wanted, and if he had an inkling <br/>I was involved I figured I was in for trouble. Ironically, he did <br/>get even - with the only kid I knew who WASN'T involved in the <br/>TP'ing! 
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Thankfully, forking was a rare event around here, although I have <br/>occasionally heard of other people who knew about it!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/></span></div><span class="q">&gt; On 2/20/07, the carrascos &lt;

LOVE the forks! <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We were frequent participators in the "yard decorations" as <br/>well. Personal favorites included "Campaigning" - we would gather <br/>every election sign we could find and "artfully" arrange them in the <br/>chosen yard. Boxes of soap suds all over the yard and beans spread <br/>all over the yard were other great "decorations" - and major points <br/>must be given for the delayed and repeated gratification of those <br/>two.

Their whole family lived, ate, and breathed <br/>football during the fall. If they weren't at the game on Friday <br/>night, it was only because someone was in a bad way. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Although most all of my friends also went to home games, many of <br/>us didn't travel to out of town games. Fall fever and boredom set in <br/>about the same time and a couple of us thought it would be funny to <br/>TP the coach's yard. The first time we did it, we took about ten <br/>rolls of TP so we could get in and get out and not get caught.
 <br/>Unfortunately, we discovered that ten rolls is really not that much, <br/>especially in a big country yard with lots of tall trees. We were <br/>sorely disappointed in the effect, but not being ones to settle for a <br/>poor showing, we decided we would try again during the next out of <br/>town game. In the meantime, we realized that because of where they <br/>lived, it was highly unlikely we would get caught. We also realized <br/>the game was broadcast on the local radio station, so we could know <br/>exactly when the game was over and if we were really smart we could <br/>even estimate the earliest possible arrival time by any member of t <br/>he family so we could be out well in<br/>&gt; advance. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So the next time we took a couple other friends with us and took <br/>about 40 rolls of TP. Although it looked much better, it still <br/>needed work. There was so much potential and not nearly enough <br/>material to work with. We also learned from the first
 experience <br/>that because the coach and his wife didn't know WHO had wrapped the <br/>house, all three kids had to help clean up. I felt guilty about that <br/>because my friend was NOT happy about spending her Saturday cleaning <br/>up MY mess (even though she didn't realize it was MY mess), so when <br/>we went back we spelled the younger son's name in the front yard in <br/>TP. Unfortunately it rained before they got home and the name was <br/>destroyed, so once again all three kids had to clean up. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Well as you well know, when you do something twice, it has become <br/>a tradition, so we returned at the next out of town game, better <br/>armed than before and with more manpower in tow. This time we took a <br/>couple of strong guys who could get the rolls really high up in the <br/>trees. It was impressive! And we tried the name thing again - this <br/>time it worked and the younger son got the benefit of cleaning it up <br/>all by himself. That served more than
 one purpose because not only <br/>did it get my friend out of cleaning, but it was a dirty trick on the <br/>son who picked on me incessantly. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Each out of town game, things got bigger and bigger and before <br/>long, a lot of people knew what was going on, but no one was <br/>telling. And as luck would have it, we even went to the playoffs! <br/>They tried leaving the dogs outside, but since I knew the dogs, that <br/>wasn't a problem, and they really kind of had fun chasing the TP <br/>rolls around. Mrs. Coach even asked some folks to check on their <br/>house periodically during football evenings but as luck would have <br/>it, those people (my parents were some who they had asked) never <br/>showed up WHILE we were doing it, and since they lived so far out in <br/>the country, it was inconvenient for other people to check very <br/>much. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Too much of a good thing gets - well - boring. We were in the <br/>store to buy our stock of toilet paper when
 somebody noticed the <br/>plastic forks and remembered a story about sticking lots of forks <br/>into someone's yard. We all jumped on board with that and took the <br/>TP back to the shelf and grabbed up boxes upon boxes of plastic <br/>forks. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We got out to their house and sort of winged figuring out how <br/>best to fork. We had no idea how many forks it would take to make a <br/>showing, so a couple of us had to go back to town to get more forks. <br/>By the time we finished, the yard was covered in little flecks of <br/>white.
