                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I for one had a terrific time!  Thanks to all who came and to<br>
those who brought boxes or carved a literary traveler, a double thank<br>
you.  Mother of Five, TeamKing and I slipped away for a bit of boxing<br>
yesterday ourselves and really enjoyed finding boxes that others had<br>
prepared.<br>
<br>
For those of you who didn't come, our biggest surprise was the<br>
storybook stroll.  We set this up for children, but a lot of the<br>
adults enjoyed it as well.  Instead of following clues, the kids had<br>
to look for items in the woods, a toothbrush for Junie B Jones,<br>
toothless wonder, etc.  Some were easier hides than others.  Also on<br>
the stroll was a camo-taped blue dolphin for the adults to play I spy<br>
with.  Only a couple adults found it, but some sharp-eyed children<br>
spotted the dolphin in the trees.  <br>
<br>
There were other secret hides, including a special Nancy Drew stamp<br>
inside a flashlight, Little Women (I think only two people found<br>
them), Hansel & Gretel inside the candy bowl, Elizabeth inside the<br>
girl's bathroom while Darcy was in the men's, and so on. <br>
<br>
Some of my favorite moments:<br>
<br>
-Handing Running Rain, aka Hermione, the special costume box.  (See,<br>
it pays to dress up).<br>
-The look on a child's face when he found Peter Pan and then Hook all<br>
by himself.<br>
-Watching Wanda search all over for the Ugly Duckling box, which was<br>
disguised as a rock.  <br>
-Finding a special puzzle hidden just for me.  <br>
-Being there when Lightning cracked the code for the mystery box, aka<br>
The Anne Frank box.<br>
-Seeing my own children enthralled on the Storybook Stroll--my five<br>
year old had the best time, and was shocked to discover things from<br>
his own house, including a stuffed penguin snatched off his bed while<br>
he was sleeping.  <br>
<br>
And afterwards, looking through the literary traveler book and the<br>
special commemorative book boxes that the PEAS put together.<br>
<br>
And one more observation--I really thought one of MOther of Five's was<br>
going to be the first to go plonk into the water, but it turned out to<br>
be Barefoot Lucy's son Lightning!<br>
<br>
I didn't take nearly enough pictures, so would love it if people would<br>
post more.  You can also post them on AQ so that folks outside of<br>
Texas can see our foolery.  Just go to the event page, and there is a<br>
link called upload pictures.<br>
