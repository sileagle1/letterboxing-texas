                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I just joined the group.  My trail name is ToniaO and I live in <br/>
Uvalde.  The first box that my husband and I found is the Barney's <br/>
Toilet Seat Museum box.  I'm 51 years old and a native Texan, born and <br/>
raised in Big Spring.  I lived in Lubbock for 18 years.  I'm a <br/>
vegetarian and my spirit animal is a rabbit.  So incorporated those <br/>
facts, I'm using this as my stamp: <br/>

I have ten thumbs when it comes to "artistic" endeavors except cross-<br/>
stitching.  I do plan to try to carve my own stamp but I doubt I can <br/>
make one as cute as my rabbit!<br/>

sound where they should be.  Have you been to the Caverns of Sonora?  <br/>
I highly recommend them. In my opinion they are better than Carlsbad <br/>
Caverns.  Also would be a great place for a box.  I haven't been out <br/>
that way since I started Lb'ing but I have thought about it and also <br/>
the nice rest area on I-10...between Junction and Sonora or is it <br/>
just west of Sonora?<br/>

Anyway, have fun and good luck with selling your house.<br/>
