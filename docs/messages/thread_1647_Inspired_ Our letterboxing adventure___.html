                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Yesterday (dh only works a half day on Fridays) we went on our<br/>
very first letterboxing adventure.  We went to a somewhat nearby park <br/>
(McAllister Park in San Antonio, which is about a 45 minute drive each <br/>
way for us)to start our adventure and we found a total of 5 letterboxes <br/>
as well as a live armadillo and his nest.  Dh loved it (well, I think he <br/>
was super excited about photographing the armadillo and excited, but not <br/>
quite as, by the stamps ;) ) and I have to say, after seeing all of the <br/>
stamps in these letterboxes, I am totally in awe!  I mean, to carve the <br/>
intricate details that are on some of these stamps, in such a small <br/>
space (eraser size and/or smaller) just blows me away.  Anyway, I just <br/>
wanted to say thanks!  I really had a great time and am looking forward <br/>
more now to planting my own boxes.  I do have to tell you that being<br/>
my size (I'm a very "large and lovable" lady!) this trip is quite a <br/>
feat, but I'm thrilled to have discovered this activity and hope to go <br/>
on many more letterboxing adventures!  Thank you also to those who plant <br/>
"easy" boxes so that until I can work up my stamina, I have some to <br/>
discover!  I'm going to be going again this weekend at some point to hit <br/>
both Freidrick Park and Raymond Russell (maybe I'll get lucky and Angi's <br/>
boxes will have reappeared?) to see what's there...  Anyway, thanks <br/>
again for the great fun and I'll be emailing status updates to the box <br/>
owners later on today :)<br/>
