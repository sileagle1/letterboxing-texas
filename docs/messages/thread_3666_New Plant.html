<div><font size="2">I love the history you included in your clues. It just really relates the box to the area. I'm such a fan of Oliver Loving and Charlie Goodnight, that I will have to come find this box before long. Did you know Loving is buried in Weatherford? There used to be a letterbox there, but I'm not sure if it's still there or not. I think you did a great job with your clues. When I first started hiding boxes, I used to make my husband or sister go find my boxes and then make adjustments before I would announce the clues, just to make sure they were accurate. I'm sure if people have difficulty finding your box from the clues, you hear about it! Have fun, and thanks for hiding a new box in an area that <em>neeeeeeds</em> boxes.</font></div>
