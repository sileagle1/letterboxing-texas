                    <div class="plaintext-content">I forgot.  When we got done at Finch we checked into hotel, had dinner, and my wife picked up a local magazine to look at.   At 9pm she said, hey look at this article about Letterboxing.  I could not belive it.  There was a 3 page article about it, and they even had hidden 2 boxes for people to go find.  Wish I would have seen this before.   Anyway, the article was well done, with pictures and many details.   My only concern was that it directed people to Atlas Quest's website, with only a mention of LBNA, but did not give out that website.  <br>
