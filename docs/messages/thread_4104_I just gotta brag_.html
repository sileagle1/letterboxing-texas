This is wizardry!<br/>
<br/>
I went shopping with my wife this morning.  This trip wasn't a "necessities"<br/>
shopping trip so much as it was a "stocking the pantry" shopping trip.  The gets<br/>
these "$ale$ coupon" deals via E-mail somewhere.  Then she makes a plan of<br/>
attack, and off she goes.  Now, she says this is not a personal best, but close.<br/>
I admit some of this - like the "military discount" will not apply to some of<br/>
you.  But most of the rest does or could apply.<br/>
<br/>
The object is to collect coupons, buy items on sale, apply the coupons, and<br/>
stock up enough to last until the next sale.<br/>
<br/>
Even I don't understand it all.   BUT......  Watch how it works.....<br/>
<br/>
We started off with a total bill of $123,61.  I thought it wasn't a bad price -<br/>
for all of what she got.  Lots of things that I know are expensive.  Heh heh heh<br/>
- watch the wizard at work!<br/>
<br/>
The stuff went past the scanner.  BEEP - BEEP - BEEP - BEEP.  Then she got -$10<br/>
for spending over $100.  Then she got -10% military retiree discount.  Then out<br/>
comes the magic wand (coupon book).   BEEP - BEEP - BEEP - BEEP, each BEEP<br/>
taking something off the total.<br/>
<br/>
When it was over, we paid $47.39 cash money to get out the door.<br/>
<br/>
$123.61 - $47.39 = $76.22 in savings.  Amazing!<br/>
<br/>
The store claims she saves nearly $200 in total savings, this is the In-Store<br/>
specials, coupons, and other applied discounts.  Not only that, but she has some<br/>
mail-in coupons that she claims will pay US $2.00 to eat the ice cream!<br/>
<br/>
She found some deal on pork ribs.  $6 a pound - but buy one and get 2 free!  She<br/>
bought $75 worth of ribs, and paid $25, then applied the other discounts and<br/>
coupons on top of it.<br/>
<br/>
This is just plain wizardry!  And she packs a purple .357 Magnum too.  No wonder<br/>
I married her!<br/>
<br/>
I sit in awe at the feet of the master!<br/>

I was just sitting here moaning over the fact that I have to go to the grocery store and hate to spend the money!<br/><br/>One of our big disadvantages is that we live in a small town with three grocery stores - one is a deep cut-rate store where you have to watch the dates very closely - I figure whatever I save there will eventually be spent on a doctor's visit for food poisoning. The other is a small local chain store with perhaps 100 stores total. The other is WALMART - the evil empire.<br/>

If you plan it out right and take advantage of store coupons and in store specials.  Last week when I went I ended up spending $123.00. But I saved over $85.00 with coupons and this should last us a couple of weeks. It take a little time and patience to do ( I probably spend an extra 30 min in the store) but I think its well worth it when you add up the savings. Plus when you have a Texas Tour Bus full of passengers at your house, you need a few extras!</div>
