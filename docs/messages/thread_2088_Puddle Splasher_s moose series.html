</p><div>I had a report that the fourth box of my Moose Series at Lake Grapevine was missing, so I replaced it this morning. It is located in a different place along the same trail as before, so if any of you have printed the clues to this series, you will want to reprint them before you go moose hunting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I feel badly because this a quite a challenging trail, and Blooming Flowers of Bedford did this series yesterday and just missed the replaced box! Luckily that trail is almost completely in the shade, because if it hadn't been, I may still be laying out there with my tongue hanging out!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, it's me Janet from Blooming Flowers. I saved a spot for the 4th <br>
stamp. I'll have to wait for cooler weather to go again. But, it was <br>
the most gorgeous hike. It "almost" reminded me of hiking in Oregon. I <br>
suggest frozen bottles of water and use them on your neck if you get <br>
hot. It's what saved me. Janet, Bedford<br>
