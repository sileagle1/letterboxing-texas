We'll be watching for the clues.  We'll be glad to pick up the box <br/>
for you.  As soon as we see the clues posted, we'll plan a trip up <br/>
there to get the new boxes.  Are you going to hide the Tour Bus in <br/>
the Houston area?  Does the finder always take the Bus and hide it <br/>
somewhere else, then post the clues on this forum?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
