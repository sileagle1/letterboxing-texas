                    <html><body><div>As much as I enjoy working on the website, most of the time I feel like I'm sitting on the sidelines watching Choi most especially (and Jay Drew jumps in there too) doing his thing! Choi is constantly tweaking things, fixing things, watching out for problems - about the time the rest of us become aware of a problem, he's already gotten it fixed. He really is amazing!<br/>
</div><div><br/></div><div>Most of what I do is answer "What's my password?" types of questions or answer park rangers who are a little upset about finding boxes where boxes shouldn't be. I also have identified counties that need to be colored because boxes have been placed (haven't done that in awhile and I guess I need to get on it) and I sometimes respond to media requests. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>Most recently, we got a note from a geocacher who had gotten word that another geocacher had gone looking for his cache and found a letterbox (the GC placer was already aware that a letterbox had been planted near his cache). The GC finder assumed the box belonged where he "thought" the GC should have been and moved it. The GC'er who wrote lived a distance from the cache and box, so he wrote to us for help contacting the box placer to see if she lived closer and could go retrieve her box and put it back where it belonged. If not, he was willing to make the trip to fix the problem. I thought that was kind of cool!</div>
<div><br/></div><div>Silver Eagle is very much respected by the website volunteers because when he identifies a problem, he usually sends it along with a fix or an idea of how to fix. He has been instrumental in several improvements throughout the years and so has been involved in things that have had fundamental effects on how the website (and in some cases, the game) operates.</div>
<div><br/></div><div>I'm not sure about at AQ, but I do know that at LBNA everyone who works on the site is a volunteer. I imagine it's much the same at AQ. Folks work on the websites because they are committed to the game and want to make it the very best it can be for everyone! Anytime you find yourself writing to one of the sites with ideas or issues, you can issue those volunteers a paycheck in the form of your appreciation (and most letterboxers do just that - I wish it were that way at my job!). </div>
<div><br/></div><div>And - you might want to keep an eye on LBNA. Just - keep an eye on it. </div><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>
