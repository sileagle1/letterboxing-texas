<div>I hate lovebugs!!!!! We have a horrible infestation of them. They get inside our house and are everywhere!! I sweep the floor every night and then the next evening they are all there again!! And outside they are all over the house. We live in a log home and just had the outside re-stained and they must like the smell of the stain or something because they are all over it!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And they smell. Dead love bugs have a bad smell to them.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Boots, I am with you this year has been really bad. They have not been this bad since 2008 when we "snow drifts" of dead love bugs when we were building our house.</div>

&gt; I hate lovebugs!!!!! We have a horrible infestation of them. They get inside our house and are everywhere!! I sweep the floor every night and then the next evening they are all there again!! And outside they are all over the house. We live in a log home and just had the outside re-stained and they must like the smell of the stain or something because they are all over it!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And they smell. Dead love bugs have a bad smell to them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boots, I am with you this year has been really bad. They have not been this bad since 2008 when we "snow drifts" of dead love bugs when we were building our house.<br/>
