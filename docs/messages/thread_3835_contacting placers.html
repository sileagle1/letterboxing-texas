<div><font color="#0000ff" face="Century" size="2">I have really been following this 
discussion (I'm a logbook lover, by the way) and listening to what all of you 
have to say.  I think Boots is right with this point, but I think there is 
something else to consider.  If you notify a placer about finding their 
box, and receive no reply, you may be less likely to notify the placer on your 
next find.  I will never forget when I found my first box, wrote Silver 
Eagle to tell him about the find, and received a very nice note back thanking me 
for letting him know about his box.  When I started placing boxes, I 
thought that was what you were "supposed" to do, so I followed his lead, and try 
to always write back when someone takes the time to let me know they have found 
(or tried to find) one of my boxes.  Seems like since there are so many new 
boxers starting these days we might all like to consider sending a simple note 
of thanks on a found box to encourage finders to notify placers.  Now back 
to unloading the dishwasher....MO5</font></div></body></html>
