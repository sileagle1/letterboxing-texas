                    <html><body><div>Yesterday I finally made it back out to Reimer's Ranch Park to find all the boxes placed there back in February and I must say, y'all did a great job! There were so many boxes I was unable to find them all before dark after 6 hours of hiking. The carves and trails were great, and many boxes were in very scenic locations. I highly recommend visiting this park, but go early and plan to spend all day. Also, if you are 62 or older you get in free, one of the few times my age worked to my advantage<span class="emoji">ðŸ‘´.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>Silver Eagle<br/></div></body></html>
