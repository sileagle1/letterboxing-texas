Monarchtrailer's school house series. It was a nice drive and not too <br>

it. Maybe I am wrong and it was another ceretery. <br>
I also volunteer to take pictures of grave stones and went to another <br>
cemetery to find 2 but was not so lucky. Anyone else do this? Could you <br>
tell me a good way to find the stone. Is there a secret to finding them?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You should be certain, first of all, that you are in the right <br>
cemetery.  The size of the cemetery is important.  If it's a small <br>
cemetery, you can walk up and down the rows fairly quickly and find <br>
what you're looking for.  The death date may be important.  There <br>
are older areas and newer areas of cemeteries.  You shouldn't look <br>
in the old part of the cemetery for a new stone.  Larger cemeteries <br>
usually have an office and good records, and are generally very <br>
willing to locate a grave for you on a map.  (In Sparkman-Hillcrest <br>
in Dallas, they chauffered me to a Texas governor's gravesite in a <br>
black limo and escorted me to the marker). If there is no office, go <br>
to the nearest funeral home.  They also keep records of grave <br>
locations for local cemeteries.  Just tell them you are doing <br>
genealogy or looking for the grave of a relative.  There are many <br>
genealogical websites that have cemetery records.  The USGenWeb <br>
Project is a good one  (www.usgenweb.org). Replace the US with the <br>
state abbreviation, (i.e. TXGenWeb), hosted by www.rootsweb.com,  to <br>
find a particular state.  www.findagrave.com is a good place to find <br>
burial places of famous people and, sometimes, anscestors.  Most of <br>
the time they don't give you the actual location in the cemetery, <br>
but I have found some that do.  Some even have gps coordinates.  <br>
Good Luck.<br>
