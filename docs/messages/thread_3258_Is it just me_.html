<div>I figured Ryan must be doing some upgrade on AQ because I couldn't get on either. The downtime of AQ usually doesn't last too long so hopefully it will be up and going again in an hour or so. (Fingers crossed.) I was printing out some clues last night and when I decided to continue today... no AQ! Drat.</div>

could get the second one my youngest daughter cut her<br/>
foot and was bleeding everywhere, then she could not<br/>
make it to the restroom and had an accident. My<br/>
husband said "It's not a lost day just yet, we can<br/>
swing by the house, get her changed, print clues in<br/>
the opposite direction and go out again". Then we get<br/>
home and can't get the clues. I always try to keep an<br/>
extra stash of clues that I think I would like to go<br/>
get but the folder I keep all that "stuff" in is not<br/>
accessible right now. Guess this means I'm going to<br/>
bed.  8 (<br/>

<div>I guess that's exactly what Barefoot Lucy was warning us about in her post yesterday... post your clues independently on AQ and LBNA so in case one goes down, we can still get to the clues on the other. Hey.... Lucy.... are you behind this? Did you somehow create this clever little sabotage to illustrate your point? Hmmmm..... I'm keeping my eye on you! Very suspicious.</div>

I tried going to LBNA and guess what? The<br/> clues I want are tied to AQ somehow and it won't let<br/> me get them.  Oh well maybe it just wasn't meant to be<br/> today. I had worked the night shift last night 7p-7a<br/> and wanted to get a couple of boxes before I hit the<br/> sack. We went this morning to look for Bikers Beware<br/> in Irving and found "Popping a Wheelie" but before we<br/> could get the second one my youngest daughter
 cut her<br/> foot and was bleeding everywhere, then she could not<br/> make it to the restroom and had an accident. My<br/> husband said "It's not a lost day just yet, we can<br/> swing by the house, get her changed, print clues in<br/> the opposite direction and go out again". Then we get<br/> home and can't get the clues. I always try to keep an<br/> extra stash of clues that I think I would like to go<br/> get but the folder I keep all that "stuff" in is not<br/> accessible right now. Guess this means I'm going to<br/> bed.  8 (<br/> <br/> --- Barefoot Lucy &lt;<a href="mailto:barefootlucy%40gmail.com">barefootlucy@<wbr/>gmail.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/> <br/> &gt; Folks on another list are having trouble with AQ.<br/> &gt; <br/> &gt; Did you look on LBNA for the boxes?<br/> &gt; <br/> &gt; On Dec 31, 2007 11:38 AM, loribaker2002<br/> &gt; &lt;<a href="mailto:loribaker2002%40yahoo.com">loribaker2002@<wbr/>yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/> &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt;   Is it just my internet server or is
