&gt; My Rocky Mt High box in Colorado has been out there for almost 2 years<br/>
&gt; and is still awaiting its first visitor (as far as I know).  Of<br/>
&gt; course, it is on top of the highest peak in CO.<br/>
<br/>
I have a box on the highest peak in the lower 48.  And it's a mystery <br/>
box.  It was found within a couple months of placing.  Of course, <br/>
AFAIK it hasn't been found since!<br/>

&gt; ok, i have a question for anyone who wants to answer it.  what is the <br/>
&gt; longest that you have ever waited for someone to find one of your <br/>
&gt; boxes?  i currently have a box that has been out there since december <br/>
&gt; 2006 that, to my knowledge, has not been found yet (not even by gg).  <br/>
&gt; so i was curious to find out if anyone else has had that happen, at <br/>
&gt; least in the last couple of years...lol.<br/>
