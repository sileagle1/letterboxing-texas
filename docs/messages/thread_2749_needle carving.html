<br>
okay, i am inspired by the phrase "needle carving" and<br>
have been to the the tractor store and got my needles<br>
and i am ready to go!  will this be a way to get<br>
really great detail and intricate images?  that is<br>
what I am hoping!  : ) <br>
<br>
but i can not figure it out. :(  push?  gouge?  pull? <br>
dig?  slice?  how?   what's the best technique?  do<br>
you just hold the little needle thing at its base?  do<br>
people use it with the syringe part?  i have searched<br>
everywhere i can think of and can not find a link for<br>
this.......any links to share?<br>
<br>
thanks for your help,<br>

ahoy..i just got some needles to play with.  i found if i use them<br>
like an exacto knife it works pretty good.  Putting the needle into a<br>
pin vise is also recommended.  i believe there are some tutorials.  i<br>
will see if i can find them <br>
