                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to take a minute to brag and be a proud mom. Several of <br/>
you know me and my daughter (aka PomPom Bear) from gatherings and <br/>
meets. Well we just spent from 7 am till 10:30pm at the softball park. <br/>
She has only been playing for one season and made the All Star Team. <br/>
They had their first tournament today in White Settlement and she won <br/>
MVP. They gave her a trophy and the game ball and I couldn't be <br/>
prouder. This is something I know she will be very proud of and if you <br/>
ever see us at a gathering...it won't be hard to guess what her <br/>
personal traveler is!!!! Thanks for letting me brag!<br/>
