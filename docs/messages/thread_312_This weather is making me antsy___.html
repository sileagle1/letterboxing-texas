                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sometime about the end of July, I fell into a real<br>
funk about the summer heat (I hate heat!  Hate it!)<br>
and didn't have any desire to go traipse through brush<br>
and woods to find boxes.  I had satisfied myself<br>
during the first part of the summer with carving<br>
stamps and making boxes, but eventually that's just<br>
not as much fun if you never take the boxes anywhere<br>
and leave them.  I was to the point that I considered<br>
stacking them in my car, so I could at least feel like<br>
I was ready to go!  <br>
<br>
Fortunately, we got preoccupied with scout stuff and<br>
were out of town for an extended period of time with<br>
that, so that when I hit home again a week ago, I felt<br>
like I had finally survived the summertime and there<br>
was hope yet for nice weather!<br>
<br>
Well, this weekend, I think I'm really, really gonna<br>
get out there and take some boxes out!  I'm thinking<br>
they'll be somewhere north and east of Tyler, a real<br>
dry area for boxes.  I can't wait to get outside for<br>
awhile!<br>
