Well I just got back from Spring Break vacation with the<br>
family to West Texas & New Mexico, and it looks like a lot<br>
has happened while I was gone.  The LB article finally <br>
came out, several new members have joined this list, and<br>
many new boxes have been placed!  First of all, welcome<br>
to all new members.  Second, kudos to Barefoot Lucy for<br>
helping make the LB article a success.  I was also<br>
interviewed, but she actually met with the reporter to<br>
show how it works.  I guess if I am Yoda, she must be Obi-Wan.<br>
<br>
Silver Eagle<br>
<br>
P.S.  I managed to place 7 new boxes in West Texas and 1 in <br>
      New Mexico, and found a few along the way.  I was<br>
      not able to visit Hueco Tanks because it requires<br>
      reservations just to visit and I did not have any.<br>
      I also did not have time to go for the one in Franklin<br>
      Mountains since it looks like a tough climb.  Oh well.<br>
      The family did make it up Guadalupe Peak, though, and<br>
      I was FF for Top Of Texas LB.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just got back from vacation in Canada without kids (unless you count <br>
Baby Bear and his wife) and it was wonderful.  We flew to Calgary and <br>
drove to Banff, Jasper & Yoho National Parks, all fairly close by.  <br>
This was the third time I have been and I highly recommend it.  Very <br>
few places have so much scenery and wildlife in such a concentrated <br>
area.  Oh yeah, and the weather was cool (highs in low 70's and low in <br>
upper 30's)!  We even found and placed a few boxes, but I must admit <br>
that was way down on our list of things to do and see.<br>
<br>
While I was gone, Blue Butterfly replaced my Tyler Rose stamp and log <br>
that I sent her, so it is ready for visitors.  Also, Compass Points <br>
replaced my Cherokee Cowboy stamp and log that I sent her in Oklahoma.  <br>
Thanks to both for helping me out!  Also, looks like late <br>
congratulations are in order for BL.  Glad to hear everything is ok and <br>
I'm looking forward to the first "Grandma Letterbox".<br>

First of all, welcome to Topcrop.  It's always nice to have a new boxer, especially when they are from my area:)<br>
<br>
On the question of box longevity, I think there are several factors involved:  length of hike, distance from trail, good hiding place and finders willing to replace well.  It is ironic that the boxes that last the longest seem to be the ones least visited.  When I first started placing, I used to put my boxes close to the trail so they were easy to get to, but I now put them a little further away if possible.  I also created mystery boxes and games to solve to limit visitation on some.  This has helped, but sometimes it just boils down to luck as Boots said.  I have placed boxes way off trail only to have them go missing within months, and others placed next to trails last for years.  As an example, on my vacation I had a chance to check on my Canada Goose box placed in 2004 while on a backpacking trip with Baby Bear.  At the time of placement we were hiking with 40 lb packs in the rain so it was not the greatest hiding place.  However, that box is still going strong and on its second logbook.<br>
<br>
Speaking of Canada, it is a great place to visit and I highly recommend going if you get a chance.  The area I am talking about is around Calgary along the Icefields Pkwy and includes 7 National Parks; eight if you count Glacier NP in US.  The scenery is fantastic and wildlife is abundant.  We saw elk, moose, bighorn sheep, mountain goats, marmots, loons, black and grizzly bears.  There are not too many letterboxes away from Calgary, so I added some as further incentive.  For an itinerary similar to what we did you can look on my son's Trips To Go website at the Icefields and Glaciers trip:<br>

Welcome back, SE. Sounds like you had a good trip. (And welcome to you too, Topcrop. Looking forward to meeting you.)<br>
Your mention of Glacier Nat'l Park reminds me of the experience Bird Dog and I had there many years ago. Actually, we'd been married a few yrs, but had not yet had a honeymoon. So we decided to go camping in Glacier, the Canadian side, as soon as school was out. The park and scenery were gorgeous. Saw the requisite bears and elk and deer. However, we didn't reckon on it still being SNOW season in Canada in early June. Blizzard came in our 2nd night, and our sleeping bags did not zip together. Decided to head south, and ended up in Yellowstone. Both of us had wonderful childhood memories of camping there with family, and watching Old Faithful spew forth. Headed for the Lodge, hoping for a room on the Old Faithful side. Yes, they had one left. We'll take it! Only to discover that there was a HUGE pine tree right outside the window blocking the entire view!<br>
Looking forward to the Bear Tale at TALE<br>
