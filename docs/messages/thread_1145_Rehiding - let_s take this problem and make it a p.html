<br>
*****A placer needs to think of what will be available<br>
to use as cover material throughout the four seasons.<br>
<br>
If the box is in a high traffic area, the placer needs<br>
to consider the time it will take the finder to rehide<br>
and choose a place to minimize the time needed. <br>
Possibly suggest lower traffic times that would be<br>
appropriate for a finder to look?<br>
<br>
<br>
> <br>
> What defines a good rehide?<br>
<br>
*********After being rehidden, the box is not visible<br>
from any angle and the cover doesn't appear contrived<br>
or fake.  Everything that came out of the box is back<br>
in the box properly and there is no evidence in the<br>
immediate area that someone has paused at the site.<br>
<br>
> <br>
> What are tips for a finder to follow as they rehide?<br>
******Take the time to look at how the box is hidden<br>
before removing it from its hiding place.  Look around<br>
to make sure you know what you will use to rehide with<br>
(i.e. if a lot of the cover is leaves and pine straw,<br>
consider that what is covering the box when you find<br>
it may crumble away, so make sure you have more<br>
available).  If you're boxing in a group, make sure<br>
one person is responsible for checking the box after<br>
everyone moves away.  Look at the site from all<br>
angles.<br>

<div>
<div>It probably does go both ways. People (and I admit I blame it on the droves of newcomers that really do not GET this hobby) are remiss about not hiding stuff well, but there have to be placers who really don't take everything into consideration when they hide either. One rule of thumb for me is if I can hide it thoroughly,  given the location, pedestrian traffic, etc,  the person should be able to put it back the same way they found it without a problem. And the changing of the seasons :::is:::: a HUGE factor in some places. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Considering the pace of life that lots of people allow themselves to be subjected to these days, I think some people may just be in too big of a hurry when they box. This is not a hobby that can always be sandwiched between 37 other weekend activities. </div>

<div> Here is my .02:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1. What should the placer take into account when placing a box, so that finders can be better rehiders?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If the box is not urban, make sure there are several paths to the box, so that a "social" trail is not created by people going to and from the box. If you are looking for a box, and see a "social" trail, don't use it. Take another route. Often, you can detour by just a yard or two. Try not to trample plants and bushes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If natural materials are used to hide the box, there should be a ready supply of those materials in the area surrounding the box- sticks, leaves, bark, stones, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>2. What defines a good rehide?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Walk in a circle around the box, insofar as is possible due to the location, to be sure that no portion of the box is visible.  In addition, the covering material must look natural, and not call attention to the location of the box (i.e., don't pile up a bunch of sticks and stones so that they are screaming "look here!).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3. What are tips for a finder to follow as they rehide?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Make sure to re-pack the box just as you found it, or better. Use all the baggies, and double-bag if possible. Use your first aid kit as needed- paper towel for the stamp, extra baggie, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Make sure you have a good re-hide; see #2.</div></div>

<div>Happy Trails,</div>
