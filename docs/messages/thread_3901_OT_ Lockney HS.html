LOCKNEY, Texas  Fire has destroyed Lockney High School.<br>
<br>
Classes were canceled Monday at the school in Lockney, about 60 miles <br>
northeast of Lubbock, as investigators seek the cause of Sunday <br>
night's blaze.<br>
<br>
Nobody was hurt. The building was unoccupied at the time of the fire.<br>
<br>
Floyd County Sheriff Paul Raissez (rah-ee-sis) told KCBD-TV that the <br>
structure is a total loss and arson has not been ruled out. He says <br>
it appears the fire started on the south side of the building.<br>
<br>
Some residents of the town of more than 1,800 watched as the crews <br>
battle the blaze around 11 p.m. Sunday.<br>
<br>
KCBD reports several people managed to get computers, band <br>
instruments and documents out of the junior high school, which is <br>
connected to the high school and also suffered damage.<br>
<br>
A prayer service was held Monday morning outside the fire-ravaged <br>
high school, as administrators try to determine where classes will be <br>
held.<br>
