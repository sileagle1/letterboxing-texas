<div>Consider this...would YOU eat food you found in a box?  Even packaged?  It's a nice thought and all, but dang.  </div>

<div>That's my thing - among others - if I just found packaged food in a box, why should I think it didn't have an "interesting" past?  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess maybe you have to be old enough to remember the LSD scare of the early 70's, when everyone was afraid to put their sodas in the armrest holder at the theatre for fear someone would come sneak along and lace the drink with acid.  I always kind of thought drug users were a LITTLE smarter than to waste their stash on unwitting strangers, but I had this vision of a shadowy figure sneaking up and down the rows in a theatre, stopping at the elbow of an unwitting movie-goer and dropping a tab of acid in their drinks, pausing only long enough to snicker wickedly in anticipation of a whole theatre full of tripping, hallucinating movie fans leaving the theatre in an unfit state.  It always stuck with me anyway - food or drink with unknown origins is just not within the boundaries...<br/>
</div>
<div>And as much as anything, the Texas heat can curdle just about anything, given enough time...yuk! </div>
