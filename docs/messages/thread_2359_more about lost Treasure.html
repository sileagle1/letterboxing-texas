<br>
thanks for your kind thoughts about my first lost box.<br>
 i knew you'd understand, and i knew the Others<br>
wouldn't (non-letterboxers, i mean).....i have not<br>
even bothered to mention it elsewhere!  : )<br>
<br>
as far as help finding it, thanks for that, too, and<br>
here are some responses to your comments.<br>
<br>
actually, Treasure had been relocated, kinda-sorta,<br>
and it was not at the scout hut anymore, so no need to<br>
look there.  i tried to look there, just in case, but<br>
there were cars all around on that day.  i'm going to<br>
ask my mom to check things out again, since she lives<br>
closer, and she can go in the early mornings when<br>
there will probably be fewer people at the park.<br>
<br>
as far as what happened, it looked like there has<br>
either been a huge storm, or they are beginning to<br>
clear the area for construction, or something, because<br>
lots of trees were down and in particular there was a<br>
big huge pile of brush down over/around/on the place<br>
where the box should have been.  i did try for several<br>
minutes to look around in the wider general area, but<br>
it was pretty piled with stuff and getting dark, so i<br>
did not stay quite as long as i might have.  <br>
<br>
and thanks for the "it might turn up later" thoughts. <br>
i had that thought, immediately, since i have heard<br>
several of you mention that situation about your own<br>
boxes, here on the list, so my disappointment was<br>
immediately cushioned with hope.<br>
<br>
i did like having one at the scout hut and so i do<br>
intend to put it back there (not done yet, though).<br>
<br>
thanks for your kind thoughts<br>
