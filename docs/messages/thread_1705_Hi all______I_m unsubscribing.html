go and not say anything, and I see it hasn't taken effect yet so <br/>
I'll post one more time. <br/>
<br/>
In all honesty, the times I *do* post, which I know aren't that <br/>
often, I feel like I'm kind of talking to myself. That's probably <br/>
because I *don't* post that often. I don't have any boxes in Texas <br/>
anynore and probably won't be planting anymore until I retire and <br/>
hopefully move back there, so I really don't feel like I'm part of <br/>
Texas boxing. <br/>
<br/>
Some of you might remember I work for the transit authority here in <br/>
nyc and we went on strike recently, as you may have read or heard. I <br/>
just found out that next month they will be taking the fines out of <br/>
both our paychecks next month. I don't think this is the time for me <br/>
to be spending money on plane tickets, car rentals and hotels and I <br/>
don't want to just charge them, so once again I won't be coming to <br/>
the gathering. I had been questioning whether or not I should come <br/>
anyway, for the same reasons I am leaving the list. <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully I'll be living back out there in the not too distant <br/>
future and can become a real part of the Texas boxing community. <br/>
Right now I just don't feel that I am.<br/>

I know you all will have a wonderful time at the gathering.<br/>

<div>I see I'm still subscribed, so....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm perfectly happy. This has nothing to do with happiness. You're reading too much into it. There's no need to feel sorry for me, though the thought is appreciated. This has to do with my feelings about not being a part of the list or of Texas boxing. Period. Nothing more. And being a tad short of playing around money for the next couple of months. There's really no need to "hope I find happiness somewhere". But thanks anyway. The thought is appreciated anyway. </div>

feel truly a part of Texas boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I for one, would truly miss your unique insights and<br/>
Texan-in-exile view on all things boxing and Texas.  Of course, do<br/>
what feels right, but personally I'd love it if you stay a part of the<br/>
list, even if you just lurk.<br/>
<br/>
As to the gathering, we'll miss you, but totally understand.  For us,<br/>
it seems like a week hasn't gone by recently when there hasn't been<br/>
some sort of "emergency"-- car, health or home related.  If we<br/>
couldn't drive, we wouldn't be come either.<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>

&gt; I'm perfectly happy. This has nothing to do with happiness. You're<br/>
reading too much into it. There's no need to feel sorry for me, though<br/>
the thought is appreciated. This has to do with my feelings about not<br/>
being a part of the list or of Texas boxing. Period. Nothing more. And<br/>
being a tad short of playing around money for the next couple of<br/>
months. There's really no need to "hope I find happiness somewhere".<br/>
But thanks anyway. The thought is appreciated anyway. <br/>

&gt; It sounds like life isn't making you happy right now.  I am sorry<br/>
for you.  Hope you find happiness somewhere.  And then return to the<br/>
list - AND Texas.<br/>
