Ditto, MO5. It was a wonderful day. Great to make new friends and put <br>
faces with the names we've seen in log books and clue lists. Kudos to <br>
Baby and Bear and to Silver Eagle for organizing and sponsoring this <br>
annual event. Thank you.<br>
<br>
I'm sorry I missed meeting you, MO5. I think I was lost on the other <br>
end of Hebron trail while you were inspecting rocks and birds. (How <br>
is it I can "follow" a map and still come out where my car is NOT <br>
parked?) I had looked forward to finding out why you will never leave <br>
Texas.<br>
<br>
See y'all next year! Bird Dog should be over the flu by then...<br>

<div>As always happens, we made great new friends and got to visit with old ones.  It's funny to me how people I see only once or twice a year can be such good friends, but it happens that way.  It also happens that new friends seem like old ones right away too, doesn't it?</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I want to chime in with thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for <br>
another great event!  You did a fantastic job of putting everything <br>
together - the location, the weather (I'll give you credit for that <br>
too!), the food, and of course, the wonderful people.<br>
<br>
We arrived Friday afternoon, checked into our little cabin, planted a <br>
few letterboxes, then drove in a big loop around Bastrop looking for <br>
the American Legion hall, only to find it was back at the beginning of <br>
the loop!  We joined Barefoot Lucy and her family for a fish fry, and I <br>
had the pleasure of meeting Fearless Fox and Nac Trail Cat's husband <br>
(never did catch his new trail name!)  We got to talking about Lucy's <br>
homemade Bailey's and Puddle Splasher's (or was that Viewfinder's?) <br>
recipe for bourban balls... and I told them about Chocolate Cake shots. <br>
Thus encouraged, we headed back into town after dinner for the <br>
ingredients before settling down for the night.<br>
<br>
Saturday was fabulous. It seems like I spent time doing all the things <br>
that make for a memorable letterboxing event... seeing old friends, <br>
doing exchanges and making new friends, solving personal travelers, <br>
finding traditional letterboxes, eating some great chili, eating some <br>
more great chili, and finding more boxes (and laughing at ourselves for <br>
our remarkable lack of stealth).<br>
<br>
Lucy, I think the reason that we connect so well when we see each other <br>
in person is due in part to this talklist. The sense of community on <br>
this list carries over to gatherings, so that we pick up right where we <br>
left off, and even new friends seem like old buddies.<br>
<br>
I also enjoyed the campfire chat last night.  It was such a relaxing <br>
end to an already great day.  It was fun sharing stories of our <br>
adventures - or MISadventures as the case may be, bidding farewell to <br>
the Cranberry Cruiser, eating that scrumptious cobbler (thanks again <br>
Fearless Fox and Lightening!), and sneaking in another chocolate cake <br>
shot with Fearless Fox when no one else was looking.  :D<br>
<br>
But all good things must come to an end, so this morning we packed up, <br>
said some final good byes and found a few more letterboxes before <br>
leaving the park.  <br>
<br>
As the perfect ending to a perfect weekend, we stopped by Buescher <br>
State Park and found the Lost Pines letterbox on our way home.  It <br>
seemed incredible that a letterbox could survive in the wild for 7-1/2 <br>
years, but when we found it we understood how this piece of Texas <br>
letterboxing history has lasted so long.  The trail was one of the most <br>
beautiful I've seen, the hiding spot was carefully chosen to avoid <br>
accidental detection, and the stamp well done and relavent to the <br>
location.  As much as I was in awe of the history behind the box, it <br>
set the ideal of what a letterbox should be.  Like I said, a perfect <br>
ending to a perfect weekend.<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone who contributed, by planting a letterbox, by taking <br>
time to talk, by contributing to the pot luck, or simply by your <br>
presence.  You are each a Texas Treasure!<br>
