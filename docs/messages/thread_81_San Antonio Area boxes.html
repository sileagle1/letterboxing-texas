                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent the weekend camping and letterboxing in the hill country, <br>
what a time we had!  We stopped off in SA on our way home and looked <br>
for COTTONWOOD, we found the spot where it should have been, but no <br>
box to be found.  Of course, it was so crowdwe that we couldn't <br>
really look around too much, but I'm pretty sure it wasn't there.  We <br>
did find the stonehenge box in Hunt, if you are going to SA its not <br>
too far away, its an amazing drive, and a VERY strange place.  Only <br>
in Texas.  Have fun!  -Mother of Four-<br>
