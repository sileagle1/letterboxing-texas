I take it as a good thing too, that they are fine with<br/>
boxes in their park as long as they aren't around<br/>
structures.  <br/>
<br/>
It really is kind of funny too - I never would've<br/>
thought that to mean "cover the well back up", but I<br/>
can see why he would!  I'll bet he had heart failure<br/>
when he thought someone was uncovering their well to<br/>
do something sneaky and that they needed to recover it<br/>
when they were done!<br/>

<div>Well, that explains it - Just as I thought, it's Lena's box that was near 
the well.  BUT the well was definitely covered when we were there and I 
don't think those rabbits or the coyotes or even the armadillo moved that heavy 
concrete cover!  Still strange.  Glad your box is OK though.  I 
hate to be the last finder when something happens to a box!  --

<div>I'm still laughing at the ranger's take on the phrase: "recover well"! Makes sense. I'll never read that instruction again though without thinking of this episode!</div>

I just got this reply from the ranger and it appears<br/>
