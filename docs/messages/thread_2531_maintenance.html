</p><div>Taking advantage of a beautiful, sunny day in the DFW area, I did a little box maintenance today. I checked on my "Watch Out for Tarantulas" box which had been reported missing, but in fact is not. I replaced my "Duck, Duck Goose" letterbox that was missing (same place/clues, new box). Then I hid a new box, Cabin Fever. </div>

<div>It's a beautiful day for letterboxing in north Texas. Hope everyone is having a good time!</div>
