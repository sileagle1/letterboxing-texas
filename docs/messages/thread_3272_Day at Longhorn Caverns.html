afternoon at Longhorn Caverns.  I wish to thank Skyebird, Baby Bear, <br>
TulipManiaFamiy, and Gingercat for spending the time to place boxes.  I <br>
spent an enjoyable 3 hours walking and looking and found all but one.  <br>
Picked up several ideas of how to do things and will have to get a <br>
knapsack together so I can do abit of first aid if needed.  Sorry I <br>
didn't have anything with me but I did learn that I should, just for <br>
others that may come after me.  I did write to those that needed some <br>
aid and as I travel that road every few months will check them next <br>
time I'm in the area.  <br>
