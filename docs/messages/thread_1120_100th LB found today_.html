                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today (a nice COOL day in north Texas!)2 of the granddaughters and I <br/>
found the Red-Eared Slider LB in Arlington planted by Urban <br/>
Letterboxer - and another little turtle HH was lurking in there, too <br/>
(Slowpoke, left there recently by the Samurai Stampers who were the <br/>
last visitors to that LB.)  This marks my 100th and now, 101st LB!  <br/>
Hooray!  Break out the confetti!  (and guess who had been the FF of <br/>
this LB?  Why, of course, that elusive silver GG!  Even my 7-year old <br/>
and 5-year old have begun to remark that his stamp is everywhere we <br/>
go!)  This is sort of appropriate, come to think of it, since the first <br/>
stamp I carved and one of the first LB's I planted was a turtle, drawn <br/>
by the 7-year-old ("In the Creek - Lauren's Turtle").  Must be <br/>
something about turtles!  -- ALSO we pulled a LB today for rescue <br/>
reasons - "In the Pond - Allie's Duck" was in the middle of a group of <br/>
little boys playing war who were all around it and just hadn't yet <br/>
noticed it, although it was lying actually lying out in view.  We hope <br/>
we were stealthy enough in removing it that they didn't see it, but we <br/>
took it with us.  I will replace it and possibly move it.  So hold off <br/>
on finding that one if you haven't already - I'll put it back ASAP. -- <br/>
