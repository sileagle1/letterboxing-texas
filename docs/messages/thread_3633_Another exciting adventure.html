                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well i have already told the group about getting to pet an 8 week <br>
old white tiger, and an alligator.  well today i had another <br>
interesting adventure (not once in a life time  though)  i went to <br>
the tx state railroad park in palestine to find chancelier_de_lbu <br>
boxes.  i actually went first to look for barefoot lucy's box in the <br>
same park that had been reported as missing.  as i was searching for <br>
that box, i stumbled across box #3 of the chancelier's box series <br>
and proceeded down the trail to pick up 4,5,6.  i then went back to <br>
find box 1 and when i finally got to the tree that i was sure it was <br>
and looked in the hole that it was in, i realized that chancelier <br>
had placed a guard on this box...a copperhead...he was all curled up <br>
and quite content.  well i had my navigator walking with me, and so <br>
i pulled him closer to me and proceeded to start tossing a couple of <br>
sticks toward the guard to try to get thim to move on...this did not <br>
work.  i realized that you can stand over the hole and look down at <br>
it, so i then found a long branch that i figured i would use to <br>
caress him to leave his station...well it worked, however instead of <br>
moving on, he just moved further into the hole.  so he stood his <br>
post and i moved on to box #2.  i found box #2 and then proceeded to <br>
wolf lake park (which i had a very difficult time finding) and <br>
finally found those two boxes.  I then decided to go back to the <br>
railroad park and get that box one way or another.  i happened to <br>
have my grabber in the back of my car (the long stick that has a <br>
handle to grab things with) so i got it out, and the snake was gone <br>
and using the grabber I GOT THE BOX..what an interesting <br>
experience...but jim please make sure that you warn people that you <br>
have a guard for this box...LOL<br>
