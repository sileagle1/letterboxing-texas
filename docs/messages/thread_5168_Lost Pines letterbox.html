                  event, but the lid has contours on the top that at
                  first made me think it was cracked, 'til I had a
                  closer look.  Curious what you'll find.  I think that
                  location drains really well, but the rocks would
                  definitely have torn an outer baggie.</span></div>

    Well, I did not get to go to Buescher and Bastrop State Parks as
    planned on Friday. I spend the day (and night) at Round Rock
    Hospital instead after waking up Friday morning with shortness of
    breath and a tight chest. EKG and stress test were both normal so we
    don't really know what caused the problems yet. I feel fine now and
    I might go out tomorrow but will probably not try to get ALL the
    great sounding boxes that are now listed on AQ and LbNA in the
    Smithville area, at least not all in one day!<br/>
<br/>
    Did anyone try to locate that 10 year old TCM box that the Mattke
    Family placed for TALE1 but never listed?<br/>

    Silver Eagle posted directions to a box that the Mattke Family
    placed 10 years ago but never published. Here is a link to them:<br/>

<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/files/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/files/</a> and the file
