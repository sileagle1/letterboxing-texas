                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went camping with my daughter yesterday and managed to place a few <br>
boxes along the way.  First, I placed a new Mystery box called Jesse's <br>
Jewels 2 to replace the one that went missing.  The first several <br>
finders will get some jewels to keep.<br>
<br>
Next, I finally placed a box that was long overdue.  Quilted Boots is a <br>
box in tribute to Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter.  I think most of you <br>
will agree that they are fine representatives of TX Letterboxers, and <br>
their boxes are worth the drive!<br>
<br>
Then I placed another Mystery box called Jonathan Livingston Seagull, <br>
which is part of my Literature Series.  It won't be hard to find and I <br>
hope you read the book if you haven't already.<br>
<br>
Finally, I relocated my Livingston Largemouth microbox and replaced the <br>
log, so reprint the clues before you go for it.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

(no cavorting but lots of shivering last night)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a nice gesture, Mr. Silver Eagle, and a special honor.  The first <br>
letterbox we ever found, just over three years ago, was your box, "Big <br>
Creek Bug".  It was very close to our house, but this one is literally <br>
in our back yard, so we'll be going out there to find it today.  Thanks <br>
for the recognition; we just enjoy being a part of the family of Texas <br>
letterboxers.<br>
