                    <div class="plaintext-content">Early on this baseball season, I created a letterbox in honor of the late and<br>
great announcer of the Philadelphia Phillies, Harry Kalas. This box was<br>
available to letterboxers at all the home games I attended this past season. <br>
With this year's season coming to an unfortunate close for Phillies fans, I am<br>
now ready to send Harry on a postal journey to reach Phillies fans near and far<br>
that weren't able to get to any of the games I was at. If you have an interest<br>
in getting Harry as a postal letterbox please send me your name and address in a<br>
message on Atlasquest or to my email: fishthis@.... The message will<br>
end up in my junkmail box so be sure to put HARRY THE K in the subject line.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
