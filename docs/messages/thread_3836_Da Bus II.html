&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the entrance to the park, head straight back to a path in the<br/>
&gt; woods.  You'll know you're in the right place if there's <br/>
gravel 'neath<br/>
&gt; your feet...go down this path 26 steps.  Look to the left, there's <br/>
an<br/>
&gt; about to keel-over decaying stump.  Behind that stump is a tree<br/>
&gt; surrounded by a multitude of humongous vines.  Beneath the two <br/>
largest<br/>
&gt; vines you'll find the bus (don't touch the vines on the tree--<br/>
they're<br/>
&gt; hairy and therefore scary).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy to get this on the road again.  Look for the circus next week.<br/>

&gt; Oh good, it's not in the best long-term location.  It's in a good<br/>
&gt; temporary location if you bring bug spray.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're going to Austin for Thanksgiving, I figured if it was still @<br/>
&gt; Telge then, I'd get it and move it on up the road.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for the circus, well, that thing is huge!  I'm working on my <br/>
entry<br/>
&gt; to the Texas circus as we speak.  My son just had something he <br/>
really<br/>
&gt; wanted me to carve and I've had a hard time finding an image.<br/>

consider it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your election day treat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The bus driver had been hearing about some Halloween ghosties <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; goblins at Telge park and decided he needed to check it out <br/>
&gt; &gt; himself. <br/>
