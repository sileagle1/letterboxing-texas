                    <div class="plaintext-content">Two of our boxes in Gonzales that were previously unavailable, have been replaced and/or relocated.  "The Hat Makers", which was buried by construction work, then retrieved by the hard work and generous spirit of Mosaic Butterfly, has been moved to a completely different and much  location.  "Sarah DeWitt's Flag", by Lone Star Quilter, which had been missing, has been replaced and moved to a slightly different location, very close to the original location.  That was a challenge.  The tiny (maybe 50 ft. square) DeWitt family cemetery, which I assume was once remote, is now completely surrounded by a large rodeo and roping arena and complex.  When we were there before, nothing was going on, so it was quiet, but this time there was some kind of rodeo event happening and we were surrounded by horses, horse trailers, and cowgirls.  I hope that they were involved in their own world and weren't paying attention to what we were doing.  If you head that way, be sure to print out the new clues.<br/>
