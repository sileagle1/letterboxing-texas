The dust has settled and we have two XL Lone Star Letterboxing T-shirts<br>
left - I ordered a couple extra, because I couldn't predict how many of<br>
my sons would want one ;-).<br>
If you'd like one or both, please email me off-list:<br>
celticlions@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Also, I noticed that we've added several new members to the group -<br>
that's exciting! If anybody would like to get another group order going,<br>
we just have to order a minimum of 12 shirts: the basic price is $9.00,<br>
with larger sizes costing a couple of dollars more. If you're<br>
interested, please mail me off this main group list for details.<br>
<br>
(BTW I wore my Letterboxing T-shirt in to talk to someone in a public<br>
building about placing an inside letterbox today - it helped to look<br>
semi-legitimate!)<br>
<br>
NOTE: Down the street from the T-shirt silk-screener is a company that<br>
creates embroidered patches. Would anyone be interested in having me<br>
check out prices for a Lone Star Letterboxer patch? I think they'd be<br>
cool to add to backpacks, hats or heavier shirts (or for holiday gifts).<br>
I've never ordered patches from them, but I've done business with them<br>
for years to make pins, so I know they're reliable.<br>
<br>
If I can convince my husband or sons, we'll create an order page<br>
someday, so that this can be easier for everybody!<br>

Take care,<br>

I haven't ordered any, so I can't give firsthand feedback. But if enough<br>
of us in Texas are interested, I'd be glad to check out having<br>
Texas-shaped versions made. There is a patch/pin store down the street<br>
from where we made the T-shirts.<br>
Incidentally, we still don't have quite enough T-shirts to submit an<br>
order - we need 5 more, I think - so let me know if anyone would like to<br>
join the ranks of the fashionable Lone Star Letterboxers!<br>
