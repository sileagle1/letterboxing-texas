Yes, I have found the Mysterious GG to be very helpful<br/>
in taking care of the boxes. Just this week he broke<br/>
the bad news to me that the Park I had planted 2 boxes<br/>
in had done some changes and my boxes are no where to<br/>
be found. I'm bummed. <br/>

Just in case you have a trip planned to Nacogdoches, I<br/>
wanted to let the list know that our Chillin' at<br/>
Tonkawa box has been pulled.  Apparently they cut down<br/>
my landmark tree - why on this deserted dirt road they<br/>
would do this, I have no idea.  The most interesting<br/>
part of this is WHO saved it for me - the famous GG. <br/>
Thanks to Barefoot Lucy who forwared me his message<br/>
about the save :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year!!<br/>

We were talking today on our way home from Nacogdoches<br/>
about first boxes planted by various people and<br/>
ourselves.  One of my all-time favorites was also one<br/>
of my first and it disappeared before it was ever even<br/>
found.<br/>
<br/>
I had hoped to find your Pretty in Purple one of these<br/>
days - purple is my favorite color!<br/>
<br/>
Have you considered contacting the park to see if they<br/>
know what happened to it?  We've seen a lot of strange<br/>
things lately, including the Frye Team's Box, Chillin'<br/>
at Tonkawa, which was displaced from its home but<br/>
found by Gryzzled Gryphon on the side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
I don't remember if I shared this story with the list,<br/>
or just with Baby Bear, but he had received a report<br/>
that his box was missing at Caddoan Mounds.  The<br/>
structure where it was hidden had been completely<br/>
removed.  I had noticed a newspaper article about a<br/>
boy scout troop doing the work as part of one boy's<br/>
Eagle project, so I contacted the Scoutmaster to see<br/>
if he knew anything.  As it happened, he had not<br/>
participated in that particular Eagle project, so he<br/>
knew nothing and I forgot about it.  A few months<br/>
later, I was sitting on an Eagle Board of Review for a<br/>
boy in the same troop as the boy who had done the work<br/>
at Caddoan Mounds, so I asked him if he had worked on<br/>
the Caddo project.  He hadn't, but a lady from his<br/>
troop was in the room and heard my question and said<br/>
that she had been there (it was, in fact, her son's<br/>
Eagle project) and she had actually found the box. <br/>
She had set it aside to look at it later because she<br/>
was curious (and at this point in her story, I was<br/>
holding my breath), but when she went back to it, it<br/>
had been picked up by the truck hauling off debris and<br/>
was sent away.  Even though the story didn't end as we<br/>
had hoped it would, it was good to be able to tell<br/>
Baby Bear exactly what had happened with his box and<br/>
it was interesting to see how odd things happen.  <br/>
<br/>
I decided then and there that I'm not going to just<br/>
walk away again if I have a box go missing - I'm going<br/>
to ask around and see if I can find someone who knows<br/>
something - you just never know!<br/>

I plan to contact the park office on Tuesday and see<br/>
if they know anything about it. It has "Not Trash,<br/>
