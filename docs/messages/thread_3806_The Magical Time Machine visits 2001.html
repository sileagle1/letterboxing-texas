                    <html><body><div dir="ltr"><div>Wow - cool!  I know you were pointing out the notable scarcity of boxes, but what I noticed was how the state used to be divided up.  I had forgotten that. The divisions were really awkward because the folks who made the divisions did the best they could, but they just didn't know Texas.  This is yet another project that Silver Eagle spearheaded - getting the divisions changed up.  We all gave our thoughts on how it should be in the early days of this list, then he put it all together and submitted it to the webmasters.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You may not know this, but the  long-time webmasters have a great deal of respect for Silver Eagle because when he makes suggestions, he also presents solutions, and he is willing to do some of the gruntwork to make it happen.  That attitude goes a LONG way toward getting things done on <a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a>, which is operated entirely by volunteers who, like the rest of us, have jobs and lives and a scarcity of time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of other things to notice:  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you go to the Dallas area region, you will see Duck Creek.  This was actually a series of four, and it represents the very first letterboxes in the state.  They were created by a boxer named Ex Posto Facto.  She was/is a mail art aficionado, highly respected in that community.  Those boxes were washed away by high waters and she was very frustrated and disheartened by the disappearance of her art (because for her, the art was the driving factor of letterboxing and the outdoors was a bonus feature), and moved away from letterboxing.  Ruby Tuesday, another dear friend to Texas letterboxing, tracked Ex Posto Facto down and spoke with her, inviting her to a gathering in Dallas.  She was unable to attend, but Ruby was very taken with her.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you also look at the Bob Woodruff Letterbox, this box followed closely behind Duck Creek chronologically and was created by a friend of Ex Posto Facto's - I don't quite recall her name and don't feel like looking it up at the moment.  Anyway, that hand-created map and the idea of "family" boxes was quite a source of discussion in the very small national group in the early days.  Letterboxing at that time was considered to be an adult pasttime and some folks didn't think it should be geared toward kids or it might become oversimplified.  Now I'm not saying I agree, but it IS something to think about, especially when folks get indignant about boxes not being okay for kids.  Thankfully we grew enough that we could move past that thinking and find that while all boxes aren't great for kids or for other boxers with limitations of some sort, some are perfect for kids and families.  We now have such a wide variety of boxes that virtually anyone has plenty of boxes they can enjoy.  <br/>
</div>
<div>And finally, notice that the three highest-populated counties as of now - Harris, Tarrant, and Cherokee - aren't even represented on that map.  Now for those of you in areas with low box populations, let that be encouragement that with effort and a little creativity, your area CAN become a boxing mecca in the state.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not only have we added "a few boxes" since 2001, we have grown as a <br>
community, too.  When I first found out about letterboxing in April <br>
of 2002, the map looked just about like this with maybe 2 or 3 more <br>
boxes in the Central Region.  It was bad enough that there were no <br>
boxes near me, but there weren't even any letterboxers still <br>
participating in Texas that I knew of.  Even after Baby Bear and I<br>
started placing boxes in late 2002, growth was slow.  It wasn't until <br>
our first Event in March, 2004 that things began to pick up, and we <br>
have grown exponentially ever since. <br>
<br>
Of the 12 boxes listed on this 2001 map, I attempted all but the West <br>
Texas boxes and found only 4:  Lost Pines, Enchanted Rock, Mayfield <br>
Park and Lighthouse.  All 4 were placed by Eoghan and as far as I <br>
know are still out there (along with a few others of his).  This is a <br>
great testament to the hiding abilities of one of the early pioneers <br>
of TX Letterboxing.  He lives in Colorado now and I hope to entice <br>
him back for one of our Events some day.  Though I was disappointed <br>
in not finding the other boxes, the one I really wish I had gotten <br>
was Duck Creek, the first letterbox in Texas.  Currently, the oldest <br>
Texas letterbox still alive is Lost Pines.  BTW, Eoghan's boxes are <br>
no longer listed on LBNA, but I have a link to his clue page in the <br>
Links section of this list. <br>
<br>
I was going to attempt the West Texas boxes, but before I made it out <br>
there a new "recruit" from El Paso named Mike joined our ranks and <br>
volunteered to look for them.   His exploits made for fun reading, <br>
even though only 1 battered box was found and had to be removed from <br>
Hueco Tanks.  He later replaced that box with one of his own and I <br>
highly recommend it and a visit to that special park.<br>
<br>
Thanks to all of you that have helped grow this hobby into the fun <br>
endeavor it has become.  And thanks, Sandibox, for the trip down <br>
memory lane!<br>
