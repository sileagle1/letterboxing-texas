As I've mentioned before, until recently I have been<br/>
directionally challenged, but I've really started<br/>
enjoying map and compass stuff through scouting and<br/>
letterboxing.  In fact, I was on a backwoods hike with<br/>
a bunch of scoutmaster type folks a few months ago and<br/>
even had the confidence to argue with them about<br/>
orienteering, and I turned out to be right!  I did<br/>
learn recently (thanks Corazon and Navigator) that<br/>
it's really important to make sure your compass floats<br/>
properly though...<br/>
<br/>
As I have been scouring online maps for this project,<br/>
I find myself fascinated by maps - street maps, road<br/>
maps, topo maps, lat/long - maps.  I think it may be a<br/>
new obsession if I'm not careful.  In fact, my Flying<br/>
Again box is based on a map of a future lake.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the map site!<br/>

&gt; This sounds great!!  I am getting soooo excited!! <br/>
&gt; Listen, I don't know if this will help anyone, but<br/>
&gt; while working on my bridges series I have found<br/>
&gt; county maps online.  <br/>
&gt; http://txdot.lib.utexas.edu/<br/>
&gt; This has been very helpful to me especially since I<br/>
&gt; am one who likes to go OFF the beaten path!!<br/>
