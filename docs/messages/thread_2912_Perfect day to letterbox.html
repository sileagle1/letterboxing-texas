</p><div>Today was the perfect day to letterbox, except for one thing... the recent weather stopped us from getting to the box. I'm sure the box is fine and high and dry, but the park rangers wouldn't allow us in because of all the recent rain. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I woke up this morning and decided I needed some fresh air, so I asked my husband if he'd like to go on an adventure with me. He replied, no, we needed to run some errands. I told him, have a good time and I'll see you tonight. Then by the time I had gathered some stuff together for my day out, I found him with maps unfolded and his little book, Texas Landmark Cafes (by Naylor) opened. He had already circled two places and asked me which one I wanted to go explore. So realizing that my day was going to be shared, I selected the one in Tioga (north of Pilot Point) because I've always wanted to find Barefoot Lucy's "SJZ's First Birthday on Her Own" box at nearby Lake Ray Roberts. As we neared Pilot Point, my husband asked, "why don't we go find a letterbox because I'm really not hungry yet. Do you happen to have your stuff with you?" (Surely he had already noticed the clue sheet in my hands!) So after a quick exploration of Pilot Point (named for a high point of timber that used to be a landmark for travellers in the mid 1800's), we headed over to the Isle du Bois state park at the lake. We pulled up to the guardhouse and my husband stated our intention to go "look around". The ranger, a formidable woman in her 70's who looked like she could take both my husband and me with one hand tied behind her, told us the unit was closed due to the high water and it would probably be another month or two before they could get down to the water and clean it out. So my husband probed a little more and asked if we could just drive around and look if we didn't go near the water, but she patiently explained to him (as if she were talking to a small child.... and I thought I was the only one who talked to him like that) that we were NOT welcomed to drive around unless we were camping. So I asked for/received the park map and we made our exit. I was feeling frustrated because I couldn't prompt my husband (right in front of her) as to what he should say to her to possibly change her mind. Actually, I'm not sure that was possible, but I had some ideas... including signing up for a campsite. Anyway, after studying the map, I am pretty sure the kid's fishing area and some of the hiking trails are not in the flooded area. I will call them in a couple of days and ask if the hiking trails are open. As long as I can get past that guardhouse.... I think I can get to that box! After being thoroughly intimidated by the ranger,  we went back out to the highway and drove over the dam. The sky was blue and the lake was sparkling. I even spotted an area where I could launch my canoe (and paddle back around to the campground) if it comes to that. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So after my husband escorted me away from the lake, we went up to Tioga and ate at Clark's Outfitters, a tiny BBQ joint that has actually been written up in Gourmet Magazine, Texas Highways and Bon Appetite! We weren't disappointed. The coconut meringue pie was about 8" high. They have a room in the back that can accommodate groups, so the wheels started turning in my head for another autumn mini-meet at Lake Ray Roberts with dinner at Clarks! I was also inspired to make a new letterbox and have even found the perfect spot for it. If I told you that Gene Autry was born in Tioga, I'm sure you can figure out what the subject of my new box will be. (For those of you over 50, he was a known as the Singing Cowboy and graced the big screen with lots of cowboy movies... for those of you under 50, he owned the Los Angeles Angels Baseball team). So I am about to pull out my carving stuff and get busy. I will be returning to the Tioga area in a few days with my new box ready to go... back in the saddle again! By then I may have figured out a way to get past the ranger at the lake too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So NO letterboxes found or planted today, but I loved the experience all the same. It's true.... letterboxing is far more than a stamp! (Although I won't rest until I get that stamp, Barefoot Lucy!)</div>
