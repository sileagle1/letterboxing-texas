                    <html><body><div>Y'all know I sometimes forget to breathe when I get going on something I really love to do...Well I'm coming down off a 28 hour stint of oxygen deprivation!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to go hang out for a few hours with Girl Scouts at 3 yesterday afternoon and got done there just in time to whisk myself over to a Boy Scout Campout where my Webelos were doing a joint campout with the troop.  We finished that up this evening about 5 just in time for me to get home take a perilously fast shower and dress in uniform for a Christmas Caroling with my Cub Scout Pack at 6.  28 hours of scouting non-stop.  Who could ask for more?  What?  If only I could have thrown in a little letterboxing too?  I DID!  Oops...make that 30 hours of oxygen deprivation! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I took off work at noon yesterday to get ready for the campout and to go talk to the Girl Scouts about letterboxing.  To get myself in the mood (as if that were a problem), I decided to jot off and catch a box or two before the GS thingy.  I made it back to town just in time to head on over to where they were meeting, and the second person I got to meet was - purpleintexKIM!!!  Isn't it funny how we get to know folks more or less on the internet, and how it's like meeting an old friend when you finally meet in person?  What a fun person Kim is!  I was more than a little embarassed that these girls all knew me and my boxes.  I felt like I should've been wearing sunglasses and a baseball cap!  They were a great group of girls though, and they had done their homework and were already very knowledgeable about letterboxing.  I told them a few stories and we got to work carving and some very nice stamps came out of it.  Kim's daughter really struggled but persevered and did a very nice ladybug!  I think I was most especially proud of her because she was ready to give up at one point.  After we did all the carving we could stand and left a big ol' mess for the hostess, I exchanged with several of the girls and they gave me a really nice gift of Mary Kay hand lotion and other skin stuff - very appropriate for a letterboxer whose skin gets kind of yukky in the elements!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had to make a flying trip over to the campout to wait for a new camper who was on the edge of backing out.  I figured if I could get ahold of him, he would stay, and he did!  He was a really good camper, even after having to go to bed in a tent by himself since he was bunking with Lightning who came in very late after going to a Mavs game in Dallas.  We earned our polar bear badges - a badge for camping in sub-freezing temps - last night!  Thankfully, we did a work project today that involved fire - lots of fire!  Did y'all know boys like to play in fire?  They are really nothing but a bunch of pyros!  Fortunately, we didn't have to call the fire department.  We wrapped it up by having a feast prepared by the boys - each patrol had to make an entree and a dessert.  I haven't eaten that well since - hmmm - the last annual gathering???
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally finished up there and ran home to change vehicles, and I decided I HAD to have a shower before I could possibly go caroling - after lots of ink, coals from the fire, and dirt in general, my hands looked awful.  I felt worlds better then and looked alot better too, except that at the last minute I realized the organizer of the caroling had asked me to bring my guitar and I had managed to gouge my thumb and index finger at the GS thingy yesterday while showing them how to carve - or rather, how NOT to carve.  Two bandaids fixed it and I had built in picks.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Gosh it feels good to finally be home, warm, clean, and to breathe yet again.  Don't know what I'm gonna do tomorrow, but I've already had MY great weekend!</div>
<div><br clear="all"/>Did I mention that the box I went and found was JB Kokopelli's Tribute to the Crocodile Hunter?  It was a very nice stamp image - I showed it to the girls as soon as I got to the GS thingy and they were all envious and thinking they would have to go find it, all except Kim who already had it.  It looks just like Steve Irwin too!
