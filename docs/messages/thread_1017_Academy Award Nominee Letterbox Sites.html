                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone, my name is Gib. I have been letterboxing for a year since my wife <br/>
found an article about it. My family has lost interest, but I remain very engaged <br/>
because it is great fun and has given me great purpose - in discovering "what" is out <br/>
there. I have thoughtfully placed five boxes in the last year in the Houston area. <br/>
<br/>
I must say that I have come to really appreciate the clever design of some of the <br/>
"hides" that I have looked for. I work in a stress-laden profession and the opportunity <br/>
to be creative and lose myself in thinking about letterboxing has been a godsend. <br/>
Perhaps my lack of time to spend looking has made me more careful about which <br/>
sites I actually have time to invest in finding. Also it has made me think about the <br/>
value of what I am saying through my letterbox. Nothing gives me greater pleasure <br/>
than to hear from someone who's memory or passion was touched by a site in which I <br/>
have placed. Simply said, I have placed a high value on relevancy on creating a few <br/>
special boxes that give pause rather than "stamp gratification". For example, I am <br/>
fascinated by any box that 'Team King" has placed in the Houston area becuse it adds <br/>
to my knowledge of the British influence in Texas. In addition, Team King has shown <br/>
serious growth in their carving skills, which makes me want to improve my own <br/>
limited skills (For the record I am not a member of Team King). <br/>
<br/>
My frustration today was that the placer of the box that I was after put it in such a <br/>
place so incredibly public that after thirty minutes of waiting  I could not go after it <br/>
without revealing to several others what was there. Honestly, this has been an <br/>
increasingly frustrating problem for me. I don't understand how a letterboxer could <br/>
not consider the experience of the 'finder" when they place "questionable" boxes that <br/>
cheapen the overall experience. I spend weeks thinking about and setting up a box to <br/>
allow time to read the log book. Honestly, that is what I want, time and a clever, <br/>
thoughtful spot to enjoy all of the stamps that people from around the world have <br/>
stamped. Opening a Log book is very personal and should be secret, because it <br/>
validates all the hard work of placement. Please think about the rest of us when you <br/>
place.<br/>
<br/>
I appologize if I have come on too strong in my first post. I am very laid back, but I <br/>
realize that many of us (including me) feel strongly about letterboxing and fully <br/>
intend to ne doing it 20yrs from now.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning, Tall Texan!<br/>
<br/>
It's great to read your introduction - welcome to the group! I've noticed<br/>
your clues popping up from time to time and I'm delighted that you're going<br/>
to join the conversation!<br/>
<br/>
TeamKing's boxes are among my favourites, too - I grew up and went to school<br/>
in England so I'm particularly fond of all their clever Tribute boxes. Last<br/>
time we were down in Houston, we found primarily boxes from TeamKing, Hawk,<br/>
Silver Eagle and BabyBear - it's funny and interesting to me that each<br/>
placer has a very distinct style in not only carving the stamp or making a<br/>
logbook, but also in choosing the placement. After a while, my husband could<br/>
guess whose box we were hunting based on the style of clues, too!<br/>
<br/>
I can hear the frustration in your note about the "public" placement of the<br/>
letterbox you were searching for yesterday - and you have every right to<br/>
cross those particular kinds of boxes off your list of future searches! <br/>
<br/>
But please be very careful in using terms such as "cheapen" and<br/>
"questionable" when you're discussing someone else's choices. Those of us<br/>
who use this forum for Texas letterboxing chatter, have worked very hard to<br/>
keep this group a pleasant, stress-free place to chat, and terms like those<br/>
could be wounding to someone.<br/>
<br/>
If you ever search for one of our boxes (CelticLions) you'll find that about<br/>
half of them are hidden in parks and remote areas - and the other half are<br/>
very urban. The urban boxes require some "subterfuge" - recently on this<br/>
list we discussed that very thing! Many of us enjoy the extra skill needed<br/>
to successfully extract an urban box - but many of us hate it!!! To each his<br/>
own!<br/>
<br/>
Here's something else to consider: sometimes things change and the spot that<br/>
the placer chose might become more exposed or public. We recently placed a<br/>
microbox in a kind of courtyard spot, which allowed for sitting on a stone<br/>
wall and stamping in relatively privately. Imagine our chagrin when it<br/>
turned out that a huge robotic dinosaur exhibit has been placed in that<br/>
courtyard!<br/>
<br/>
At the present time, I have health issues which prevent me from looking for<br/>
boxes on the long hikes - but I wouldn't dream of suggesting that everyone<br/>
cater to my particular preferences - I just read through the clues very<br/>
carefully to try to rule out those boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Well, this turned out to be a bit long-winded, didn't it? Time to get a cup<br/>
of coffee and cheer on Lance!!!<br/>
<br/>
I'm delighted that you wrote &amp; I can't wait to get down to Houston again and<br/>
search out some Tall Texan boxes!!!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'll play "devil's advocate" here and hope that it doesn't come across<br/>
as snarky...<br/>
<br/>
I consider the issue of discretion and public locations part of the<br/>
level of "difficulty."  And, sometimes that's for my benefit as well.<br/>
<br/>
For example, my first TX "find" was a box in Old Town Spring, a<br/>
wonderful little town north of Houston.  One letterbox in that area is<br/>
hidden in a very public location.  The challenges of discretion make<br/>
it a fairly difficult box to visit.  It's probably necessary to wait<br/>
until after the nearby shop closes, to access the letterbox without<br/>
discovery.<br/>
<br/>
Well, my husband and I arrived in Old Town Spring earlier in the day. <br/>
And, waiting to find the box at a more discreet time, we visited<br/>
several shops and had a wonderful (and inexpensive) meal at Wunsche<br/>
Bros Cafe... something that we might not have done if the box had been<br/>
an absolute drive-by.<br/>
<br/>
I view this the same as some hikes I've gone on, completely unaware<br/>
that a (parkland) box would involve a lot more walking and/or climbing<br/>
than I'd anticipated:  It forces me to take more time, smell the<br/>
roses, and enjoy myself.<br/>
<br/>
I'm an overworked, self-employed self-starter... and that doesn't<br/>
always serve me well. Here it is Sunday morning, and I'm about to<br/>
spend half the day re-HTML-ing some webpages.  Sure, they're personal<br/>
webpages; I try really hard not to do "work-work" on the weekends,<br/>
especially on Sundays.  But, it's still stressful and I'm wondering if<br/>
I should be letterboxing this morning, instead.<br/>
<br/>
Because of this, more difficult letterboxes are often good for me... <br/>
Whether I'm forced to actually browse shops and enjoy an inexpensive<br/>
meal with my sweetie, or hike a trail that turns out to be absolutely<br/>
gorgeous... this is one reason why I love letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, I'm aware that different people enjoy letterboxing for different<br/>
reasons.  Not everyone puts the focus on the "seek" part of the<br/>
experience, as opposed to the "find" conclusion.  So, I don't want to<br/>
make it sound as if my choice is better than others', or anything like<br/>
that.<br/>
<br/>
But, while I feel that the challenges should be clearly indicated in<br/>
the clues, I'm also in favor of boxes that are so publicly placed,<br/>
they're what I call the "Mission: Impossible" letterboxes.  Sometimes,<br/>
they force me to relax and enjoy myself.<br/>
<br/>
If I couldn't have lingered around Old Town Spring, I might have been<br/>
tremendously frustrated by the box that I'm talking about, there. <br/>
But, I knew from the clues that it was going to be a challenge to<br/>
access the box discreetly, and--in retrospect--I'm really glad that my<br/>
husband and I had that excuse to relax and enjoy ourselves.<br/>
<br/>
Again, I don't want this to sound like I'm disagreeing.  I think that<br/>
there are letterboxes for everyone, and every one of us will rate each<br/>
box using different criteria.  That doesn't make any box less valid or<br/>
valuable to letterboxing as a whole.<br/>
<br/>
But, I have enjoyed the unexpected "seek" phases that I've<br/>
encountered, whether it was an undiscovered park along the water's<br/>
edge in NH, or a "hidden in (almost) plain sight" box in Old Town<br/>
Spring.<br/>
<br/>
As long as I have a hint of the nature of the challenge when I'm<br/>
looking for a letterbox, I'm happy, and the "seeking" often turns into<br/>
serendipity for me.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>

<div>Hello!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a funny story about a letterbox in Old Town Spring...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Realizing that it would be near a storefront and possibly lots of people, I 
decided to hunt for it early in the morning, before the shops open.  
Arriving at 8:00, surely I would be able to nab it without any question.  
Imagine my surprise when I pulled up and found window washers washing the 
windows on the shop!  This was my first outing alone and I had no idea what 
to do.  I sat in the car for a bit reading over the clues to try and 
memorize them.  The window washers disappeared on the side of the building, 
I grabbed my camera ( to make it look like I was taking a picture of the 
train on the tracks across the street!) and quickly ran in search of the 
letterbox.  Fortunately, it was in the first place I looked.  I 
grabbed it and took it back to the car in order to stamp in ( which I need to 
work on because I ended up dropping the stamp pad on my shorts!)  Here come 
the window washers, back to the front.  I found a map in my car and started 
looking over it to disguise my real reason for being there!  Finally I left 
my mark in the logbook and when the workers went around the side of the building 
again, I discreetly placed the box back in its location.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Who knew that what could have been a quick drive by, ended up taking 20 
minutes or so?</div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Speaking as someone who loved finding your thoughtfully-placed <br/>
Magnolia Crossing and Lost Rope Swing boxes, I think we also put <br/>
some thought into where we place boxes.  However, we choose spots <br/>
for different reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
1.  We letterbox as a family.  Sometimes it's a spot with a great <br/>
playground or something that the kids will enjoy that we think a <br/>
letterbox might increase the overall family experience.  We also <br/>
like funky, unusual places like the place where we put our Pop the <br/>
Top.  <br/>
<br/>
2.  I love teasing out little bits of wilderness in the heart of <br/>
Houston.  I wish that we could spend every weekend out in the true <br/>
woods, but schedules and life just doesn't permit.  So, instead, I <br/>
like finding patches of woods inside or near the city where you can <br/>
hopefully find some solitude, even if the hike isn't that long.  <br/>
<br/>
3.  I like mystery boxes.  We have done quite a few of these.  In <br/>
general, they don't get nearly the same number of visitors.  But, I <br/>
don't care.  We do it for us and if there are finders, so much the <br/>
better.  Generally, these have short hikes, if at all, but the work <br/>
is done up front deciphering the clues.  Who is ready to capture the <br/>
queen?<br/>
<br/>
4.  Recently we placed the Daily Grind box.  This particular hiding <br/>
spot has nothing to really recommend it, but it is there to <br/>
facilitate boxing breaks and exchanges.  As stated before, my <br/>
husband would like it very much if people would also hide boxes at <br/>
good pubs.  <br/>
<br/>
I think your points are actually a good starting point for a <br/>
discussion about what makes for a good letterboxing experience.  The <br/>
truth is, we are such a diverse group of people with different <br/>
interests, that it'll be different strokes for different folks.<br/>
<br/>
My absolute favorite boxes/experiences are those where we go on a <br/>
nice long family hike and the kids don't whine and we enjoy nature <br/>
and the day.  But, I also really appreciate those boxes that take me <br/>
somewhere I've never been.  Not a native Texan, but have lived in <br/>
Houston 20 years this August, and I am constantly finding out new <br/>
things about the city and the state.  For instance, I want to read <br/>
Diezmo, the new book by Rick Bass because even though I never took <br/>
7th grade Tx history, I know about the Black Beans incident from <br/>
Baby Bear's box at Monument Hill State Park.<br/>
<br/>
Whoa, did I create a long post.  Didn't mean to.  Interesting topic, <br/>
though.<br/>

Kristin, how very funny!  I do the same thing... take my camera and<br/>
use it as an excuse to snoop around for public letterboxes.  It's my<br/>
"cover story" to explain what I'm doing if someone asks awkward<br/>
questions.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, I actually use my photos in my art, so I can talk about my<br/>
pictures with a fairly straight face... but my camera is almost always<br/>
with me when I'm letterboxing, in case I need some on-the-fly<br/>
subterfuge for finding a clever, public letterbox.<br/>
<br/>
So, I do have a photo of the hiding spot of that Old Town Spring box;<br/>
even after-hours, it took us a few minutes to be able to remove it<br/>
discreetly.  Fortunately, we found it on the first try, too.<br/>

<div>Hi there, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since I live in New York City (though originally from Texas) and almost all of my boxes are urban boxes, I feel I have to respond to this. You don't say if the boxes you are talking about are urban boxes specfically, but if they are located in such very public places, I would assume so? Urban boxing is a totally different experience than boxing in sometimes very remote and often wild areas, and I for one do not feel that my boxes "cheapen the overall experience", in fact, I find it pretty insulting, as I'm sure the other people I know who do urban boxing would. I'm sure you didn't mean to insult anyone, but I felt insulted just the same. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I recently found the box of a fellow urban boxer that was located smack dab in front of one of the *most* famous landmarks in New York City, hidden behind a sign, with crowds of people going by on the sidewalk CONSTANTLY.  I had to stand there for quite some time, figuring out her directions (which were not that hard, but I was being a little dense that day) and then spent quite a while pretending to talk on my cell phone until I felt I could safely get the box. What a rush! It was great!!  I took the log around the corner to a phone booth and took my time looking at the previous stamps and then stamped in. This is obviously a very different experience than being alone in a beautiful, quiet, wooded area and finding a wonderful box hidden under some rocks or in a tree. I recently went boxing in Utah and found some awesome little boxes in the middle of nowhere. That was great also! I loved being out there. Living here, I sometimes ache to be in the wide open spaces. But urban boxing is very different and my boxes and the boxes of  other urban boxer are certainly not "questionable", just a different area of boxing. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I said, I live in NYC, *and* I do not own a car (shocking to those Texans who drive to the mailbox, but true nonetheless). I get out of the city when I can to go boxing, but it can get complicated and expensive. Aside from that, I LOVE urban boxing. I love the fact that that my small, secret little treasures are in their hiding places amongs all these millions of people and no one knows. I love hearing from people who come here to visit and are able to do some boxing while there here. They seem to get a big kick out of finding my boxes and those of the few other urban boxers here, and I get a kick out of hearing from them. I try to make the stamp and logbook as special as I can, given the fact that most of them have to be very small. I love doing that and get a great feeling of accomplishment and pleasure out of it . I know one urban boxer who carves her stamp, puts an ahesive on the back and then almost totally splits the stamp, so she can have a larger stamp fit into a small container. She has used creativity to give the finder a more interesting find than they might have expected. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You seem to feel pretty strongly about this, but you should be more tolerable of *all* the different areas of boxing and not confine your praise for boxes found inside a tree in the middle of nowhere, where one doesn't have to do anything but figure out where it is, not practice what some of us call "urban stealth", that can take quite a lot of patience, skill, and practice *both* in placing and finding. I spend a lot of time researching and exploring different possible locations for urban boxes. Very often I have spent hours scounting out an area, only to find that it's just not going to work. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So when you say "........please think about the rest of us..........", you need to be practicing what you preach and remembering that there is room for all kinds of boxing, just like there is room for hand carved or store bought stamps, easy clues or hard clues, the list goes on and on. This is a hobby that enables each individual to get whatever kind of joy or achievement they need and or want out of it. If you see clues for a box that appears to be in an area that would take too much "urban stealth" and stress for you to enjoy the experience, then go look for another box and leave that box to those of us to do enjoy it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I have over reacted, I apologize, but I really took your remarks personally. My boxes are great little boxes that I love doing, seem to be </div>
<div>enjoyed by a lot of people, if their response is any indication, are by no means "questionable", and do *not* in any way "cheapen the overall experience". </div>

<div>Hi there, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since I live in New York City (though originally from Texas) and almost 
  all of my boxes are urban boxes, I feel I have to respond to this. You don't 
  say if the boxes you are talking about are urban boxes specfically, but if 
  they are located in such very public places, I would assume so? Urban boxing 
  is a totally different experience than boxing in sometimes very remote and 
  often wild areas, and I for one do not feel that my boxes "cheapen the overall 
  experience", in fact, I find it pretty insulting, as I'm sure the other people 
  I know who do urban boxing would. I'm sure you didn't mean to insult anyone, 
  but I felt insulted just the same. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I recently found the box of a fellow urban boxer that was located smack 
  dab in front of one of the *most* famous landmarks in New York City, 
  hidden behind a sign, with crowds of people going by on the sidewalk 
  CONSTANTLY.  I had to stand there for quite some time, figuring out her 
  directions (which were not that hard, but I was being a little dense that day) 
  and then spent quite a while pretending to talk on my cell phone until I felt 
  I could safely get the box. What a rush! It was great!!  I took the log 
  around the corner to a phone booth and took my time looking at the previous 
  stamps and then stamped in. This is obviously a very different experience than 
  being alone in a beautiful, quiet, wooded area and finding a wonderful box 
  hidden under some rocks or in a tree. I recently went boxing in Utah and found 
  some awesome little boxes in the middle of nowhere. That was great also! I 
  loved being out there. Living here, I sometimes ache to be in the wide open 
  spaces. But urban boxing is very 
  <div> </div>
<div>As I said, I live in NYC, *and* I do not own a car (shocking to those 
  Texans who drive to the mailbox, but true nonetheless). I get out of the city 
  when I can to go boxing, but it can get complicated and expensive. Aside from 
  that, I LOVE urban boxing. I love the fact that that my small, secret little 
  treasures are in their hiding places amongs all these millions 
  of people and no one knows. I love hearing from people who come here to visit 
  and are able to do some boxing while there here. They seem to get a big kick 
  out of finding my boxes and those of the few other urban boxers here, and I 
  get a kick out of hearing from them. I try to make the stamp and logbook as 
  special as I can, given the fact that most of them have to be very small.. I 
  love doing that and get a great feeling of accomplishment and pleasure out of 
  it . I know one urban boxer who carves her stamp, puts an ahesive on the back 
  and then almost totally splits the stamp, so she can have a larger stamp fit 
  into a small container
  <div> </div>
<div>You seem to feel pretty strongly about this, but you should be more 
  tolerable of *all* the different areas of boxing and not confine your praise 
  for boxes found inside a tree in the middle of nowhere, where one doesn't have

<div>I would love to have you come visit. And if you come all the way from Texas we should do an exchange. I too have a little bit of a problem with people who seem to need their hands held, or seem to want to be led by the hand directly to the box without having to actually use their brains. There's no way a placer can always anticipate everything. Thus the waver of responsibility! We're all grown ups here! heh Well, except for some of the people on the big list. I couldn't resist. It was just too easy. heh </div>

in a stress-laden profession and the opportunity </tt><br/>
<tt>to be creative and lose myself in thinking about
letterboxing has been a godsend. </tt><br/>
<tt>Perhaps my lack of time to spend looking has made
me more careful about which </tt><br/>
<tt>sites I actually have time to invest in finding.
Also it has made me think about the </tt><br/>
<tt>value of what I am saying through my letterbox.
Nothing gives me greater pleasure </tt><br/>
<tt>than to hear from someone who's memory or passion
was touched by a site in which I </tt><br/>
<tt>have placed. Simply said, I have placed a high
value on relevancy on creating a few </tt><br/>
<tt>special boxes that give pause rather than
"stamp gratification". For example, I am </tt><br/>
<tt>fascinated by any box that 'Team King" has
placed in the Houston area becuse it adds </tt><br/>
<tt>to my knowledge of the British influence in Texas.
In addition, Team King has shown </tt><br/>
<tt>serious growth in their carving skills, which
makes me want to improve my own </tt><br/>
<tt>limited skills (For the record I am not a member
of Team King). </tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>My frustration today was that the placer of the
box that I was after put it in such a </tt><br/>
<tt>place so incredibly public that after thirty
minutes of waiting  I could not go after it </tt><br/>
<tt>without revealing to several others what was
there. Honestly, this has been an </tt><br/>
<tt>increasingly frustrating problem for me. I don't
understand how a letterboxer could </tt><br/>
<tt>not consider the experience of the 'finder"
when they place "questionable" boxes that </tt><br/>
<tt>cheapen the overall experience. I spend weeks
thinking about and setting up a box to </tt><br/>
<tt>allow time to read the log book. Honestly, that is
what I want, time and a clever, </tt><br/>
<tt>thoughtful spot to enjoy all of the stamps that
people from around the world have </tt><br/>
<tt>stamped. Opening a Log book is very personal and
should be secret, because it </tt><br/>
<tt>validates all the hard work of placement. Please
think about the rest of us when you </tt><br/>
<tt>place.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I appologize if I have come on too strong in my
first post. I am very laid back, but I </tt><br/>
<tt>realize that many of us (including me) feel
strongly about letterboxing and fully </tt><br/>

<div>Hi, Gib!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First, I would like to say that I have found a couple of your boxes and appreciate the Texas History theme! I love Texas and U.S. History, so I find your boxes especially interesting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I find the very public letterboxes to be a challenge! I have "tripped and fallen" and "dropped things", taken thousands or pretend photos, and avidly watched hundreds of nonexistent birds to get to them. Once I've snagged the box, I usually go off to a more private spot (sometimes the car) to stamp in. Then, returning the box presents another challenge! Someone a week or so ago, and I can't remember who, so sorry, had the incredibly clever idea of wearing an orange vest, hard hat, and carrying a clipboard for urban locations. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sometimes, even a relatively secluded location can backfire. I was just in Oak Ridge, TN, where there is a series of 3 boxes. One of them was placed near a pagoda in a far corner of the park. I had no sooner snagged the box when the mower showed up. On Sunday morning, for pete's sake!! The park has large, open grassy areas, and I had to wait over 30 minutes for the mower to move far enough away to safely return the box. It was a nice day, so I sat down and read a book while I waited. Thirteen hours later, I was in Forrest City, AR searching for a box placed by WandaAndPete, but that's another story......</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Happy Boxing,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>JOY aka The Road Trip Queen</div>

<div>Hello everyone, my name is Gib. I have been letterboxing for a year since my wife</div>
<div>found an article about it. My family has lost interest, but I remain very engaged</div>
<div>because it is great fun and has given me great purpose - in discovering "what" is out</div>
<div>there. I have thoughtfully placed five boxes in the last year in the Houston area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I must say that I have come to really appreciate the clever design of some of the</div>
<div>"hides" that I have looked for. I work in a stress-laden profession and the opportunity</div>
<div>to be creative and lose myself in thinking about letterboxing has been a godsend.</div>

<p><tt><span><o:p> </o:p></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><tt><span>My</span></tt></span><tt><span> comment:<span>  </span>Ive read the various responses and appreciate everyones diverse viewpoints. <span> </span>Much of <span class="GramE">my</span> boxing is done on the fly, between home and MS where Navigators mom lives. (She always asks if we have found any of those little plastic boxes lately.) At this time, <span class="GramE">my</span> logbook reading consists of a quick scan of previous entries, noting who has been there or not more than reading the personal notes.<span>  </span>And for the same reason, <span class="GramE">I</span> rarely leave more than name, date and home town. <o:p></o:p></span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span><o:p> </o:p></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><tt><span>My</span></tt></span><tt><span> question:<span>  </span>For a couple of months or more I have been toying with the idea of a box in a remote location that is only accessible to the public once a month. <span> </span>When this area is accessible, it is with a guide. Because of <span class="GramE">this</span> I think it would be next to impossible for a lone adult to get the box, log in and replace the box. <o:p></o:p></span></tt></p>
<p><tt><span><o:p> </o:p></span></tt></p>
<p><span class="GramE"><tt><span>Stealth, teamwork and timing any takers?</span></tt></span><tt><span><span>  </span>The box is made.<span>  </span><span class="GramE">I</span> can put it there or in a more traditional location.<span>  </span>Your ideas please<o:p></o:p></span></tt></p>

<p><tt><span>Hello everyone, my name is Gib. I have been letterboxing for a year since my wife </span></tt><span><br/><tt>found an article about it. My family has lost interest, but I remain very engaged </tt><br/><tt>because it is great fun and has given me great purpose - in discovering "what" is out </tt><br/><tt>there. I have thoughtfully placed five boxes in the last year in the Houston area. </tt><br/><br/><tt>I must say that I have come to really appreciate the clever design of some of the </tt><br/><tt>"hides" that I have looked for. I work in a stress-laden profession and the opportunity </tt><br/><tt>to be creative and lose myself in thinking about letterboxing has been a godsend. </tt><br/><tt>Perhaps my lack of time to spend looking has made me more careful about which </tt><br/><tt>sites I actually have time to invest in finding. Also it has made me think about the </tt><br/><tt>value of what I am saying through my letterbox. Nothing gives me greater pleasure </tt><br/><tt>than to hear from someone who's memory or passion was touched by a site in which I </tt><br/><tt>have placed. Simply said, I have placed a high value on relevancy on creating a few </tt><br/><tt>special boxes that give pause rather than "stamp gratification". For example, I am </tt><br/><tt>fascinated by any box that 'Team King" has placed in the Houston area becuse it adds </tt><br/><tt>to my knowledge of the British influence in Texas. In addition, Team King has shown </tt><br/><tt>serious growth in their carving skills, which makes me want to improve my own </tt><br/><tt>limited skills (For the record I am not a member of Team King). </tt><br/><br/><tt>My frustration today was that the placer of the box that I was after put it in such a </tt><br/><tt>place so incredibly public that after thirty minutes of waiting  I could not go after it </tt><br/><tt>without revealing to several others what was there. Honestly, this has been an </tt><br/><tt>increasingly frustrating problem for me. I don't understand how a letterboxer could </tt><br/><tt>not consider the experience of the 'finder" when they place "questionable" boxes that </tt><br/><tt>cheapen the overall experience. I spend weeks thinking about and setting up a box to </tt><br/><tt>allow time to read the log book. Honestly, that is what I want, time and a clever, </tt><br/><tt>thoughtful spot to enjoy all of the stamps that people from around the world have </tt><br/><tt>stamped. Opening a Log book is very personal and should be secret, because it </tt><br/><tt>validates all the hard work of placement. Please think about the rest of us when you </tt><br/><tt>place.</tt><br/><br/><tt>I appologize if I have come on too strong in my first post. I am very laid back, but I </tt><br/><tt>realize that many of us (including me) feel strongly about letterboxing and fully </tt><br/><tt>intend to ne doing it 20yrs from now.</tt><br/><br/><tt>Tall Texan</tt><br/><br/><tt>  </tt><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span><o:p></o:p></p>---- LSpots keywords ?&gt;---- HM ADS ?&gt;---- LSpots keywords ?&gt;---- HM ADS ?&gt;
