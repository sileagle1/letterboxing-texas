This is a situation that I have seen coming and dreaded.  It might be <br>
a State-wide mandate, but not all parks have been enforcing it <br>
equally, but that might be changing.  I'm afraid placing boxes in <br>
State Parks without permits is just not going to work in the long <br>
run.  <br>
<br>
Now normally, I'm all for following the rules and getting permission <br>
when appropriate, but this is one time it just doesn't seem worth it <br>
to me.  When I was requested to complete a permit for one of my boxes <br>
that was confiscated, I tried to comply, but the requirements are <br>
just too stringent.  They require you to pick a spot that is <br>
acceptable to them, and re-register again every year.  As ya'll know, <br>
many of my boxes are in State Parks scattered all over TX (and <br>
beyond), and it just isn't feasible for me to re-register or visit <br>
all of them every year.  If I only had boxes in a State Park near me, <br>
I probably would do like Mike and cultivate a relationship, but then <br>
I would only have boxes in that one park.  However, I also feel <br>
uncomfortable claiming responsibility for anything found in the box, <br>
whether I put it there or not, so not sure I would sign a permit even <br>
then.  I guess as my boxes get discovered they will be confiscated, <br>
and I will avoid State Parks for future plants, since I don't want to <br>
break the rules or follow them either. <br>
<br>
As far as future Gathering venues, we may have to accept the fact <br>
that no boxes will be in the park, but be satisfied with many boxes <br>
placed nearby, and Austin meets that criteria.  It might not be so <br>
bad since the main purpose of Events is to meet other letterboxers, <br>
and finding boxes is just an added bonus.  The only alternative would <br>
be to find a non-State Park with camping, a shelter big enough for <br>
us, and plenty of trails for boxes.  If anyone knows of such a place <br>
in Central TX, I can look into it.<br>
<br>
Which alternative do ya'll prefer?<br>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They've been trying to close Rusk State Park for two years now, and since that began and I became more mindful of the budget issues, I've made it a point to write anyone and everyone as high up the chain as seems relevant and who might care, to let them know how much I have enjoyed a particular park and why I found it to be pleasant.  Only once have I sent in a bad review, and I sent it to the lowest level guy NOT in that park so that maybe he could work on it.  I do also try to spend a little time talking to rangers and getting a feel for their philosophy, for future reference boxing-wise.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can't get real excited about planting in state parks anymore myself though. As I see it, the risk is the existence of a policy (which specifies geocaching, and presumably means to cover other treasure hunt games even though it doesn't have any "or other" phraseology) coupled with inconsistency in applying the policy.  The park I described above is only as friendly to us as its head ranger, and if the next guy comes in and wants permits, he may well pull every box in the park and treat them as suspect even though there was a "don't ask don't tell" sort of local approach previously.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I wonder if each park could have a designated letterbox manager or <br>
volunteer.  For instance, since I live pretty close to Huntsville <br>
State Park, I could "adopt" it for letterboxing.  I could check on <br>
each box periodically and, when a new box is placed, bring the clues <br>
to the attention of the ranger and get his approval.  I would be <br>
authorized to move the box to his satisfaction if necessary and <br>
notify the placer of the new location.  If the box is objectionable <br>
for some reason, I could pick it up and notify the placer.  I would <br>
return it to the placer if he/she so desired.  Of course, this would <br>
have to be worked out with the Parks and Wildlife folks.  Just a <br>
thought.  As for McKinney Falls SP, I still think it is a good <br>
location for an event.  McKinney Roughs, which is a Lower Colorado <br>
River Authority park, would be a good place to hide boxes and it's <br>
about 12 or 13 miles away, but there are no camping facilities or <br>
facilities for a gathering that I know of.<br>

<p>I wonder if each park could have a designated letterbox manager or 
  <br/>volunteer. For instance, since I live pretty close to Huntsville <br/>State 
  Park, I could "adopt" it for letterboxing. I could check on <br/>each box 
  periodically and, when a new box is placed, bring the clues <br/>to the 
  attention of the ranger and get his approval. I would be <br/>authorized to 
  move the box to his satisfaction if necessary and <br/>notify the placer of the 
  new location. If the box is objectionable <br/>for some reason, I could pick it 
  up and notify the placer. I would <br/>return it to the placer if he/she so 
  desired. Of course, this would <br/>have to be worked out with the Parks and 
  Wildlife folks. Just a <br/>thought. As for McKinney Falls SP, I still think it 
  is a good <br/>location for an event. McKinney Roughs, which is a Lower 
  Colorado <br/>River Authority park, would be a good place to hide boxes and 
  it's <br/>about 12 or 13 miles away, but there are no camping facilities or 
  <br/>facilities for a gathering that I know of.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In

  I'm afraid placing boxes in<br/>&gt; &gt; State Parks without permits is just 
  not going to work in the long<br/>&gt; &gt; run.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Now 
  normally, I'm all for following the rules and getting <br/>permission<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; when appropriate, but this is one time it just doesn't seem <br/>worth 
  it<br/>&gt; &gt; to me. When I was requested to complete a permit for one of my 
  <br/>boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; that was confiscated, I tried to comply, but the 
  requirements are<br/>&gt; &gt; just too stringent. They require you to pick a 
  spot that is<br/>&gt; &gt; acceptable to them, and re-register again every 
  year. As ya'll <br/>know,<br/>&gt; &gt; many of my boxes are in State Parks 
  scattered all over TX (and<br/>&gt; &gt; beyond), and it just isn't feasible 
  for me to re-register or <br/>visit<br/>&gt; &gt; all of them every year. If I 
  only had boxes in a State Park near <br/>me,<br/>&gt; &gt; I probably would do 
  like Mike and cultivate a relationship, but <br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt; I would only 
  have boxes in that one park. However, I also feel<br/>&gt; &gt; uncomfortable 
  claiming responsibility for anything found in the <br/>box,<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  whether I put it there or not, so not sure I would sign a permit 
  <br/>even<br/>&gt; &gt; then. I guess as my boxes get discovered they will be 
  <br/>confiscated,<br/>&gt; &gt; and I will avoid State Parks for future plants, 
  since I don't <br/>want to<br/>&gt; &gt; break the rules or follow them 
  either.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As far as future Gathering venues, we may 
  have to accept the fact<br/>&gt; &gt; that no boxes will be in the park, but be 
  satisfied with many <br/>boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; placed nearby, and Austin meets 
  that criteria. It might not be so<br/>&gt; &gt; bad since the main purpose of 
  Events is to meet other <br/>letterboxers,<br/>&gt; &gt; and finding boxes is 
  just an added bonus. The only alternative <br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; be to find a

<div>Actually, SE, I like that plan anyway.  It's an area I'd love to 
visit, and at gatherings, I'm always torn between finding boxes and meeting 
people.  And there are many boxes within a reasonable distance from there 
-- and likely to be many more if we plant our gathering there!  I hope the 
boxes in nearby Bastrop State Park are still in place, since I've not been there 
yet either!   But whatever the group, or you, decide on for this next 
gathering is OK with me.  If I can make it, I will; if there's a conflict 
that prevents my attending, then I'd hate to have influenced the decision too 
much either way anyway!</div>

In contrast to the Florida state park bureaucrats, the City of <br>

One of my boxes is in one of those parks on Lake Travis, the Hamilton <br>
Greenbelt.  Another one is pretty close, and the third is just a few <br>
miles up the road in Bee Cave.<br>

 content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Though I think we could find an alternative location (one of the <br/>parks on Lake Travis, or Canyon Lake), I believe McKinney Falls is <br/>going to be the best overall location. What some of you can do is <br/>hide boxes in the park, but do not post the clues until after the <br/>event (then post as mystery boxes), then bring pre-printed clues to <br/>the event (or better yet, email all your clues to me and I will <br/>combine into one big clue set for everyone to use at the event - <br/>multiple copies).<br/><br/>I just read another article about how Park visitation is dropping in <br/>the last few years, and also noticed more Texas state parks have been <br/>closed due to
 funding issues. Government involvment never leads to <br/>improvements!<br/><br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Silver Eagle" <br/>&lt;sileagle@..<wbr>.&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sorry to hear about this, especially since I was planning on <br/>finding <br/>&gt; them soon. I wonder if Baby Bear got the same message?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This is a situation that I have seen coming and dreaded. It might <br/>be <br/>&gt; a State-wide mandate, but not all parks have been enforcing it <br/>&gt; equally, but that might be changing. I'm afraid placing boxes in <br/>&gt; State Parks without permits is just not going to work in the long <br/>&gt; run. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now normally, I'm all for following the rules and getting <br/>permission <br/>&gt; when appropriate, but this is one time it just doesn't seem worth <br/>it <br/>&gt; to me. When I was requested to complete a permit for one of my <br/>boxes <br/>&gt;
 that was confiscated, I tried to comply, but the requirements are <br/>&gt; just too stringent. They require you to pick a spot that is <br/>&gt; acceptable to them, and re-register again every year. As ya'll <br/>know, <br/>&gt; many of my boxes are in State Parks scattered all over TX (and <br/>&gt; beyond), and it just isn't feasible for me to re-register or visit <br/>&gt; all of them every year. If I only had boxes in a State Park near <br/>me, <br/>&gt; I probably would do like Mike and cultivate a relationship, but <br/>then <br/>&gt; I would only have boxes in that one park. However, I also feel <br/>&gt; uncomfortable claiming responsibility for anything found in the <br/>box, <br/>&gt; whether I put it there or not, so not sure I would sign a permit <br/>even <br/>&gt; then. I guess as my boxes get discovered they will be confiscated, <br/>&gt; and I will avoid State Parks for future plants, since I don't want <br/>to <br/>&gt; break the rules or follow them either. <br/>&gt;
 <br/>&gt; As far as future Gathering venues, we may have to accept the fact <br/>&gt; that no boxes will be in the park, but be satisfied with many boxes <br/>&gt; placed nearby, and Austin meets that criteria. It might not be so <br/>&gt; bad since the main purpose of Events is to meet other letterboxers, <br/>&gt; and finding boxes is just an added bonus. The only alternative <br/>would <br/>&gt; be to find a non-State Park with camping, a shelter big enough for <br/>&gt; us, and plenty of trails for boxes. If anyone knows of such a <br/>place <br/>&gt; in Central TX, I can look into it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Which alternative do ya'll prefer?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Silver Eagle<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Boots Tex and Lone Star <br/>&gt; Quilter" &lt;janet@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I just got an email from the Park Superintendant/<wbr>Park Police <br/>&gt; Officer <br/>&gt; &gt; at
