                    <html><body><div>Well I just woke up from a nap taken after a cold shower after a long day manning a Cub Scout booth on hot asphalt at the Tomato Fest and I thought I should write it up BEFORE I hit the bottle of wine that's going to rock me back to sleep.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had the good fortune to share the booth with the girl scout troop that invited me for a carving tutorial a few months back.  Several of the girls from that tutorial were there and we had a good time hanging out together again.  The girls were there working on their Bronze awards by doing service hours for the local animal shelter.  We had PawTrekker and her mom and her mom's guide dog Vido, and the Martin Girls 1, 2, and Mom.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I took my box Some Tomato and set it at our booth.  The girls were the first to snag it, of course, and the rest of the day they asked "Is anyone else going to ask for it?", to which I said, "Maybe they will, maybe they won't, but won't we be surprised when they do?"
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They managed to hand out all their flyers for the shelter and I managed to give away a pretty tall pile of magazines and flyers myself, and we were all wearing out and ready to go home.  But we hung in there.  And at one moment I looked up from a few folks we had around, and who did I see but Blue Butterfly with Roarin' Lion and Stinky Monkey!  I couldn't imagine she would miss getting that box, especially since it is now retired until next year (if I'm fit to do that heat again by then!).  The girls heard me greet her, and started scrambling for their logbooks, but alas, she took the box over to the curb and they had to turn their attention back to our business of the day.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before Blue Butterfly had brought the box back, one of the Martin Girls told me someone else was asking for it.  I looked up and there was Lois of Adams Trails with her husband!  We had a gathering going on!  The girls were stoked and were moreso when Blue Butterfly came back over with the box and I asked her to exchange with them.  We cleared the table of Cub Scout and Animal Shelter stuff and the stamping commenced.  I had to wonder what our booth neighbors must have thought was going on, when suddenly our little booth which had had light traffic all day was suddenly swarmed and everything they had been seeing was suddenly gone.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Blue Butterfly and the boys left just as the rain began!  Blessed rain!  Adams Trails huddled under our awning with us while we decided whether the rain would continue, and then we realized the awning wasn't entirely waterproof either, so then we were hustling to get paper stuff put away - logbooks FIRST of course!  So there we were two Adams Trails, one Lucy, two Martin Girls and Martin Mom, Pawtrekker, Pawtrekker's mom, and Vido under a 10x10 awning with two tables and three chairs, and trying to protect everything.  For just a moment, I stepped back and watched our little scene and had to chuckle about it.  Finally, the rain let up and Adams Trails moved on (only after Mr. Adams emptied our awning of water, which I later learned I should be glad for because after I had cleared everyone else out, I realized the puddling water on the awning was really creating a nice little shower of its own!).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The shower happened shortly before the event was over and our little gathering ended as quickly as it had begun, so folks started packing like crazy and my Girl Scout friends left too.  I carried the important stuff to the car and grouped the rest of my stuff up in the middle of the awning and went to find Fearless Fox in his booth (his was a boring work-related booth),  a little water and a little shade.  I finally found a picnic table in deep shade, when who should I see coming toward me but - you know it - Gryzzled Gryphon!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We went to my car so he could stamp the box and on the way over there, I called Pawtrekker's mom to see if her dad would run her back up to exchange with GG.  I didn't know how to get in touch with the Martin Girls and figured they were probably well out of range by then anyway, but Pawtrekker was ecstatic to get to meet our esteemed enigma.  I had been telling them Gryzzled Gryphon stories earlier in the day and she especially had been eager to meet him, but she did a great job of being herself when she finally did meet him.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, stamping all done, GG and I found a little shade and he told me a funny story about his recent trip to West Texas.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for me, I was tired and feeling very much worse for the wear of the day on hot asphalt, but any day with a little letterboxing has GOT to be a good day, right?</div>

<div><font size="2">I never gave up hope of getting to come out today for the Tomato Festival, but finally admitted this morning that I just didn't have it in me today. I've been battling a nasty little cold all week, and although the worst of the cold symptoms are over, the annoying cough still keeps me up half the night. Anyway, I loved reading about your day and am so excited that some of our Texas boxers made it out there today. I saw the storm on the radar and was hoping it would pass quickly. It only lasted about half an hour in McKinney, but it was a nice, welcomed rain.</font></div>

&gt; Trails with her husband! We had a gathering going on! The girls <br/>were<br/>&gt; stoked and were moreso when Blue Butterfly came back over with the <br/>box and I<br/>&gt; asked her to exchange with them. We cleared the table of Cub 
<br/>Scout and<br/>&gt; Animal Shelter stuff and the stamping commenced. I had to wonder <br/>what our<br/>&gt; booth neighbors must have thought was going on, when suddenly our <br/>little<br/>&gt; booth which had had light traffic all day was suddenly swarmed and
<br/>&gt; everything they had been seeing was suddenly gone.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Blue Butterfly and the boys left just as the rain began! Blessed <br/>rain!<br/>&gt; Adams Trails huddled under our awning with us while we decided 
<br/>whether the<br/>&gt; rain would continue, and then we realized the awning wasn't <br/>entirely<br/>&gt; waterproof either, so then we were hustling to get paper stuff put <br/>away -<br/>&gt; logbooks FIRST of course! So there we were two Adams Trails, one 
<br/>Lucy, two<br/>&gt; Martin Girls and Martin Mom, Pawtrekker, Pawtrekker's mom, and <br/>Vido under a<br/>&gt; 10x10 awning with two tables and three chairs, and trying to <br/>protect<br/>&gt; everything. For just a moment, I stepped back and watched our 
<br/>little scene<br/>&gt; and had to chuckle about it. Finally, the rain let up and Adams <br/>Trails<br/>&gt; moved on (only after Mr. Adams emptied our awning of water, which <br/>I later<br/>&gt; learned I should be glad for because after I had cleared everyone 
<br/>else out,<br/>&gt; I realized the puddling water on the awning was really creating a <br/>nice<br/>&gt; little shower of its own!).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The shower happened shortly before the event was over and our <br/>little
<br/>&gt; gathering ended as quickly as it had begun, so folks started <br/>packing like<br/>&gt; crazy and my Girl Scout friends left too. I carried the important <br/>stuff to<br/>&gt; the car and grouped the rest of my stuff up in the middle of the 
<br/>awning and<br/>&gt; went to find Fearless Fox in his booth (his was a boring work-<br/>related<br/>&gt; booth), a little water and a little shade. I finally found a <br/>picnic table<br/>&gt; in deep shade, when who should I see coming toward me but - you 
<br/>know it -<br/>&gt; Gryzzled Gryphon!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We went to my car so he could stamp the box and on the way over <br/>there, I<br/>&gt; called Pawtrekker's mom to see if her dad would run her back up to <br/>exchange
<br/>&gt; with GG. I didn't know how to get in touch with the Martin Girls <br/>and<br/>&gt; figured they were probably well out of range by then anyway, but <br/>Pawtrekker<br/>&gt; was ecstatic to get to meet our esteemed enigma. I had been 
<br/>telling them<br/>&gt; Gryzzled Gryphon stories earlier in the day and she especially had <br/>been<br/>&gt; eager to meet him, but she did a great job of being herself when <br/>she finally<br/>&gt; did meet him.<br/>&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, stamping all done, GG and I found a little shade and he <br/>told me a<br/>&gt; funny story about his recent trip to West Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As for me, I was tired and feeling very much worse for the wear of 
<br/>the day<br/>&gt; on hot asphalt, but any day with a little letterboxing has GOT to <br/>be a good<br/>&gt; day, right?<br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
