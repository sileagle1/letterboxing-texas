                    <html><body><div>I received an AQ mail yesterday saying that a family had found "A Color of His Own". I was so excited, I started a reply with questions and comments about it. </div> <div> </div> <div>This was my first carving to be used by other people. I had only carved my sig stamp prior to carving this cute little chameleon. He was carved for The Great Book Adventure in Houston in October 06.</div> <div> </div> <div>Before sending my reply to this family, I decided to look at their found date. It was for back then, before he came up missing. </div> <div> </div> <div>I was so bummed out. But, for a second there, I knew how y'all felt after being told that a box was missing and then all of a sudden it came back. It's a wonderful feeling. </div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Blooming Flowers</div> <div> </div><br/><br/><div> </div><p>
