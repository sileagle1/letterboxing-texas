                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to share my excitement with y'all.  We have been <br/>
letterboxing for just over a year now.  We have tried to get my <br/>
parents interested but with no luck.  <br/>
Well, mom is out of town right now and Dad calls me everyday.  Dad <br/>
also travels a lot for his job.  He flies or drives probably 4 days <br/>
out of 5.  Monday he going to Bastrop TX and Tuesday will be in Rio <br/>
Rancho NM.  He comes home each night usually but travels a lot.  <br/>
So anyway, I call him to find out where places are and stuff like <br/>
that.  So I was asking him today about a town in south Texas told him <br/>
I was looking into a box in the area.<br/>
Well, I finally got him to look on letterboxing.org.  He seems <br/>
interested.  He doesn't think he'll have the time to find any in <br/>
Bastrop but is definately going to look for the 2 in Rio Rancho.  I <br/>
told him if he did find them just to sign his name and stuff and we <br/>
can come up with a stamp for him later.  He seems excited.  A new way <br/>
to find interesting stuff on the road since he does travel so much.  I <br/>
went over some of the basic rules with him, ya know be discreet that <br/>
sort of thing.  But he seems generally interested.  I am so excited <br/>
for him.  I hope he enjoys this.  I hope he gets good finds.<br/>
