Any more clues as to how to get to the "endangered species" sign in <br/>
St Ed's Park - Barton Creek, Austin? Parked in bigger lot, went down <br/>
to the creek - turned right. We hiked the trail along the creek <br/>
upstream. Trail hits the road a couple of times, passed the <br/>
crossover road going across to private property. Went about 10 more <br/>
minutes up the trail (slow pace). Couldn't figure if we hadn't gone <br/>
far enough or struck out on the wrong trail. Trail got thicker and <br/>
water was turning to a trickle and standing in some areas.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Though I had trouble finding this one, too, I finally<br/>
was successful by crossing the creek back down the road <br/>
and then taking a trail up that follows the creek<br/>
higher up.  Eventually you will get to the top of the<br/>
mountain and find the Endangered Species sign.  I don't<br/>
want to give away any more information, but maybe<br/>
you can get the owner to supply some hints in private<br/>
email.  Good luck!<br/>
