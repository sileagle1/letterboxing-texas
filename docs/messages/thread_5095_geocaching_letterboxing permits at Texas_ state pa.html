                    <html><body><p>If you ask me, this is a vast improvement over the previous form. For
one thing, it gives a space for a physical description of the location
vs having to give either GPS or make notes on the back of the form or
attach the clues themselves. For another, it does take away the 1 year
requirement - that's been a hang-up for alot of placers over the recent
years as we've hashed and rehashed the permitting process. I also like
the fact that they've made them guidelines and not rules - it doesn't
indeed allow the parks some leeway in enforcement. <br/>
<br/>
I have a feeling they realized that by making hard and fast rules that
didn't apply well to some parks, and by having the 1 year expiration,
they were imposing a lot of extra work on park personnel and rather
than doing the work, the parks were simply ignoring the requirement
altogether unless they had experienced issues in sensitive areas. And
I think making it a guideline serves to allow the placer to feel that
they can be a part of the process rather than being dictated to with
onerous requirements.<br/>
<br/>
In my opinion, all good moves by TPWD. I've understood from the
beginning that they want to make sure they are protecting their parks,
but I also understand letterboxers who have stayed under the radar
because the premise of permitting runs counter to the covertness of the
game. <br/>

Im not sure when this happened, but its been updated to include letterboxing. The guideline is now titled Seek and find activities including both geocaching and letterboxing. It is also a suggested guideline  maybe they recognize that not all the parks are enforcing the rules the same way? The permit includes letterboxes as one of the options for cache type. They have also removed the line about the permit being valid for one year. Unfortunately you still have to get approval before the box is placed. <u></u><u></u></span></p>
