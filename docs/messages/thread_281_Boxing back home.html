Displaced Texan here -- originally from Houston but now living in <br>
Washington DC.  I was home over the second week of August and <br>
actually managed to do a bit of boxing.  Found the Brown Bomber in <br>
Galveston alive and well (and there are a lot of those pelicans in <br>
the surf right now -- see them while you can!) as well as the stamp <br>
at Don`Key and Challenger Memorial Park.  Also found the Battleship <br>
Texas stamp (can you tell I'm from the southeast side?), though the <br>
logbook was quite wet.  <br>
<br>
Didn't get a chance to do any planting while I was there, but I think <br>
I've gotten my mom, sister and nephew hooked, so don't be surprised <br>
if some pop up sooner than later.  My nephew is so excited to do it, <br>
but we're working on toning down the difficulty of his clues (he <br>
loves the idea of sending someone on a long, wild goose chase).<br>
<br>
