                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well after a long hibernation, the Texas Tour Bus took off this past <br/>
weekend. After fighting the traffic down I35 from the Spring <br/>
Breakers, the crew decided to stop off in Austin. After a quick <br/>
detour, the bus found itself in Barton Springs. While there to take <br/>
a quick dip in the 70 degree year round swimming hole, the guys <br/>
decided that they liked it here and decided to stay.  As we went <br/>
about finding some of the boxes located here, we met a couple that <br/>
were doing the peas box, "The Barton Springs Salamander" and they <br/>
asked us if we were lb'ers. Guess the cammo'd box and the backpacks <br/>
gave it away. When we told them yes, we proceeded to find out that <br/>
they were too and were fairly newbies. So we went over some of the <br/>
finer points of lb'ing with them. They have only been doing it a <br/>
short while but they "Shoot for the Stars" were very intrigued with <br/>
it. As we sat in the beautiful sunshine and stamped we started to <br/>
tell them about the Texas Tour Bus. Having only found a couple of <br/>
the stamps they were very anxious to find it. So the bus detoured <br/>
home with them and is to be replanted shortly with new clues. With <br/>
it being such a nice day, the park was very crowded and we didn't <br/>
want to take a chance that someone would see us planting the box and <br/>
take off with it, so we figured it would be better if we knew a <br/>
lb'er had it and would replant it in the area locally. The TTB <br/>
didn't seem to mind so they are hanging out in Austin and will be <br/>
back on the road again with new clues shortly.  Thanks to Shoot for <br/>
the Stars for relocating the TTB for us.<br/>
