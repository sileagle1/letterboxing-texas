<div>Well, it would depend. If I was going to stay with friends, and figured I was just escaping a bad storm, and might come back to some damage or maybe no damage (I think a lot of people left because they were afraid they would lose power and didn't want to suffer the heat and inconvenience) and knew I 'd have some free time, I'd take it if I could. If I thought I would have to stay in a shelter or I was quite sure I would be coming back to a pile of rubble or a lake where my house used to be, I would leave it. </div>

I would bring ours - with many little ones and not<br/>

would be gone, I wanted to make sure that I had<br/>
something for us to <br/>

SO, I pose the question, if you were having to leave<br/>
your<br/>
