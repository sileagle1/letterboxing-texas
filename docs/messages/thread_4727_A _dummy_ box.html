<br>
It gives someone who is looking for the box a chance to know they found the right spot but that its off being logged by someone.  I haven't ever used it but thought it was a great idea.  The laminated card can be placed in a pouch or box to carry with you all the time for things like that.<br>
<br>
I like the "planning a hike for the grandkids" routine too to explain the notebook, pack, etc.<br>
