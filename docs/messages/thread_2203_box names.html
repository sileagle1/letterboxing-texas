<div>I was thinking about 
what Lucy said about boxers perhaps not realizing that both boxes were in the 
same park.  When I first started letterboxing 3 years ago the boxes I found 
were the ones placed by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (mostly because they were the 
only boxes out there!) and usually they both had one in the same park.  In 
their clues they always had a tip at the end, "Now go find Silver Eagle's 
 xxxxx box", which was a great help for me.  Silver Eagle even has the 
link to the other box right on his clue page.  This is a little too high 
tech for me to do on my own, but if I know there is another box in the park I 
try to remember to put it in my clues.  I am going to make sure to do this 
from now on, because Lucy brings up a good point, sometimes there are so many 
boxes to chose from (HURRAH!) that it is easy to overlook boxes that are in the 
same park, trail, etc.  MO5</div></body></html>

                    <html><body><div>Lucy Locket and Blue Butterfly and I all have boxes in close proximity also, and we add notes to our clues about the other boxes.  What a shame it would be for someone to go out of their way to visit that particular park and NOT get all the boxes there!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, I have one box on one trail, and a series of six on the same trail, and another boxer has a box on the SAME trail - It's a three mile trail, so plenty of room for all of them.  Wouldn't it be a bummer to hike the whole trail looking for the series, only to find out you walked right by two other boxes?  I've got a hint in those clues to be careful to look at clues because there are other boxes on that trail.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Obviously it's a good idea to ask the other planter if it's okay to reference a box, and there are some occasions when I can see someone wouldn't want their box tied to other boxes, but it does add a little help to the finder if they are cross-referenced.
