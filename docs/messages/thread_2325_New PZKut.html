<span> I use the white and orange.  I like the orange for smoother carves.  I like the white because it is very good for shading, fur, hair, etc.  But I got a bad batch of white last time I ordered.  It didn’t take the ink in places.  It was strange.  I hope your batch is better than mine was!  But I know what  you mean. I order mine in smaller batches all year round because I order new blades each time, and I go through them quickly.  I love getting that big envelope in the mail! <br/>
