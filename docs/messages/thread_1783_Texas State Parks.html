I've spent the past three weekends in state parks. <br/>

facility-wise, because as many of you who have camped<br/>
out of state know, our state parks have, as a whole,<br/>

<br/>
I would like to suggest that as you spend time in<br/>
state parks, you give feedback to them about your<br/>
experience.  Hopefully our comments will eventually<br/>
have some influence on the funding status of state<br/>
parks.<br/>

Here is the link off the website for contacting TPWD. <br/>
There are other folks who could also be copied on such<br/>
a message, like the Comptroller's office (sorry, but<br/>
their website is down), your elected state officials,<br/>
Robert Cook, the Executive Director of TPWD, but at<br/>
the very least, bookmark the following link and use it<br/>
to leave feedback about your experience:<br/>

<div><span class="031435503-27032006">I have 
to say that we were shocked at the fees for your state parks when we visited 
last November.  Much higher than anywhere we have traveled, and we 
travel  quite a bit.  It certainly doesn't seem that the public 
lands are accessible to the general public unless they are willing to pay the 
hefty fees.  We can afford them, but I've never been in another state that 
charged BY THE PERSON to enter a park.  It sounds like budget issues may be 
the source of the problem, but it is unfortunate that it may be limiting access 
to those with lower incomes.</span></div>
