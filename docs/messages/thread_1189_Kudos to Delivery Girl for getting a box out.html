Excellent.  Very nice.<br>
<br>
Yes, I noticed you had your first box posted and I<br>
meant to take note of that in my update message about<br>
the gathering - we are now up to one boxer, one box in<br>
the three counties!  Woohoo! If I remember, you have<br>
another box or two out, but not posted yet, right?<br>
<br>
I would certainly appreciate any insight you can give<br>
us about the area - frankly, I've not ever spent any<br>
time at all in your area, so that and the fact that it<br>
is nestled among several high box areas made me decide<br>
that's where the Barnraising had to be!<br>
<br>
Are you aware of any other letterboxers in your area? <br>
To my knowledge, you are it.  I was that way for quite<br>
a long time in East Texas, and Ruby and I were talking<br>
about how her family were lone boxers in the Dallas<br>
area even for awhile!  Things do change...<br>

Yes, you are correct regarding the Johnson County side<br>
from Waxahachie. <br>
<br>
In the next coming week I will be thinking about what<br>
goes on locally for some ideas. I think in Burleson a<br>
"Kelly Clarkson" letterbox should be planted. :)<br>
<br>
I just planted my first box here in Burleson about 2<br>
weeks ago and YUP - you guessed it! GG was the first<br>
to sign in!<br>

<p>Thanks to the Cummins Clan there are people getting interested in Letterboxing here in Burleson. They used to live here but still come here regularly.
