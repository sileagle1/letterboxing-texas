                    <html><body><p>Sure hope the Wild West Box gets moving again. And no clamoring for it may mean that newer boxers don't know what it's all about. When I first started boxing some 6-7 yrs ago, I heard about the box--I guess from chats on the list. It had been planted not a mile from my house, but I was a few hours too late. Bummer! Then a week or so later it was planted in Pedernales Falls SP. I saw the post late in the evening, and informed Bird Dog I was going to try for it. Got up early and high tailed it out 290, with an eagle eye out for troopers who might want to slow me down and impede my mission. And then there it was. Big box under a bush. Grabbed it with awe and glee. Leisurely drive back home. THEN, I opened the box. Oh My! What have I done. What beautiful carves. Such clever subjects and stories. I barely knew how to carve a round circle, and my knowledge of Texas folklore was limited to the Alamo, northern replant that I am. But took a deep breath and, fool that I am, braved where angels dare not tread. I had a blast. I loved looking thru books at the library to figure out what to carve, gained a little skill, and added a stamp to the box. It was great fun seeing what others had done, and even more fun posting the replant and watching the scurrying on the list.</p><div>So if we can get this wrested from Sea Dove would be wonderful.

                    <html><body><p>Some of your questions can be answered by clicking on the "Files" tab and scrolling down to the file titled "TTB2", which stands for Texas Tour Bus 2, then clicking on "TTB2 Instructions". The entire TTB2 has been copied page by page and can be found in the same file. The original Texas Tour Bus was started and owned by Team King, but  unfortunately was lost when it was handed to a "newbie" and was never seen again.  I'm sure this post will generate comments about the traveling boxes that followed, including the Circus box and the Wild West Show and Rodeo box, which is still out there, although moving around very slowly.  Maybe we should revisit all the rules so that everyone will understand the purpose of the box.  I think each box has been better than the one before.  I also believe that the finders have become better and better at creating stamps and decorated pages for the logbook that new boxers who happen to find the box are intimidated to the point of hanging on to the box much too long and never making a contribution to it.  Is there some way we could put a time limit on the box (I think a month is adequate) so that it will move along and more people can enjoy it?  I don't know how that could be enforced.  Any suggestions?</p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>

<p>I've always thought that people should use the same urgency in replanting the special boxes as they did in finding them in the first place. We used to have an "unofficial rule" that these special boxes should be replanted within a week or two of finding it. If you aren't able to stamp, carve and replant it in a timely manner, let someone else have a crack at it. Puddle Splasher</p>

                    <html><body><p>The Wild West Show is the 4th traveling box and is currently active, though very slowly at this point.  The Texas Tour Bus went missing so TTB2 was created.  When it filled up it was retired and the Circus took its place (it was quite a funny story involving Baby Bear and Letterbox Bozo).  When it filled up it was retired and the Wild West Show took its place.  Baby Bear has the TTB2 and Circus boxes and brings them to TALE each year for anyone to stamp in.  The rules for the Wild West Show are to only post clues to its whereabouts on this Yahoo Group and keep it in Texas.  Once it has been placed and clues posted, it is first come, first get.  The finder should then add a Wild West character to the box and place it somewhere soon, posting clues here and starting the stampede again.  <br/><br/>To speed up the process and help those that feel overwhelmed with adding a stamp to the box, maybe we should say that adding to the box is optional and getting it back in circulation should be the priority.  We would just have to hope that some would still add to the box if time permitted.  Bell Motel is the owner of this box so should have final say, but what do y'all think?<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>
