Saturday, March 19, 2005 for our second TX Letterbox Event.<br/>
I also reserved my campsite and suggest you do the same if<br/>
you plan to camp.  There are currently over 40 sites available,<br/>
but they could go fast.  I have created a web page with<br/>
information about the event and put it in the Links section,<br/>
along with a link to our first TX Letterbox Event.  I have <br/>
included some information about nearby accommodations and other <br/>
activities in the area, and will continue to add more as I <br/>
think of them.  We can talk about details later, such as who <br/>
wants to bring what, and everyone can R.S.V.P. to me so I can <br/>
update the web page.  So, we should be set and I look forward <br/>
to another great Event!<br/>
