wet. The box and baggies had leaked, but the little book was in good enough 
condition to hold together. We set it in the sun next to me on the sidewalk 
while the kids played. Then I realized I had a complete flat, so we left it out 
longer until triple A showed up. </font></div>

<div>Way too many people give up when they come up empty-handed a couple of times, so it's great that you made that "one more" trip that netted you a box.  And when your kids get excited about it, it's hard not to get hooked!
