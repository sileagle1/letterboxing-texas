<div> Well my sons and I went on a 
successful letterbox hunt. It was League of Their Own #3 in Richardson. We had a 
great deal of fun finding it. Unfortunately, when we found it, it was soaking 
wet. The box and baggies had leaked, but the little book was in good enough 
condition to hold together. We set it in the sun next to me on the sidewalk 
while the kids played. Then I realized I had a complete flat, so we left it out 
longer until triple A showed up. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately I didn't have any extra 
baggies with me, so I just dried it best I could and put it back into place. I 
did notify the person who posted about it...is that someone on this list, by 
chance? I haven't heard back. So if there is another hard rain it will get wet 
again. There were actually several small holes in the box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was fun to get a good find after 3 
missing ones...my kids were thrilled.</div>

<div>The lady who planted that series is presently working on her doctorate degree so I think she's not active right now. I have a couple of boxes I want to look for in Richardson soon, so I'll try to check on her box while I'm there and put a new baggie in it.</div>

<div>Way too many people give up when they come up empty-handed a couple of times, so it's great that you made that "one more" trip that netted you a box.  And when your kids get excited about it, it's hard not to get hooked!
