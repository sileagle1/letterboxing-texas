<div></div>
<div>I'm working this evening on putting our weekend trip together, and I'm 
  wondering one thing:  I notice several of the rec areas have a $5 entry 
  fee.  We may well be hitting 4 of them this weekend, meaning this 
  could get expensive (not to mention State Park fees!).  Is that the 
  case, or will one day use permit cover all the local areas.  I'm

<div>I have a funny story about those day use fees - about 17 years ago, we found ourselves homeless for about five months.  We wound up camping in a state park in California until we could get back on our feet.  We could barely afford the very cheapest of sites - one without electricity for $7 a night.  There were no per person day use fees, but you did have to pay an extra $1 if you had more than one vehicle.  We had two vehicles and the park would give you a folded up receipt to put in the window that showed in bold marker the last day of the month the vehicle would be in the park (
i.e. it would have a 19 if the vehicle was to leave after the 19th).  We just could not afford that $1 but we had to pay it because the extra vehicle was, at times, the only shelter my infant daughter and I had from the elements during the day while the other vehicle was gone with my husband to work.  Well after a week or two of paying it and realizing this was going to be more than a passing situation, we realized we could keep the receipts and reuse them from month to month and as long as we laid pretty low, the park wouldn't realize it.  We reused those receipts for four months and never got caught.  It was a great feeling not to have to keep track of them once we got going again, and here about 5 years ago we sent the California park where we had stayed a check for $150 to cover all those fees we avoided.  I've always wondered what they thought when they got that money, but they DID cash the check!

$4.00 per car and $2.00 per person.  We wanted to put a letterbox <br/>
there, but we would have had to pay $8.00 to get in (just the two of <br/>
us) and we thought that would be unreasonable.  We have a Golden Age <br/>
pass (sometimes being old has advantages) and Cagle charges us half <br/>
price, but Double Lake gave us a permanent day pass, so we get in <br/>
there free.  Stubblefield works on the honor system (no attendant), <br/>
so I used my Cagle receipt and just placed it on the dash.  If you <br/>
visit state parks often, it really helps to get the annual pass.<br/>

&gt; the last day of the month the vehicle would be in the park (i.e. <br/>
it would<br/>
&gt; have a 19 if the vehicle was to leave after the 19th).  We just <br/>
could not<br/>
&gt; afford that $1 but we had to pay it because the extra vehicle was, <br/>
at times,<br/>
&gt; the only shelter my infant daughter and I had from the elements <br/>
during the<br/>
&gt; day while the other vehicle was gone with my husband to work.  <br/>
Well after a<br/>
&gt; week or two of paying it and realizing this was going to be more <br/>
than a<br/>
&gt; passing situation, we realized we could keep the receipts and <br/>
reuse them<br/>
&gt; from month to month and as long as we laid pretty low, the park <br/>
wouldn't<br/>
&gt; realize it.  We reused those receipts for four months and never <br/>
got caught.<br/>
&gt; It was a great feeling not to have to keep track of them once we <br/>
got going<br/>
&gt; again, and here about 5 years ago we sent the California park <br/>
where we had<br/>
&gt; stayed a check for $150 to cover all those fees we avoided.  I've <br/>
always<br/>
&gt; wondered what they thought when they got that money, but they DID <br/>
cash the<br/>
&gt; check!<br/>
