Buns of steel?  Buns of aluminum foil -- everyone has to start somewhere, right?  But I digress.) is that TX
 carvers can hold their own!  It was fun seeing names of people from the boards and seeing carves from one of our own at an event. Open Space did us proud with her contribution. I was also impressed with how kind and generous the locals were in taking care of boxers from out of town.  I liked that they had a singalong in the evening that many of the longtimers were rushing to get to.  During the day, the kids gathered at the group campsite where they played all day under the supervision of several adult LB'ers who forewent their time on the trails to hang out with the kids and let them soak each other with squirt guns and basically tire themselves out being hooligans.  </span></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>I know that Bell Motel managed to get every, single box!  Go, you!  Many, many, had boxing at their actual campsites, which was fun since you got to sit around and chat or just sneak in while they were
 on the trails.</span></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>The generosity of spirit seems to be common to all letterboxers, so you still feel like you're part of a huge family you haven't even met yet.  But the really interesting thing is that letterboxers all over the country seem to have an odd underwear fetish.  While boxer shorts with hearts are preferred in one area of the country, it seems that tassled bras are the standard up there, even for men!, which apparently matches Bell Motel's preferences perfectly.  Whooo --WOO! as we say in my family when you drop your towel.</span></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>The other thing I learned was that it was a good thing I sucked it up and actually shelled out the big bucks for hiking shoes.  As much as it pains me to pay for anything, it really does matter.  One blister, but no crippling, thanks.</span></div><div><span></span> </div><div><span>I also
 learned that in the northeast, they have a "camp coffee"-induced disability.  They cannot recognize faces and instead call you the name of the person to your left.  Consequently, Screamin' Meemie became Mosaic Butterfly, and I became no one, having no one to my left ever.  To help them with this disability, you must wear a hat.</span></div><div></div><div><br/> </div></div></body></html>

I just returned from a trip to Colorado with the family and though I didn't get to find many boxes, a couple were interesting.  When planning my trips I decide roughly where I want to go, then look at letterbox clues to see if there are any interesting places nearby that I have never heard of.  If so, I research them and add to the itinerary if time allows.  It is a tedious process, but has enabled me to go to places I never would have known about.  This time, while looking for boxes near Rocky Mt.

Another box, Rafting Teddys in Buena Vista, introduced me to a whole bunch of trails along the Arkansas River and gave me quite a surprise when I stamped in.  Two Texas boxers had stamped in a few years ago:  Dewberry and Viewfinder.  It is always fun to see fellow Texans in logbooks!  BTW, that area of Colorado is known for river rafting and I highly recommend it.  We did The Numbers with River Runners and it was exhilarating!  We stayed at Mt.

Number two was reeling in an Amberjack on a deep sea fishing trip off the coast of Florida (took every ounce of energy in my body), and NUMBER ONE: Drum roll....... climbing those mountains on the Appalachian Trail. In fact, that was so hard, I'm planning to do another section next summer including McAfee Knob and Dragons Tooth, which requires hand over foot rock climbing with a 30 pound pack on my back. I'll have to carry a lot of days of food for that section because there aren't resupply places close to the trail, but at least there should be plenty of water along the trail. I'm not really an adrenaline junky, but I do enjoy a good challenge - especially when it's over!
