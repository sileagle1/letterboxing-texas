flaming, but I want you to show me a group of more than 2000 people <br/>
that doesn't have its misunderstanding and disagreements.  <br/>
<br/>
Generally, what is perceived as a flame is much more likely to be <br/>
miscommunication.  That happens in my work life with email A LOT.  <br/>
Far, far too often it is more a question of someone misunderstanding <br/>
someone's tone, because email/chat lists do not offer the nuances of <br/>
body language or voice pitch that help us to fully understand what <br/>
others are saying.  I think anyone who has been around the Internet <br/>
at all probably knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  <br/>
<br/>
On the Big List there are very experienced boxers and newbies.  <br/>
There are people of all different political views, religions (or non-<br/>
religions), ethnicities and sexual orientations.  This makes for a <br/>
fabulous, diverse group.  And what do all these people have in <br/>
common?  They like to traipse around and look for plastic tupperware <br/>
with a little "prize" inside.  The sociologist in me thinks that the <br/>
dynamic exchange of ideas that comes out of that construct is <br/>
terrific.  That said, I think civility is called for.  Those who <br/>
have a repeated history of complete incivility should not be <br/>
tolerated by the group.<br/>
<br/>
And finally.  I like hand-carved stamps.  There, I said it.  I <br/>
prefer a not-very-well-executed hand-carved stamp to a gorgeous <br/>
purchased one.  I'll go to a box that has a bought stamp, because I <br/>
enjoy the experience.  But, I think the placer should just mention <br/>
that fact in the clue.  Full disclosure is a positive.  <br/>
<br/>
Didn't mean to ramble on.  I guess that's what happens when a PR <br/>
person/sociologist/English major starts talking about group <br/>
dynamics.  The sociology of groups was my absolute favorite <br/>
undergrad course, but that's another post!<br/>
<br/>
Happy 4th all!<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to add that my question (and my comments) seemed to be very<br/>
&gt; misunderstood, which is why I've stopped commenting on the big <br/>
list. <br/>
&gt; I must be phrasing things very badly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few minutes ago, I counted the stamps in my own personal logbook,<br/>
&gt; and--if I don't count the exchanged stamps that resulted from a<br/>
&gt; (large) class that I taught in letterbox stamp carving--the stamps <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; equally handcarved and store bought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's probably a good representation of the balance in actual<br/>
&gt; letterboxing: 50/50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm thrilled to find any letterbox.  I don't think any less of a <br/>
store<br/>
&gt; bought stamp than a handcarved one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I asked on the list, I was mostly commenting about how often <br/>
I'll<br/>
&gt; struggle with truly vague and/or confusing clues if I know that a<br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamp is the prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, I once spent over an hour turning over rocks in a <br/>
heavily<br/>
&gt; wooded (and very rocky) area in the northeast when the clue <br/>
was, "turn<br/>
&gt; left at the two trees and look under the rock!"  The stamp was<br/>
&gt; gorgeous, but the clues were far too vague.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, in my post to the big list I never intended to make less of <br/>
any<br/>
&gt; letterbox, no matter what the stamp is like... For me, every <br/>
letterbox<br/>
&gt; is a fabulous opportunity to discover a new trail, a new landscape,<br/>
&gt; and often a new park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope to meet some of the other letterboxers on this list, but now<br/>
&gt; I'm wondering if I'm regarded as some horrid woman who disdains <br/>
store<br/>
&gt; bought stamps.  I'm also suspecting that my comments were confused<br/>
&gt; with Lady P's, when her sentiments seemed to be the very opposite <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an artist, I love handcarved stamps.  However, letterboxing is--<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; me--about the hikes and the thrill of successfully sorting out <br/>
clues<br/>
&gt; to find a box.  I also enjoy planting boxes, and reading the log <br/>
books<br/>
&gt; later. I get all mushy when I read notes by little kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I was all that keen on carving stamps, I'd be far more active <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; the Carving Consortium.  I'm not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to make it very clear that I am delighted to find any and <br/>
all<br/>
&gt; letterboxes, whether they include handcarved stamps, store bought<br/>
&gt; stamps, cut-up pink erasers as stamps, or even a piece of a sponge <br/>
cut<br/>
&gt; in a cute shape.  Heck, if it makes any kind of mark in my logbook,<br/>
&gt; I'm thrilled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, I'm horrified by what was suggested on the big list, and <br/>
dismayed<br/>
&gt; that I'm the one who seemed to have started it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would never want anyone to give up letterboxing because they're<br/>
&gt; using store bought stamps.  That would limit the hobby to artists <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; aspiring artists, and that would be simply awful.  This is such a<br/>
&gt; fabulously fun hobby, I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, <br/>
no<br/>
&gt; matter how plain or fancy their stamps, logbooks, containers, or<br/>
&gt; clues.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the old adage "If you have a choice of<br/>
assuming positive or assuming negative, assume<br/>
positive until you have a reason to do otherwise." is<br/>
a good adage to use with the big list, and email<br/>
communication in general.  Someone said something in<br/>
direct response to one of my posts there the other day<br/>
that really almost got me going, but I took into<br/>
account the source and his penchant for very dry,<br/>
cutting humor.  Knowing that I really enjoy his humor<br/>
when it isn't directed at something I said, I stepped<br/>
back and assumed that he was using his humor at that<br/>
time as well.  If that wasn't the case, don't tell me<br/>
because I'm still blissfully ignorant.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I also enjoy the big list, but I tend to stay off of<br/>
it if there are a lot of flames going on.  This stuff<br/>
isn't real life enough for me to merit getting my own<br/>
outlook dragged down by it.  But when it's clicking,<br/>
it makes very interesting people watching and I think<br/>
it's given me better insight into letterboxing. <br/>
Frankly, it's where I get my little dose of big world.<br/>
 I'm on other lists with other folks who basically<br/>
think just like I do, do things I do, believe as I<br/>
believe, etc.  It gets a little boring, so I enjoy<br/>
that list when it isn't being dysfunctional. <br/>
Unfortunately, it's been pretty dysfunctional lately<br/>
and I hope it cycles out of it all soon.<br/>
<br/>
Dewberry, I'm glad you posted in support of the big<br/>
list because I realized after I posted my message that<br/>
I might have seemed pretty negative about it and I<br/>
certainly didn't want to come across as downing it.  <br/>
