                    <div class="plaintext-content">While we're having this discussion, I want to add my two cents.  I <br>
think the big list is fabulous.  There can be a problem with <br>
flaming, but I want you to show me a group of more than 2000 people <br>
that doesn't have its misunderstanding and disagreements.  <br>
<br>
Generally, what is perceived as a flame is much more likely to be <br>
miscommunication.  That happens in my work life with email A LOT.  <br>
Far, far too often it is more a question of someone misunderstanding <br>
someone's tone, because email/chat lists do not offer the nuances of <br>
body language or voice pitch that help us to fully understand what <br>
others are saying.  I think anyone who has been around the Internet <br>
at all probably knows EXACTLY what I'm talking about.  <br>
<br>
On the Big List there are very experienced boxers and newbies.  <br>
There are people of all different political views, religions (or non-<br>
religions), ethnicities and sexual orientations.  This makes for a <br>
fabulous, diverse group.  And what do all these people have in <br>
common?  They like to traipse around and look for plastic tupperware <br>
with a little "prize" inside.  The sociologist in me thinks that the <br>
dynamic exchange of ideas that comes out of that construct is <br>
terrific.  That said, I think civility is called for.  Those who <br>
have a repeated history of complete incivility should not be <br>
tolerated by the group.<br>
<br>
And finally.  I like hand-carved stamps.  There, I said it.  I <br>
prefer a not-very-well-executed hand-carved stamp to a gorgeous <br>
purchased one.  I'll go to a box that has a bought stamp, because I <br>
enjoy the experience.  But, I think the placer should just mention <br>
that fact in the clue.  Full disclosure is a positive.  <br>
<br>
Didn't mean to ramble on.  I guess that's what happens when a PR <br>
person/sociologist/English major starts talking about group <br>
dynamics.  The sociology of groups was my absolute favorite <br>
undergrad course, but that's another post!<br>
<br>
Happy 4th all!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think the old adage "If you have a choice of<br>
assuming positive or assuming negative, assume<br>
positive until you have a reason to do otherwise." is<br>
a good adage to use with the big list, and email<br>
communication in general.  Someone said something in<br>
direct response to one of my posts there the other day<br>
that really almost got me going, but I took into<br>
account the source and his penchant for very dry,<br>
cutting humor.  Knowing that I really enjoy his humor<br>
when it isn't directed at something I said, I stepped<br>
back and assumed that he was using his humor at that<br>
time as well.  If that wasn't the case, don't tell me<br>
because I'm still blissfully ignorant.  LOL<br>
<br>
I also enjoy the big list, but I tend to stay off of<br>
it if there are a lot of flames going on.  This stuff<br>
isn't real life enough for me to merit getting my own<br>
outlook dragged down by it.  But when it's clicking,<br>
it makes very interesting people watching and I think<br>
it's given me better insight into letterboxing. <br>
Frankly, it's where I get my little dose of big world.<br>
 I'm on other lists with other folks who basically<br>
think just like I do, do things I do, believe as I<br>
believe, etc.  It gets a little boring, so I enjoy<br>
that list when it isn't being dysfunctional. <br>
Unfortunately, it's been pretty dysfunctional lately<br>
and I hope it cycles out of it all soon.<br>
<br>
Dewberry, I'm glad you posted in support of the big<br>
list because I realized after I posted my message that<br>
I might have seemed pretty negative about it and I<br>
certainly didn't want to come across as downing it.  <br>
