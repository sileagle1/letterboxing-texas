big deal to some parts of TX and neighbors to the north, but it is <br>
pretty rare for us.  The last time it snowed was the miracle Christmas <br>

running around like crazy, catching snowflakes on black paper.  The

up and find snow on the ground.  For about 5 minutes it looked a little 
like Michigan! (Except for the palm tree in my neighbor's yard, that is.)

<div>Just know that you will be expected to take all of it home that you can!!</div>
