                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I went out to Mission Tejas today with my navigator,(my puggle <br>
JR).  Even with it being Friday the 13th, we had a lot of success <br>
and found 4 really great stamps.  We started with the "shorter" walk <br>
to find Will's World's "The Pipebangers:Fraggle Rock Series."  He <br>
says in the clues that it is a long walk and is "hilly".  However, <br>
they were long hills, which went up and down both ways.  We did take <br>
the "shorter" walk, but it still ended up being over a mile rt.  <br>
However the walk was worth it.  It takes you to the CC Bathtubs <br>
which is a really neat site in the middle of the forest.  The stamp <br>
was also really cool and ties in well with the site.  After we <br>
recouped from the walk, we went to the mission site.  When I pulled <br>
up the first thing I noticed was that the area where Silver <br>
Eagle's "Spanish Flag Lb had previously been hidden was taped off <br>
with yellow "Do Not Enter" tape and that they were clearing that <br>
little area for a utility pole.  So the log that "Spanish Flag" was <br>
behind was no longer there.  So being me, I looked around and didnt <br>
see anyone, so I crossed the tape and went to look for the box.  I <br>
did find the box in a hole totally uncovered.  So I took the box out <br>
of the hole and found it a new hiding spot, which I will email <br>
Silver Eagle the clues for.  (Silver Eagle, if this is not <br>
satisfactory, please let me know, and I can go pick it up and mail <br>
it to you, or whatever you would like for me to do with it.  I just <br>
figured the best would be to find it a new home...the box and <br>
contents were in perfect shape).  I then went to find Boots <br>
Tex's "Nabedache" box down a really nice trail and found it safe and <br>
sound.  I loved the stamp and location was great.  Next, we went to <br>
the playground area, and found Princess Aurora's "Tejas Bell" <br>
resting nicely.  The stamp and the story that goes along with it are <br>
really great.  Our next stop was the pond area and I did check on <br>
Baby Bear's "Tejas" box which is safe and secure and then went to <br>
find Lone Star Quilter's "Indian Trails -Quilt Block Series."  The <br>
box was safe and sound.  I am always so impressed with the quilt <br>
block series.  They are such wonderful designs.  So, besides Silver <br>
Eagle's box being in jeopardy..it was a great day and four wonderful <br>
boxes.  (I had previously found Baby Bear and Silver Eagle's boxes, <br>
but they are also wonderful) So much for the Friday the 13th <br>
superstition...Thanks to all the wonderful letterboxers/carvers out <br>
there for a great day.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the nice report, JB, and we're glad you liked our boxes.  <br>
That was a good thing you did for SE's Spanish Flag.  That box has <br>
been in that spot for over 4 years.  When we were there 2 weeks ago, <br>
the log was still there and the box was well hidden and in perfect <br>
condition.  I'm glad you could save it.  That's a pretty little <br>
park.  When we went with our grandchildren (6, 4 and 8 months), they <br>
took note at the office that we had children and one ranger came up <br>
to our campsite and gave the kids little bug-catching kits with nets <br>
and magnifying glasses.  He was friendly and funny and the kids <br>
loved him.  He also has story-telling sessions around a campfire at <br>
scheduled times, so if you go, check the schedule for this and other <br>
programs.<br>
