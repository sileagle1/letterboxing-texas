<span>Well, maybe it isn’t.  I just guess I was giving the benefit of the doubt that old-timers wouldn’t leave a logbook out of the bag, leave the boxes out in the open, and use thumbprints as their signature stamps.  It isn’t muggles unless they happen to have been carrying multi-colored stamp pads with them.<br/>

Have I offended someone in some way?<br/>

<span>“How aggrivating!!  :-(<br/>
Which ones were missing!??  “<br/>
<br/>
I now have 5 total missing: <br/>
<br/>
ESOT: Rafinesque’s Big-Eared Bat, ESOT: Jaguarundi, Stretch, Moonrise, and Mean Moon.  <br/>
<br/>
I’m not going to replace the two moons, and the ESOT’s and Stretch will have to wait a while.  I’ve fallen ill and I can’t even think about carving right now.  I happen to have hard copies of the stamps, though, thank goodness.  <br/>
<br/>
I have this tendency to hide boxes near creeks and lakes.  I hope that they just washed away instead of succumbing to some Muggle’s vandalism.  I hate the thought of some thieving teen miscreant stamping their math notebook with my giraffe or moon!!!  Acts of God and honest mistakes I can understand...stupidity and meanness I cannot.  <br/>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While you may well be right and it is a newbie, if I had to guess, it sounds more like a group, probably of kids (maybe a scout group?), who blew threw "doing" letterboxing as an afternoon activity rather than actually getting involved in letterboxing.  Personally, I don't consider those sorts of folks to be newbies, but maybe muggles with a clue?

the box, like whoever destroyed the ones in Rusk near the long <br/>

stumbled upon my General Sherman box in Rusk State Park and signed <br/>
in it and complimented it and left it for the next "muggle", (for a <br/>
period of five months), are to be recruited!  They're future <br/>
letterboxers, they just don't know it yet.   We've only been aware <br/>
of letterboxing for about 15 months and have seen the activity boom, <br/>
at least in the eastern half of the state.  What's it going to be <br/>
like in 3 or 4 years?  Maybe we should all resolve this year to pick <br/>
a county that has no letterboxes and plan a special trip to plant <br/>
some there.  Share the fun with those who are letterbox-poor.<br/>

<p>My son finally called and told me that a Muggle is a human without 
  <br/>magical powers (I've never seen a Harry Potter movie). Anyway, I <br/>guess 
  I pretty much fit that description, as does most everyone else <br/>(with the 
  possible exception of Gryzzled Gryphon). Seriously, is <br/>that a lettrboxing 
  term I should be familiar with? I assume it <br/>means someone who doesn't know 
  the etiquette of letterboxing?<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>,

  Not unless I'm a muggle. Is that anything like a caveman?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

  &gt; Well, maybe it isnt. I just guess I was giving the benefit of <br/>&gt; 
  the doubt<br/>&gt; &gt; that old-timers wouldnt leave a logbook out of the 
  bag, leave <br/>the <br/>&gt; boxes out<br/>&gt; &gt; in the open, and use 
  thumbprints as their signature stamps. It <br/>&gt; isnt<br/>&gt; &gt; muggles 
  unless they happen to have been carrying multi-colored <br/>&gt; stamp 
  pads<br/>&gt; &gt; with them.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Have I offended 
  someone in some way?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; STargazer<br/>&gt; &gt;

  &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Okay, I have to ask. How do you know its

  few days. <br/>&gt; I've been going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; around checking on my 
  plants and have found SIX of them left <br/>&gt; out in the<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt;&gt; open, and the logbooks left out of the plastic bags. It looks 
  <br/>&gt; like the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Metroplex may have some newbies that 
  aren't quite up to speed <br/>&gt; on protocol.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt;&gt; If you are new to boxing, please be sure to hide the boxes 
  <br/>&gt; well, and please<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; put logbooks and stamps in 
  their labeled baggies.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;
