                    <html><body><div dir="ltr"><div>One of the lurking venerables of the Texas List emailed me yesterday.  I had been wondering about her, so I was very glad to hear from her!  She reads the list daily by digest but she has a problem which probably anyone who reads the digest version has - not editing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I will say I am probably the worst about this.  In fact, I started using google because I forget to trim my posts.  Google, at least in MY browser (someone tell me if it doesn't come across trimmed to you), at least hides the previous text and allows the reader to click to see it if they want to.  Anyway, most of you know what I'm talking about, so if you do, just skip over this part to the next part and promise you'll do better at trimming your posts, but for those of you who don't know what I'm talking about, here goes:  When you reply to a message, many email editors send back the message you are replying to AND your message.  If the message you were replying to was itself a reply, it sends your message, the message you replied to AND the message that person replied to.  Some of our recent threads have gotten quite long, so that one message might have the same original message 15 or 20 times - yikes!  Where this gets bad is if someone reads on digest (a daily delivery of all the messages from the group), and the digest message is filled with the same message over and over and over again.  It makes reading in digest highly difficult, if not impossible.  NOW - sometimes you NEED to have the message you are replying to included, so not cutting it is okay - say - a reader is going to wonder what the heck you are talking about if they don't know which message you are replying to.  Sometimes, though, you can get away with sending back only a little portion of the message you are replying to, so you need to highlight the text you want to keep, go up to Edit at the top of your browser, down to Copy, and then go to your own message and go back to Edit and then Paste.  My personal opinion is that if you are responding to a message, you should put what you are replying to at the top of you message, then do some sort of separator - I do *************************** - and type your message.  Then go back to the original message and highlight it, then hit Delete.  Our digest readers will thank you!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>NOW - the other related topic is subject lines and this is MY pet peeve.  If you will not be writing in regard to what the original poster wrote about and titled the post about, change the subject line.  Let me give you a picture image of what happens when you don't do this - have you ever been to a convention or a conference or Sunday School or anywhere where there are different places to learn about different topics?  Let's say you are at the World Conference for Daily Living Skills and you signed up for the "How to Dial a Telephone" breakout session.  You're running a little late and as you dash in the door, you hear someone discussing "How to Properly Seal an Envelope".  What?  You step back outside - "How to Dial a Telephone" is on the door and you know you are in the right room, but when you step back inside, they are discussing "How to Prune a Tree".    You are really confused and you can't even call anyone about it because you missed the dialing the phone discussion.  Different email programs have different ways of handling changing the subject line, so figure out how to do it in yours and then do it.  On many lists, I delete threads I'm not interested in or that have run their courses, but on this list I read every single post, even if I just breeze over it, because I want to be diligent in making sure everyone is taking care of everyone else and playing nice.  Busy people will thank you for changing subject lines - and doesn't that include all of us?</div>

<div>Thank you for your attentive reading.  Back to original programming - whatever that was!  (I'm forty messages behind, but something about a missing Bear?)<br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>
