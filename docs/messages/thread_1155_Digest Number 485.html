<div>I've always adopted that Navajo philosophy myself - and I think I can 
safely say I'm avoiding approaching hubris with my stamp carving so far!  
Mostly, they're fairly simple up to this point, but still, I've had some very 
nice comments on them, and I loved doing them, and I'm pretty proud of them 
(oops!  There's the hubris, after all!).  For me, the fun is in the 
finding of the LB, discovering the new place, often a really interesting or 
pretty view (my trail name, you know: Viewfinder), and in actually following the 
clues successfully to make the discovery!  The interesting logbooks are the 
next "gift" of letterboxing, and finally, the stamp is almost like the frosting 
on the cake!  I do love a beautiful, unique, funny, or interesting and 
well-carved stamp, but then, I also love just a simple one or even a 
store-bought one!  I love them all, and the fact that someone did all of 
this to provide for my letterboxing adventures is still amazing to 
me.  </div>
<div>And ...as to the rehiding issue: yes, for the first time, recently I've 
been finding my own boxes left exposed, or semi-exposed, and I really take great 
pains when planting to figure out good hiding places with good cover for 
them, and even to consider seasonal vegetation changes, possible flood paths, 
accidental discovery probability, and even where a stamper might comfortably sit 
to stamp in ... all of which takes me far more time than actually making the 
logbook, covering the box in camo tape, or even carving the stamp!  So the 
thought that someone would be careless or thoughtless enough just to leave it 
out, not replace items securely, or let it be exposed to casual walkers is 
disturbing!  I prefer to think that squirrels have displaced them, or heavy 
rains have moved them, or something.  So far, none have been 
lost...yet!  But I sympathize with those whose boxes have gone missing, 
because I've already found many of them and know what great boxes they were, and 
am grateful that they consider replacing them, sometimes several times.  
What positive, hopeful, optimistic people Texas Letterboxes have to be to 
continue this activity in spite of weather, PI, BEA's and FIRE ANTS (they got me 
again last week! Got to stop wearing flip-flops on the trail!).  </div>

<div>I'm with you- I just love the entire letterboxing experience, from planning out my route and which boxes I will hunt to stamping in. I am happy with any stamp.  And, if the hike or location is especially interesting, I don't get too bummed if the box is missing- at least I had a good hike or toured an interesting museum!</div>
