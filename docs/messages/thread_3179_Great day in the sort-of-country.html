<div>Last week on one of those glorious weather days, I made the trek to 
McKinney for a day of letterboxing with PuddleSplasher, who has really peppered 
that area with some great new boxes!  Here's the situation report:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We began our day in Farmersville, where Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter 
have boxes in a pretty little country cemetery filled with pecan trees (while I 
found and stamped the boxes, PS picked up pecans).  Then, after coffee 
and a shopping sidetrip in Farmersville - PS bought yarn - we made our way 
to Sister Grove Park on Lake Lavon, where PS's Kids' Games series of 5 boxes is 
planted along a very nice hiking trail.  Now, you'd think letterboxing with 
the planter would make it easy, even though I had all the clues and followed 
them myself, but we had several challenges  when a trail marker here 
or there had disappeared and the "trail" had been reclaimed by prairie grass, 
but we persevered and found them all.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After  lunch in a quaint country cafe in McKinney (really good, 
too!), we made a tour of about 5 more little country cemeteries in the 
general area north of McKinney and found the other boxes she's 
planted.   I found the boxes and stamped in while  she made 
notes for editing clues where we found something had changed here and 
there.  We wound up in McKinney on Town Lake Trail, finding one of her 
boxes and one by Wolf Pack 4 that had mysteriously moved on its own to a 
completely different place - I just happened to spot it in a big pile of 
brush.  This is the same letterbox that PS had rescued and dried and 
returned after recent floods, and no one had stamped in since, so it's odd that 
it seems to be moving around on its own!  Maybe it's those BEA's or 
Letterboxing Coyotes or 'Boxin' 'Dillos, or maybe it's just kids.  Who 
knows?  Anyway, the box is still there and safe and dry.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On my drive back toward the west, I ended my day in the old Zion cemetery 
on a hilltop between Frisco, Denton, and McKinney, watching a gorgeous sunset 
between the branches of a large V-shaped old cedar and was doubly 
rewarded by finding a HH in the final letterbox of the day.  That 
was very nice conclusion to a lovely day in the sort-of countryside.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, I don't normally like letterboxing marathons (which might be called 
Throw-N-Go), in which the goal is to find as many as possible in a single day, 
because I really like to stop and savor the place and enjoy reading the logbooks 
and the adventure.  But all of these locations are in pretty close 
proximity and many have more than one box .  We hiked two nature trails and 
took time to enjoy the scenery and found 7 boxes on those trails; we visited 6 
cemeteries, all small, country, historic and interesting places and took time to 
explore the headstones and found 9 boxes there, because some of those little 
cemeteries have several boxes, plus my extra reward of a HH in the final box, 
making a total of 17 boxes found in that day.  And we also 
took time out for a good lunch in a country cafe in McKinney, coffee and 
shopping in an antiques and yarn shop in Farmersville, and a long leisurely 
drive to and from home for me with the top down in the Miata to make it a 
perfect day.   If you want to spend a nice day finding lots of really 
good letterboxes (as all of these boxes certainly are) and doing some 
interesting exploring, hiking, and maybe even manage to pick up a few pecans 
too, I highly recommend this as a very good day!</div>
