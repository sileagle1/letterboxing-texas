                    <div class="plaintext-content">So i was wondering does any one live in or near McAllen? Just wondering <br/>
because i was just in Reynosa, and really think that Taco Ducks (the <br/>
best restaurant in Reynosa) definately needs a box planted close by it, <br/>
so people can stamp in while enjoying tacos.  i want to make the stamp <br/>
etc but it will be at least another year untill i'm there again, so i <br/>
was wondering if there was anyone who might be going to Reynosa who <br/>
could take a box for me whne i've made it!!<br/>
