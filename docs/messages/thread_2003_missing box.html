                    <div class="plaintext-content">Texas Gal, we attempted to find your Heritage Park box last Thursday.  <br>
It was our last box of the day after having been to Georgetown and to <br>
Dana Peak, so it was about dusk.  This park was pretty busy, even at <br>
that hour, with the ball fields close by and walkers on the path <br>
nearby.  We found the tree with the "scar", which was a good-size hole <br>
in the tree and assumed that's where the box was located.  I felt <br>
inside the hole, which was full of that corky stuff that usually <br>
inhabits holes in trees, and I couldn't find anything.  On the left <br>
side, the hole started getting pretty deep, so, being dark in there, <br>
and not knowing how deep the hole was, I gave up on the box.  The <br>
height of the hole (about 4 to 4 1/2 feet off the ground?) seemed to <br>
be just the right height for a kid to look in, just because he's a <br>
kid, and maybe one of them found the box.  You might want to find a <br>
place a little more out of the way (Martin Springs Nature Center could <br>
use a few more).  From the observation deck, the hole in the tree is <br>
pretty prominent.  I know this is frustrating as we have lost three <br>
boxes in the last month, and I thought they were pretty well hidden.  <br>
We have found almost 300 boxes, so we are relatively "seasoned" <br>
boxers, I would say.  Who knows what happens to these boxes?  You <br>
can't let it bother you, it doesn't happen often, just plant two more <br>
to replace that one. <br>

We found the Corpus Porpois 2 in the most beautiful place then went <br>
in search of The Texas Turtle 2 but the area had just been serviced <br>
with fresh weed eating by the cleanup crew so it may have been moved <br>
or lost or captured - either way it was missing the day we went in <br>
search of it but we still thouroughly enjoyed the area and followed <br>
the clues which were fantastic.<br>
<br>
On our way home we found Wolf Brand and Petroleum Park which led us <br>
on a trip down memory lane as we had lived in Corsicana for many <br>
years and raised our three oldest sons there- we hit the local <br>
mexican Food Restraunt "Old Mexican Inn" -yum!!! I think it might be <br>
nice to have a restraunt link to some of these boxes - that was a <br>
great trip!:)<br>
<br>
We chose these boxes as they were in our path of planned travels, I <br>
was glad our first box was a find even though our second was not. <br>
Planning and anticipation made this a fun first try.All of the boxes <br>
we found were little- hubby especially liked the tiny camo one.<br>
