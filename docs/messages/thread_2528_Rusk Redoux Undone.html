<div>Rusk Redoux - 0<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>The weather has won the battle - the forecast and supporting weather map predict temps around 42 degrees and 80% chance of rain for tomorrow.  Rather than have folks driving in in the bad weather, and asking folks to box in cold AND wet (including my crazy mother who planned on being there WITH bronchitis), we are going to reset the official date of the Rusk Redoux to Sunday, February 11th.  It will, of course, be called the Rusk Redoux Redone. I will be saving the Last Train event stamp for that day.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>HOWEVER, that is not to say there is no fun on the run in the rain tomorrow!  We are going to go ahead and have an informal meet-up, no potluck, just BYO (or maybe we'll go somewhere).  I know that JBK will be there as I will, and Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket will come. Kim has said she hopes to make it.  Now we may hang out there at the park, or we may prowl off to find some poor unsuspecting boxless county.  Or we may find a cozy corner of a restaurant to hide out in and plot the future of East Texas letterboxing (I don't mean to scare y'all, but I felt y'all should know that).  Anyone else who wants to come along is more than welcome!  However, unless you plan on meeting up somewhere around 10 
a.m. at RSP, I suggest you use my cell phone to track us down.  If you don't have that number and you think you may show up, email me for it.</div>
