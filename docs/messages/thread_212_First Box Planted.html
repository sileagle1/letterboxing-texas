for the interduction to everyone.  I am disgusted to say that even <br>
though I'll be soo close to 13 boxes I won't be able to hunt most of <br>
them.  The night of July 6th a very needy person must have known how <br>
nice I am and took my Chevy Blazer.  I say needy because when the <br>
police found it; it was stripped of motor trany and anything else <br>
that didn't have VIN's.  Also the neighborhood was full of these <br>
donations to the needy.  So now I'll have to see if any of the guys <br>
I'll be working with are cool enough to drive me around.  <br>
Then I find out about the GA. gathering at Stone Mnt that I'll miss <br>
due to my untimely donation of a truck that only had TWO payments <br>
left.  Sorry about crying on the list.<br>

on here, so let it all out.  I'd buy you a beer if I could. Just try <br>

Maybe you could plant an urban micro in that neighborhood as a <br>
memorial to your truck.<br>
