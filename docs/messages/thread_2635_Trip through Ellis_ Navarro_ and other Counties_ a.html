                    <html><body><div>Once again, I teamed with my sis-in-law Texas Flutterbye to make a run through some boxes.  Our husbands, who are brothers, decided they wanted to go biking today.  I tried in vain to get them to decide in advance where they would be biking, but eventually gave up and mapped us out a trip to clean up a few remaining boxes in areas we had already boxed.  Lightning opted for the bike excursion - which turned out to be around White Rock Lake.  I woulda liked to have boxed around there, but oh well!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We headed up toward Corsicana last night and arrived at their house just in time for dinner and a movie on the big screen.  The guys got tired of the movie and headed to Walmart, Gander Mountain, and stores unknown.  TFB and I opted to stay at the house and get our bags ready to go today and to exchange HH's and a postal and so forth, and to compare logbooks to see what we each didn't have yet.  Finally, about midnight we turned in, after Lightning got himself a new bike and the guys had themselves a plan for the day.  Our niece graciously gave up her bed, and we wound up snoozing wayyy too late, especially given that daylight savings time had occurred overnight.  We all got going about the crack of 9, heading out our separate ways.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Our first order of business was to grab Blue Butterfly's box in Corsicana.  Nice find, but it's seen a lot of visitors in its short life!  We contemplated how many hundreds of people must visit that very park without even a clue about the box hidden right under their noses!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On to Ennis, we found our way to Bluebonnet Park and hit the trail to find Lucy Locket's Pinky and the Brain.  This was a cool set of two in a nice park.  I'm not sure exactly why, but we had a long discussion there about renaissance faires.  Hmmm?  No idea.  But we did.  Followed by stopping to watch some kids feeding funyons to a huge school of bream.  We decided that fishermen who spend big bucks on bait just don't have a clue - clearly funyons were the food of choice among discerning fishes!  Happy to have our newfound insight, we stopped by where a couple of fishermen had their tackle boxes spread out and were seriously casting their lines out for fish.  We told them "Funyons".  It has to be funyons.  They didn't get it.  Too bad.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On our way out to Bardwell Lake, I was telling her GG's story about almost not being allowed in to Waxahachie Creek Park to leave us clues to his first box.  She couldn't believe it, until we got to the gate and pulled up to the window and I, in my most bored voice said "We want to come in and hike."  WELL - the lady asked WHERE we intended to hike, to which I stuttered a bit, not remembering specifically the name of the trail.  She proceeded to tell me the two trails and I guessed the wrong one and she began to explain to me that we could get lost on that trail and it was quite long and that if we got lost we would have to ask a horseman, and there weren't any documented horses on the trail at the moment (and I SOOOO wanted to ask her if they deport undocumented horses, but I decided not to open that can of worms).  FB was sitting in the passenger's seat mumbling to herself, and getting steadily louder as the conversation continued, so I quickly waffled and told the woman the other trail, and she was satisifed that we wouldn't be in over our heads and let us go on in, explaining to us that we needed to go LEFT.  I pulled away from the window and went right, wanting to go check first on something else there at the park before going for Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's boxes.  For the rest of our time there, I felt certain I would see a ranger truck pulling up beside me with the little lady at the wheel, yelling "See?  You're lost already!  I said LEFT - go LEFT!"  But she either didn't catch up with us or didn't care as much as it originally seemed, because once in we were free to roam as we saw fit.  With her direction, we found our way to the correct trails and proceeded to find Silver Eagle's Waxahachie Wikiup and Baby Bear's Sally.  We once had to pretend we were sketching, but we had seen the other folks at the trailhead taking pictures of the trash cans and other weird things, so we weren't too worried about them because it sure seemed as though they were covering up what they were really there for too.  It did occur to me to wonder if the lady knew they were at the equestrian trail instead of the short trail, but I decided not to ask.  Unfortunately, I had forgotten to bring the final answer to Scarlet Pimpernel, so all I could do was try to remember the directions to that one - which I was unsuccessful at.  It still lies out there for me to get.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After leaving there, we decided to bee line over to Terrell, where we got Stargazer's box, Nana's Hummingbird.  That was a lovely little box and it had to be the most organized cemetery I've ever been to.  I really do want to get out and find more of her boxes.   Nice.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We checked in with the guys to see where they were, and it sounded as though we would hit the driveway about the same time as them if we were to find two more boxes before heading back to FB's house.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We began our homeward turn and made it to Mabank, where we found Adams Trails' new (first?) box, Boxing is a Circus, and went on to Seven Points where we got Have Fun Matte.  It's always fun to go find someone's first plants, but not surprisingly - we weren't the FIRST finders!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were surprised to find ourselves back home before the fellas, so we settled in and had a couple of beers while we waited for them.  My bro-in-law called ahead wanting some 'tain't cream, so rather than hanging out and finding out what that was, I loaded my fellows in the car and we headed back home for the weekend.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We took a cross-country route home via Palestine, which isn't exactly the shortest route, but it sure was the prettiest!  Somehow or another, we stumbled across a place I had heard of but never visited before - the Gus Engeling Wildlife Management Area.  Here's the link for it - it is a great place to visit and a very nice educational center:

<div> </div>
<div>Fortunately, I had a stamp and a container in my bag, so at Fearless Fox's suggestion, I planted a box there.  Look for the posting in the next day or two!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Long tiring day, so off to bed with me...yea!  Daylight Savings' Time - long days!</div>
