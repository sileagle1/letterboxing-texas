My trail name is hoppers of seabrook, I travel with<br/>
helter-skelter and we have 2 little ones, Moona is 11<br/>
and Dittr is 6. We are neophyte boxers, but we've<br/>
planted about 8 boxes and found about 25 now. Moona<br/>
and I learned about letterboxing at girl scout camp.<br/>
We are trying to put a letterbox in each of the parks<br/>
of seabrook because we think its a unique area and we<br/>
want other boxers to experience our local beauty. We<br/>
also get down to galveston fairly often and hope to<br/>
plant more down there for the boxing touristas that<br/>
come each summer.<br/>
<br/>
Is Houston still letterboxing capital of NA? too cool,<br/>
good to be known for something besides obesity.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, IKEA today had these great little packs of<br/>
unlined spiral bound notebooks, about 4" x 3" and they<br/>
are 99cents!! <br/>

Cheers all,<br/>

That is so cool that you learned about Letterboxing though Girl <br/>
Scouts, so did I.  I only planted 2, but they are in GS camps. I <br/>
have found about 15.  I will be in Galveston is weekend, planning to <br/>
plant some and find some.  I will be planting on the Bolivar side <br/>
mostly.  I will be in Seabrook in early June, on the hunt for yours. <br/>
Thanks for the IKEA info. <br/>
<br/>
Happy Hunting <br/>
