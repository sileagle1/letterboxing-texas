My trail name is hoppers of seabrook, I travel with<br>
helter-skelter and we have 2 little ones, Moona is 11<br>
and Dittr is 6. We are neophyte boxers, but we've<br>
planted about 8 boxes and found about 25 now. Moona<br>
and I learned about letterboxing at girl scout camp.<br>
We are trying to put a letterbox in each of the parks<br>
of seabrook because we think its a unique area and we<br>
want other boxers to experience our local beauty. We<br>
also get down to galveston fairly often and hope to<br>
plant more down there for the boxing touristas that<br>
come each summer.<br>
<br>
Is Houston still letterboxing capital of NA? too cool,<br>
good to be known for something besides obesity.<br>
<br>
BTW, IKEA today had these great little packs of<br>
unlined spiral bound notebooks, about 4" x 3" and they<br>
are 99cents!! <br>
<br>
Cheers all,<br>

<br>
That is so cool that you learned about Letterboxing though Girl <br>
Scouts, so did I.  I only planted 2, but they are in GS camps. I <br>
have found about 15.  I will be in Galveston is weekend, planning to <br>
plant some and find some.  I will be planting on the Bolivar side <br>
mostly.  I will be in Seabrook in early June, on the hunt for yours. <br>
Thanks for the IKEA info. <br>
<br>
Happy Hunting <br>
