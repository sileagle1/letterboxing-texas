                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent the most wonderful day with Sandi Box and Soccer Chick<br/>
yesterday.  I had been at a theater conference in Houston, and had not<br/>
stray more than five blocks from the convention center.  I hadn't<br/>
gotten a real taste of Houston (although the conference was a blast).<br/>
<br/>
These two fine ladies gave me a wonderful Houston experience, with a<br/>
FAB-U-LOUS meal at the Breakfast Klub (you just don't see grits like<br/>
that in California), and a wonderful day at Memorial Park.<br/>

You guys may not know this, but I lived in Hartford Connecticut, right<br/>
before letterboxing took off in that Fabled Mecca.  I always laugh at<br/>
the jokes about how you have to be careful while driving in Hartford.<br/>
 if you leave your windows rolled down, letterboxes will throw<br/>
themselves into your car!<br/>
<br/>
Well, Connecticut has nothing on Texas!<br/>
<br/>
We were just finishing stamping in, when I said, "Hey, what's that?" <br/>
Without even trying, I found a letterbox that was peeping out of its<br/>
hiding spot.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't worry -- we snuggled it back into place, and tucked it in very<br/>
carefully.<br/>
<br/>
How many places can one find a letterbox by ACCIDENT!!??!!<br/>
<br/>
Combine that with a great sighting of a "life" bird, and the glorious<br/>
display of blue bonnets, and it was a perfect day.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, y'all!<br/>
