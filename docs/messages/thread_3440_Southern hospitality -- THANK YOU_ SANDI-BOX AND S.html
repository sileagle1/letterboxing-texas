                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent the most wonderful day with Sandi Box and Soccer Chick<br>
yesterday.  I had been at a theater conference in Houston, and had not<br>
stray more than five blocks from the convention center.  I hadn't<br>
gotten a real taste of Houston (although the conference was a blast).<br>
<br>
These two fine ladies gave me a wonderful Houston experience, with a<br>
FAB-U-LOUS meal at the Breakfast Klub (you just don't see grits like<br>
that in California), and a wonderful day at Memorial Park.<br>
<br>
You guys may not know this, but I lived in Hartford Connecticut, right<br>
before letterboxing took off in that Fabled Mecca.  I always laugh at<br>
the jokes about how you have to be careful while driving in Hartford.<br>
 if you leave your windows rolled down, letterboxes will throw<br>
themselves into your car!<br>
<br>
Well, Connecticut has nothing on Texas!<br>
<br>
We were just finishing stamping in, when I said, "Hey, what's that?" <br>
Without even trying, I found a letterbox that was peeping out of its<br>
hiding spot.  <br>
<br>
Don't worry -- we snuggled it back into place, and tucked it in very<br>
carefully.<br>
<br>
How many places can one find a letterbox by ACCIDENT!!??!!<br>
<br>
Combine that with a great sighting of a "life" bird, and the glorious<br>
display of blue bonnets, and it was a perfect day.<br>
<br>
Thanks, y'all!<br>
