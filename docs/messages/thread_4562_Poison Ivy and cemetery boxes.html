you’re probably right about the rash. I think it would have hit you sooner if the cemetery had been the source. we’re definitely looking forward to returning to find the box. the background on the statue was wonderful. and we’re glad for more draw to this wonderful little cemetery. we checked on our two boxes there (one we found -”will the circle be unbroken”, the other -”tempus fugit” - I didn’t find, but want to look again before being sure it’s missing.<br/>
<br/>
speaking of cemetery boxes, we’re also looking forward to revisiting oakwood to see your new stamps!<br/>
<br/>
we recently found out that our box in hebrew rest cemetery “the draped urn” was thrown away by the caretaker!  another boxer was searching for it and the caretaker pressed them into explaining what they were doing and then he admitted finding it earlier and assuming it was trash (even there there was a note on it!) and discarded it. uggh!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">On the one hand, manicured cemeteries have fewer places for boxes and they have caretakers.  On the other hand, cemeteries that are a little more "natural" have many places to hide boxes, but they may develop weeds and, in particular, poison ivy.  Maybe we could ask the caretaker at Holy Cross, if they have one, to remove the PI at the Davila grave.  Of course, then he would probably find the box and, assuming it was trash, discard it.  I hope you do go back to Oakwood Cemetery, it is definitely on the manicured side and you have to dodge the mowers.  One of them was keeping an eye on me as I was trying to place one of the boxes but I think I convince him that I was studying tombstones.  Definitely no PI in that place, though.<br/>
