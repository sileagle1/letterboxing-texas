A much different story than the one you wrote was revealed to me by Ghost of IRA Boxer with the understanding it would go no further. Your version is nothing more than slander and I insist that you remove the story from your clues immediately Baby Bear; or should I say Baby Bare, since you talk about bare hides in your version of the story.</div><div><br/></div><div>Letterbox Bozo</div><div>IBA Clown<br/></div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>I am horrified and offended that you would post such an inaccurate and misleading story about me and my ancestor, great-grandfather IRA Box, and associate his good name with that of the outlaw Samuel Bass.  The truth, as everyone knows, is as follows, and may be confirmed by reading up on your Texas history:  IRA Box was a rancher near Round Rock, not Cypress, and was also a respected Texas Ranger.  Sam Bass was a notorious bank robber and a Yankee from Indiana.  He came to Texas and formed a gang with a local thug named Bobby (Baby) Bare.  The gang was widely known as the Bare-Bass Gang.  The Bare-Bass Gang was in the middle of robbing the bank in Round Rock on July 21, 1878 when they were surprised by the local Sheriff and a group of Rangers, including my ancestor, IRA Box.  Sam Bass shot and killed the Sheriff and while attempting to escape, was shot by one of the Rangers.  You guessed it; the Ranger was IRA Box.  July 21, 1878, was Sam Bass's 27th birthday.  Baby Bare, coward that he was, apparently escaped and went into hiding somewhere near Cypress.  It's rumored that some of his descendants still live in the area.</p><div><br/></div><div>The Ghost of IRA Boxer</div></body></html>
