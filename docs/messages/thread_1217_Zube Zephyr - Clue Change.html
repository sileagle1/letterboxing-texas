ride and to give my very first placed letterbox some well<br>

creek by an observant letterboxer and I wanted to get it<br>
up higher to avoid future floods.  I gave it a new camo<br>
box and lashed it to a tree with a bungee cord in the<br>
same area it was before.  Hopefully the cord won't be <br>
visible in the winter when the foliage dies.  I updated<br>
the clues since some landmarks had changed in the 3 years<br>
it has been out there, so reprint them before you go.  The<br>
logbook it still damp but I did not want to replace it yet<br>
since it is fun for others to see who has visited in the past.<br>
By the way, they have added more track and the train ride is<br>
even longer than before and now goes through the woods near my<br>
box.  More people know about the free train rides offered on the <br>
third Saturday of each month (except winter), so it was <br>
crowded.  But it's still a fun way to spend a Saturday afternoon, <br>
especially if you wait until cooler weather.<br>
