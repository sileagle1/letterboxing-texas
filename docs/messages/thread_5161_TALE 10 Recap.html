                    <div class="plaintext-content">At least 50 or 60 crazy, wonderful people showed up at Buescher SP to make this one of the best TALEs yet!  We had people from 6 states (Delaware, Virginia, Alabama, Tennessee, New Mexico and TX) and luckily the park was big enough to handle us.  The rec hall was probably the nicest one so far and I really enjoyed sitting outside when I had a chance to admire the view in the great weather.  The slideshow by Baby Bear was great, and many thanks to Bird Dog for bringing the projector and screen.  The raffle was fun, especially when Mosaic Butterfly "won" the IRA boxers and had to model them.  Thanks to all who donated prizes and bought tickets.  My only disappointment was I did not get to talk with everyone with everything going on, but know that I appreciate all of you coming and helping make it a success.  I'm already planning TALE 11.<br/>
<br/>
I have created 2 albums in the Photos section of the TX Yahoo Group; TX TALEgate and 10th TX LB Event.  I have put some pictures in them but feel free to add any you have.  Also, I have updated the clues to my 20 Questions Game 8 box to make it easier to find, so be sure to reprint them.  Thanks again for making this TALE special!<br/>

Also, special thanks to Mosaic Butterfly for arranging the pre-TALE dinner and for organizing and carving the creative stamps for night boxing.  Baby Bear and I managed to find them after closing up the rec hall and they were great!<br/>
