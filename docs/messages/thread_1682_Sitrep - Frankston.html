because I had hoped to verify that what I found isn't<br/>
true.<br/>
<br/>
Lightning and I went out on a short jaunt last weekend<br/>
to avoid the germs floating around our house from the<br/>
sick folks.  We headed toward Frankston so that we<br/>
could check up on a box on the way and so we could<br/>
find Blue Butterfly's new boxes in the area.<br/>
<br/>
On the way to Frankston, we stopped at The Spring to<br/>
fill up with water (fresh delicious spring water - you<br/>
just can't beat it!), to find a Geocache and to check<br/>
up on Texasluvbug's Water from the Rocks.  We found<br/>
The Spring to be flowing well and we found the cache,<br/>
but we couldn't find the letterbox.  I'm really bummed<br/>
about that...that is a great place to have a box!  I<br/>
had previously found it, so I was fairly sure I could<br/>
remember where it was, but there was no sign of it.  I<br/>
emailed TLB to see if she had had any reports of it<br/>
and I also emailed known finders to double check if I<br/>
was in the right spot to find it.  All signs point to<br/>
it being missing, although TLB hasn't yet written me<br/>
back to say whether she knows it to be there or not. <br/>
SOOOO...if you hope to go for Water from the Rocks,<br/>
realize it may not be there.  It is a good place to<br/>
stop anyway though - just for the water - so if I were<br/>
in the area I would go ahead and stop and drink up,<br/>
and while there look for the box, if for no other<br/>
reason than to prove me wrong!<br/>
<br/>
We went on to Frankston to find another couple of gc's<br/>
and another letterbox.  We were pretty successful on<br/>
all counts, except that the final leg of one multi-gc<br/>
was behind a fence that said "Closed".  I'm still<br/>
trying to figure out whether it is acceptable to a<br/>
gc'er to cross a fence or not.  I decided I wasn't<br/>
real thrilled with the idea, so I let that cache lie. <br/>
We did find a benchmark on that run though, and that<br/>
was pretty cool.  I was impressed to know that there<br/>
are little places all over the country that are<br/>
designated as basically indisputable location markers.<br/>
 I went home and told Fearless Fox about them, and he<br/>
burst my bubble when he said "Oh yeah, we have one of<br/>
those in the front yard - I buried it when I built<br/>
that burm".  Hmph.  He says he only found out you<br/>
aren't supposed to bury those things a year or two<br/>
ago, so I wonder if he feels like going out and<br/>
unburying it now.  Are they like the tags on pillows<br/>
and bedding?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we got on to Frankston and went in search of<br/>
Blue Butterfly's Pine Hill.  We found it - no problem<br/>
- in an odd little part of the country I had never<br/>
come across before.  The only problem we ran into is<br/>
that it is a really friendly neighborhood - folks kept<br/>
stopping and asking us if we were okay and if we<br/>
needed some help.  I kept telling them no, instead of<br/>
telling them "YES.  You can help us by leaving us<br/>
alone and forgetting you ever saw us here!"  I<br/>
sometimes wish we could carry the flashy-thingies that<br/>
they had on Men in Black.<br/>
<br/>
We went back to Frankston and found yet another cache<br/>
and a pretty amazing little museum.  I love little<br/>
hometown museums.  I've seen the one in Frankston for<br/>
years and never been there at the right time (Tues,<br/>
Thurs, Sat).  It was convenient because we also needed<br/>
to go to the bathroom by that time, so we popped in to<br/>
browse a bit and use their facilities before heading<br/>
to find some lunch.  Well, you don't just browse a<br/>
small museum like that - the curator caught us at the<br/>
door and walked us through the whole thing, giving us<br/>
the grand tour.  Two hours after we walked in, we<br/>
still had to go to the bathroom, but we were a LOT<br/>
smarter than we were when we arrived.  It was very<br/>
interesting and because of the research I had done for<br/>
JEN, I had the good fortune of being able to shed a<br/>
little light on one of the "mysteries" she had spread<br/>
through the whole museum - pieces of her ongoing work<br/>
of identification and description that had escaped her<br/>
and previous volunteers.<br/>
<br/>
We finally broke free of the museum and beelined to<br/>
Dairy Queen to grab a bite and use their facilities,<br/>
only to find I had left my billfold at home!  Yikes! <br/>
We had planned on staying out another few hours, but<br/>
our stomachs got the best of us (it WAS 3 p.m. and<br/>
long past lunch time by then), so we headed home with<br/>
plans to try again for Blue Butterfly's other new box<br/>
this weekend.<br/>
