managed to look for a few letterboxes on the way on<br>
Friday, 9/24.  I found Cleo Memorial, Tribute To<br>
England #2 and Road Runner alive & well, but was unable<br>
to find Lone Star Trail at Big Creek Scenic Area.  I<br>
also checked on my Big Creek Bug and Lufkin Lookout<br>
boxes and they are doing well.  I was amazed I was<br>
able to accomplish all this on Friday since Ivan was<br>
supposed to ruin the whole weekend.  I did not hit rain<br>
until almost in Lufkin, then it was gone that night.<br>
I guess even a Tropical Storm can't stop a determined<br>
letterboxer (or maybe I was just lucky).  Thanks for<br>
the boxes and for all the new ones placed while I was gone!<br>
