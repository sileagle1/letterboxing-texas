<div> </div>
<div>Also, went to check on Homer box today at lunch.  I had already carved replacement, and actually placed it, then checked on old one that had been reported missing.   Though the rock had been moved, the microbox was in its place.   It is buried about 3 inches down in the mulch and has camo tape, so hard to see.    Therefore, I now have 2 Homer boxes in the park.   Don't see viable reason for extra placements, thus I will not count it as a new box.   I will add it to the existing clues just in case someone is sitting in the gazebo when you go, thus you can go get the other one!</div>

<div>Thanks!</div>

As we were some of the ones who couldn't find it, I guess that makes <br>
us part of the "doh" crowd.  Hanging out with two Homers is probably <br>
what we deserve.<br>
