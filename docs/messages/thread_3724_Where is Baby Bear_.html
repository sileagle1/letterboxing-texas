&gt; Has anyone seen or heard from Baby Bear today?   He left the house <br/>
&gt; earlier with his computer, and some containers, but I have not been <br/>
&gt; able to reach him since.   I'm concerned, since he kept talking about <br/>
&gt; some clown that keeps following him in a little car, and wearing boxer <br/>

Hello, I sent you a letter last week letting you know I'm a newbie looking for an easy box. I was to sick to go out but my husband and his 17 year old found "The ghost of Telge Park 2007" They said it was in great shape and the said the did their best to put it back EXACTLY the way they found it or better. Thanks for setting up a great box. Those two had a wonderful time.<br/>
