                    <div class="plaintext-content">just wanted to share one more thought about the<br/>
training puppies and kids topic.  i have actually seen<br/>
this book, and even read the whole book myself, called<br/>
The Dog Trainers Guide to Parenting (or some sort of<br/>
title like that, forgive me if I did not get it<br/>
exactly right) and guess what?  it was a great little<br/>
book, with the main emphasis being on small positive<br/>
steps being made to shape behavior towards the<br/>
positive end goal, and with the importance of<br/>
consistency being stressed.  it was funny and well<br/>
done, a book i'd actually recommend, and not at all<br/>
condescending or mean towards kids or parents. <br/>
Rather, the goal was helping people have another set<br/>
of tools they might find useful for helping their kids<br/>
turn out to be lovely people.  really, there are a lot<br/>
of similarities.  in fact, we used to call my son "the<br/>
puppy" because he was so much like having a puppy,<br/>
crawling on all fours and biting our ankles! <br/>
(probably why he has turned out the way he has!) : )<br/>
