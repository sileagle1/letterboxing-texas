                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from an interesting trip south to Brazoria County.  I originally intended to only go to the San Bernard NWR to see the migrating birds, but while researching the area I found many historical sites to visit, too.  I saw the original grave site of Stephen F. Austin before he was moved to Austin, a replica of the first Capitol of TX, and a large statue of Stephen F. Austin.  I would have also seen the largest live oak tree in TX, but the rangers were not there to let me in.<br/>
<br/>
As extra incentive for you to visit I placed 3 boxes while down there.  Try to go soon before it gets too hot and the bugs come out.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you had a fine time.  We went down that way in December and saw the first capitol and the statue of Stephen F. Austin, but didn't see the tree or the gravesite, so I guess we'll have to go back.  We did make it over to Blessing and placed a box there, which hasn't been found, so hopefully your boxes will encourage more visitation to the area.  Thanks.<br/>
