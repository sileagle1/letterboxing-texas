                    <div class="plaintext-content">The weather was supposed to be perfect for 'boxing this weekend so I decided to execute a plan I had hatched a while ago - hit up five Travis County parks in one day to save on gas and pay only one entrance fee.  A quick note to the mailing list brought out Bell Motel to join me for the day. We met at an HEB parking lot nearby and headed out for the first park - Hippy Hollow. The idea was to get there before too many naked people started to show up and question our motives for being there. We succeeded in getting there before the gate was even open yet so we drove on by and stopped at Bob Winz Park at Windy Point to look for Dawn's Glory's "In Love". No-go! We found the remains for an Easter Egg hunt so we suspect it has recently been muggled. Back to Hippy Hollow and the gate is still locked so we parked nearby and walked in and had the place to ourselves. (Apparently, it does not open until 9:00am) Found four out of five boxes, several with very nicely carved pin-up variety images.<br/>
<br/>
Next we headed west for Pace Bend Park. Here we located four of the five boxes in the Shoulda', Coulda', Woulda' seris with #4 being found empty. After that we placed a new box in a lonely part of the park then headed out for lunch.<br/>
<br/>
Back on the road, we headed off to Reimer Ranch Park in far southwest Travis County for some hiking and exploration.  We didn't find the perfect spot for a box but I will be back.  This park is a great place to explore.  There is a very nice streambed hike that leads down past some rock-climbing walls, similar to Barton Creek in Austin, and then there is hiking along three miles of Pedernales Riverfront and miles of mountain bike trails.  There is also several places where you can view the nearby movie set for "The Alamo".<br/>
<br/>
The final stop for the day was Hamilton Pool. There was two boxes already here and we placed a third and got back to the Jeep just before closing time.<br/>
<br/>
5 parks, about 10 miles of hiking, 10 of 13 boxes found, and 2 new boxes placed and the weather was just as advertised - perfect for springtime 'boxing in Texas.<br/>

    To maximize use of the park pass we concentrated on the county park
    boxes this time. Bell Motel showed me her image of Warlock.  I
    definitely want to come back and find that for myself.<br/>
