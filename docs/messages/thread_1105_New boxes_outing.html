-(including her very first!) at a wonderful park south of downtown <br/>
Houston, ER and Ann Taylor Park.<br/>
<br/>
However, the fact that it has rained every day for the last three <br/>
weeks was very evident in the mosquito population.  There were quite <br/>
literally clouds of them following us.  So, my boxes got planted <br/>
closer to the entrance than I would have liked.  I envisioned a <br/>
leisurely stroll through the park investigating all the <br/>
possibilities.  NO!!!  This was a "that looks like a good spot, now <br/>
let's get out of here" operation.<br/>
<br/>
I do think that you will love this park.  Everytime we've been, <br/>
we've seen different species of birds and butterflies--it is a <br/>
lovely patch of wilderness with a rich history.  It is a perfect <br/>
letterboxing spot (shady and pretty and terrific if you're a birder) <br/>
that I was waiting for some worthy boxes to hide.  Just bathe in <br/>
DEET first or wait 'til the skeeter population drops off a little!  <br/>
I may plant another box out there in the Time Traveler Series, but <br/>
it won't be until fall.<br/>
<br/>
My bug repellant did work, but last I saw, Runs For Chocolate was <br/>
pretty itchy.  <br/>

<div>Runs for Chocolate may change her trail name to Runs FROM mosquitoes!  
I counted fourteen bites on my back alone from yesterday's adventure- and I 
sprayed with Off!  I wonder if Walmart sells Benadryl in bulk?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dewberry forgot to mention the beautiful display of arachnids in the 
park!  Just make sure to look up when you are walking along the 
trails!  If you like Banana spiders, this park is just for you.</div>
