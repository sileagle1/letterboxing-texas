<div>I was just testing it out to see what was going on, and while I'm not having problems getting messages to load from the group homepage, I'm noticing that messages aren't posting as quickly as they should.  It appears to be a hurry up and wait deal - I had two messages post fast and the latest one has taken five minutes or so - so far.

<div>We may be about to see another of yahoo's crazy bottlenecks happening.  Anyone happen to know if any new viruses have come out in the last day or two?  That's usually what triggers Yahoo to screen mail better.</div>

<div>Is anybody (other than me) having trouble accessing messages through the yahoo group.  I'm able to get messages through the Daily Digest and able to view the Home Page of the group as well as the Message Listing Page, but when I click on a message to read it...it is loading at the "speed of Christmas", as my kiddos like to complain!
