<div>Well, we've been "out-gryphoned" once again! Congratulations, oh Sly One! By the way, I was having lunch on Wednesday at the El Chicos in McKinney, and the Coryell County Sheriff was eating at the table beside mine. I thought of interrogating him as to what interesting character he may be aware of in his county who drove a crystal Cruiser. However, I was intimidated by the size of his gun (as well as his girth), so I decided to allow him to eat in peace. Very tempting however.</div>
