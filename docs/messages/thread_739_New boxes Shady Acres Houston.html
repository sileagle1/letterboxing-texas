Hi All,<br/>
<br/>
We've been confined to the house a bit since Asterix's recovery is <br/>
going sloooowly.  We did get out to place two new boxes, Jasmine and <br/>
Penguin, in the Shady Acres area of Houston as an outing this <br/>
morning.  Clues are on LBNA already, and I'll put links on Atlas <br/>
Quest in a bit.<br/>
<br/>
The park that Jasmine is in is really neat and could certainly hold <br/>
another box or two.  We've left prizes for the first 9 finders, <br/>
which we might replenish if we get around to it (plus our usual type <br/>
of first finder prize).  If whoever finds Penguin first would do us <br/>
a favor and remove the outer plastic bag, we'd appreciate it; the <br/>
bag's just there to hold the microbox and the ff prize (something <br/>
different, would like feedback) together.  <br/>
<br/>
Am reading the messages and am jealous that we didn't have time to <br/>
try the Kick A beans and the Jalapenos.  Although the boys don't <br/>
like spice yet (we keep trying to acclimate them), Asterix &amp; I think <br/>
the hotter the better.  Stuffed Jalapenos are a particular favorite.<br/>
<br/>
Okay, we've got several more boxes ready to hide.  Depending on how <br/>
the boys' moods and Asterix knee are, we're hoping to get them <br/>
planted this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoying the great Houston weather,<br/>
<br/>
Dewberry.<br/>
