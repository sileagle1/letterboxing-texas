I have the TTC.  I have had some things come up in recent months that put a twist on how I thought things would play out.  I've not been able to box or do much else other than work and try to maintain some sanity.  I will pass the circus along this week before TALE.  I know I am remiss in keeping it this long.  I know it is an email of excuses.  I sincerely apologize.<br>
