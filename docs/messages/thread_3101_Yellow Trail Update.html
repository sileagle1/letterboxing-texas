<br/>
Preparations are in full-swing.  We have about 50 people coming, lots<br/>
of new faces to look forward to meeting.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be in the back section of the picnic loop.  When you turn off of<br/>
Memorial onto Picnic Ln, go left and through the gates (the gates off<br/>
Memorial where the sign says Memorial Park Picnic Area are never<br/>
actually open).  This puts you on a one way loop.  Towards the back<br/>
you should see some restrooms.  We'll be in one of those picnic niches<br/>
(look for the green balloons) back there.  Can't say exactly which<br/>
one.  If you miss us, circle back around.<br/>
<br/>
If you're planting a box that day, bring a copy of your clue to put on<br/>
the bulletin board for others to copy down.<br/>
<br/>
The tables are pretty ick, so I'd definitely bring a picnic blanket or<br/>
a table cloth, &amp; some portable chairs.  Hoppers has offered to bring<br/>
home made rootbeer, but other than that it's a BYO-picnic event.<br/>
<br/>
There's lots of room for the kids to play, and we'll have Jack<br/>
Pumpkinhead's Pumpkin Patch so that they can letterbox to their<br/>
hearts' content.<br/>
<br/>
Afterwards, anyone who wishes can congregate at Texadelphia for food &amp;<br/>
refreshment.<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten a little carried away with the carving of OZ characters,<br/>
so there'll be plenty of boxes.  Help me!  I need to stop!<br/>
<br/>
Anything else?<br/>
