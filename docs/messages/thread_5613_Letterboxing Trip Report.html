                    <html><body><p class="MsoNormal">A few months ago I read an article in a local magazine about
the Malakoff Man and decided I needed to go see it, and of course place a
letterbox nearby.<span style="">  </span>Since the museum where
it is located is kind of far, I planned a camping/letterbox trip like I used to
do in the old days.<span style="">  </span>I would place
several boxes along the way and find as many as I could in the process</p><p class="MsoNormal">.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">My first stop was W.G. Jones SF where I found a series of
boxes and placed one, then it was on to Fort Boggy SP.<span style="">  </span>I haven’t been to this park in over 6 years
and I couldn’t believe the changes! It used to only be open on weekends and had
a run-down look to it, but now it is open all week with several campsites and
even a few new cabins. The downside to this is that most of the landmarks in
letterbox clues no longer exist, so I was unable to find the boxes I looked
for. It was still a worthwhile visit to a nice park.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">After camping at Fairfield SP it was on to the town of
Malakoff where the mysterious stone was discovered. I placed my box dedicated
to it at the town cemetery, then headed to Corsicana to see it at the Pearce
Museum. There are actually 3 stone heads that were discovered and it was
fascinating to see them. There are other interesting things to see, like
arrowheads and Civil War artifacts. The section on Texas involvement during
that war was full of information I had never heard before and I ended up
spending way more time there than planned, but it was worth it.</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">While in Corsicana I placed a box and found a Boots Tex
Governor box that was over 10 years old. I am ashamed that it has taken me that
long to find some of his boxes and I vow to do better in the future, especially
since some are bound to go missing eventually. At first I thought that is what
happened to this one since all I initially saw in the tree hollow was empty beer
bottles, but I kept digging and found it underneath. Awesome, as usual. I also
found a box by Ghost of IRA Boxer about a one-legged tightrope performer whose
grave just says Rope Walker 1884. His identity has been a mystery for years and
I was curious to find out more. By a strange coincidence, when I got home the current
issue of my local magazine had an article about the Rope Walker that cleared up
some of the mystery. How cool is that!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The rest of the trip was spent placing more boxes, several
of which are part of my TX Baseball series, and finding a few more in the rain
and eventually in the dark. It was fun to letterbox like I used to and I highly
recommend y’all do the same while the weather is cool. Looking forward to
seeing everyone at TALE 15 next month!</p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.texascooppower.com/texas-stories/travel/saving-face-in-malakoff" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.texascooppower.com/texas-stories/travel/saving-face-in-malakoff</a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="http://www.pearcemuseum.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.pearcemuseum.com/</a></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a href="https://www.texascooppower.com/texas-stories/history/the-rope-walker-of-corsicana" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.texascooppower.com/texas-stories/history/the-rope-walker-of-corsicana</a><br/></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/></p>
