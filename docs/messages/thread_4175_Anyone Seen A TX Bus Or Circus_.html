Hello to all! I know you haven't heard from me in quite a while....that's because I was abducted by aliens! Yes, I know thats hard to believe but why else would you not have heard from me for so long!!!! As luck would have it, I have extolled the virtues of letterboxing with out far out friends and they were so kind as to send me back to earth right where they dropped off their friend. They told me they would have a bus full of rowdy Texans that I could catch a ride with. So here I am back in Cowtown!  They said we would be staying here for a night or two and then heading out. I will let you know where we end up.   Monarch B<br/>

They said something about it being too hot to go very far and just wanted to hang out by the "falls". Last I saw of them, they had headed south on Bryant Irvin road off of I20. They took a "Quick Trip" in to get a drink before heading down that ol' Oak Bend. They ran smack down to Oakmont at which point they hung a right around a curve and another right on Bellaire. Now they wanted to park in the parking lot but discovered when they got there, it was all closed up due to construction! So they carried on down the road until they came to the "River Bend". Thinking this sounded nice and cool, they turned left here and parked by the light pole. After hauling everyone out of the bus, they proceeded down the sidewalk past the 6 wooden fingers. You will know they were there cuz apparently some of them decided to deposit
 their gum here! They followed the trail past the birdhouse on the right until they came to a huge green box on their left. Just past this green box is a trail off to your right. They followed this down to the sound of the falls. At the bottom they went right for about 20 paces. To the right was a huge concrete rock and that is where they set up camp. If you want to catch them before they float on down the falls, you had better hurry! I'm sure they won't stay there for long. It was a real pleasure hosting them, but its time for them to move on !</div>
