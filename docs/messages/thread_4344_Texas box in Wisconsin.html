<br/>
Martini Man &amp; I hosted an event called "Haunted Harvest" in October 2005 and Dewberry kindly sent us a box from Texas called "The Trees are Watching..." for the event.  Our friends Merlin &amp; Ardea helped plant some of the boxes for the event, including the one from Dewberry.  They had some reports the box was missing, and when they checked on it earlier this year, it was in fact gone from its spot.  They therefore removed it from the LBNA database.  <br/>
<br/>
As is the case with many event locations, the park is now a popular destination for many newer letterboxers since there are many boxes there.  Two young women that started letterboxing this year posted this report a few days ago:<br/>
<br/>
".....  Anyway, we have a good story about todays letterboxing adventure we wanted to share. LK and I went to Menomonee Park in Menomonee Falls, WI to grab a small handful of boxes that were planted for the Harvest Gathering of 2005. The first box we found, however, was located in a rather high opening of a tree and was FROZEN SOLID into that hole! Luckily, we had thought to bring my car ice scraper along (for easier digging, as we have no trowel)... but we were still presented with the problem of how either of us would get up there to dig! <br/>
<br/>
After finding that having LK stand on my shoulders would not work long enough to be effective, we decided we needed to find some OTHER way to get up there. As usual, the Universe provided us with a solution, and we managed to find some amazing large and sturdy branches that I was able to use like a little ladder to climb up and get that sucker OUT! (I'll see if I can figure out how to post the pictue LK took of me getting that box!)<br/>
<br/>
Funny thing was, it wasn't even the box we were looking for! This box wasn't even on our list... BONUS! Still, we had to find the other one (which was also in a tree). Turns out, it was ALSO frozen! So I headed back to grab our "ladder" and chopped away a second time. Didn't expect to work up such a sweat on a 15 degree day!<br/>
<br/>
Then, we nearly left the park without finding the last box on our list because it was getting late for the Packer game! But we only had one more parking lot to check so it HAD to work! (unless we missed it along the way) Fortunately, it was there! So we left the park only 30 minutes late, with 5 new stamps and a great sense of accomplishment! <br/>

Follow-up to the story:  Another determined local boxer went to the park a day or two later to also try to find this box after reading the post.  She couldn't find any clues on-line, so went to the second box's location, followed the footprints in the snow back to the Dewberry box and was successful.  Our friends who planted it now plan to go back to check to see where it ended up (they had originally planted it at the BASE of the tree) then update and repost clues.<br/>

Great to know that this box is still surviving up here in cold &amp; snowy Wisconsin!<br/>

Puddle Splasher - a Cowboys fan who's also always been a Packer fan... except when they play the Cowboys. By the way, and nothing to do with letterboxing, at last week's game against Philly, we were in a suite owned by the Cowboys organization and Mrs. McNabb (the Philly QB's mom) was sitting next to my husband. What a nice lady - even in the event of her son's team getting beat up on. She told my husband they had a plan... but when the plan goes bad, it just goes bad; but they'll be back next Saturday with a new plan! (I'm sure they will!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; day or two later to also try to find this box after reading the post. She<br/>
&gt; &gt; couldn't find any clues on-line, so went to the second box's location,<br/>
&gt; &gt; followed the footprints in the snow back to the Dewberry box and was<br/>
&gt; &gt; successful. Our friends who planted it now plan to go back to check to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; where it ended up (they had originally planted it at the BASE of the tree)<br/>
&gt; &gt; then update and repost clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Great to know that this box is still surviving up here in cold &amp; snowy<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wisconsin!<br/>
