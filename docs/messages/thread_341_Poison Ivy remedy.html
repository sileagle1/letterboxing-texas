I've never had the stuff (knock on wood), but friends<br/>

something... :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The poison ivy leaves an oily toxin that will start absorbing into <br/>
the skin in a few minutes.  Anything that dissolves oil will stop <br/>
the process, if treated quickly enough.  All soaps and detergents <br/>
dissolve oil, as well as alcohol.  I was told to carry a bottle of <br/>
hand sanitizer while hiking to rub on suspected areas of contact <br/>
because it has a high alcohol content. Then wash well w/ soap and <br/>
water asap.  <br/>
<br/>
A small percentage of people are not allergic to it, but they can <br/>
develop sensitivity over time so be careful!!  My husband is not <br/>
allergic, so he is always our "trailblazer" and spotter when out <br/>
letterboxing in ivy areas ;)<br/>
<br/>
happy trails,<br/>
