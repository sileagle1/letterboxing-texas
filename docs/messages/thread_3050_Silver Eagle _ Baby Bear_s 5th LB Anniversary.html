                    <html><body><div>Considering that the first several boxes we found were one of y'all's, I think it's a safe bet to say that we probably wouldn't STILL be letterboxing if it weren't for the two of you - so I thank you from the bottom of my heart!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking at the counts, it looks like there were maybe 10 boxes in the state when y'all got started?  And over the five years since there have been 1,983 listings in Texas (on LBNA, including archived boxes), and of those, around 330 belong to either you or Baby Bear.  That puts your contribution to about 16% of all Texas boxes.  WOW!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - that kind of growth makes predicting the future pretty difficult, but I DO have to wonder where letterboxing will be on y'all's 10th anniversary!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again,</div>

<div>I don't usually chime in on this list but we just want to send our congratulations to both Silver Eagle and Baby Bear. Without you, there wouldn't be many boxes in TX! </div>

<div>Sue &amp; I finally snagged our first Silver Eagle box in VT last weekend. A real treat from a real letterboxing pioneer! Congrats to you both!</div>

have made it worth staying with.  Thank you for all your <br/>
