                    <html><body><p>When we were at the Brazos Bend event, Bloomin' Grandma Jo reported that they couldn't  find my box at the Scottsville Cemetery near Marshall.  Within a few days, another "attempt" was reported, making three in a row, so we made up an excuse to make a trip to replace the box.  It is my favorite, after all, of all the boxes I have placed.  We carved a new stamp (well, Boots did) and we made a log book, then today we made the trip to Scottsville.  The original clue referenced "the tallest pine tree on the fence line".  When we went into the bushes, we found only cedar trees, but after some looking around, we found a big pine stump, cut nearly flush with the ground.  Looking around the cedar tree closest to the stump (not even the tallest cedar), we found the box, safe, dry and intact.  We don't know why the pine tree was cut, but we think that whoever cut it down found the box and moved it to the cedar.  It was properly covered with twigs and leaves but no sign of the rock nest that we made for it. We can certainly understand why the original clues would be misleading.  They would lead to the tallest cedar tree, which was not even close to the location of the box.  We put the original stamp and logbook in a new box and left the new logbook in there as well.</p><div><br/></div><div>Lone Star Quilter</div></body></html>
