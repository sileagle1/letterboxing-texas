&gt; So - just as we have letterboxing backpacks, we could buy a Miata <br/>
and also<br/>
&gt; have a letterboxing car.  And if deep rural letterboxing were <br/>
planned, it<br/>
&gt; might even be small enough to be loaded in the back of a full-sized <br/>
4 wheel<br/>
&gt; drive truck for deployment at the box site???<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Let me just mention that the thing about it being handy for drive-<br/>
bys is not<br/>
&gt; real definitive - not too long ago Lightning and I were able to <br/>
reach out of<br/>
&gt; the car and pick up a drive-by box (one of Bambi's boxes here in<br/>
&gt; Jacksonville) in my Buick Regal by driving it between two trees.  <br/>
Of course,<br/>
&gt; my Buick Regal doesn't have many of the other qualities you <br/>
describe, so<br/>
&gt; it's only claim to letterboxing usefulness is that in that <br/>
particular<br/>
&gt; instance, I could pick up a drive-by from the car, and that I don't<br/>
&gt; particularly care if it gets scratched up because the paint job is <br/>
already<br/>
&gt; shot.<br/>

<div>Yep, very good on curvy mountain roads (love that stick shift!).  And 
at least the Miata didn't wind up upside down with the two of us under it, as 
did the raft in the middle of the Royal Gorge.... Who's still dizzy?  Me 
too!  </div>
