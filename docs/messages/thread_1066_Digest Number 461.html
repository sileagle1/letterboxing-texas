<div>Oh NO!  My sister and I found it just a couple of weeks ago - we were 
FF, and were so excited!  The location was excellent and it was well 
hidden, so I agree, it couldn't have been accidentally found.  And we were 
so careful to replace it exactly as we found it, only a few ducks and fish were 
watching.  That was a beautiful stamp, too!  So sorry to hear it's 
gone.  -- Viewfinder and Puddle-Splasher,
