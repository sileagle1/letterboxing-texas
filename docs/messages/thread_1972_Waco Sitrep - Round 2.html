                    <html><body><p>For the second time in less than a month, I found myself in the Waco area!</p>
<p>I had wanted to plant a box while I was there the first time, but I didn't get to go quite as deep into that area as I had hoped, so I had to return to plant my box, which I really wanted to get planted by mid-July or so.  This time, my most excellent sidekick Lightning rode shotgun, and we had a great time, as we always do together!
</p>
<p>Fearless Fox had to work Monday and Tuesday, and the two days earlier had been taken up with a funeral and other similar responsibilities, so I was sitting around feeling a bit sorry for myself and thinking I was going to have to resort to cleaning house if I couldn't figure out how to break free.  Finally, I decided Lightning and I couldn't waste the two days with cleaning solutions and I DID, after all, have that box that needed planting, so we packed up and headed to Waco.  
</p>
<p>I wanted to take him to the Texas Ranger museum, but we got to town a shade too late for that, so we went and found Silver Eagle's box again (I had found it on my first visit). We replaced the very full logbook for him (it was so full that Lightning couldn't have signed into it if he had wanted to!) and Lightning stamped in and we moved on.  We went on to find Baby Bear's nearby box so Lighting could sign in there too, but there were a bunch of kids hanging out very close to it.  We tried hanging out too, but the kids outhung us.  We headed on after awhile...
</p>
<p>Now, as any self-respecting kid would do, Lightning had spotted the pool at the hotel when we checked in and he wasn't going to forget about it easily, so he wasn't going to have any further part of letterboxing Monday evening until he had a chance to swim.  He hit the pool and I sat poolside and carved.  What a nice evening it was for a July evening!  
</p>
<p>We didn't get up quite as early as I had hoped, but we did make it out of the hotel by 7:30 a.m. and were hitting Walmart a few minutes later - as we were checking into the hotel the evening before, I realized I had forgotten my hiking shoes and all I had were sandals, so right off the bat I had to buy shoes.  I even contemplated boxing in my sandals, but given my snake experience of the last trip to the area, I decided I needed to break down and at least get some closed toe shoes, even if not top notch.  It was a good choice, I later realized.
</p>
<p>The first box we found was Wild and Crazy Guy! by Gingercat.  I would've never found that location if we hadn't been looking for the box, but it was so beautiful there that we stuck around longer than necessary just enjoying the area.  
</p>
<p>Turned out to be perfect timing because as we got back to town about the time the Texas Ranger Museum was opening and we took the time to visit there and watch the film.  Neat museum.  Worth the delay.  I know a lot more about Texas Rangers than I used to!
</p>
<p>We had already found all but two of the Waco boxes, and I decided that given our short timeframe and the fact that we were on a mission, we needed to pass those by again and head on to Temple.  </p>
<p>We ventured out to Lions Park to pick up the Duo placed there by tx dragonfly.  By the time we got there, it was noon-ish and pretty warm already, but summer-hardened as we like to think we have become, we bailed out of the car and set about our mission, not taking water with us because it was supposed to be a fairly short run - a half mile or so - and remember, we like to believe we have become summer-hardened.  
</p>
<div>Now let me preface this next bit by saying that we occasionally come across clues that we have a hard time with - they don't seem to be a problem with anyone else in the world - it is apparently just us, or the day, or the heat, or it may have been my new shoes, or something - any old thing might trigger it.   But yes, we struggled with the clues and started getting tickled at ourselves over not being able to get the simplest thing straight.  We finally thought we were somewhat on track, and were talking quietly between ourselves, when an elderly man offered us a bit of help.  He had overheard us (with 70+ year old ears from 50-75 feet away) say something about gravel path, so he very helpfully pointed out to us that we were a little distance from the gravel path.  We looked where he was pointing, and sure enough the gravel path was wayyyy over there - down a long hill.  We thanked him and turned and trekked down the lonnnngggg hill.  As we were approaching the gravel path, I kept thinking to myself that we weren't seeing the other landmarks in the clues.  But we definitely were at the gravel path!  We walked along the path for a distance without ever seeing any of those landmarks, and I kept thinking the clues made it sound like the landmarks shouldn't be terribly far down the path.  I conferred with Lightning and he agreed - we had allowed ourselves to be hoodwinked, drawn off course by that fellow who, kind-hearted as he was, really didn't have a clue what we were doing.  So up we went - up the lllllooooonnnnnnnngggggg hill.  It wasn't until the return trip that we really realized it was pretty steep too!  We didn't want to come upon the man again and have to explain to him why we weren't on the gravel trail, and the only other option seemed to me that we would have to bonk him on the head with the clue sheets, so rather than walk right by him, we recon'd around the lllllllloooooooonnnnnnnnnggggggggg hill and came up the back side, to the man's back.  Sure enough, right where we had been headed to the first time was a gravel trail, hidden from view initially by the trees.  We took a minute and sat down on a table and wrung the sweat out of our shirts and talked about the old man's incredible hearing while we watched him from behind to make sure he didn't turn and spot us.  We came to the conclusion that he is actually an elaborate stumbling block placed there by tx dragonfly to make finding the box more "interesting".   We got up and worked our way toward the first of the duo, only to come upon a father/daughter pair who were looking for bugs - by turning over every rock with a garden spade to look under them!  And wouldn't you know it, they were working the area where the box HAD to be!  Lightning and I made a nuisance of ourselves by taking up plant study right in their way, and right beside where we felt the box must be.  Rather than disturb us, they went around us, leaving the rocks in our immediate area unturned.  After they had moved on, we turned a few rocks ourselves and found the box!  It was a sweet victory to get THAT box!  We went on and found the second box without any further adventure, and we were two very happy letterboxers when we got back to our car and WATER!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was moving on into early afternoon and the one thing we HAD to do that day was as yet undone.  We proceeded on, ignoring other boxes we would've liked to have found, and got to our goal by mid-afternoon and then had to set about finding a location for our box.  That in itself was quite an adventure, and at one point, we found ourselves surrounded by SWAT officers with heavy firepower.  But that's a story for another day....
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Through this whole day, we had another deadline in our heads as well - we had to be back in Jacksonville by 8:30 to make the boat so we could see the fireworks display.  We managed to pull out of Waco at 6 p.m. with rain in hot pursuit, and pulled up to the dock at 8:20 precisely, just in time to jump aboard.  It was nice to be home and to celebrate the 4th in our family's tradition - on a boat in the middle of Lake Jacksonville with fireworks going off all around!
