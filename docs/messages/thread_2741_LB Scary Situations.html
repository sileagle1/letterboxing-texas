serious (knock on wood).  I've actually had more happen before I <br/>
started letterboxing, as I'm sure many of you have, too.  Maybe that <br/>

<br/>
Once I was bitten by a scorpion while putting a box BACK.  I'm always <br/>
careful when retrieving a box, using a stick to poke around first, <br/>
but I never worried too much about putting it back.  Now I do.<br/>
<br/>
Another time I had to retrieve a box from within a hollow tree.  It <br/>
was wedged about arm's length up inside and I could not dislodge it <br/>
with a stick, so I reached up and grabbed it.  When it finally came <br/>
down, there was a big snake coiled around the box and he was mad!  <br/>
Not sure if he was poisonous, but it still made me almost shed my <br/>
skin.  Stamping into that box and putting it back was the hardest <br/>
thing I have ever done letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Well, maybe not the hardest.  Once in Louisiana I had to cross a <br/>
spillway that had NO Trespassing signs all around it and could open <br/>
up automatically if the bayou got too high.  The clues said it was ok <br/>
to cross, but I really had to suck it up to make that crossing, <br/>
especially since the water was really flowing.  And the whole time <br/>
I'm on the other side I kept worrying it would open and strand me <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I've had way more occasion to feel nervous about being <br/>
thought of as the predator than being afraid of one.  I usually <br/>
letterbox alone, and whenever I go to a park with Mothers and kids, <br/>
I'm always afraid they will think I am some pervert out to get them.  <br/>
I mean, what would you think if you saw some strange guy lurking <br/>
around in the bushes!  I always half expect the cops to come if I <br/>
take too long stamping in.  And it is probably even worse when I box <br/>
with Baby Bear.  Just think how bad it looks when people see two guys <br/>
emerge from the bushes with smiles on their faces!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are dangerous situations in nature other than the critters <br/>
that we should all be aware of, especially when we're letterboxing <br/>
with kids.  There are rocks and creeks and lakes and drop-offs.  We <br/>
just got back from McKinney Falls SP and it has a trail that runs <br/>
along a cliff that has a pretty good drop down to the creek, and <br/>
even little trails that loop right out to the edge for an overlook <br/>
with no rails or warning signs (which kids wouldn't read anyway).  <br/>
Another is the trail at Blue Hole Park in Georgetown which also runs <br/>
along the edge of a sheer drop-off down to the river.  If you <br/>
haven't been to a place before, an adult should probably take the <br/>
lead and watch out for natural hazards.  Nature is beautiful, but <br/>
not always kid-friendly.<br/>

Yeah, that's the LB right there . . . surrounded by hundreds of Daddy<br/>
long-legs!<br/>
<br/>
Okay, so it was less "Scary" and more "creepy."  Either way, I yelled<br/>
to my partner, who was waiting on the trail with my baby (who always<br/>
goes LBing with us), "YOU'VE GOT TO SEE THIS!"  She came walking over<br/>
with my baby in her arms and was really surprised.  "I've never seen<br/>
such big daddy long-legs."  I have, but I've never seen so many in one<br/>
place!  <br/>
<br/>
You should have seen me pulling that box out with two sticks while my<br/>
LB partner was swiping spiders off my legs and back.  After we got the<br/>
box out and walked to a place where we could stamp I shook off like a<br/>
dog.  Man, that gave me the heebie jeebies!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Once I was bitten by a scorpion while putting a box BACK. I'm <br/>
always<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; careful when retrieving a box, using a stick to poke around <br/>
first,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but I never worried too much about putting it back. Now I do.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Another time I had to retrieve a box from within a hollow <br/>
tree. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was wedged about arm's length up inside and I could not <br/>
dislodge it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a stick, so I reached up and grabbed it. When it finally <br/>
came<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; down, there was a big snake coiled around the box and he was <br/>
mad!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if he was poisonous, but it still made me almost shed <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; skin. Stamping into that box and putting it back was the <br/>
hardest<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing I have ever done letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, maybe not the hardest. Once in Louisiana I had to cross a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spillway that had NO Trespassing signs all around it and could <br/>
open<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; up automatically if the bayou got too high. The clues said it <br/>
was ok<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to cross, but I really had to suck it up to make that crossing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; especially since the water was really flowing. And the whole <br/>
time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm on the other side I kept worrying it would open and strand <br/>
me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, I've had way more occasion to feel nervous about <br/>
being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thought of as the predator than being afraid of one. I usually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;! letterb ox alone, and whenever I go to a park with Mothers <br/>
and kids,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm always afraid they will think I am some pervert out to get <br/>
them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I mean, what would you think if you saw some strange guy <br/>
lurking<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around in the bushes! I always half expect the cops to come if <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; take too long stamping in. And it is probably even worse when <br/>
I box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with Baby Bear. Just think how bad it looks when people see <br/>
two guys<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; emerge from the bushes with smiles on their faces!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your story got me to thinking...has anyone ever come into a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; circumstance while out boxing that they would be scared or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; frightened? There have been several times when I have been out <br/>
boxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in some area and thought this could be a scary situation if <br/>
the wrong<br/>
