The Great Wuga Wuga and I were headed up to Denver this past weekend and we stopped at a brand new Gryzzled Gryphon/ Frost Maiden letterbox in Raton, NM. I was sure we'd be first finders so was dismayed to see someone had beat us to it! And who was it but the ghost of Ira Boxer! There was the tell tale sign of his - the boxer shorts with hearts - along with a veiled threat to GG - he said he had just missed him, but he was hot on his trail! I didn't see him sign in to any other CO boxes so I think he might have gone back to TX. I'd keep an eye out and tell Frost Maiden to watch your back, GG....<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey, maybe that wasn't me!  I think I heard that you were going to Montana or someplace like that, someplace a little more bear friendly than Texas, so I suspect you might have had something to do with it, since you probably had to go right through Raton Pass to get there.  I'm wondering what those Texas Longhorns were doing way up there?  Cypress may not be as safe as you think, little bear!  Besides, I was born in Texas and I died in Texas, so I think that makes me a Texan, or at least an Ex Texan.<br/>

I was picturing a bunch of football players in orange jerseys running through the mountains.  I guess I'll have to find the box myself to find out, unless I can convince IRA Boxer to let me look at his logbook.  Fat chance of that happening.<br/>
