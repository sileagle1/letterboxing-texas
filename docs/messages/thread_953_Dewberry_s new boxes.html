<div>Did you all tour the turtle facility?  Isn't it 
great?  We thought about putting a box there last summer, but as you say, 
it is very un-box-friendly.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also placed a new box in Galveston today, and ours is 
a tribute as well, but not to anything as majestic as a sea turtle.  Our is 
a tribute to all things silly, and like you, I will post clues tomorrow.  
I'm exhausted from carrying the toddlers back and forth across the most enormous 
mounds of seaweed I have ever seen.  There must have been at least 8 feet 
of it between the sand and the ocean all the way up and down the beach.  
Good crab catching, though.</div>
