The fire was nice and warm, the people friendly,and the food was<br>
great!! Especially those Oatmeal Raisin Cookies by Puddle Splasher!<br>
It was nice to meet new people and hear their stories of how they<br>
started LB'ng. The Trivia game was enjoyed by all, and we went away<br>
with more knowledge about this intersted hobby of ours.<br>
I did learn some other interesting facts:<br>
<br>
1. If you are 6'9" tall you CAN turn over in a canoe!<br>
2. One of our fellow boxers has a "Groupie" following.<br>
3. If you give two boys a ball they will find a lot of ways to <br>
entertain themselves.<br>
<br>
4. Always check for bees/wasp/jellowjackets when retrieving a box by<br>
Baby Bear.<br>
<br>
We also had a nice day at WAshington on the Brazos. It's not very<br>
often you go boxing and get to hang out with others who are<br>
searching for what you are. Ginder Cat and Skye Bird made the day<br>
even better!<br>
