                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have listed a new WOM box called Y U on AtlasQuest for logging<br>
purposed.  This is a letterbox with a twist:<br>
<br>
I will distribute the clues to one local boxer (already chosen), who<br>
after finding the box, will then be able to give them to ONE and ONLY<br>
ONE letterboxer (or a group that lbs together).  The new recipient<br>
will be able to pass the clues along to ONE new person and so on.  <br>
<br>
When the clues are passed, you must tell the person Y U and you should<br>
email me to tell me who you've given the clues too.  I'll keep track<br>
of who has gotten the clues and where they are at any given time.<br>
<br>
If the clues come back to you a second time, you can pass them on to<br>
someone else without refinding the box.  If you don't know who to send<br>
them to, you can pass them back to me and I will pass them on to someone.<br>
<br>
You are also free to rewrite the clues if you so desire.  Right now<br>
they are straight-forward, but you may change one word or all of them.<br>
 The box should stay put. <br>
<br>
Kind of like telephone, but with letterbox clues.<br>
