                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, it's late and I'm tired from the road.  Not sure how well the<br>
brain is working, so it's a perfect time to do a new project!  I have<br>
created a database for the Great Texas Box Exchange and added my own<br>
personal entry.  I may have left off a field, but let's hope not. <br>
Tell me if I have.<br>
<br>
Later, based on what people choose, I may change my entry, currently<br>
it's the East Texas Yamboree (if someone else wants it, that's fine<br>
too) because I like the name.  I am also tempted by the Corndog<br>
Festival, the Fire Ant Festival, the Hammer Fest, GatorFest and Mule<br>
Days just to name a few.  Feel free to pick whichever of the many<br>
fests and festivals in the great big state of Texas appeals to you in<br>
some way.  In your log book and supporting materials, it would be<br>
great if you put a little information about the town or the festival<br>
you are representing.  <br>
<br>
If you're participating and I hope you are, email me your snail mail<br>
address to dewberrylb (at) gmail (dot) com.  Later on, I will send<br>
everyone individual emails with the address of your send-to person. <br>
Remember, Miss Moon needs a micro or mini box, so if someone<br>
specifically wants to create one for Gotham, send me an email about that.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your enthusiasm.  Can't wait to see the end products!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">no, for this exchange you create a box.  You mail the box to someone <br>
else who then plants it in the wild.  All you are responsible for as <br>
the carver is the creation of the box.  The recipient places it, <br>
creates clues and maintains it--so you have no real control over <br>
where it ends up being planted.  The boxes will not necessarily be <br>
placed near the festivals, but are sort of "in the spirit" of which <br>
ever fest or festival was the inspiration.  So, you could have a <br>
festival box that is actually 800 miles from its inspiration.  <br>
<br>
This exchange allows boxers from one part of the state (or country--<br>
anyone's welcome to participate in the exchange) to plant their work <br>
in another, with the security of knowing that someone else is <br>
looking after them and they are not "orphans."  Plus, it allows <br>
finders greater opportunity to find boxes created by letterboxers <br>
whose boxes they might not be able to find because of distance. <br>
<br>
If you want to do a specific box that would be planted in a specific <br>
spot or city, feel free to do that one too, but separately on your <br>
own outside of the exchange.  It's a great way to extend the <br>
series.  <br>
<br>
Did I explain it okay?<br>
<br>
Thanks for signing up!<br>
