    Oh my! So many trails, so little time! I have just spent the last
    two afternoons starting my explorations of this wonderful park
    system that Silver Eagle has so graciously decided to share with us.
    There are miles of trails and plenty of room for quite a few
    letterboxes.  I have really got to get back to carving again so when
    cooler weather happens along I will be ready.<br/>
