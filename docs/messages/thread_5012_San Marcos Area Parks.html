<div>I hiked some of these trails today—they are fabulous!  There are still 
lots of wildflowers and the prickly pears are starting to bloom.  I was

    Oh my! So many trails, so little time! I have just spent the last
    two afternoons starting my explorations of this wonderful park
    system that Silver Eagle has so graciously decided to share with us.
    There are miles of trails and plenty of room for quite a few
    letterboxes.  I have really got to get back to carving again so when
    cooler weather happens along I will be ready.<br/>
