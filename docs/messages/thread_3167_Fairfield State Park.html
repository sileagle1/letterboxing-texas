Silly at that particular park, since it is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; probably one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the most hardy parks I've ever been to. Maybe they've<br/>&gt; &gt; spotted<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; deer with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ink on their hooves. Anyway, wish me luck!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt;<br/></p>

                    <html><body><div>Well as I mentioned, I went to Fairfield State Park with our Cub Scout pack this weekend.  It was an absolutely glorious weekend for camping with a bunch of boys and their parents.  The woods around our campsites have been earnestly purged of anything that would ever cause harm - including dragons, ninjas, monsters, and a few other bad guys that apparently go along with pokemon or those other games we didn't have when I was into purging woods of bad guys.  It is now safe for any and everyone to go to Fairfield Lake State Park.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is a ranger/game warden there at Fairfield whose "thing" is snakes.  He gave us the low-down about all the different species of snakes in the US - and about how most of them live in Texas, and further, how about 10% of them are found in Fairfield.  Nice.  Made ME feel good about sleeping on a cot by the fire the night before!  However, he went on to explain that most snake bites are not deadly, and that even among bites by deadly snakes, most still aren't deadly because snakes usually won't release all their venom on a defensive bite because then they don't have venom in case they find something to kill and eat shortly after biting defensively.  He also pointed out that snakes really don't want to take us on because we are giants to them, so they would much rather lay still and hope you don't see them.  He talked about how to deal with snakebite (we've probably all heard that, so I won't bore you with it), and discussed an actual snakebite case he had worked on three months earlier - his own son, who had been bitten by a copperhead in their garage.  The boy was there to show off the wound even, which he played up very nicely.  The ranger said, however, that a copperhead bite is a relatively mild bite and you would have time to find a hospital with the proper anti-venom (because you are supposed to know what kind of snake bit because you went hunting for it after it bit - to which I thought "I don't know anyone who is going to go hunt down the biter") as opposed to going to the nearest hospital in a helicopter, which would be the case with a coral snake. He said to follow the three S's when having an encounter with snakes:  Stop (wouldn't want to run in the same direction as the snake, or turn and plow into a tree while making your exit).  Search (for other snakes or dangers around you).  Slowly move away.  Many folks in the crowd thought Scream should be one, but he disagreed so we suggested that he should add Scream and make it 4 S's.  He didn't go for it still.  He actually had two live copperheads he was showing, one in a clear container and one in a washtub of leaves.  It was pretty freaky when I realized how many times I had probably walked right past a snake!  Anyway, I wanted to share this with everyone since most of us agree we aren't real crazy about snakes in the woods.  This guy actually goes around hunting for them so he can remove them to an unpopulated area - now how many of you knew our state park officers do nice things like that?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And of course, after the snake show caused me pause to think about whether I really wanted to sleep by the fire again, Saturday night after campfire a bunch of us were sitting around passing the time of day, when a huge-Huge-HUGE spider began a dance right over the fire.  It was the most interesting thing.  From my perspective, I couldn't ever see his web, but he was clearly spinning because he would swing left and then right and then he would suddenly glide upward and drop ever so gracefully.  As I watched him I noticed that he was dancing right over the place I had had my cot the night before.  So now I had to wonder if the fire and I made a warm inviting place for a snake to get some heat AND about whether that spider was going to drop on me (and the snake).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I DID wind up sleeping by the fire again, and I just chose not to think about having nocturnal company in my cot.  Two of the boy scouts who were camping with us joined me by the fire for the night, but I didn't mention to them what had occurred to me - I figured it would either freak them out the way it had me, or they would think I was a wimp for even worrying about it!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The snake show and the spider dance were interesting sidelights for letterboxers because I know how we all love the critters, but what y'all are really interested in hearing is whether they allow letterboxes.  I made friends with the park superintendent, who wound up manning the office all weekend.  I kept dropping in to make sure we were squared away money-wise, but I always managed to pop in just as he was very busy with other guests, so he kept telling me to go away and come back later,  Finally I was about to leave Sunday morning and I got a chance to talk to him about letterboxing,  He said they DO allow them, but they have to approve the location.  He didn't say anything about paperwork or fees or anything, just that they have to approve the location.  He got a game warden type call just as we were getting into the discussion, so I let him off the hook and will return sometime soon to get the process going.
