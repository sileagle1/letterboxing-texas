                    <div class="plaintext-content">By the way, "Madison Quilt Block" was supposed to be called "Dolly <br/>
Madison Star" and that's the name printed on the log book, but LbNA <br/>
would not let us use that name for the box, for some reason.  We got <br/>
a "Forbidden: you don't have permission to access/BoxAdd.php on this <br/>
server" message.  When we changed the name to "Madison Quilt Block", <br/>
no problem.  Does anyone know why that would happen?<br/>

Thanks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is great!  I also placed a box in a virgin County (Waller), which <br/>
was the final county needed in the Southeast Region.  I have put a new <br/>
