A little too timid and new to do my own yet...   Our first <br>

found out why we couldn't find it! :(   Nice park anyway.  The kids <br>
were trilled to find silvereagles Texas Star at the Fair Park, <br>
though!  The first stamp in our book!!!  I hope that as school gets <br>
out we can do weekend outings further away to find more!!!  <br>

I was wondering about Spider's Lair and Halloween.  The directions <br>
seem to be for geocaching with coordinates.  I don't have the <br>
equipment to do those!  Are there any other instructions?<br>

Where is the best, most comprehensive list of LB sites?  <br>

Thanks for all your experiences!  I enjoy reading the posts, <br>

Happy spring!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to Texas Letterboxing!  Don't feel bad that you<br>
live in an area without many letterboxes, there are many<br>
others in the same boat.  Maybe you can eventually place<br>
a few of your own to help populate the area.<br>
I'm curious when you found my Texas Star box and what shape<br>
it was in since I have not heard from it in a while and<br>
like to keep up with the status of my boxes.<br>
Bob Woodward Park box is not only missing but abandoned<br>
since the owner no longer participates.  I am trying to<br>
get the box moved off of the Texas Clue Page and put in<br>
the letterbox basement (where abandoned box clues go) so<br>
others won't make wasted trips.<br>
As far as Spider's Lair & Halloween, I just visited them<br>
in March and they were doing fine.  They are both in<br>
Arcadia Trail Park and don't require GPS or geocaching<br>
abilities.  Just follow the clues and you will find both.<br>
There is another box that was placed in your area recently<br>
called the Stampbook Box that I have not looked for yet<br>
so you have at least 3 to look for.<br>
The best place to find clues & info. for boxes is at:<br>
<br>
http://www.letterboxing.org/<br>
<br>
There are other letterboxing information and talklist sites, too.<br>
I have many of the links on my webpage at:<br>
<br>
http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/<br>
<br>
Good luck and have fun!<br>

Drat! I'm a brand new letterboxer in the Dallas area and thought<br>
the <br>
Woodward Park box would make a great first outing. My husband & son <br>
& I were feverishly trying to get stamps carved so we could give it <br>
a try;-). I'm so glad to have found this list for good updates! <br>
<br>
Amy, we will just have to start populating the DFW area with new <br>
letterboxes!<br>

My family tried Texas Star at the Fair Park, after no success at <br>
woodward park.  It was great and easy for a guaranteed good <br>
experience!  Good luck and have fun!<br>
