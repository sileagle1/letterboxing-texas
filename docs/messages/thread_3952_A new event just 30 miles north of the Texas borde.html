                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone,<br>
<br>
I am hosting an event at Lake Murray State Park in Ardmore, OK.<br>
Ardmore is only 30 miles north of Texas on I-35. I thought I had<br>
posted this event last week on here, but have been told it may not<br>
have gone through, so I'll try again. The listing is on Atlas Quest.<br>
Please sign up there so I can get an idea of numbers of clues to print<br>
and food to have on hand, as well as other things. I'd love to see you<br>
there!<br>
<br>

<br>
This event is being held at Lake Murray State Park. It is 5 miles<br>
south from Ardmore, OK and 3 miles east from I-35. The park is dog<br>
friendly, but does require a leash be used. Map of the park:<br>
http://www.touroklahoma.com/images/map_park/LakeMurray.pdf There is a<br>
$3 day use fee per carload for the part of the park the pavilion is<br>
in, and that $3 fee is waived if you are camping.<br>
<br>
There will be over 35 movie based boxes planted for this event alone<br>
that are visiting from all across the US! This park has over 8 miles<br>
of trails with a variety of trail heads to enter in and out of. While<br>
hiking, you can expect to enjoy lake side views, some dense pine area,<br>
some large rocky areas that are fun to climb, and quite a bit of<br>
wildlife. The trails are well marked and easy to navigate. Trails are<br>
not very stroller friendly. Only some trails allow bikes. I will have<br>
maps for you when you arrive in your packet of clues and info.<br>
<br>
If you only want to come to meet with people and enjoy the lake, there<br>
is no shortage of things you can do at Lake Murray. You can fish, ride<br>
a bike, rent an ATV, ride a horse (they have horses you can ride for a<br>
fee), visit the nature center, bring your boat or jet ski (or rent<br>
one), or play golf at the course beside the park. More info can be<br>
found on the website:<br>
http://www.touroklahoma.com/detail.asp?id=1+5U+6446<br>
<br>
Accommodations: Lake Murray has a wide variety of accommodations that<br>
include tent camping, RV camping, cabins and cottages, and a lodge.<br>
Camping is done on a first come, first serve basis - they don't take<br>
reservations. They do take reservations for the cabins/cottages and<br>
the lodge if that interests you. For more info on the cabins/cottages<br>
or lodge, call (580) 223-6600. Camping fee info is on the website here:<br>
http://www.touroklahoma.com/campingfees.asp<br>
<br>
I will be there camping on both Friday and Saturday night. I intend to<br>
set up somewhere at Buzzard's Roost, (not sure where since I can't<br>
make a reservation). They have both tent and RV camping here on the<br>
lake. All the sites at Buzzard's Roost have stone tables and grills.<br>
(The sites at Tipp's Point don't have tables and grills for tents<br>
which is the reason for not camping at the area of the pavillion). If<br>
anyone wants to share marshmallows and stamps and stories Friday<br>
night, that would be great! Let me know and I'll do something in the<br>
way of a separate sign-up for that.<br>
<br>
The day of the gathering is Saturday. I have reserved the pavilion at<br>
Tipp's Point (called the Cisco Pavillion) for use all day, but don't<br>
plan to start until 10:30 am. It is right on the water, so don't<br>
forget your jacket if it is chilly. If you need help finding us, ask<br>
for the LBOK group. If you arrive on Friday, I will get you your clue<br>
packet at that point. If you plan to arrive Saturday and want your<br>
clues before 10:30am, send me an AQ mail and I will work something out<br>
with you.<br>
<br>
For lunch, I will be providing pizza and/or pasta at a cost of $3 per<br>
person (exact change appreciated!). Please bring either drinks or a<br>
small dessert or snack (chips, little baggies of trail mix, ect) to<br>
share with everyone. I'll provide cups, ice, plates, forks and<br>
napkins. If you don't want pizza or pasta, please bring your own sack<br>
lunch.<br>
<br>
There will be a few event boxes (table boxes) on hand to stamp into,<br>
but please don't bring any more unless you ask ahead of time. Most of<br>
these event boxes will be available on Friday night only. I am hoping<br>
most everyone will be out boxing for these 35+ wonderful stamps on<br>
Saturday.<br>
<br>
If I can answer any questions, don't hesitate to send me an AQ mail!<br>
I'll send my phone number out when the date gets closer.<br>
