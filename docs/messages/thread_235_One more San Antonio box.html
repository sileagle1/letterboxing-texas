                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Silver Eagle, for letting me know I overlooked one! <br>
<br>
The one I found today was the Lone Star Beer LB... it's just a short <br>
distance from the Peanuts one- but for some reason the name of the <br>
box made me think it might be downtown or something, so I never even <br>
looked at it before I printed the others out and came down here. <br>
Anyway, I got the directions for that one and went back out to the <br>
park and found it. And since it was such a short hike, and it wasn't <br>
hot here yet- I decided to follow the trail around some more and <br>
explore the park a bit. I did the "CITO thing" of geocachers and <br>
picked up trash along the way. I didn't have a garbage bag with me <br>
(thought I did, but didn't) so I was crumpling up any bits of paper I <br>
found into the cups and bottles. I picked up a beer bottle that kind <br>
of 'sloshed' a bit. And then when I put some paper down into it, it <br>
sloshed a bit more... and when I took a closer look at the bottle- I <br>
realized that the 'beer' wasn't beer, but a little frog! I set the <br>
bottle down and tapped the bottom end to scare him out and set him <br>
free. Good thing he kept "sloshing" otherwise he would've been thrown <br>
away with the garbage! <br>
<br>
Anyway, I had an interesting hike and sending my thanks to Silver <br>
Eagle for filling me in on the fact that I'd missed a box planted in <br>
the area I was hunting in the other day! :-)<br>
