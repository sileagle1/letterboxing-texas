I first heard about letterboxing on Thanksgiving day in 2005.  The nearest I could come to that date on The Wayback Machine was July, 2005.  At that time, this board had 139 members and there were 722 messages posted for the month.  I went into the current message board just now and found that there are now 376 members.  The latest message number is 18085 and when I subtracted 722 from that number, I got message number 17363, which was posted on August 23, 2009, almost 6 months ago.  Are we losing interest in letterboxing, or do we know it all and don't have anything to talk about?  I've noticed that sometimes, days will pass with no new messages posted.  I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's just an observation and I find it curious.  I wonder if I can think of one post a day, just to see if there's anyone out there reading what I have to say.  I might give it a try.  What do you think?<br>

all-encompassing rubber stamping site (AQ) and many people now also post on
Facebook.  I personally still prefer the Yahoo groups.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <html><body><p>Very good question BootsTex.<br/><br/>I have a few thoughts (don't be shocked now, okay?)<br/><br/>When the list first began, there were far fewer of us and letterboxing was new to everyone and we were ALL learning. We were also all getting to know one another, so there was a lot of chatter, a lot of questions, a lot of excitement, many great new ideas, a lot of idle chat and a mountain of inane and entirely silly humor (remember Ruby's endless puns?). <br/>
<br/>As the list matured, the charter members had become comfortable with each other and so we didn't have to ask whether Puddle Splasher was a scurrilous sneak who would steal a box out from under someone's nose given half an opportunity. We all knew it. <br/>
<br/>The Newboxers listed started shortly after this list did, and it has become a well-established forum for asking "dumb newbie questions." I can't tell you how many times the question "Do I have to carve my own stamp?" question has been answered there, and answered well and with great patience. This list used to be where Texas newbies asked newbie questions. This list has much the same environment as Newboxers, but it seems most of those questions go there instead of here now. That's fine - it's a GREAT list (Mark Pepe is an incredible leader on that list and I'm proud to say I'm a moderator on it for him). However, sometimes I wish Texas newbies would ask their questions here because they would get the location-specific customs rather than the global answer. Also, asking questions is a great way to spark conversation with folks who are essentially your neighbors.<br/>
<br/>I think alot of the newer members got a sense that we were a tight-knit group of friends and felt something like outsiders. I don't think we originals intended to be exclusive, but I know some new boxers did feel that we were (because they said so). For my part, I felt that we were indeed a tight-knit group, but we had a "more the merrier" feeling about us and anyone who wanted to could break into our cluster But that attitude didn't always convey itself. Admittedly though, at times we were going so hard and fast that it would have been hard for a newbie to jump in and get in the mix. <br/>
<br/>We have always allowed a wide latitude of discussion on this list - essentially, if you are a letterboxer you can join and talk about whatever you want to talk about (i.e. Blockbuster) as long as it is respectful. I know that some folks became offended by the opinions expressed by others, and quit participating. Sometimes they felt the line of respect was crossed - I can't say I always agreed that it was, but yeah - it was crossed on occasion. But when you have a bunch of folks talking together, somebody is gonna say something that hurts someone else's feelings every now and then, or offends them. I consider many of the offenders and the offendees to be highly intelligent, interesting and caring folks who have strong opinions about their respective positions. But then - I LOVE a good debate and have been known to play devil's advocate to generate interesting discussion myself and have gotten myself into hot water on an occasion or two because of that. <br/>
<br/>When the list started, there were essentially two overriding precepts and one rule. The rule - Don't plant in national parks. The precepts - civility in all things and a letterbox is a letterbox if it has clues, a stamp, and a logbook. In my opinion, this brilliant lack of boundaries (except the national park one) led to creativity and thought-provoking ideas that promoted great discussion and idea-bouncing. As the game has progressed, everything has to have a name so it can be logged just right or listed just right, so that it has become pretty formula-driven. What fun is it to talk about THAT?<br/>
<br/>And I think the creativity level of a large number of boxes has gone down. How much discussion can a box generate whose clue reads "Go to the Walmart in Jacksonville and park in the Garden Center parking area. Look under the cover at the base of the light by the shopping cart return."? On the other hand, may I just say Scarlet Pimpernel - or Murder in the Arboretum?<br/>
<br/>And folks don't post sitreps. They used to generate a LOT of discussion!<br/><br/>I have a few other thoughts that I haven't entirely formulated, but I'm looking forward to seeing what other folks have to say.<br/>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Someone made a remark that got me thinking, so
I did a little research on this website and got some interesting results. I
first heard about letterboxing on Thanksgiving day in 2005. The nearest I could
come to that date on The Wayback Machine was July, 2005. At that time, this
board had 139 members and there were 722 messages posted for the month. I went
into the current message board just now and found that there are now 376
members. The latest message number is 18085 and when I subtracted 722 from that
number, I got message number 17363, which was posted on August 23, 2009, almost
6 months ago. Are we losing interest in letterboxing, or do we know it all and
don't have anything to talk about? I've noticed that sometimes, days will pass
with no new messages posted. I'm not saying that's a bad thing, it's just an
observation and I find it curious. I wonder if I can think of one post a day,
just to see if there's anyone out there reading what I have to say. I might
give it a try. What do you think?<br/>

<p>Very good question BootsTex.<br/>
<br/>
I have a few thoughts (don't be shocked now, okay?)<br/>
<br/>
When the list first began, there were far fewer of us and letterboxing was new
to everyone and we were ALL learning.  We were also all getting to know
one another, so there was a lot of chatter, a lot of questions, a lot of
excitement, many great new ideas, a lot of idle chat and a mountain of inane
and entirely silly humor (remember Ruby's endless puns?).  <br/>
<br/>
As the list matured, the charter members had become comfortable with each other
and so we didn't have to ask whether Puddle Splasher was a scurrilous sneak who
would steal a box out from under someone's nose given half an
opportunity.  We all knew it.  <br/>
<br/>
The Newboxers listed started shortly after this list did, and it has become a
well-established forum for asking "dumb newbie questions."  I
can't tell you how many times the question "Do I have to carve my own
stamp?" question has been answered there, and answered well and with great
patience.  This list used to be where Texas newbies asked newbie questions. 
This list has much the same environment as Newboxers, but it seems most of
those questions go there instead of here now.  That's fine - it's a GREAT
list (Mark Pepe is an incredible leader on that list and I'm proud to say I'm a
moderator on it for him).  However, sometimes I wish Texas newbies would
ask their questions here because they would get the location-specific customs
rather than the global answer.  Also, asking questions is a great way to
spark conversation with folks who are essentially your neighbors.<br/>
<br/>
I think alot of the newer members got a sense that we were a tight-knit group
of friends and felt something like outsiders.  I don't think we originals
intended to be exclusive, but I know some new boxers did feel that we were
(because they said so).  For my part, I felt that we were indeed a
tight-knit group, but we had a "more the merrier" feeling about us
and anyone who wanted to could break into our cluster  But that attitude
didn't always convey itself. Admittedly though, at times we were going so hard
and fast that it would have been hard for a newbie to jump in and get in the
mix.  <br/>
<br/>
We have always allowed a wide latitude of discussion on this list -
essentially, if you are a letterboxer you can join and talk about whatever you
want to talk about (i.e. Blockbuster) as long as it is respectful.  I know
that some folks became offended by the opinions expressed by others, and quit
participating.  Sometimes they felt the line of respect was crossed - I
can't say I always agreed that it was, but yeah - it was crossed on occasion. 
But when you have a bunch of folks talking together, somebody is gonna say
something that hurts someone else's feelings every now and then, or offends
them.  I consider many of the offenders and the offendees to be highly
intelligent, interesting and caring folks who have strong opinions about their
respective positions.  But then - I LOVE a good debate and have been known
to play devil's advocate to generate interesting discussion myself and have
gotten myself into hot water on an occasion or two because of that. <br/>
<br/>
When the list started, there were essentially two overriding precepts and one
rule.  The rule - Don't plant in national parks.  The precepts -
civility in all things and a letterbox is a letterbox if it has clues, a stamp,
and a logbook.  In my opinion, this brilliant lack of boundaries (except
the national park one) led to creativity and thought-provoking ideas that
promoted great discussion and idea-bouncing.  As the game has progressed,
everything has to have a name so it can be logged just right or listed just
right, so that it has become pretty formula-driven.  What fun is it to
talk about THAT?<br/>
<br/>
And I think the creativity level of a large number of boxes has gone
down.  How much discussion can a box generate whose clue reads "Go to
the Walmart in Jacksonville and park in the Garden Center parking area. 
Look under the cover at the base of the light by the shopping cart
return."?  On the other hand, may I just say Scarlet Pimpernel - or
Murder in the Arboretum?<br/>
<br/>
And folks don't post sitreps.  They used to generate a LOT of discussion!<br/>
<br/>
I have a few other thoughts that I haven't entirely formulated, but I'm looking
forward to seeing what other folks have to say.<br/>

<br/>Gatherings really are where things happen that are talked about for times to come, but as you can imagine, the best jokes don't happen on command, they happen when no one is expecting it.

We usually do two miles with the younger boys and three with the Webelos - flat - and they think we're killing them! <br/><br/>That would sound fun if I hadn't had bronchitis for the last three weeks - the origins of which probably came from my cub scouts. Don't shake their little hands, Mike. Those stubby little fingers look innocent, but they are deadly! I normally carry Purell around with me to discretely use between handshakes. The one time I didn't - started as a cold, wound up as bronchitis. <br/>
<br/>I somehow don't think you would have to address being considered sweet and innocent. Puddle Splasher doesn't either, if you know her long enough!<br/><br/>I had to get up well before dawn this morning to take Dvir to the school to leave for Academic UIL. We woke up a little late so I didn't get to check weather before I left - had no idea what the roads had done overnight so I kicked on the 4x4 in the truck and off we went. A couple of slick spots, but for the most part clear, so I drove like a tank for nothing, but when you hit ice is to late to switch. The UIL coordinator was going to be cautious about getting them there and said he would turn the bus around if he hit any icy bridges, so I've stayed up until I know for sure they are there and not coming back, and I'm now finally sleepy enough to go back to bed.<br/>

Y'all got some tough cub scouts out there. We usually do two miles with the<br>
younger boys and three with the Webelos - flat - and they think we're killing<br>
them! <br>
<br>
That would sound fun if I hadn't had bronchitis for the last three weeks - the<br>
origins of which probably came from my cub scouts. Don't shake their little<br>
hands, Mike. Those stubby little fingers look innocent, but they are deadly! I<br>
normally carry Purell around with me to discretely use between handshakes. The<br>
one time I didn't - started as a cold, wound up as bronchitis. <br>
<br>
I somehow don't think you would have to address being considered sweet and<br>
innocent. Puddle Splasher doesn't either, if you know her long enough!<br>
<br>
I had to get up well before dawn this morning to take Dvir to the school to<br>
leave for Academic UIL. We woke up a little late so I didn't get to check<br>
weather before I left - had no idea what the roads had done overnight so I<br>
kicked on the 4x4 in the truck and off we went. A couple of slick spots, but for<br>
the most part clear, so I drove like a tank for nothing, but when you hit ice is<br>
to late to switch. The UIL coordinator was going to be cautious about getting<br>
them there and said he would turn the bus around if he hit any icy bridges, so<br>
I've stayed up until I know for sure they are there and not coming back, and I'm<br>
now finally sleepy enough to go back to bed.<br>

Which brings up a point:  What is the status of our two traveling boxes, Texas Tour Bus 2 and Texas Traveling Circus?  A "sitrep" might be nice.  I remember a few years ago when we hadn't heard from the original Texas Tour Bus for a few weeks, maybe even a few months, then it suddenly reappeared.  Seems someone had it, but didn't realize everybody was worried about its whereabouts.  Sadly, it did go missing later and was never seen nor heard from again.  I'd especially like to hear about the Texas Traveling Circus.  We had it this time last year, at the beginning of its journey, and passed it off at Mission Tejas.  I don't remember hearing from it very many times since then.  The idea behind these traveling boxes is to keep them moving so that more people get to enjoy the experience of suddenly having to drop everything and be the first one to the box.  Sometimes it's funny watching the race take place and seeing who gets there first.  LB_Bozo did a great job on the box and everyone needs a chance to see it and make your own contribution to the wild and crazy world of the Texas Traveling Circus.<br>

                    <html><body><p>Well - I have the Texas Tour Bus 2. I tried to stir up some interest when we took it with us camping in Pittsburg over Thanksgiving, but aside from one boxer who thought she had the location figured out (apparently there is also somewhere around Lockhart famous for sausage and chicken-I'm still really sorry I sent you on a wild goose chase), we didn't see much interest. I was really bummed too, because it was hidden practically in our camp, so when someone found it we were gonna have an impromptu gathering with some great food on the grill and a dutch oven cobbler. In the earlier days of the Tour Bus, that gathering could have potentially involved 20 people, all vying for the bus! Anyway, I felt very uncomfortable about leaving it in a state park, so we brought it home. <br/>
<br/>I plan to take it to the gathering and steal a table for it to be set
up on, so that folks can stamp it if they so decide. I realize that
isn't necessarily in keeping with the intent of the box, but I'd be
willing to hide it at the end of the day and post it to the group for
anyone who wants to to find it. However...<br/>
<br/>I think we need to retire it for a couple of reasons. First of all, it is chock full and about to explode. Since it is so full, no one can contribute to it, and that is really part of the fun of these traveling boxes. Secondly, if we retire it, perhaps the Circus will get more play. Thirdly, it is now a letterboxing treasure - something that would be a true loss to our circle if anything happened to it, like as in the first Tour Bus.<br/>
<br/>I suggest that if we retire it, it be moved to a slightly larger container and become an event box. With the extra room, folks could contribute to it as they see fit. I think we could also consider mailing it around to folks who are too far off the beaten trail to have seen it. Make no mistake - I am NOT recommending turning it into a postal box. I'm recommending that we consider the few folks that live in areas where it has never been, and who would really have to make a big stretch to ever go to a gathering where it might be, and give them an opportunity to have it for a bit..FYI, it weighs in at 10 pounds now. <br/>
<br/>So - if anyone has thoughts or opinions about what I've said about TTB2, speak up!<br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

<div>Very good question BootsTex.<br/><br/>I have a few thoughts (don't be shocked now, okay?)<br/><br/>When the list first began, there were far fewer of us and letterboxing was new to everyone and we were ALL learning.  We were also all getting to know one another, so there was a lot of chatter, a lot of questions, a lot of excitement, many great new ideas, a lot of idle chat and a mountain of inane and entirely silly humor (remember Ruby's endless puns?).  <br/><br/>As the list matured, the charter members had become comfortable with each other and so we didn't have to ask whether Puddle Splasher was a scurrilous sneak who would steal a box out from under someone's nose given half an opportunity.  We all knew it.  <br/><br/>The Newboxers listed started shortly after this list did, and it has become a well-established forum for asking "dumb newbie questions."  I can't tell you how many times the question "Do I have to carve my own stamp?" question has been answered there, and answered well and with great patience.  This list used to be where Texas newbies asked newbie questions.  This list has much the same environment as Newboxers, but it seems most of those questions go there instead of here now.  That's fine - it's a GREAT list (Mark Pepe is an incredible leader on that list and I'm proud to say I'm a moderator on it for him).  However, sometimes I wish Texas newbies would ask their questions here because they would get the location-specific customs rather than the global answer.  Also, asking questions is a great way to spark conversation with folks who are essentially your neighbors.<br/><br/>I think alot of the newer members got a sense that we were a tight-knit group of friends and felt something like outsiders.  I don't think we originals intended to be exclusive, but I know some new boxers did feel that we were (because they said so).  For my part, I felt that we were indeed a tight-knit group, but we had a "more the merrier" feeling about us and anyone who wanted to could break into our cluster  But that attitude didn't always convey itself. Admittedly though, at times we were going so hard and fast that it would have been hard for a newbie to jump in and get in the mix.  <br/><br/>We have always allowed a wide latitude of discussion on this list - essentially, if you are a letterboxer you can join and talk about whatever you want to talk about (i.e. Blockbuster) as long as it is respectful.  I know that some folks became offended by the opinions expressed by others, and quit participating.  Sometimes they felt the line of respect was crossed - I can't say I always agreed that it was, but yeah - it was crossed on occasion.  But when you have a bunch of folks talking together, somebody is gonna say something that hurts someone else's feelings every now and then, or offends them.  I consider many of the offenders and the offendees to be highly intelligent, interesting and caring folks who have strong opinions about their respective positions.  But then - I LOVE a good debate and have been known to play devil's advocate to generate interesting discussion myself and have gotten myself into hot water on an occasion or two because of that. <br/><br/>When the list started, there were essentially two overriding precepts and one rule.  The rule - Don't plant in national parks.  The precepts - civility in all things and a letterbox is a letterbox if it has clues, a stamp, and a logbook.  In my opinion, this brilliant lack of boundaries (except the national park one) led to creativity and thought-provoking ideas that promoted great discussion and idea-bouncing.  As the game has progressed, everything has to have a name so it can be logged just right or listed just right, so that it has become pretty formula-driven.  What fun is it to talk about THAT?<br/><br/>And I think the creativity level of a large number of boxes has gone down.  How much discussion can a box generate whose clue reads "Go to the Walmart in Jacksonville and park in the Garden Center parking area.  Look under the cover at the base of the light by the shopping cart return."?  On the other hand, may I just say Scarlet Pimpernel - or Murder in the Arboretum?<br/><br/>And folks don't post sitreps.  They used to generate a LOT of discussion!<br/><br/>I have a few other thoughts that I haven't entirely formulated, but I'm looking forward to seeing what other folks have to say.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/></div></div></div></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br/></div></font><!-- end group email --></blockquote></body></html>

<div>I think Lucy hit the nail on the head. I don't post on this list often b/c I do kind of feel like I'm intruding on a close knit of friends at times. Not that ya'll have ever been rude or unwelcoming, your all awesome. :) The advice that was given to me by one of the veteran boxers on this list is to try to attend the gatherings. I was told that's where everyone really gets to know each other and "private" jokes are created at them. I've been to a couple of gatherings now and so far everybody has been on their best behaviour so I haven't been able to witness any moments for me to joke about. Puddle Splasher, you seem to be the one that everyone likes to pick on the most, but everytime I've met you you seem so sweet and innocent. ;) I'm going to the TALE event this year and I expect something big and embarressing or controversial to happen so I can start giving people a hard time. :)</div>

&gt; Well - I have the Texas Tour Bus 2.  I tried to stir up some interest when<br/>
&gt; we took it with us camping in Pittsburg over Thanksgiving, but aside from<br/>
&gt; one boxer who thought she had the location figured out (apparently there is<br/>
&gt; also somewhere around Lockhart famous for sausage and chicken-I'm still<br/>
&gt; really sorry I sent you on a wild goose chase), we didn't see much<br/>
&gt; interest.  I was really bummed too, because it was hidden practically in our<br/>
&gt; camp, so when someone found it we were gonna have an impromptu gathering<br/>
&gt; with some great food on the grill and a dutch oven cobbler.  In the earlier<br/>
&gt; days of the Tour Bus, that gathering could have potentially involved 20<br/>
&gt; people, all vying for the bus! Anyway, I felt very uncomfortable about<br/>
&gt; leaving it in a state park, so we brought it home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I plan to take it to the gathering and steal a table for it to be set up on,<br/>
&gt; so that folks can stamp it if they so decide.  I realize that isn't<br/>
&gt; necessarily in keeping with the intent of the box, but I'd be willing to<br/>
&gt; hide it at the end of the day and post it to the group for anyone who wants<br/>
&gt; to to find it.  However...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we need to retire it for a couple of reasons.  First of all, it is<br/>
&gt; chock full and about to explode.  Since it is so full, no one can contribute<br/>
&gt; to it, and that is really part of the fun of these traveling boxes.<br/>
&gt; Secondly, if we retire it, perhaps the Circus will get more play.  Thirdly,<br/>
&gt; it is now a letterboxing treasure - something that would be a true loss to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suggest that if we retire it, it be moved to a slightly larger container<br/>

stop talking to people and let's go box already?" that I've heard at
the few we've attended.  As much as I'm sure he'd love the camping, I'm seriously thinking of getting my mom to watch him for TALE just so that I can talk to the adults!<br/>
<br/>I also can really relate to having very little time lately to post messages - I've been doing good to reply to the ones my mom sends (and only because if I don't, she calls), and briefly glancing at the rest of them.  I'm thrilled that I've had enough time this weekend to actually thoroughly read everything in an almost timely manner with the list suddenly becoming active again.<br/><br/>I totally concur that Puddle Splasher really is very nice and sweet - but I'm not sold on the innocent part.  My child seems innocent to lots of people, and I can attest that he is nowhere close to it - he just hides it really well sometimes.  :-)<br/><div><br/>Rogue Artist<br/></div><div style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><br/><div style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;"><font face="Tahoma" size="2"><hr size="1"/><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">From:</span></b> Pam Rodgers &lt;perky_p_99@yahoo.com&gt;<br/><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">To:</span></b> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Sent:</span></b> Sat, February 13, 2010 8:18:54 AM<br/><b><span style="font-weight: bold;">Subject:</span></b> Re: [letterboxingtexas] I wonder........<br/></font><br/>

I don't post on this list often b/c I do kind of feel like I'm intruding on a close knit of friends at times.

I was told that's where everyone really gets to know each other and "private" jokes are created at them. I've been to a couple of gatherings now and so far everybody has been on their best behaviour so I haven't been able to witness any moments for me to joke about. Puddle Splasher, you seem to be the one that everyone likes to pick on the most, but
 everytime I've met you you seem so sweet and innocent. ;) I'm going to the TALE event this year and I expect something big and embarressing or controversial to happen so I can
 start giving people a hard time. :)</div>

<div>Very good question BootsTex.<br/><br/>I have a few thoughts (don't be shocked now, okay?)<br/><br/>When the list first began, there were far fewer of us and letterboxing was new to everyone and we were ALL learning.  We were also all getting to know one another, so there was a lot of chatter, a lot of questions, a lot of excitement, many great new ideas, a lot of idle chat and a mountain of inane and entirely silly humor (remember Ruby's endless puns?).  <br/><br/>As the list matured, the charter members had become comfortable with each other and so we didn't have to ask whether Puddle Splasher was a scurrilous sneak who would steal a box out from under someone's nose given half an opportunity.  We all knew it.  <br/><br/>The Newboxers listed started shortly after this list did, and it has become a well-established forum for asking "dumb newbie questions."  I can't tell you how many times the question "Do I have to carve my own
 stamp?" question has been answered there, and answered well and with great patience.  This list used to be where Texas newbies asked newbie questions.  This list has much the same environment as Newboxers, but it seems most of those questions go there instead of here now.  That's fine - it's a GREAT list (Mark Pepe is an incredible leader on that list and I'm proud to say I'm a moderator on it for him).  However, sometimes I wish Texas newbies would ask their questions here because they would get the location-specific customs rather than the global answer.  Also, asking questions is a great way to spark conversation with folks who are essentially your neighbors.<br/><br/>I think alot of the newer members got a sense that we were a tight-knit group of friends and felt something like outsiders.  I don't think we originals intended to be exclusive, but I know some new boxers did feel that we were (because they said so). 
 For my part, I felt that we were indeed a tight-knit group, but we had a "more the merrier" feeling about us and anyone who wanted to could break into our cluster  But that attitude didn't always convey itself. Admittedly though, at times we were going so hard and fast that it would have been hard for a newbie to jump in and get in the mix.  <br/><br/>We have always allowed a wide latitude of discussion on this list - essentially, if you are a letterboxer you can join and talk about whatever you want to talk about (i.e. Blockbuster) as long as it is respectful.  I know that some folks became offended by the opinions expressed by others, and quit participating.  Sometimes they felt the line of respect was crossed - I can't say I always agreed that it was, but yeah - it was crossed on occasion.  But when you have a bunch of folks talking together, somebody is gonna say something that hurts someone else's feelings every now and then,
 or offends them.  I consider many of the offenders and the offendees to be highly intelligent, interesting and caring folks who have strong opinions about their respective positions.  But then - I LOVE a good debate and have been known to play devil's advocate to generate interesting discussion myself and have gotten myself into hot water on an occasion or two because of that. <br/><br/>When the list started, there were essentially two overriding precepts and one rule.  The rule - Don't plant in national parks.  The precepts - civility in all things and a letterbox is a letterbox if it has clues, a stamp, and a logbook.  In my opinion, this brilliant lack of boundaries (except the national park one) led to creativity and thought-provoking ideas that promoted great discussion and idea-bouncing.  As the game has progressed, everything has to have a name so it can be logged just right or listed just right, so that it has become
 pretty formula-driven.  What fun is it to talk about THAT?<br/><br/>And I think the creativity level of a large number of boxes has gone down.  How much discussion can a box generate whose clue reads "Go to the Walmart in Jacksonville and park in the Garden Center parking area.  Look under the cover at the base of the light by the shopping cart return."?  On the other hand, may I just say Scarlet Pimpernel - or Murder in the Arboretum?<br/><br/>And folks don't post sitreps.  They used to generate a LOT of discussion!<br/><br/>I have a few other thoughts that I haven't entirely formulated, but I'm looking forward to seeing what other folks have to say.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

<br/>Interesting you say that about intruding, and feeling comfortable talking about food. That's one reason we've not ever limited discussion very much. If we leave the door open to talk about whatever, it makes us more of a community and if we wind up talking about a wide array of subjects, we'll eventually hit one that brings out a lurker or a newbie. Sometimes I post random things and then think maybe I'm making an unwelcome post about something unletterboxing, but that was sort of the custom early on, so I've just continued...<br/>
<br/>I suppose sometimes new members feel uncomfortable posting about letterboxing specifically because they don't want to show their ignorance or be treated like they don't know anything. Anyone is entitled to an opinion, and they are entitled to change their opinions as time goes by. Sometimes newbies express ideas, and old members see a problem with it (i.e using baby wipes to clean stamps - sounds like a GREAT idea, but it's generally not done because of the alcohol and odor in the wipe), and express that, but hopefully the oldie's comments come across as addressing the idea, not critiquing the person. One thing I've learned about letterboxers though, is that they are usually very strong in how they express themselves, so sometimes they come across gruff or rude. I've been guilty of that. Nine times out of ten, that's not how they (we) are. But still, I can see how that might be intimidating.<br/>
<br/>You know your kid better than anyone, but letterboxing kids at gatherings have a way of taking care of themselves. I've always been amazed at how they fall in together and hang out all day long. My son (now 14) has made some great friends of letterboxing kids and adults. Let me share a kid story of a gathering either two or three years ago - it probably won't make you feel a bit better about bringing him, but it's funny! <br/>
<br/>The first gathering Mother's Love and her daughters, Texas Pokey and Frog Kisses, went to, they took most of their kids. My son, Lightning (now Draconis viridis) and Texas Pokey's son, Jonathan, hit it off big time. Jonathan is slightly younger than Dvir, but they are both scouts and similar in personalities. They must've been 11 and 12 at the time, so it must have been two years ago? Bear in mind, this gathering is always the first weekend in March, and this was no different. March - that's important. The day was moving along at a pleasant pace, and I was enjoying sitting and talking to Texas Pokey, when Lightning and Jonathan came and started hanging out over our shoulders. Finally, Lightning asked me if he could go swimming (the inevitable question when Lightning is near water). I tend to be a little more lenient on things like swimming in springtime and then I get in trouble with Fearless Fox, so I try not to make those judgment calls for my own peace later. Still though, even I thought it might be a little cool, but I sent him to ask Fearless Fox, who was down the way at our cabin. I was certain that since I thought it was too cool, Fearless Fox would certainly think so, and he would tell Lightning "NO" and I would still be the good parent. Jonathan asked Texas Pokey the same thing, and she - being a wise mother herself and following my lead - said "If Lightning's daddy says he can swim, so can you." We smirked betweenst ourselves, thinking we had managed to keep from being the bad guys to our kids. We talked on for awhile until we glanced out at the lake and there were our boys - chest deep, soaking wet, and having the time of their lives! Fearless Fox, in some weird change of direction, allowed Lightning - and consequently Jonathan - to go swimming. Texas Pokey and I just looked at each other - we knew we had been had, but what were we to do? They were already wet, so we couldn't undo the swimming. We let 'em swim on, and then endured their "full of themselves" attitudes when they eventually came back - they knew they had gotten the better of us too, but we had done it to ourselves so they couldn't get in trouble for it.<br/>
<br/>So - it won't be the end of the world if you have to bring him. There will be other kids for him to hang out with, and for the most part they aren't bad influences!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

Your idea about making it an event box makes a lot of sense to me.  That way, everyone will be able to see it and "stamp in" if they like.  I don't know about adding additional stamps at this point, even if you got a bigger box. That would only make it more difficult to haul around to the events.  I say we do it.  That will leave only the Texas Traveling Circus out there, and I have to say again that it's worth finding and I'd like to see it moving along a little faster so more people can appreciate it.  <br>

Your idea about making it an event box makes a lot of sense to me.  That way, everyone will be able to see it and "stamp in" if they like.  I don't know about adding additional stamps at this point, even if you got a bigger box. That would only make it more difficult to haul around to the events.  I say we do it.  That will leave only the Texas Traveling Circus out there, and I have to say again that it's worth finding and I'd like to see it moving along a little faster so more people can appreciate it.  <br>
