Oh cool!<br/>
<br/>
Would you let me know what you think of the<br/>
directions?  You did the two I was a little concerned<br/>
about!<br/>
<br/>
Did you walk the whole trail at Griff Ross?<br/>
<br/>
I had the foresight to keep a layer of Off, but the<br/>
bugs managed to bite anyway - I wonder how bad they<br/>
would've been if I hadn't sprayed.<br/>
<br/>
I've been emailing the owner of Foot Steppin' - he was<br/>
thrilled to hear from his HH, so be sure and give him<br/>
another thrill, okay?<br/>
