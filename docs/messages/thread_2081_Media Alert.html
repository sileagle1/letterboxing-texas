AQ.  Basically a re write of the article on Questing from the September

on letterboxing, there was another not too long ago about how to get your kids

<div>Don't let hand-carved stamps intimidate you!  There ARE a few boxers who are natural-born carvers, but most of us got to be decent or better carvers by simply - carving!  So carve away - and don't be ashamed to plant those carvings.  As you get better, you will plant others, but you will continue to maintain those and they will make you smile at how much better you've gotten! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you feel bad about putting what you think are pitiful carvings out to be found by others, compensate for the carving by taking us to some really cool places.  Use your boxes to tell us a story.  Write great clues.  Make neat logbooks.  I personally don't mind "bad" carving, especially when I know it's a newbie that's doing their best to jump in and experience the whole game. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are so many different elements to letterboxing and precious few of us walk into it good at all of them right away.  Letterboxing is a game of learning and adapting and tweaking so it is never mastered.  If it were, someone would sell "LETTERBOXING - Been there, done that" t-shirts.  I haven't run across those and I doubt I ever will!

<div>Hey, kudos for jumping in there and working on your first letterbox. I guarantee we won't be disappointed, because we all are so excited when a new box is planted! Like MO5 said, there's much more to letterboxing than the stamp. I think everyone enjoys finding a hand-carved stamp and will certainly appreciate your effort. I really struggled with my first stamps, but the funny thing is, I wouldn't think of replacing them. Think of it like this - Picasso's work when he first started out was probably pretty bad, but if you could lay your hands on one, it would probably be as valuable as his later works to collectors!</div>
