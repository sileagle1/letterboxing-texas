paces I have a tendency to take exaggerated steps and forcefully drive my heel

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sometimes, counting steps on the trail is the most accurate way to get to a particular point, so I do that a lot, unless there is an unmistakable landmark.  At the point of departure from the trail, a heading will work or, if a tree really stands out, I just say something like "to your right, about 20 feet off the trail, look for a huge gnarly oak".  That works even if you don't happen to have your compass or a gps.  Often, however, there is one "best" way to get to the box that everyone tends to take to avoid vines or bushes, and that creates a small social trail, despite anything you can say.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just as Mike said, I usually take more deliberate steps when counting off steps or paces on a trail, because I'm shorter than many letterboxers so I usually take bigger strides when counting. However, when I leave the trail to go trekking in the woods, I'm much more cautious. I'd love to say that's because I'm so conscious of not leaving a social trail (which I am), but primarily it's because I am so allergic to poison ivy, that I become overly cautious when I leave the trail - that, and the fact that it's almost impossible to take a straight path when in the woods. The idea of stepping in a hole and breaking my ankle out in the woods is not a pleasant thought either. Hiding a letterbox at the edge of the trail can be a tricky business, so I think it's usually appropriate to hide a box off the trail - depending on the posted rules. Some signs explicitly state to not leave the trail, so I think it's bad form to do so when posted. Those signs are posted for a reason, but if there are no rules against trekking through the woods, then I'd say use your very best judgement!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally, I like having some sort of distance in the clues, and steps is easier to follow than distance estimates.  It may cause a social trail, but it is better than digging around several wrong trees because you are not sure which one to look behind.  Also, I never have understood the problem with social trails.  Animals leave game trails, so as long as there is no sensitive vegetation or historical artifacts being disturbed, what is wrong with people creating social trails?  I find it hard to believe hunters only stay on trails, so why can't letterboxers venture off, too?<br>
