                    <html><body><div><div>Hello everyone,</div><div><br/></div><div>If you know anyone who might be interested in working at a summer resident camp in east Texas, please send them my way.  We have had letterboxing as an activity before, and can certainly do that again, although it's not required that the person be interested in letterboxing.  <span>We have not had hardly any applicants at all so far and time is getting short for hiring for summer camp, and while I was reading the notes from the posts this last time, it occurred to me that people who enjoy letterboxing are probably the same folks who can handle summer camp, physically, since they are already used to
 being outside and enjoy it (as compared to many people nowadays who prefer to watch TV or otherwise relax inside in the cool all summer).</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>Our staff is usually mostly young people just out of high school, graduating high school seniors or early college people, so it's a good first-job for many people, and we are happy to work with and mentor young people who are starting out in the work world.   The main things we need are good health, good energy and the ability to follow directions.<br/></span></div><div><br/></div><div>basic requirements for all staff are: </div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>1 - pass the criminal background check for working with children</span></div><div><span>2 - be drug-free (including alcohol and tobacco)</span></div><div><span>3 - be healthy and able to withstand working outside in the summer heat in June, with no air conditioning.</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I can train them in everything else they need to know (although if they do have other camp-related skills already, that's nice, too, of course).</div><div><br/></div><div>If they already have their Lifeguard certification (or are willing to get it), that's even better, and means more more money for them, too.   Basic camp season is June 7 to July 7, with the option to extend both before &amp; after for Lifeguards, possibly.</div><div><br/></div><div><span>If you happen
 to know anyone at all, please encourage them to visit our site for Camp Niwana</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><a href="http://campniwana.org/">http://campniwana.org/</a><br/></div><div><br/></div><div> Or, they can email me for more info, at campfiresetc@gmail.com</div><div><br/></div><div><span>Thanks!</span><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></body></html>
