For those of you  who knew James while he was at home or at Ft. Hood, we heard<br/>
from him today.  He said to say HI to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
He is in Mosul, in the northern mountains, the Kurdish region.  He says it is<br/>
colder and has more snow than Ft. Carson (Colorado Springs).<br/>
<br/>
You-all may find this amusing.  He has been a ham operator for all of 19 months<br/>
now, although he has listened to Short Wave since he was a small boy.  Anyway -<br/>
he has a new job.  Instead of being a Scout-Sniper-Paramedic as a part of a<br/>
Bradley crew, he is now in the HQ, running the COMMO shop.  Yup - his "VAST"<br/>
radio experience as a ham operator got him into the commo shop.  He says he<br/>
doesn't think it will last long, maybe a few months.  His favorite quote - "Its<br/>
a Push To Talk button, not a push to think button."  At least he is warm.<br/>
<br/>
I started to lecture him about getting soft, letting his guard down.  I<br/>
mentioned the recent attack in Mosul as an example.  I told him I saw it on the<br/>
news, and he should keep ready - condition yellow to orange all the time.  He<br/>
said he didn't need to wait for the news to see it, he was there.  Two<br/>
insurgents were killed immediately, one got out the door before the dropped him.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - he is well, and he misses Ft. Hood and the warm Texas weather.  I<br/>
expect about Summer he will be wishing for the snow.<br/>
<br/>
He should return to Ft, Hood/Killeen in the spring of 2009.  Maybe Lucy will<br/>
make another Welcome Home box for him that forces me to come back for too.<br/>
<br/>
Y-all have a great evening.<br/>
