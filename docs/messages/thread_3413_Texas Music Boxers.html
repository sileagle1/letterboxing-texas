<p><font color="#0000ff">With so many new boxers of late, (which is GREAT!!) I thought I would take a moment and introduce our boxing family. I of course am Blue Butterfly and live in East Texas, along with Stinky Monkey and Roarin' Lion who are my grandsons. They are 5 and 6 and have been boxing with us from day one almost 3 years ago. They love looking at their logbooks and talking about where they have been and the stamps in their logbooks! Their Aunt, Lucy Locket, who is my daughter, lives in Navarro County. As a group, we are known as The Texas Music Boxers. We've had adventures of a life time collecting stamps and memories. </font></p>
<p><font color="#0000ff">To all the new boxers....Welcome aboard!</font></p>
