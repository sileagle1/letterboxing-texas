                    <html><body><div>I've had a particular point of work-related business to tend to in the Waco area for a few weeks, so I've been planning a boxing trip that direction for awhile now.  Our good friend, Gryzzled Gryphon, was kind enough to verify that the boxes listed were all still there and to give me suggestions about plan of attack.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I aimed my trip for this weekend since I knew Fearless Fox and Lightning would be leaving for Mexico Friday morning.  I figured on leaving within a few hours of getting rid of, er I mean, seeing them off.  My high hopes were dashed when the water pump when out on my car, but I remind myself that it was probably a good thing it went out before I left town.  I awoke Saturday morning to torrential downpours and a car as yet unrepaired.  Very frustrating, especially because I KNEW GG was probably going to try to beat me to the new box in Belton!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO ANYWAY...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After I got my car back, I told SJZ, who was visiting this weekend, that I would "get up very early this morning and come hell or high water I would be heading to Waco."  You would think I would realize it is best to be careful how I phrase things.  Sure enough, I work up early.  3 
a.m.  To a phone call.  Yes, it was the call parents dread - child is at the hospital after an accident, but it was a wrong number.    BAD case of de ja vu.  But as it happened, I knew the family, so I was wide awake and trying to help the hospital get in touch with the parents.  That was the hell part.  The high water I wasn't even aware of until I walked out the door into the night, er, early morning - but who could tell the difference at 4 
a.m.?  It was pouring rain.  And lightning (not my son, Lightning, he is in Mexico).  Did that stop me?  Noooo!  I jumped in the car and pulled out of the driveway, glad that Fearless Fox wasn't around to talk sense into me.  Don't tell him I did that!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It took me forever to just get to Palestine, so I decided to stop and hang out in Walmart (I'ver NEVER voluntarily hung in Walmart until today) and wait for at least some of the storm to pass on by.  By the time I got on the road again, it was 6 
a.m. and I was a good hour behind schedule.  It was still raining, but I could see hints of ligher skies in the west.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Under promising blue skies, I hit the loop in Waco at 8:00 and by 8:30 I was at my first box - Silver Eagle's Texas Ranger box.  As always, nice box nicely hidden.  I even made a friend while I was stamping in - some guy eating breakfast there.  He watched what I was doing like he sees people rubber stamping there all the time.  Finally he moved along and I was able to replace the box.  There was also a geocache in the same general vicinity, so I caught that too and moved on.  My next box was Baby Bear's (I know y'all are surprised he had one near Silver Eagle's) and again, nicely done.  As always.  Sneaky too.  And again, a GC in the general area, so I picked that up.  I was pretty pleased with myself by this point - I was 4/4 by 10:00 
a.m.! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I moved along to Rebel's Cameron Zoo boxes.  Now Cameron Park is a PARK!  It reminds me quite a lot of San Diego's Balboa Park.  Rebel leads the finder out to a very secluded-seeming trail, squarely in the middle of town, but you would swear you were alone for miles!  Moreso at box #1 than box #2, as I introduce the Renegade Bikers.  I found Box #2 and sat myself down beside the trail in the only somewhat clear area.  I had everything dragged out when I heard some guy yelling "Hard left" "Hard right" "Turn".  They seemed pretty close, but I thought bicycles would surely not be on this particular trail because of all the switchbacks and the very steeple incline and the roots and rocks and other hazards - one of which at that exact moment was - ME.  I barely saw the lead rider before he saw me, and I immediately realized that if he was going to make it around that turn, he would need the space where I was sitting (in hindsight, I realize that is why it was clear!) - but it was too late to move.  He looked up and saw me squarely in his path (although I stand by the fact that I was BESIDE the official path, not IN the path).  He halted right before he hit me and his three cohorts immediately piled up behind him.  They were apologetic and good-natured and apparently uninjured and they were quickly along their way.  I finished up my stamping and quickly moved on before Lance Armstrong himself came barreling around the corner.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I might also mention that I found two more GCs in Cameron, so now I was 8/8 finds.  Remarkable for me in the GC front - I typcailly run about 50%!  By then it was around Noon and I was feeling good about life and thinking I would be going home with a logbook full!  My afternoon was NOT like my morning.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I moved along to try to find a couple around Lake Waco, but right off the bat I figured out I had passed the exit for one when I came into town.  Oh well.  I decided to leave that one for my leaving town.  I paid my money to get into the park where Drifter is and parked.  I went to where I thought the box should be, and I found that I had to get to the base of a large evergreen - one of those with branches to the ground.  As I slipped between the branches, I noticed how peaceful and cool it was, and then I noticed that there were berries growing among the branches, so I checked out the leaf and realized the berries were a wild grape or muscadine.  All in all, the place I was was exactly the sort of place I would've chosen to be if I were a snake!   Just as that thought crossed my mind, I put my hand up to a branch to steady myself and the branch MOVED!  The snake was as startled by my invasion as I was of the branch moving, so he took off as I stepped back and landed on my rear end!  I got myself up and out of the tree, then I realized I had lost my sun glasses in there.  They were cheap and I thought the snake looked like he could use some sunglasses, so I was going to donate them to the cause.  Until I realized my keys had also fallen out of my pocket.  Now I was going to give the snake my shades, but I wasn't going to give him my carr.  Really - you have to have feet to operate a vehicle!  So back I went to retrieve my keys and get my shades in the bargain, making bunches of noise before I emerged so he and any friends could politely take cover.  I debated whether I was even in the right spot, and I'm not sure I was.  Actually, I KNOW I wasn't in the right spot, whether the box was there or not!  I guess I should say I don't know if I found the box's location or not...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Did I mention that the only thing I forgot was my walking stick?  That's pretty good for me!  And I noticed at some point that if push came to shove, I could use Fearless Fox's wimpy stick - the one that looks like a ski pole and has a spike on the end and a disc to keep the spike from sinking the stick too deep and a little tiny compass in the handle that only helps if you have under 40 eyes OR a magnifying glass (neither of which do I carry routinely).  I cannot tell you how many times I've rolled my eyes when he has gone on about how great his walking stick is.  I personally like a good solid wood stick, hewn from land I know and rough cleaned, leaving the smoothing to the hands of the one who owns it.  My own stick has my name and pack number and den name burned into it because I presented the boys in my den with sticks just like it at the beginning of last year.  Now that's a stick.  Silly ski pole stick.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, after the snake incident, I decided to keep moving, so I went on to find Harry Potter in Woodway.  Another lovely park - Woodway Park.  I had already wished a couple of times that I had brought my walking stick, so I decided I would carry the stupid ski pole just in case I needed a pokey stick.  As I stepped on to the trail, I was struck by the beauty of the woods.  Truly breathtaking.  Looking at the tree cover is probably why I didn't realize I had stepped into clay - wet, slick, cakey clay.  Kind of like the black gumbo Dallas has, but not black.  Great surface to walk on - when it hasn't been rained on earlier in the day.  By the time I realized I was on clay, it was too late.  My shoes were caked in it, and I was scrambling for balance.  I managed to go a few more steps, found the bridge in the clues and was relieved - momentarily - to step onto it and hopefully to be able to get the situation under control, but it was not to be.  The bridge was slick too!  Now y'all know I try to practice Leave No Trace as much as I can, and one thing you learn in LNT is that you had better wear shoes you can slog around in because you should always stick to the trail even if it is fouled, so you don't create a wider path than is already there.  I couldn't do it.  I really wanted that box, but I couldn't walk the trail to it.  So I tried walking off trail ever so slightly, but there was hardly room to pass except on the trail.  I soon had to give up and retrace my steps.  Definitely a box for another day.  Regrettably, I have to admit that the only reason I never landed on my butt for the second time today was because of that goofy walking stick.  I don't think I'll ever concede that it really is a pretty good stick to Fearless Fox, but I won't roll my eyes when he talks about it anymore.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>By then I was a little discouraged.  I had missed two boxes in a row and it was 3 p.m. or so.  I had a decision - Temple/Belton or Mother Neff.  I opted for Mother Neff because I had it on good authority that it was worth the visit.  It was!  You drive through some pretty dry boring area to get there, and then as you start making turns to get to the park, you begin seeing trees and by the time you enter the park, you are under dense canopy.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I staked my plan and quickly cross-referenced caches to boxes and headed on out after a talk with a very nice, extremely helpful ranger.  I went for the cave boxes, one by Baby Bear and one by Gingercat.  I went for Baby Bear's first, and quickly missed a landmark, but I thought I would wing it.  That didn't work out very well.  I found myself convincing myself that where I was standing fit the clues, but I had to admit after awhile that it didn't.  Meanwhile, a family had come up behind me, so as I backtracked, I drew their attention.  I have not ever had anyone actually interrogate me about what I am doing.   I can usually say "research" and they ignore me for fear I might think they are interested and started telling them all about it.  They weren't wanting to move along and I wasn't either, so I stood around there acting ditzy, like I had misjudged something and couldn't figure out where I was supposed to be going.  Meanwhile, the man wouldn't let up!  He wanted to know where my people were, why I was out there alone, whether I was there for my job, and THEN - as I tried to act disinterested and move on, he walked closer to me and tried to read my paper!  I pretended I was making notes, and folded it up so the words wouldn't show and started writing latin plant names.  Thank goodness I grew up in the horticulture business!  Finally, after a few more questions about why I was alone and where my husband was, they moved along.  I sat down and rested for awhile, using the clues and visually scoping out where the box would be, and was fairly certain I had spotted its hiding place about 30 feet away by the time they were a good five minutes down the trail.  It's funny how painfully obvious something is when you don't try to second guess the planter or force your surroundings to meet the clues.  I think this may well be the best Baby Bear box I've visited yet!  I was right on the money about where to look, but when I got up close, I still couldn't see the actual hiding place.  Trusting his clues and not my eyes, I started looking where he said it was and it was there!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I then searched out and found Gingercat's Daddy Long Legs box.  Excellent stamp and also a very good hiding spot.  No Daddy Long Legs in the cave today though.  Possibly because it was late afternoon?  Or maybe because it had rained earlier in the day?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hated to leave, but by then it was getting late and my knee was starting to bother me after the dance I did on the clay earlier, and the guy with all the questions about why I was alone was tugging at my subconscious, so I decided I would have to come back later to get the rest of what I missed in Mother Neff and in the Coryell/McClennan/Bell Counties area.  In the meantime, I left one bit of unfinished business, so hopefully I'll be able to get back soon.

<div>I hated to leave, but by then it was getting late and my knee was starting to bother me after the dance I did on the clay earlier, and the guy with all the questions about why I was alone was tugging at my subconscious, so I decided I would have to come back later to get the rest of what I missed in Mother Neff and in the Coryell/McClennan/Bell Counties area.  In the meantime, I left one bit of unfinished business, so hopefully I'll be able to get back soon. <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
