<br/>
As Eoghan said, all boxes are fine!  I would also like to add that <br/>
we had a most excellent time during our road trip to Texas.  We <br/>
camped in Abilene the first night, the weather was perfect.  <br/>
<br/>
Abilene SP, found both:<br/>
<br/>
Buffalo Gap<br/>
SHOTB:  CALEB<br/>
<br/>
Arriving in Austin, found:<br/>
San Gabriel Park - found during the final four soccer tourney<br/>
<br/>
Chisolm Trail Box - the path to cross over was blocked off due to <br/>
high water but we found another way to get in.  The water was <br/>
rushing!  I now know the story of Round Rock - a great one it is <br/>
too, I took some amazing photos and you can still see wagon wheel <br/>
trails!  I'll add some photos to the 'photos' section soon!<br/>
<br/>
Then it was time to pull out all the stops!  The next day, we headed <br/>
for Bastrop, our favorite Texas SP!  We managed to snag six boxes <br/>
before the rain started to pour!  Bastrop is so beautiful when it's <br/>
wet and very green!  We also were able to stamp in on the rock that <br/>
Eoghan proposed at - it was awesome!  <br/>
<br/>
Bastrop boxes stamped:<br/>
<br/>
Lost Loblolly - where we also were the 'first to find' <br/>
Mr. Poppers Penguins "H.H." - it's now in Colorado<br/>
Poison Ivy<br/>
Trail Rider - Baby Bear, this logbook is full!<br/>
Skinny Pine <br/>
Park Pest <br/>
<br/>
We wanted to find them all but it was time to go!  The fun ended all <br/>
too soon!  We will be back!  Thanks to all of you for such wonderful <br/>
boxes!  Might I add, Baby Bear, your carving is superb!<br/>
<br/>
Take care all!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

Thank you - it was such a great time!  I added photos to the photos <br/>
section - enjoy!  PLEASE let us know WAY ahead of time when the next <br/>
gathering is - perhaps we can try harder this time!  <br/>
<br/>
We had two boxes to hide but the rain did NOT let up!  Grrrrrrrrr!  <br/>
They were "Texas-esque" boxes so we will save them for the next <br/>
trip!  We tried, we really did!<br/>
<br/>
Plans to travel to the Rockies soon???  I know you were talking <br/>
about a backpacking trip?  Keep us posted!<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
