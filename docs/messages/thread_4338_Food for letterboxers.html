That big teddy bear that I set out to show where we were floats around my house still, and every time I see him, I think of that event. I most recently saw him being carried/dragged around by Trail Whale, who decided the bear was his new best friend at my house - the bear is still bigger than he is!

Anyway, when they get together, they partied hard, ate like kings, and drank like fish. I'm not much of a partier anymore, my midsection can't afford to eat as well as they do, and I proved not to be able to keep up with them on the drinking front.

  Kawasaki.  Those were fond memories and they are all good friends to this 
  day, even though we rarely see them because our friends moved away before she 
  got sick and passed away.  Anyway, when they get together, they partied 
  hard, ate like kings, and drank like fish.  I'm not much of a partier 
  anymore, my midsection can't afford to eat as well as they do, and I proved 
  not to be able to keep up with them on the drinking front.  River Rats 
  came from our experiences during that time of our lives.<br/><br/>Recipe is on

<p>Great idea, BL! It was fun looking at these recipes and remembering 
      some of the events. - JEN at Lake Bardwell... I'd just recently moved back 
      to Texas and it was the first time I'd met you, Ruby Tuesday, "almost" 
      Gryzzled Gryphon, although we had passed on the trail and acknowledged 
      each other with a smirk and a nod! What fun it was for us to all be 
      sitting around that picnic table trying to solve the clues to his first 
      box! I still love making your River Rats everytime we fire up a grill.... 
      where's that recipe?<br/>Puddle Splasher<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, Barefoot

      included, particularly gathering type<br/>&gt; recipes. If you send 
      something along and you want me to include your sig<br/>&gt; stamp, scan it 
      in and send it along and I'll use it too.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've got others 
      I've found along the way, not to mention ones from my Tomato<br/>&gt;
