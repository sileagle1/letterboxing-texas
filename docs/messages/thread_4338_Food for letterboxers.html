That big teddy bear that I set out to show where we were floats around my house still, and every time I see him, I think of that event. I most recently saw him being carried/dragged around by Trail Whale, who decided the bear was his new best friend at my house - the bear is still bigger than he is! Trail Whale is gonna be a letterboxer - I just know it - I just hope he doesn't decide the bear needs to be his boxing buddy!<br/>

      spring-cleaning right now (won't tell you if I'm late for last spring 
      or<br/>&gt; early for the coming one) and I came across recipes I collected 
      from the JEN<br/>&gt; gathering primarily, but also a couple of others 
      along the way so far. I<br/>&gt; thought I would share it with y'all, and 
      invite y'all to send along any<br/>&gt; other recipes you might want to see 
      included, particularly gathering type<br/>&gt; recipes. If you send 
      something along and you want me to include your sig<br/>&gt; stamp, scan it 
      in and send it along and I'll use it too.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've got others 
      I've found along the way, not to mention ones from my Tomato<br/>&gt; 
      Fest/Pampered Chef gathering. I'm looking for those and I'll post them as 
      I<br/>&gt; get to them.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <a href="http://eatinglikeletterboxers.blogspot.com" target="_blank">http://eatinglikele<wbr/>tterboxers.<wbr/>blogspot.<wbr/>com</a><br/>&gt;
