is. You don't know what else could be in that log. Please pick up <br/>

Thanks for the hug,<br/>
 I am thinking that I should just not respond so as to not add fuel <br/>
to the fire, and it looks like he found the box by accident by <br/>
poking around in a hole in a log because that is what he does... He <br/>
is a zoology student. (its amazing what you can find out about a <br/>
person when you google their name.)  It just irks me that he thinks <br/>
he can just pick up something that belongs to someone else just <br/>
becuause he IS a zoology student. I wonder if he picks up disc golf <br/>
goals or hiking markers because they are litter too. Oh well, I <br/>
should not go on any more becuase it just gets me more upset. IF he <br/>
starts preying on boxes we will have to deal with that. Thankfully I <br/>
already know enough info about him.<br/>
<br/>
Keep an eye on your boxes.<br/>

I'm so sorry you had this experience - bet you were pretty shaken. I hope he<br/>
finds other pursuits and leaves your boxes alone!<br/>
We will put our heads together and devise an<br/>

tomorrow.  Can I get the picture of your logbook in the aquarium for part

Sorry to hear about this, especially since it can affect<br/>
all of us in Texas.  Which of your boxes did he find?  <br/>
Will you replace it?  I'm still hoping to make it down that<br/>
way in late December and had both your boxes on my list to <br/>
find.  Also, I can't find clues for your new GPzoo box.  <br/>
Did you post them or is the LBNA site having problems again?<br/>
This probably calls for a new box to be created for people<br/>
with exceptional bad luck with their boxes, similar to the <br/>
Purple Heart box available to those receiving injuries in<br/>
the Line Of Boxing.  Hang in there, and if you do respond<br/>
to his email, you might try urging him to try the hobby<br/>
before judging it, especially since he could combine his<br/>
hobby of zoology with letterboxing quite easily.  The problem<br/>
is, I hate to direct him to letterboxing.org if he doesn't<br/>
already know about it, since he could then find other boxes<br/>
to destroy.<br/>

    The fact that he did not see the waiver makes me feel better to <br/>
know he did not look at the clues sheet, he just emailed me at the <br/>
email address I left in the log book. Anyways, I don't think he <br/>
meant to give me his name, but it showed up in his email. Then I <br/>
googled him and found out more than I ever needed to know. <br/>

&gt; &gt; find.  Also, I can't find clues for your new GPzoo<br/>
&gt; box.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Did you post them or is the LBNA site having<br/>
&gt; problems again?<br/>
&gt; &gt; This probably calls for a new box to be created<br/>
&gt; for people<br/>
&gt; &gt; with exceptional bad luck with their boxes,<br/>
&gt; similar to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Purple Heart box available to those receiving<br/>
&gt; injuries in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Line Of Boxing.  Hang in there, and if you do<br/>
&gt; respond<br/>
&gt; &gt; to his email, you might try urging him to try the<br/>
&gt; hobby<br/>
&gt; &gt; before judging it, especially since he could<br/>
&gt; combine his<br/>
&gt; &gt; hobby of zoology with letterboxing quite easily. <br/>
&gt; The problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; is, I hate to direct him to letterboxing.org if he<br/>
&gt; doesn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; already know about it, since he could then find<br/>
&gt; other boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; to destroy.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's what he said,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Litterbug, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Your letterbox has been found and removed on<br/>
&gt; 11/20/04. Attached <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; picture of what you could meet when people go<br/>
&gt; looking for letter <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxs in Texas. If littering isn't wrong enough<br/>
&gt; for you, I think <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sending unsuspecting people to look for your<br/>
&gt; hidden boxes in <br/>
&gt; logs <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is. You don't know what else could be in that<br/>
&gt; log. Please pick <br/>
&gt; up <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; new hobby. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ￼<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then he sent a picture of my log book that he<br/>
&gt; put in an aquarium <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with a rattlesnake.   <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What do I say to him?  I hope he hasn't looked<br/>
&gt; at the clues for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other boxes. I hope he doesn't get any more. <br/>
&gt; Whaaaah!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But that didn't stop me from planting a new one<br/>
&gt; today. Look for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; GPZoo box. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Help<br/>

&gt; &gt; boxes. He does not live locally to me and was just<br/>
&gt; &gt; here on a field <br/>

<div>I'm glad you decided not to respond to him. With jerks like that, there wouldn't be any point. He's a redneck idiot (Being from Texas, I feel free to use the word redneck). </div>
<div>That is really a sick thing to do. I wouldn't put any more boxes in that particular area. "littering"??????????????? PLEASE. God what a total moron. I tell you though, I'd love it if there was a way to get back at people like that without them knowing where it came from. </div>
