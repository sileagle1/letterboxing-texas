&gt; Well - as a retired soldier with lots of desert experience, I can say that<br/>
&gt; snakes are truly rare in the late fall through early spring.  Not gone<br/>
&gt; completely, but usually.  I speak for West Texas, the habits in the east may<br/>
&gt; differ somewhat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Study up on them - respect them, but do not fear them.  And above all, do not<br/>
&gt; mess with them.  Or kill them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rattle Snakes do not want to encounter you.  If given the chance they will warn<br/>
&gt; you with a buzz of their tail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If forced into a human encounter, they would rather flee than bite.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If cornered, they will strike.  Most snake bites happen in two ways.  The snake<br/>
&gt; is found suddenly in an unexpected place and startled, or people do not listen<br/>
&gt; and try to mess with the snake.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a snake bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom.  This is more true<br/>
&gt; with older and larger snakes.  But you cannot count on that.  Smaller snakes are<br/>
&gt; more dangerous than the larger ones for several reasons.  First, they are not as<br/>
&gt; frightening, so people will be more likely to mess with them.  Second, when they<br/>
&gt; strike they nearly always dump all the venom they have into the bite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Death from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people.  The very<br/>
&gt; young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc) need<br/>
&gt; to be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite victim calm, and seek medical aid<br/>
&gt; ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is for TV.  Study up on<br/>
&gt; proper first aid for snake bite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knowledge is power.  Most people fear what they do not understand.  Kind of like<br/>
&gt; hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them.  Knowledge and<br/>
&gt; experience usually conquers those fears.  So it should be with snakes.<br/>
&gt; Knowledge and precaution is all you need.  Use a stick to poke - not your hand.<br/>
&gt; Use a grabber to reach the box, not your arm.  If you see a snake, remember it<br/>
&gt; belongs there, you are a visitor in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by<br/>

As someone who was bitten by a snake in the early spring when snakes are rare,
I will say that it can happen. <br/>
<br/>
This will be my last post on the subject. <br/>

&gt; Well - as a retired soldier with lots of desert experience, I can say that<br/>
&gt; snakes are truly rare in the late fall through early spring. <span style="color:green">***** </span><b>Not gone<br/>
&gt; completely<span style="color:green"> *****</span>,</b> but usually. <span style="color:green">*****</span><b>I speak for West Texas</b><span style="color:green">*****</span>, the habits in the east may<br/>
&gt; differ somewhat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Study up on them - respect them, but do not fear them. And above all, do
not<br/>
&gt; mess with them. Or kill them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rattle Snakes do not want to encounter you. If given the chance they will
warn<br/>
&gt; you with a buzz of their tail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If forced into a human encounter, they would rather flee than bite. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If cornered, they will strike. Most snake bites happen in two ways. The
snake<br/>
&gt; is found suddenly in an unexpected place and startled, or people do not
listen<br/>
&gt; and try to mess with the snake.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If a snake bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom. This is more
true<br/>
&gt; with older and larger snakes. But you cannot count on that. Smaller snakes
are<br/>
&gt; more dangerous than the larger ones for several reasons. First, they are
not as<br/>
&gt; frightening, so people will be more likely to mess with them. Second, when
they<br/>
&gt; strike they nearly always dump all the venom they have into the bite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Death from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people. The very<br/>
&gt; young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc)
need<br/>
&gt; to be aware of their situation. Keep the bite victim calm, and seek
medical aid<br/>
&gt; ASAP. Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is for TV. Study up on<br/>
&gt; proper first aid for snake bite.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Knowledge is power. Most people fear what they do not understand. Kind of
like<br/>
&gt; hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them. Knowledge
and<br/>
&gt; experience usually conquers those fears. So it should be with snakes.<br/>
&gt; Knowledge and precaution is all you need. Use a stick to poke - not your
hand.<br/>
&gt; Use a grabber to reach the box, not your arm. If you see a snake, remember
it<br/>
&gt; belongs there, you are a visitor in its land. Give it the respect it is
due by<br/>
&gt; yielding the trail to it, and you will be fine. Most snakes cannot quite
strike<br/>
&gt; as far as they are long, but give it as much room as you can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In 20 years I only had to evac one soldier for snake bite. It was just a
cute<br/>
&gt; little baby snake. He had heard that the baby snakes didn't bite. Heh heh
heh<br/>
&gt; - just like all guns are loaded, so too are all snakes. Give them their
due,<br/>
&gt; and all will be well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this is helpful.<br/>

&gt; Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Introduction<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been a member of this group for a small while but I just havent
taken the<br/>
&gt; time to introduce myself yet. Between an LTC that is challenging me, my
kitchen<br/>
&gt; being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft table!)and starting a direct
sales<br/>
&gt; business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life lately. But
im here<br/>
&gt; now. :)<br/>
&gt; I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX
with his<br/>
&gt; wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a
year. We<br/>
&gt; have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even
started<br/>
&gt; carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma does all
the<br/>
&gt; work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving. They both
love to<br/>
&gt; draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even look for some
boxes<br/>
&gt; when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very long, a little
over a<br/>
&gt; year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let them overrun me and
am<br/>
&gt; planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking done and try, try to
get<br/>
&gt; better at quilting. I also want to plant some more letterboxes in my area
since<br/>
&gt; its still pretty quiet around here. I get some finds, most are accidents,
very<br/>
&gt; few log them but I still love doing it. I have a box ready to be planted
in<br/>
&gt; Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments my son lives at. I hope to do
that<br/>
&gt; in November. I am married to a great supportive guy. He probly wouldnt
letterbox<br/>
&gt; on his own but has found every box with me and helps me with the
directions and<br/>
&gt; stuff planting mine. We also geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky
enough to<br/>
&gt; meet some boxers in Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns
Glory<br/>
&gt; organized it to meet me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But
I<br/>
&gt; felt special anyway. :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait,
I<br/>
&gt; practiced with a carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet
which is<br/>
&gt; who I want to carve.<br/>
&gt; And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont
even<br/>
&gt; know im here most of the time. :) <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who<br/>
&gt; survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in
Texas?<br/>
&gt; Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering.<br/>
