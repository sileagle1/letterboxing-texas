                    <html><body><div>Well, believe it or not, I plan to go get a box or two. My friends from work, including Lori of KMBaker, and I and our families are going to Possum Kingdom lake for the weekend. </div> <div> </div> <div>It's taken us 3 weeks and two or more trips to the store and we are finally ready to go. Why does it take so much stuff to go stay at a campground for two nights. I believe it's as much stuff as we take for a week long adventure. Crazy.</div> <div> </div> <div>But, I am so excited. Please pray for anything but rain. As it's been here in DFW lately, the nights are very cool and the days are lovely. That weather would be fine with me.</div> <div> </div> <div>So, Friday and Saturday night we'll be sitting around a campfire making smores and drinking wine (dessert wine I'm sure).</div> <div> </div> <div>It's only been 3 months since I've done any boxing out in the wild.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Blooming Flowers</div><p>
