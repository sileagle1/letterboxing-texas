<div>Thanks Sea Dove (glad 
to hear from you!) and dear Lucy for answering the question for me!  The 
box was planted, and then went missing about a year ago.  It is archived on 
LBNA, and never listed on AQ because, well, I'm partial to LBNA I 
guess.  In any case, the box is no longer there...so that is my story and 
I'm sticking to it.  Back to making treats for teacher munchie day, don't 
ask why I am doing it at 10:30 at night.  MO5</div></body></html>

<div>I'm not making school treats, but I'm baking cookies for neighbors and for Cubbies who will be going caroling Saturday night.  I have no idea why I do this, but baking is almost always a 9 to midnight thing for me too!

<div>You know, add me to
