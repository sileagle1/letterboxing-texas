Looking forward to going there some day and finding your box.<br/>
BTW, consider it your box, not a replacement for the one that used <br/>
to be there.  If you want to mention the original in your clues for <br/>
history sake, that would be fine, but you earned the right to put your <br/>
own box there.<br/>
<br/>
As far as volunteering to be the "letterbox ranger" at your nearest <br/>
State Park, I think that is a great idea, Boots.  And my hat is off to <br/>
you, Mike, for cultivating such a good relationship with the parks in <br/>
your area.  Maybe some of us could try it if any parks are close <br/>
enough, but only if the park has started enforcing the permit rule.  I <br/>
wouldn't want to alert them to boxes until absolutely necessary.<br/>

&gt; Exactly what I did.  It is working fine in El Paso.  In fact, my first<br/>
&gt; attempt at fake rocks was a disaster - but the second is coming <br/>
along.  And<br/>
&gt; this is for the surprise box.<br/>

&gt; Yeah - hard to believe that they are allowing one.  But one of the <br/>
rangers<br/>
&gt; there is from Franklin Mtn park, and I think he put the word in for <br/>
me.<br/>
