Hello all!  I just got back from a cold weekend in Austin and <br>
happened to find a couple of boxes at the Barton Creek Greenbelt.  <br>
My Step-father has lived in Austin all his life and prides himself <br>
on knowing the ins and outs of the town.  He couldn't believe that <br>
he had driven past the entrance to this park hundreds of times and <br>
never realized it was there.  He loved it!  He's going back this <br>
week to explore it some more.  <br>
BARTON CREEK GREENBELT LETTERBOX- Found in perfect condition.<br>
HIKING PUG LETTERBOX- Box was glaringly visible from the trail.  <br>
There was even a log from a geocacher who noticed it from the trail <br>
and investigated.  The insides were perfect and there were a lot of <br>
interesting logs from around the globe.  We placed it back in its <br>
spot with a rather large rock wedged into the opening.  I hope the <br>
Pug Lovers don't mind.<br>
<br>
We also searched for the AUSTIN HIGHLIGHTS 1 LETTERBOX at the <br>
arboretum.  It's not there.  I'm certain of the location, but this <br>
is a very popular place for the kiddies and I think it may have been <br>
victimized.<br>
<br>
I also found out were to look for the Box of Ants, Austin Anteater, <br>
and 360 Bridge boxes, but those will have to wait till next trip.  <br>
Thanks to all the placers.  Me and the family had a great time.<br>
<br>

Patches.<br>
<br>
I'm a little behind on this topic, so forgive me if it's too late to <br>
chime in.  <br>
Put me down for five.<br>
I vote for no numbers(F/P, or year)<br>
I don't care about stitch content.<br>
I can wait till the gathering for reciept (If I can make it, if not <br>
I don't mind the postage)<br>
<br>
I think that's all for now,<br>

The entrance is actually on the northbound side of loop 360.  I <br>
guess if you are going SW on 1, take the 360 exit<br>
and go SSE. Then there is a light you can turn at, but I don't <br>
remember the street name or if there even was one. You can see the <br>
park entrance sign to your left.  There are no roadsigns for <br>
directions. If you get to Lamar, you've gone too far.  You can get <br>
the two that I did, and if you're in the mood for a long walk or <br>
bike ride, there are at least two other boxes in this park and one <br>
in Zilker Park, which adjoins the Barton Greenbelt. <br>
