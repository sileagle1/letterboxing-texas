                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since the feedback has been so positive, I went ahead and booked the <br/>
pavilion at South Lake Park on Lake Bastrop for Saturday, 3/1/08.  I <br/>
also booked a campsite and if you know you are camping you might want <br/>
to do the same.  You have to reserve by calling the TX Parks &amp; Wildlife <br/>
at 512-389-8900.  They have 38 sites suitable for tents or RV.  They <br/>
also have 18 cabins.<br/>
<br/>
Baby Bear and I have decided to make the theme TX Icons, which is <br/>
basically anything that reminds you of TX.  I thought about having a <br/>
Leap Day theme since the day before the Event is 2/29/08, but it was <br/>
too limiting.  We will also have another LB game with prizes for the <br/>
winner.<br/>
<br/>
Even though it is still a long way off, I wanted to make sure we had a <br/>
place and date to mark on our calendars.  I will send more details as <br/>
time gets closer.  I hope everyone can make it and that the weather <br/>
will be nice.<br/>
