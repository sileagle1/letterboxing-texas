                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
We were very happy to escape the snowstorm in Wisconsin yesterday.  <br/>
We were late arriving in Texas since the Milwaukee airport was closed <br/>
for several hours due to the snow.  Finally got to our hotel after <br/>
midnight, so slept in late this morning.<br/>
<br/>
Once we got going, we were very happy to be on the trails on the <br/>
north side of Lake Grapevine.  We found most of the boxes we looked <br/>
for and were impressed with the quality of the stamps!  (We also <br/>
enjoyed the oftentimes humerous clues).  We've contacted the placers <br/>
for all the boxes we found, but figured we also post a quick summary <br/>
of the boxes we attempted today:<br/>
<br/>
Moose Series - couldn't find 1st box, boxes 2-5 in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
"Mooscellaneous Moosings on the Life of Zeus - found 1st box, <br/>
couldn't find 2nd box, and found 3rd box open w/wet loggbook and no <br/>
stamp<br/>
<br/>
If You Give A Moose A Muffin Letterbox - found &amp; repaired<br/>
The Blues and the Abstract Moose - found in good shape.<br/>
The Moose-adventures of Merlin the Mooseterious - found in good shape.<br/>
Three Blind Moose - foundin good shape.<br/>
White Sail - found in good shape.<br/>
The Lone Star State - found in good shape.<br/>
<br/>
We were very happy to do our first exchanges with Texas letterboxers <br/>
when we met Mommytana and her son Pirate Bob on the trai at the <br/>
Merlin box.  It's not often that we meet other boxers out on the <br/>
trail, so this was a nice bonus today.<br/>
<br/>
We're looking forward to more hiking and boxing over the next 2.5 <br/>
days.  Thanks to all of you who have planted boxes!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
P.S.  Is there a story behind the choice of Moose for a gathering?  <br/>
We found quite a few creative boxes on this theme today, and are <br/>
curious as to how/why moose invaded the area...<br/>

<div>Shortly after Viewfinder hid her Lost Moose box and I hid my Moose Series at Lake Grapevine, we had a gathering up on the north side of the lake about fourteen months ago. The theme of the gathering was Many Meese Mini Meet (MMMM), and everyone carved moose boxes. It was amazingly fun and creative. Ruby Tuesday, who planned the meet, even made moose shaped chocolate lollypops. At the time, the lake was lower than it had been in years due to a two year, drought, but then it started to rain in the spring, and we had one of the rainiest years ever and the lake rose higher than it has been in many years. Some of those trails you were hiking today were under water and were only opened in the last couple of months. Unfortunately some of the boxes still are under water, and a few washed away!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We're so glad you're here and having a good time!</div>

<div>...Shortly after Viewfinder hid 
her Lost Moose box and I hid my Moose Series at Lake Grapevine...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That was a stamp I'd carved originally for a trip to Montana and Canada, 
with full intentions of leaving it there somewhere, but instead he wound up 
coming home with me so I found him a home at Lake Grapevine, thus, "The Lost 
Moose."  Then they moved the hiking trail and it went right beside his 
hiding place, so I moved him to another place, actually straddling the county 
lines between Denton and Tarrant Counties on the trail, so he was still "lost," 
and then the lake rose to record heights and washed him away.  I'm thinking 
he's planning to circumnavigate the globe through the Gulf of Mexico into the 
Atlantic, through Panama Canal, up the Pacific Coast and wind up back in the 
Arctic waters and somehow find his way back to Canada on his own.  Likely, 
don't you think?  Anyway, that was the original Moose box at Lake 
Grapevine, after which PuddleSplasher was inspired to create her really funny 
Moose series, and then Ruby Tuesday thought it would be a puzzle for future 
boxers in the area to discover so many Moose-inspired boxes around 
Grapevine.  Obviously, she was right!</div>
