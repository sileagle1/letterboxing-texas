                    <div class="plaintext-content">While hiking on the Appalachian Trail, most people are given their trail names by other hikers, but in letterboxing we usually pick our own trailname. I used my real name for a few months until my trailname came to me! I had been out letterboxing one afternoon in Connecticut and was driving my Jeep through a swamp. Water was flying up over the windshield and I was having the time of my life. The next morning, I was paddling my canoe in the lake with my husband and telling him about my adventure the day before. I told him how much I loved splashing around in all that water, and he said, "Driving in puddles, canoeing, hiking in the rain.... I guess you really enjoy being a Puddle Splasher", and .... there it was!<br/>
Have fun, <br/>

<div></div>
<div>Here's a link to my story - this conversation apparently came up a couple of years ago (it rolls around periodically when someone in your shoes poses the question - and it is always a good discussion, one I never tire of reading!), so you may want to check out the messages around the one I'm linking to and you'll likely get stories from boxers who aren't here any longer to tell how they got their names.</div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/message/9569">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/message/9569</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm sorry I didn't chime in when you posed this question on Newboxers. I've had a horribly hectic week, but I've enjoyed watching this discussion there and am glad it has spilled over here.I noticed that someone there said "make it pronouncable". I thought that was really good advice! Although some boxers do go by real names at gatherings, many of us do not. I much prefer the use of my trailname in a letterboxing setting. If you make it easy foryou and others to pronounce, it is more likely to stick.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I feel very comfortable with my trail name, almost as though it is my "true" name, as opposed to my "real" name which has all sorts of labels and roles assigned to it. Not that I don't like all those things, but in letterboxing I am free of all that stuff and sometimes hearing my realname makes me think something dreary like "Oh yeah, you have laundry to do". Lucy NEVER does laundry - that's one of the things I envy about her (or, err, me - or who IS writing this right now???)</div>
<div></div>
<div>When you find something you really like, you may think others will think it is silly or corny, but ifYOU like it, go with it. It's sort of like getting the opportunity to name yourself. It will speak about you, and if you put yourself out there as that being your name,everyone else willroll right along with you. </div>
<div></div>
<div>And if you try a name out and it doesn't ever seem to become a fit, don't feel like you can't change it.<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!" </div>
