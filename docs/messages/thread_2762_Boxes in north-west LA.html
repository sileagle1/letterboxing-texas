There have been 15, *count 'em* yes, 15 new boxes added or replaced, <br>
in or around Shreveport, since the first of the year.<br>
<br>
It's a great time to make a short visit to collect them. Also, if you <br>
do plan a trip to this area, send me an email and maybe we can do an <br>
exchange while you're here.<br>

<div>Several of us are planning to get up into far northeast Texas this weekend to plant, so hopefully there won't be quite such a no-man's land between us and y'all anymore!  You're welcome to come plant with us, or to plant on your side of the border moving toward us.  Of course, can't get MUCH further west of Shreveport without being IN Texas!

<br>
I am soooo looking forward to the new boxes in east TX!!! <br>
I thought I had plans for this weekend, but alas...*sigh* how things <br>
change from one day to the next around here.<br>
<br>
I don't have any stamps to plant so, I guess instead of planting I <br>
will be CARRR-VING! *Singin' Happily*<br>
<br>
Maybe I should start working on that series that's been floatin' <br>
around in my head.<br>
<br>
Anyway, ya'll have a grand time. Come see me when you can,<br>
