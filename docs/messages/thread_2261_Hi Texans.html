I'll probably spend most of my time lurking here, but I was dying to<br>
know what a blast everyone had at the Great Book Adventure.  I'm in MA.<br>

yesterday if you dressed in costume.  <br>
<br>
I'm going to plant it as a permanent box though, so that others will<br>
be able to find it (at some point when I dig out from the blizzard of<br>
boxes in my living room).  <br>
<br>
Just back from Snap Crackle & Clues.  We had a more intimate group <br>
this morning, but it was loads of fun as well.<br>
<br>
Okay, off to a baseball team party.  Will post more details when I get<br>
back!<br>
