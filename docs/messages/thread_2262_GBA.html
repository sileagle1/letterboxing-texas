We had such a wonderful time meeting everyone and seeing all those <br/>
fabulous stamps!   The storybook stroll was really wonderful and the <br/>
kids really loved discoving their favorite books on the trail.<br/>
E-bug was fascinated with the cooties, so thanks to all who provided <br/>
those.<br/>
<br/>
I knew there would be no way to get all the boxes/stamps, but I said <br/>
I'd be content if I got Darcy &amp; Elizabeth (from my favorite book and <br/>
author of all time).   When we finally figured out the right place <br/>
to look (thanks TeamKing)I was so disappointed that Lizzy was <br/>
nowhere about.   Just as I was about to give up and get the heck <br/>
outta that disgusting Loo, I spotted a flash of yellow fun foam in <br/>
the garbage can.  After a quick bath, Lizzy was presentable to see <br/>
Darcy once again.   I can't imagine someone confusing Miss Bennet <br/>
with trash - she is a lady through and through!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway --- thanks a bunch to everyone who helped make the GBA such a <br/>
fun adventure!  It's so nice to be able to put a face next to the <br/>
trail names and signature stamps now :).<br/>

<div>Now that I have finally 
cleaned out my van from the weekend's festivities I thought I would put in my 
two cents on the gathering.  I think it was great to see everyone from far 
and near, my only regret is that there was not more time to visit with each one 
of you!  Thank you to everyone who came, I hope you enjoyed your visit to 
the Houston area, we love our city, and hope you did too!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best part of the 
gathering, for me, was to see families together having so much fun.  I 
think the storybook walk was a great success (due, I am sure, mostly to the huge 
pair of underwear that housed Captain Underpants!) and I loved watching the kids 
squeal as they found each box.  My 4 &amp; 5 year olds are the ones least 
likely to cheer when I say we are going letterboxing, but they came home from 
the gathering looking at their stamps and talking about all the things they had 
found.  I also think there is a lot to be said on the power of reading to 
children, I had many conversations on the Storybook walk with grownups that 
started out, "I LOVED this book when I was little!" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best moment of the 
day (except for when it was Lightning, and NOT one of my kids, who fell in the 
water) was hearing my little boot boy bragging about how he had met "The 
Real" Silver Eagle and Baby Bear.  Even daddy of five was pretty 
impressed with seeing them in person.  It is funny how these trail names 
that started out to be so mysterious three years ago when we 
found our first letterbox have now become household names, and wonderful how all 
those "letterboxing people" have now become friends.  I hope everyone had 
as much fun as we did, and if you know anyone who could use some XXXXXXXXL 
underpants, just let me know!  MO5 </div></body></html>
