                    <html><body><p>     Once again, Silver Eagle and Baby Bear did an awesome job organizing our TALE!  It was great to see everyone, and "catch up" on all the news of the last year. I have been letterboxing for thirteen years, and it still amazes me how great a group this is! So sorry it ended on such a sad note, but we will continue to place and find boxes as we forge ahead, continuing the legacy that has made Texas Letterboxing what it is today.</p><div>      As Echo has already said....We box on!</div><div>Blue Butterfly</div></body></html>
