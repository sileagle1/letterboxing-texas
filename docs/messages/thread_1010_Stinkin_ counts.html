                    <div class="plaintext-content">Every now and then I sit down and try to figure out my<br>
PFX counts.  And once I start trying to figure it out,<br>
I remember why I don't keep up with it.<br>
<br>
Now I have a few situations that came up mainly at the<br>
gathering because everyone was so darned creative.  <br>
<br>
First of all, I'll start with the easy one.  What is<br>
the designation for a Postal LB?  I think I've used<br>
"U" (as in USPS) before, but I don't recall if that's<br>
correct.  I know I could just include them in my F<br>
count, but I don't really want to include them there<br>
because I didn't find them, they found me.<br>
<br>
Secondly, there were a couple of Hitchhiker Hostels at<br>
the gathering.  Do the hostels themselves also count<br>
as H's, or do they count as F's?  They weren't really<br>
finds because they were brought to the gathering, and<br>
they aren't really hitchhikers because they usually<br>
stay in one place.  I thought about counting them as<br>
B's for brung's-heck, I don't know.<br>
<br>
Now - travellers.  Do travellers count as exchanges or<br>
WHAT?  So if, say, I got Catpawz' stamp AND her<br>
traveller, do I count her stamp as an X and her<br>
traveller as a F?  Never mind...just looking on Silent<br>
Doug's site and that seems to be what he is saying.<br>
<br>
And as for that crazy Clue game - what the heck are<br>
all THOSE stamps???  LOL<br>
<br>
Oh yes, the Happy Birthday Texas LB.  Now, technically<br>
it is a Postal, but couldn't it also be an Event box? <br>
Okay, just kidding on that one - I'm counting it as a<br>
Postal, but I had to throw that thought out there.<br>
<br>
If going to gatherings makes my brain hurt this much,<br>
I'm gonna have to quit going to 'em - NOT!<br>
