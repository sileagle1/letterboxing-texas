I remember why I don't keep up with it.<br/>
<br/>
Now I have a few situations that came up mainly at the<br/>
gathering because everyone was so darned creative.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'll start with the easy one.  What is<br/>
the designation for a Postal LB?  I think I've used<br/>
"U" (as in USPS) before, but I don't recall if that's<br/>
correct.  I know I could just include them in my F<br/>
count, but I don't really want to include them there<br/>
because I didn't find them, they found me.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, there were a couple of Hitchhiker Hostels at<br/>
the gathering.  Do the hostels themselves also count<br/>
as H's, or do they count as F's?  They weren't really<br/>
finds because they were brought to the gathering, and<br/>
they aren't really hitchhikers because they usually<br/>
stay in one place.  I thought about counting them as<br/>
B's for brung's-heck, I don't know.<br/>
<br/>
Now - travellers.  Do travellers count as exchanges or<br/>
WHAT?  So if, say, I got Catpawz' stamp AND her<br/>
traveller, do I count her stamp as an X and her<br/>
traveller as a F?  Never mind...just looking on Silent<br/>
Doug's site and that seems to be what he is saying.<br/>
<br/>
And as for that crazy Clue game - what the heck are<br/>
all THOSE stamps???  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Oh yes, the Happy Birthday Texas LB.  Now, technically<br/>
it is a Postal, but couldn't it also be an Event box? <br/>
Okay, just kidding on that one - I'm counting it as a<br/>
Postal, but I had to throw that thought out there.<br/>
<br/>
If going to gatherings makes my brain hurt this much,<br/>
I'm gonna have to quit going to 'em - NOT!<br/>
