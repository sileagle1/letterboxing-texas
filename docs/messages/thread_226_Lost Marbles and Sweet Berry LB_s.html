geocaching, and just generally wandering around.  I checked on Lost<br>
Marbles and Sweet Berry LB's just west of Marble Falls and both are<br>
there but the log books are ruined. We are talking, like, reverted<br>
back to wood pulp mush! I cleaned out the containers and put the<br>
stamps back in and rehid them as described.<br>

I wouldn't normally post a report like this but both of these caches<br>
were reported to be missing so I thought you all might want to know<br>
otherwise.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lou and I emailed about this earlier today. The strange thing is <br>
that these boxes had been reported as missing twice and when Lou <br>
found them they weren't hidden under the big rocks where I placed <br>
them, but out in the open, more or less. I think maybe a non-<br>
letterboxer accidently found one, then looked in the other similar <br>
rock formation and found the other one too, took them, and just <br>
recently (before a good rain) returned them after reading up on <br>
letterboxing and realizing that they should be left there.<br>
 Anyway, I am glad they are back. :) Thanks again for drying them <br>
out and replacing them in their correct possitions, Lou.  Lou didn't <br>
have any paper with him, and it will be October before I  -possibly-<br>
  get up there again, so if anyone else is going to be searching for <br>
these two micro-boxes before then, I'd appreciate it if you could <br>
put some paper inside them to serve as temporary logbooks.<br>
