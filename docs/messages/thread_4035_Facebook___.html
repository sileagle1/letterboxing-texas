I don't feel very anonymous on this list anyway, but I DO feel like I have control over what anonymity I have here. It seems like an all-or-nothing thing on FB, unless you have two accounts and that is a pain in the rear!<br/>
<br/>The one thing I see as being an advantage to it for letterboxing purposes is being able to post to someone's wall when I find one of their boxes. I don't care for logging my finds online, yet I want to let placers know I've found their box, so a quick note on FB means I can fill them in relatively painlessly.<br/>

I only joined because my little brother, the brat, in Oregon, refused to let me know why he had to go to the ER one day. he said the only way I ccould  find out was to join facebook. So, I did. In case you are wondering, he cut his finger with a utility knife and had to get stitches. It would be minor, but the doctor stitched through his nail and the cut was no where near the nail, so extra pain that was unnecessary. Big baby.</div>
