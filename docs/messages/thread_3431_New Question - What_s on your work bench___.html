                    <html><body><div>NTC mentioned that we did the What's In Your Backpack? thing lately and I've been working really hard at getting my workbench in shape, so I thought we might have fun with "What's on your Work Bench? (or wherever you work at carving or logbook making)<br clear="all"/>
</div>
<div>I've sometimes teased my husband that he likens toilet paper to wealth and he wants to display ours for all to see.  We have a perfectly fine closet that it could hide in, but instead ALL the toilet paper we own sits in the package on the floor of our bathroom.  Well - my workbench must be my center of wealth - I want everything in view and in reach!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of years ago I decided I needed some space of my own where the lady of the house wouldn't get irate with me for leaving shavings on the floor or getting ink on the table or accidentally carving the furniture.  I walked about the house, inside and out, with an eye toward the perfect place.  For awhile I considered a corner in the Living Room That Isn't a Living Room where there is perfect light, but after setting up shop there, I realized I still had to deal with the shavings/ink/carving situation.  I considered a place in the corner of the yard where no one goes and I briefly considered building myself a lean-to, but that was daunting in itself and knowing how I am about finishing big projects, realized I needed space before the decade is over.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I finally did a commando raid on our garage, braving the stacks of stuff and the layers of dust.  I cleaned and cleared the corner workbench, right by the Very Dark Little Room at the back of the garage where things unknown are placed, right across the narrow walking space from the dryer, and right under the big giant open-faced fan that sounded like a 747 warming up its engines and blew gunk all over me whenever its switched was flipped (and for the record, it pulled enough power to turn off half the lights in the house too).  I staked my claim bravely and when my husband came home and discovered that I was missing inside, he took a shot on finding me in the garage (must've figured I was taking a load of clothes to the dryer) and found me there - exacto blade in hand, daring him to try to retake the workbench.  Now Fearless Fox is a wise man and he knows how to pick his battles - after 23 years of wedded bliss, he should.  He turned and walked away, but I knew it wasn't that simple.  To maintain control of the corner workbench, I was going to have to keep it occupied and filled.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well in the last months, I've been lax in guarding my space, and a couple of bicycles have been stacked in front of it, a ladder, some bottles of something were placed on the workbench and the storage shelves had eased their clutter back over near my collection of stuff.  Last weekend, I again retook the Workbench, cleaning out my craft cabinet and throwing a lot of stuff in and around it away, and taking other craft stuff stacked on the big metal shelves and placing it in the cabinet so I could make room for the intruding stuff around my Workbench.  I moved the bikes out of the way, the ladder too, and I again had my space and it was time to get things in proper order.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, my work area goes something like this:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ON THE BENCH: </div>
<div>A jar of clothes pins (I still haven't completely finished cleaning)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ink Pads-roughly 2 dozen.  They are stacked in two stacks against the back wall of the bench, and last weekend I marked the color on the side of each one with a Sharpie so I wouldn't have to keep unstacking them to find the color I wanted.  Odd that it took me that long to think of it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Baggie of index cards with cards cut down to size for LTC's.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A small vise to keep things together that are supposed to stay together.  I used it back when I backed my stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Magnifying Lamp.  A must for over-40 eyes.  In the base of it is a shallow bowl for collecting small things.  I keep my current exacto, a gouge, and a couple of pencil sharpeners there, and that's where I put things when I'm working on a project so I can reach and grab without taking my eyes off what I'm working on.  On, and one of those dental tools with the twisty ends?  It seemed like a good idea at the flea market, but I haven't found a good use for it yet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A coffee can with old markers, writing pens, a couple different awls,  I try to keep at least one of a particular writing pen that I am fond of in the can, but I am notoriously bad about stealing from myself, so this does'nt work out too well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box of Exactos. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box of gouge blades.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of cans of canned air.  Very helpful for cleaning up a project, or revealing "loose hairs" on a carving.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Large cutting board.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A stack of carving block - PZ Kut - White - B Grade, if you care.  A few other miscellaneous pieces, but mostly that.  A box with pink pearl erasers and other odd small carving chunks.  I like to keep at least 10 clean blocks on hand, in case I go into a carving frenzy and stampeaz is closed for a few days.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Somewhere on my workbench, you would find my cell phone, not that I care to take phone calls, but it is also my MP3 player and I thoroughly enjoy listening to music while I'm carving.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, several books that inspire creativity or help solve clues.  Among other things, I have a book on making books and a couple of code books I keep close by, and a writing tablet so that if I suddenly think of something to write, I don't have to go to my inside desk to do it (and frankly, I get far more inspired at my workbench than I do at my other desk).  I have a notebook with my 101 list and a few other select inspirational items in it, and a notebook for keeping notes for myself in.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>SHELVES TO MY RIGHT:</div>
<div>Since I am left-handed, anything that goes to my right is pretty much storage only.  My little bench is hemmed in by a large silver metal storage shelf and I managed to eek out some room on the shelves to keep boxes, so I have several boxes that are wanting to be placed and several that are waiting to be filled.  I also have a couple of pieces of old backer board.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>TO MY LEFT: </div>
<div>On the left side of my bench are three small storage shelves.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hitchhikers waiting to be turned loose.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A jar of corks.  A jar of corks?  Gotta put 'em somewhere.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Card file of old designs I've used in boxes and stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box of wrong stamps.  I used to keep these lined up around my workbench at eye level.  It made me smile to look at the parade of silly mistakes I made as I carved, or the moments when I made one cut too many, or I shortcutted by drawing directly on to my carving material.  I finally had to admit that there were so many boo-boos on my shelf that I needed to take them off display to allow room for other things, so I placed them in a hinged Tupperware (TM) container that has served in various capacities ever since I started letterboxing.  I have to admit - I really miss looking at my misfit army.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>India Ink and calligraphy pens.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Circle Cutter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Illuminating table for making tracing easier.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rotary cutter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A ziplok bag of brightly colored heavy cardstock.  Surely good for something!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME:</div>
<div>I have a large pegboard - with pegs:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Embroidery Hoops.  I remember using them for something to do with letterboxing, but it sure is escaping me right now!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Epoxy </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Glue gun</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sandpaper</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Extra carving tools.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Coping saws.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Floral tape.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Color - map pencils, markers (cheapo markers, not the ones we carry), watercolor pencils (have y'all used these?  They are cool!), oil crayons, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Leather punches</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Woodworking gouges</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sandpaper</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cropodile - this is a cool tool SandiBox had when she did her logbook making demo.  I just HAD to have one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, a stack of store-boughts I need to put away.  I occasionally use them, but not very often.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ON THE FLOOR:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My backpack, packed and ready to go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A plastic box that has stuff in it like patches and other things that I need to have nearby, but stashed away.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>*************************</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking at this list, I realized my backpack list was very logical and everything had a purpose.  My workbench?  Wow!  It shows my distractible nature all over it.  I guess the difference is that my workbench is the center of my creativity and my backpack is the essentials of the hunt.</div>

 building myself a lean-to, but that was daunting in itself and knowing how I am about finishing big projects, realized I needed space before the decade is over.  </div> <div> </div> <div>I finally did a commando raid on our garage, braving the stacks of stuff and the layers of dust.  I cleaned and cleared the corner workbench, right by the Very Dark Little Room at the back of the garage where things unknown are placed, right across the narrow walking space from the dryer, and right under the big giant open-faced fan that sounded like a 747 warming up its engines and blew gunk all over me whenever its switched was flipped (and for the record, it pulled enough power to turn off half the lights in the house too).  I staked my claim bravely and when my husband came home and discovered that I was missing inside, he took a shot on finding me in the garage (must've figured I was taking a load of clothes to the dryer) and found me there - exacto
 blade in hand, daring him to try to retake the workbench.  Now Fearless Fox is a wise man and he knows how to pick his battles - after 23 years of wedded bliss, he should.  He turned and walked away, but I knew it wasn't that simple.  To maintain control of the corner workbench, I was going to have to keep it occupied and filled.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Well in the last months, I've been lax in guarding my space, and a couple of bicycles have been stacked in front of it, a ladder, some bottles of something were placed on the workbench and the storage shelves had eased their clutter back over near my collection of stuff.  Last weekend, I again retook the Workbench, cleaning out my craft cabinet and throwing a lot of stuff in and around it away, and taking other craft stuff stacked on the big metal shelves and placing it in the cabinet so I could make room for the intruding stuff around my Workbench.  I moved the bikes out of the way,
 the ladder too, and I again had my space and it was time to get things in proper order.  </div> <div> </div> <div>So, my work area goes something like this:</div> <div> </div> <div>ON THE BENCH: </div> <div>A jar of clothes pins (I still haven't completely finished cleaning)</div> <div> </div> <div>Ink Pads-roughly 2 dozen.  They are stacked in two stacks against the back wall of the bench, and last weekend I marked the color on the side of each one with a Sharpie so I wouldn't have to keep unstacking them to find the color I wanted.  Odd that it took me that long to think of it!</div> <div> </div> <div>Baggie of index cards with cards cut down to size for LTC's.</div> <div> </div> <div>A small vise to keep things together that are supposed to stay together.  I used it back when I backed my stamps.</div> <div> </div> <div>Magnifying Lamp.  A must for over-40 eyes.  In the base of it is a shallow bowl
 for collecting small things.  I keep my current exacto, a gouge, and a couple of pencil sharpeners there, and that's where I put things when I'm working on a project so I can reach and grab without taking my eyes off what I'm working on.  On, and one of those dental tools with the twisty ends?  It seemed like a good idea at the flea market, but I haven't found a good use for it yet.</div> <div> </div> <div>A coffee can with old markers, writing pens, a couple different awls,  I try to keep at least one of a particular writing pen that I am fond of in the can, but I am notoriously bad about stealing from myself, so this does'nt work out too well.</div> <div> </div> <div>Box of Exactos. </div> <div> </div> <div>Box of gouge blades.</div> <div> </div> <div>A couple of cans of canned air.  Very helpful for cleaning up a project, or revealing "loose hairs" on a carving.</div> <div> </div> <div>Large cutting
 board.</div> <div> </div> <div>A stack of carving block - PZ Kut - White - B Grade, if you care.  A few other miscellaneous pieces, but mostly that.  A box with pink pearl erasers and other odd small carving chunks.  I like to keep at least 10 clean blocks on hand, in case I go into a carving frenzy and stampeaz is closed for a few days.</div> <div> </div> <div>Somewhere on my workbench, you would find my cell phone, not that I care to take phone calls, but it is also my MP3 player and I thoroughly enjoy listening to music while I'm carving.</div> <div> </div> <div>And finally, several books that inspire creativity or help solve clues.  Among other things, I have a book on making books and a couple of code books I keep close by, and a writing tablet so that if I suddenly think of something to write, I don't have to go to my inside desk to do it (and frankly, I get far more inspired at my workbench than I do at my other desk). 
 I have a notebook with my 101 list and a few other select inspirational items in it, and a notebook for keeping notes for myself in.  </div> <div> </div> <div>SHELVES TO MY RIGHT:</div> <div>Since I am left-handed, anything that goes to my right is pretty much storage only.  My little bench is hemmed in by a large silver metal storage shelf and I managed to eek out some room on the shelves to keep boxes, so I have several boxes that are wanting to be placed and several that are waiting to be filled.  I also have a couple of pieces of old backer board.  </div> <div> </div> <div>TO MY LEFT: </div> <div>On the left side of my bench are three small storage shelves.</div> <div> </div> <div>Hitchhikers waiting to be turned loose.</div> <div> </div> <div>A jar of corks.  A jar of corks?  Gotta put 'em somewhere.</div> <div> </div> <div>Card file of old designs I've used in boxes and stamps.</div>
<div> </div> <div>Box of wrong stamps.  I used to keep these lined up around my workbench at eye level.  It made me smile to look at the parade of silly mistakes I made as I carved, or the moments when I made one cut too many, or I shortcutted by drawing directly on to my carving material.  I finally had to admit that there were so many boo-boos on my shelf that I needed to take them off display to allow room for other things, so I placed them in a hinged Tupperware (TM) container that has served in various capacities ever since I started letterboxing.  I have to admit - I really miss looking at my misfit army.</div> <div> </div> <div>India Ink and calligraphy pens.</div> <div> </div> <div>Circle Cutter.</div> <div> </div> <div>Illuminating table for making tracing easier.</div> <div> </div> <div>Rotary cutter.</div> <div> </div> <div>A ziplok bag of brightly colored heavy cardstock.  Surely good for
 something!</div> <div> </div> <div>And finally, </div> <div> </div> <div>ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME:</div> <div>I have a large pegboard - with pegs:</div> <div> </div> <div>Embroidery Hoops.  I remember using them for something to do with letterboxing, but it sure is escaping me right now!</div> <div> </div> <div>Epoxy </div> <div> </div> <div>Glue gun</div> <div> </div> <div>Sandpaper</div> <div> </div> <div>Extra carving tools.</div> <div> </div> <div>Coping saws.</div> <div> </div> <div>Floral tape.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Color - map pencils, markers (cheapo markers, not the ones we carry), watercolor pencils (have y'all used these?  They are cool!), oil crayons, </div> <div> </div> <div>Leather punches</div> <div> </div> <div>Woodworking gouges</div> <div> </div> <div>Sandpaper</div> <div> </div> <div>Cropodile - this is a cool tool SandiBox had when she
 did her logbook making demo.  I just HAD to have one!</div> <div> </div> <div>And finally, a stack of store-boughts I need to put away.  I occasionally use them, but not very often.</div> <div> </div> <div>ON THE FLOOR:</div> <div> </div> <div>My backpack, packed and ready to go.</div> <div> </div> <div>A plastic box that has stuff in it like patches and other things that I need to have nearby, but stashed away.</div> <div> </div> <div>************<wbr/>*********<wbr/>****</div> <div> </div> <div>Looking at this list, I realized my backpack list was very logical and everything had a purpose.  My workbench?  Wow!  It shows my distractible nature all over it.  I guess the difference is that my workbench is the center of my creativity and my backpack is the essentials of the hunt.</div> <div> </div> <div>So who dares take inventory of THEIR work area???<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">I have a few "Work Bench" projects.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">Not really on the workbench, but in the 
computer....  The Great State of Texas - through the local Texas Parks and 
Wildlife office, has asked me to convert all the hikes I have posted on 
LocalHikes.com into a different format for their use in mapping the 
trails.  I will also need to survey and complete a form for each 
trail.  Currently, I have over 50 hikes listed.  But only about 25 in 
El Paso.  So I am slowly working on that.  I sent a message out for 
others around the state to see if they wanted to help - makes us letterboxers 
look good in their eyes - stepping up to assist.  Ann you need it a GPS 
that keeps a track-log.  Most of them do that.  If you are interested 
contact me.  I should have this project finished soon - well - within a 
month anyway.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">Here in the electronics shop, I have a $6000 9-band 
short wave transceiver waiting for one more part before I do some repairs and 
upgrades to it.  This radio allows me to contact radio operators around the 
world.  I have many friends in Europe, as I lived there for 7 years.  
And there are many soldiers both active and retired with radio equipment that I 
often speak with.  Also, it is fun to meet new people on the air and learn 
about where they live.  Ever hear of Ducie Island?  It is in the 
Pitcairn Island Chain.  Remember Mutiny on the Bounty?  I talked to 
VR6TC.  The "TC" is for Tom Christian, one of the descendants of the 
original "Bounty" crewmembers.  Cool, huh???  I also talked to KC4AAA 
- McMurdo Station.  Know where McMurdo is?  It is cold, and getting 
colder!  MIR, Space Shuttle, ISS.... yep - hams on all of 
them!</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">I have a "half-way" project running.  The first 
half of the project is in the electronics shop, but it will move to the garage 
soon.  It is a 6-band HF/VHF/UHF transceiver for my jeep.  To get it 
running I will need to install 7 antennas in the jeep.  But I have a bit of 
roof work to do to the jeep before I can install the antennas.  The last 
few parts for this radio were ordered yesterday.  It should be complete 
and ready for testing by next weekend.  I am also working toward 
getting the jeep ready for the radio and antennas.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">In the garage workbench I have the head for a 1993 Jeep 
4.0 HO-EFI motor.  I just finished grinding out the exhaust ports, then 
polishing the exhaust ports and the combustion chambers.  Over the next 
several days I will be painting the oil areas with a yellow epoxy paint.  
Soon I will ordering all the parts I need to start assembling it.  All 
the parts will go to a machine shop for fitting and balancing.  The 
balancing is the most important part.  A balanced engine - all other things 
being equal - will last 2 to 3 times longer than an unbalanced engine.  I 
will also be overhauling a better transmission for that jeep.  But I won't 
go into that as it isn't on the workbench - yet.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">At the SEWING bench, I have a few old military uniforms 
waiting.  I make shorts from the pants, and cut the sleeves off the tops to 
make "pocket vests" out of them.  After all those years in uniform I 
actually find them comfortable.  And they hold up better than most other 
clothing on the trail too.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">On a friend's workbench, we have a $4000 and raising 
repeater project.  I build the mechanical assembly, wired in the cooling 
fans, AC and DC power distribution, and mounted all the electronic assemblies in 
my garage.  His job is to wire in the audio and control circuits, then 
ready it for testing.  We will transport it up to the mountain when it is 
finished.  I will be on my way to his house right after I click SEND on 
this.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">LETTERBOXING?  Oh.....  I don't have a 
letterboxing workbench.  Everything I have listed above had exact standards 
of performance or measurement.  I can do that.  Letterboxing - 
well.... stamp carving is artistic.  I am not a very artistic person.  
And as you can see, I don't have the time to learn.  Life is busy 
enough.....</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">IN FACT.... the phone call I just got was the 
BOSS.  I have a system down.  Operations also needs assistance with 
the hydrogen purity analyzer.  Would I please go in and handle both?  
Heh heh heh - at $62 an hour..... I should say so...  Yep - no time to 
learn carving.  Maybe when I cannot hike anymore.</span></div>

<div>NTC mentioned that we did the What's In Your Backpack? thing lately and I've been working really hard at getting my workbench in shape, so I thought we might have fun with "What's on your Work Bench? (or wherever you work at carving or logbook making)<br clear="all"/>
</div>
<div>I've sometimes teased my husband that he likens toilet paper to wealth and he wants to display ours for all to see.  We have a perfectly fine closet that it could hide in, but instead ALL the toilet paper we own sits in the package on the floor of our bathroom.  Well - my workbench must be my center of wealth - I want everything in view and in reach!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Well in the last months, I've been lax in guarding my space, and a couple of bicycles have been stacked in front of it, a ladder, some bottles of something were placed on the workbench and the storage shelves had eased their clutter back over near my collection of stuff.  Last weekend, I again retook the Workbench, cleaning out my craft cabinet and throwing a lot of stuff in and around it away, and taking other craft stuff stacked on the big metal shelves and placing it in the cabinet so I could make room for the intruding stuff around my Workbench.  I moved the bikes out of the way, the ladder too, and I again had my space and it was time to get things in proper order.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, my work area goes something like this:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ON THE BENCH: </div>
<div>A jar of clothes pins (I still haven't completely finished cleaning)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ink Pads-roughly 2 dozen.  They are stacked in two stacks against the back wall of the bench, and last weekend I marked the color on the side of each one with a Sharpie so I wouldn't have to keep unstacking them to find the color I wanted.  Odd that it took me that long to think of it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Baggie of index cards with cards cut down to size for LTC's.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A small vise to keep things together that are supposed to stay together.  I used it back when I backed my stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Magnifying Lamp.  A must for over-40 eyes.  In the base of it is a shallow bowl for collecting small things.  I keep my current exacto, a gouge, and a couple of pencil sharpeners there, and that's where I put things when I'm working on a project so I can reach and grab without taking my eyes off what I'm working on.  On, and one of those dental tools with the twisty ends?  It seemed like a good idea at the flea market, but I haven't found a good use for it yet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A coffee can with old markers, writing pens, a couple different awls,  I try to keep at least one of a particular writing pen that I am fond of in the can, but I am notoriously bad about stealing from myself, so this does'nt work out too well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box of Exactos. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box of gouge blades.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of cans of canned air.  Very helpful for cleaning up a project, or revealing "loose hairs" on a carving.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Large cutting board.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A stack of carving block - PZ Kut - White - B Grade, if you care.  A few other miscellaneous pieces, but mostly that.  A box with pink pearl erasers and other odd small carving chunks.  I like to keep at least 10 clean blocks on hand, in case I go into a carving frenzy and stampeaz is closed for a few days.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Somewhere on my workbench, you would find my cell phone, not that I care to take phone calls, but it is also my MP3 player and I thoroughly enjoy listening to music while I'm carving.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, several books that inspire creativity or help solve clues.  Among other things, I have a book on making books and a couple of code books I keep close by, and a writing tablet so that if I suddenly think of something to write, I don't have to go to my inside desk to do it (and frankly, I get far more inspired at my workbench than I do at my other desk).  I have a notebook with my 101 list and a few other select inspirational items in it, and a notebook for keeping notes for myself in.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>SHELVES TO MY RIGHT:</div>
<div>Since I am left-handed, anything that goes to my right is pretty much storage only.  My little bench is hemmed in by a large silver metal storage shelf and I managed to eek out some room on the shelves to keep boxes, so I have several boxes that are wanting to be placed and several that are waiting to be filled.  I also have a couple of pieces of old backer board.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>TO MY LEFT: </div>
<div>On the left side of my bench are three small storage shelves.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hitchhikers waiting to be turned loose.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A jar of corks.  A jar of corks?  Gotta put 'em somewhere.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Card file of old designs I've used in boxes and stamps.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box of wrong stamps.  I used to keep these lined up around my workbench at eye level.  It made me smile to look at the parade of silly mistakes I made as I carved, or the moments when I made one cut too many, or I shortcutted by drawing directly on to my carving material.  I finally had to admit that there were so many boo-boos on my shelf that I needed to take them off display to allow room for other things, so I placed them in a hinged Tupperware (TM) container that has served in various capacities ever since I started letterboxing.  I have to admit - I really miss looking at my misfit army.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>India Ink and calligraphy pens.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Circle Cutter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Illuminating table for making tracing easier.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rotary cutter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A ziplok bag of brightly colored heavy cardstock.  Surely good for something!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME:</div>
<div>I have a large pegboard - with pegs:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Embroidery Hoops.  I remember using them for something to do with letterboxing, but it sure is escaping me right now!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Epoxy </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Glue gun</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sandpaper</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Extra carving tools.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Coping saws.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Floral tape.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Color - map pencils, markers (cheapo markers, not the ones we carry), watercolor pencils (have y'all used these?  They are cool!), oil crayons, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Leather punches</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Woodworking gouges</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sandpaper</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Cropodile - this is a cool tool SandiBox had when she did her logbook making demo.  I just HAD to have one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, a stack of store-boughts I need to put away.  I occasionally use them, but not very often.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>ON THE FLOOR:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My backpack, packed and ready to go.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A plastic box that has stuff in it like patches and other things that I need to have nearby, but stashed away.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>*************************</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking at this list, I realized my backpack list was very logical and everything had a purpose.  My workbench?  Wow!  It shows my distractible nature all over it.  I guess the difference is that my workbench is the center of my creativity and my backpack is the essentials of the hunt.</div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">I have a few "Work Bench" projects.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">Not really on the workbench, but in the computer....  The Great State of Texas - through the local Texas Parks and Wildlife office, has asked me to convert all the hikes I have posted on LocalHikes.com into a different format for their use in mapping the trails.  I will also need to survey and complete a form for each trail.  Currently, I have over 50 hikes listed.  But only about 25 in El Paso.  So I am slowly working on that.  I sent a message out for others around the state to see if they wanted to help - makes us letterboxers look good in their eyes - stepping up to assist.  Ann you need it a GPS that keeps a track-log.  Most of them do that.  If you are interested contact me.  I should have this project finished soon - well - within a month anyway.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">Here in the electronics shop, I have a $6000 9-band short wave transceiver waiting for one more part before I do some repairs and upgrades to it.  This radio allows me to contact radio operators around the world.  I have many friends in Europe, as I lived there for 7 years.  And there are many soldiers both active and retired with radio equipment that I often speak with.  Also, it is fun to meet new people on the air and learn about where they live.  Ever hear of Ducie Island?  It is in the Pitcairn Island Chain.  Remember Mutiny on the Bounty?  I talked to VR6TC.  The "TC" is for Tom Christian, one of the descendants of the original "Bounty" crewmembers.  Cool, huh???  I also talked to KC4AAA - McMurdo Station.  Know where McMurdo is?  It is cold, and getting colder!  MIR, Space Shuttle, ISS.... yep - hams on all of them!</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">I have a "half-way" project running.  The first half of the project is in the electronics shop, but it will move to the garage soon.  It is a 6-band HF/VHF/UHF transceiver for my jeep.  To get it running I will need to install 7 antennas in the jeep.  But I have a bit of roof work to do to the jeep before I can install the antennas.  The last few parts for this radio were ordered yesterday.  It should be complete and ready for testing by next weekend.  I am also working toward getting the jeep ready for the radio and antennas.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">In the garage workbench I have the head for a 1993 Jeep 4.0 HO-EFI motor.  I just finished grinding out the exhaust ports, then polishing the exhaust ports and the combustion chambers.  Over the next several days I will be painting the oil areas with a yellow epoxy paint.  Soon I will ordering all the parts I need to start assembling it.  All the parts will go to a machine shop for fitting and balancing.  The balancing is the most important part.  A balanced engine - all other things being equal - will last 2 to 3 times longer than an unbalanced engine.  I will also be overhauling a better transmission for that jeep.  But I won't go into that as it isn't on the workbench - yet.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">At the SEWING bench, I have a few old military uniforms waiting.  I make shorts from the pants, and cut the sleeves off the tops to make "pocket vests" out of them.  After all those years in uniform I actually find them comfortable.  And they hold up better than most other clothing on the trail too.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">On a friend's workbench, we have a $4000 and raising repeater project.  I build the mechanical assembly, wired in the cooling fans, AC and DC power distribution, and mounted all the electronic assemblies in my garage.  His job is to wire in the audio and control circuits, then ready it for testing.  We will transport it up to the mountain when it is finished.  I will be on my way to his house right after I click SEND on this.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">LETTERBOXING?  Oh.....  I don't have a letterboxing workbench.  Everything I have listed above had exact standards of performance or measurement.  I can do that.  Letterboxing - well.... stamp carving is artistic.  I am not a very artistic person.  And as you can see, I don't have the time to learn.  Life is busy enough.....</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="751152314-22032008">IN FACT.... the phone call I just got was the BOSS.  I have a system down.  Operations also needs assistance with the hydrogen purity analyzer.  Would I please go in and handle both?  Heh heh heh - at $62 an hour..... I should say so...  Yep - no time to learn carving.  Maybe when I cannot hike anymore.</span></div>

my "workbench" is my computer table, and the trashcan is at my feet <br/>

carving pad is a nice thick Architectural Digest magazine, and my tub <br/>
o'stuff moves with me wherever I'm working:  all the carving tools, <br/>
carving media, logbook-making supplies, markers, assorted tools and <br/>
essentials kept therein.  Also close at hand while I'm working: a <br/>
glass of iced tea (or something stronger if I'm not planning on using <br/>
that Exacto knife, being somewhat knife-phobic). Or, my "workbench" <br/>
might the table out on the deck in the sun, and of course, the tub <br/>
o'stuff can go out there, too! I won't bore you all with a precise <br/>
list of items in the tub o'stuff.  <br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; NTC mentioned that we did the What's In Your Backpack? thing lately <br/>
and I've<br/>
&gt; been working really hard at getting my workbench in shape, so I <br/>
thought we<br/>
&gt; might have fun with "What's on your Work Bench? (or wherever you <br/>
work at<br/>
&gt; carving or logbook making)<br/>
&gt; I've sometimes teased my husband that he likens toilet paper to <br/>
wealth and<br/>
&gt; he wants to display ours for all to see.  We have a perfectly fine <br/>
closet<br/>
&gt; that it could hide in, but instead ALL the toilet paper we own sits <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; package on the floor of our bathroom.  Well - my workbench must be <br/>
my center<br/>
&gt; of wealth - I want everything in view and in reach!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A couple of years ago I decided I needed some space of my own where <br/>
the lady<br/>
&gt; of the house wouldn't get irate with me for leaving shavings on the <br/>
floor or<br/>
&gt; getting ink on the table or accidentally carving the furniture.  I <br/>
walked<br/>
&gt; about the house, inside and out, with an eye toward the perfect <br/>
place.  For<br/>
&gt; awhile I considered a corner in the Living Room That Isn't a Living <br/>
Room<br/>
&gt; where there is perfect light, but after setting up shop there, I <br/>
realized I<br/>
&gt; still had to deal with the shavings/ink/carving situation.  I <br/>
considered a<br/>
&gt; place in the corner of the yard where no one goes and I briefly <br/>
considered<br/>
&gt; building myself a lean-to, but that was daunting in itself and <br/>
knowing how I<br/>
&gt; am about finishing big projects, realized I needed space before the <br/>
decade<br/>
&gt; is over.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I finally did a commando raid on our garage, braving the stacks of <br/>
stuff and<br/>
&gt; the layers of dust.  I cleaned and cleared the corner workbench, <br/>
right by<br/>
&gt; the Very Dark Little Room at the back of the garage where things <br/>
unknown are<br/>
&gt; placed, right across the narrow walking space from the dryer, and <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; under the big giant open-faced fan that sounded like a 747 warming <br/>
up its<br/>
&gt; engines and blew gunk all over me whenever its switched was flipped <br/>
(and for<br/>
&gt; the record, it pulled enough power to turn off half the lights in <br/>
the house<br/>
&gt; too).  I staked my claim bravely and when my husband came home and<br/>
&gt; discovered that I was missing inside, he took a shot on finding me <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; garage (must've figured I was taking a load of clothes to the <br/>
dryer) and<br/>
&gt; found me there - exacto blade in hand, daring him to try to retake <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; workbench.  Now Fearless Fox is a wise man and he knows how to pick <br/>
his<br/>
&gt; battles - after 23 years of wedded bliss, he should.  He turned and <br/>
walked<br/>
&gt; away, but I knew it wasn't that simple.  To maintain control of the <br/>
corner<br/>
&gt; workbench, I was going to have to keep it occupied and filled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well in the last months, I've been lax in guarding my space, and a <br/>
couple of<br/>
&gt; bicycles have been stacked in front of it, a ladder, some bottles of<br/>
&gt; something were placed on the workbench and the storage shelves had <br/>
eased<br/>
&gt; their clutter back over near my collection of stuff.  Last weekend, <br/>
I again<br/>
&gt; retook the Workbench, cleaning out my craft cabinet and throwing a <br/>
lot of<br/>
&gt; stuff in and around it away, and taking other craft stuff stacked <br/>
on the big<br/>
&gt; metal shelves and placing it in the cabinet so I could make room <br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; intruding stuff around my Workbench.  I moved the bikes out of the <br/>
way, the<br/>
&gt; ladder too, and I again had my space and it was time to get things <br/>
in proper<br/>
&gt; order.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my work area goes something like this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ON THE BENCH:<br/>
&gt; A jar of clothes pins (I still haven't completely finished cleaning)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ink Pads-roughly 2 dozen.  They are stacked in two stacks against <br/>
the back<br/>
&gt; wall of the bench, and last weekend I marked the color on the side <br/>
of each<br/>
&gt; one with a Sharpie so I wouldn't have to keep unstacking them to <br/>
find the<br/>
&gt; color I wanted.  Odd that it took me that long to think of it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Baggie of index cards with cards cut down to size for LTC's.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A small vise to keep things together that are supposed to stay <br/>
together.  I<br/>
&gt; used it back when I backed my stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Magnifying Lamp.  A must for over-40 eyes.  In the base of it is a <br/>
shallow<br/>
&gt; bowl for collecting small things.  I keep my current exacto, a <br/>
gouge, and a<br/>
&gt; couple of pencil sharpeners there, and that's where I put things <br/>
when I'm<br/>
&gt; working on a project so I can reach and grab without taking my eyes <br/>
off what<br/>
&gt; I'm working on.  On, and one of those dental tools with the twisty <br/>
ends?  It<br/>
&gt; seemed like a good idea at the flea market, but I haven't found a <br/>
good use<br/>
&gt; for it yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A coffee can with old markers, writing pens, a couple different <br/>
awls,  I try<br/>
&gt; to keep at least one of a particular writing pen that I am fond of <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; can, but I am notoriously bad about stealing from myself, so this <br/>
does'nt<br/>
&gt; work out too well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box of Exactos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box of gouge blades.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A couple of cans of canned air.  Very helpful for cleaning up a <br/>
project, or<br/>
&gt; revealing "loose hairs" on a carving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Large cutting board.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A stack of carving block - PZ Kut - White - B Grade, if you care.  <br/>
A few<br/>
&gt; other miscellaneous pieces, but mostly that.  A box with pink pearl <br/>
erasers<br/>
&gt; and other odd small carving chunks.  I like to keep at least 10 <br/>
clean blocks<br/>
&gt; on hand, in case I go into a carving frenzy and stampeaz is closed <br/>
for a few<br/>
&gt; days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Somewhere on my workbench, you would find my cell phone, not that I <br/>
care to<br/>
&gt; take phone calls, but it is also my MP3 player and I thoroughly <br/>
enjoy<br/>
&gt; listening to music while I'm carving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, several books that inspire creativity or help solve <br/>
clues.<br/>
&gt; Among other things, I have a book on making books and a couple of <br/>
code books<br/>
&gt; I keep close by, and a writing tablet so that if I suddenly think of<br/>
&gt; something to write, I don't have to go to my inside desk to do it <br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; frankly, I get far more inspired at my workbench than I do at my <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; desk).  I have a notebook with my 101 list and a few other select<br/>
&gt; inspirational items in it, and a notebook for keeping notes for <br/>
myself in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SHELVES TO MY RIGHT:<br/>
&gt; Since I am left-handed, anything that goes to my right is pretty <br/>
much<br/>
&gt; storage only.  My little bench is hemmed in by a large silver metal <br/>
storage<br/>
&gt; shelf and I managed to eek out some room on the shelves to keep <br/>
boxes, so I<br/>
&gt; have several boxes that are wanting to be placed and several that <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; waiting to be filled.  I also have a couple of pieces of old backer <br/>
board.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; TO MY LEFT:<br/>
&gt; On the left side of my bench are three small storage shelves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hitchhikers waiting to be turned loose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A jar of corks.  A jar of corks?  Gotta put 'em somewhere.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Card file of old designs I've used in boxes and stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box of wrong stamps.  I used to keep these lined up around my <br/>
workbench at<br/>
&gt; eye level.  It made me smile to look at the parade of silly <br/>
mistakes I made<br/>
&gt; as I carved, or the moments when I made one cut too many, or I <br/>
shortcutted<br/>
&gt; by drawing directly on to my carving material.  I finally had to <br/>
admit that<br/>
&gt; there were so many boo-boos on my shelf that I needed to take them <br/>
off<br/>
&gt; display to allow room for other things, so I placed them in a hinged<br/>
&gt; Tupperware (TM) container that has served in various capacities <br/>
ever since I<br/>
&gt; started letterboxing.  I have to admit - I really miss looking at <br/>
my misfit<br/>
&gt; army.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; India Ink and calligraphy pens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Circle Cutter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Illuminating table for making tracing easier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rotary cutter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A ziplok bag of brightly colored heavy cardstock.  Surely good for<br/>
&gt; something!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Epoxy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glue gun<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandpaper<br/>

&gt; Extra carving tools.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Coping saws.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Leather punches<br/>

&gt; Woodworking gouges<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandpaper<br/>

&gt; Cropodile - this is a cool tool SandiBox had when she did her <br/>
logbook making<br/>

occasionally<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; ON THE FLOOR:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My backpack, packed and ready to go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A plastic box that has stuff in it like patches and other things <br/>
that I need<br/>
&gt; to have nearby, but stashed away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *************************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking at this list, I realized my backpack list was very logical <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; everything had a purpose.  My workbench?  Wow!  It shows my <br/>
distractible<br/>
&gt; nature all over it.  I guess the difference is that my workbench is <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; center of my creativity and my backpack is the essentials of the <br/>
hunt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So who dares take inventory of THEIR work area???<br/>

<p>OK, I'll weigh in on this one. If my "workbench" is my kitchen <br/>table, 
  I'll move the salt and pepper and tablecloth or placemats <br/>before I spread

  mentioned that we did the What's In Your Backpack? thing lately <br/>and 
  I've<br/>&gt; been working really hard at getting my workbench in shape, so I 
  <br/>thought we<br/>&gt; might have fun with "What's on your Work Bench? (or 
  wherever you <br/>work at<br/>&gt; carving or logbook making)<br/>&gt; I've 
  sometimes teased my husband that he likens toilet paper to <br/>wealth 
  and<br/>&gt; he wants to display ours for all to see. We have a perfectly fine 
  <br/>closet<br/>&gt; that it could hide in, but instead ALL the toilet paper we 
  own sits <br/>in the<br/>&gt; package on the floor of our bathroom. Well - my 
  workbench must be <br/>my center<br/>&gt; of wealth - I want everything in view 
  and in reach!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A couple of years ago I decided I needed some 
  space of my own where <br/>the lady<br/>&gt; of the house wouldn't get irate 
  with me for leaving shavings on the <br/>floor or<br/>&gt; getting ink on the 
  table or accidentally carving the furniture. I <br/>walked<br/>&gt; about the 
  house, inside and out, with an eye toward the perfect <br/>place. For<br/>&gt; 
  awhile I considered a corner in the Living Room That Isn't a Living 
  <br/>Room<br/>&gt; where there is perfect light, but after setting up shop 
  there, I <br/>realized I<br/>&gt; still had to deal with the 
  shavings/ink/<wbr/>carving situation. I <br/>considered a<br/>&gt; place in the 
  corner of the yard where no one goes and I briefly <br/>considered<br/>&gt; 
  building myself a lean-to, but that was daunting in itself and <br/>knowing how 
  I<br/>&gt; am about finishing big projects, realized I needed space before the 
  <br/>decade<br/>&gt; is over.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I finally did a commando raid on 
  our garage, braving the stacks of <br/>stuff and<br/>&gt; the layers of dust. I 
  cleaned and cleared the corner workbench, <br/>right by<br/>&gt; the Very Dark 
  Little Room at the back of the garage where things <br/>unknown are<br/>&gt; 
  placed, right across the narrow walking space from the dryer, and 
  <br/>right<br/>&gt; under the big giant open-faced fan that sounded like a 747 
  warming <br/>up its<br/>&gt; engines and blew gunk all over me whenever its 
  switched was flipped <br/>(and for<br/>&gt; the record, it pulled enough power 
  to turn off half the lights in <br/>the house<br/>&gt; too). I staked my claim 
  bravely and when my husband came home and<br/>&gt; discovered that I was 
  missing inside, he took a shot on finding me <br/>in the<br/>&gt; garage 
  (must've figured I was taking a load of clothes to the <br/>dryer) and<br/>&gt; 
  found me there - exacto blade in hand, daring him to try to retake 
  <br/>the<br/>&gt; workbench. Now Fearless Fox is a wise man and he knows how to 
  pick <br/>his<br/>&gt; battles - after 23 years of wedded bliss, he should. He 
  turned and <br/>walked<br/>&gt; away, but I knew it wasn't that simple. To 
  maintain control of the <br/>corner<br/>&gt; workbench, I was going to have to 
  keep it occupied and filled.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Well in the last months, I've 
  been lax in guarding my space, and a <br/>couple of<br/>&gt; bicycles have been 
  stacked in front of it, a ladder, some bottles of<br/>&gt; something were 
  placed on the workbench and the storage shelves had <br/>eased<br/>&gt; their 
  clutter back over near my collection of stuff. Last weekend, <br/>I 
  again<br/>&gt; retook the Workbench, cleaning out my craft cabinet and throwing 
  a <br/>lot of<br/>&gt; stuff in and around it away, and taking other craft stuff 
  stacked <br/>on the big<br/>&gt; metal shelves and placing it in the cabinet so 
  I could make room <br/>for the<br/>&gt; intruding stuff around my Workbench. I 
  moved the bikes out of the <br/>way, the<br/>&gt; ladder too, and I again had my 
  space and it was time to get things <br/>in proper<br/>&gt; order.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; So, my work area goes something like this:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ON THE 
  BENCH:<br/>&gt; A jar of clothes pins (I still haven't completely finished 
  cleaning)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Ink Pads-roughly 2 dozen. They are stacked in two 
  stacks against <br/>the back<br/>&gt; wall of the bench, and last weekend I 
  marked the color on the side <br/>of each<br/>&gt; one with a Sharpie so I 
  wouldn't have to keep unstacking them to <br/>find the<br/>&gt; color I wanted. 
  Odd that it took me that long to think of it!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Baggie of index 
  cards with cards cut down to size for LTC's.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A small vise to 
  keep things together that are supposed to stay <br/>together. I<br/>&gt; used it 
  back when I backed my stamps.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Magnifying Lamp. A must for 
  over-40 eyes. In the base of it is a <br/>shallow<br/>&gt; bowl for collecting 
  small things. I keep my current exacto, a <br/>gouge, and a<br/>&gt; couple of 
  pencil sharpeners there, and that's where I put things <br/>when I'm<br/>&gt; 
  working on a project so I can reach and grab without taking my eyes <br/>off 
  what<br/>&gt; I'm working on. On, and one of those dental tools with the twisty 
  <br/>ends? It<br/>&gt; seemed like a good idea at the flea market, but I haven't 
  found a <br/>good use<br/>&gt; for it yet.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A coffee can with 
  old markers, writing pens, a couple different <br/>awls, I try<br/>&gt; to keep 
  at least one of a particular writing pen that I am fond of <br/>in the<br/>&gt; 
  can, but I am notoriously bad about stealing from myself, so this 
  <br/>does'nt<br/>&gt; work out too well.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Box of 
  Exactos.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Box of gouge blades.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A couple of 
  cans of canned air. Very helpful for cleaning up a <br/>project, or<br/>&gt; 
  revealing "loose hairs" on a carving.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Large cutting 
  board.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A stack of carving block - PZ Kut - White - B Grade, 
  if you care. <br/>A few<br/>&gt; other miscellaneous pieces, but mostly that. A 
  box with pink pearl <br/>erasers<br/>&gt; and other odd small carving chunks. I 
  like to keep at least 10 <br/>clean blocks<br/>&gt; on hand, in case I go into a 
  carving frenzy and stampeaz is closed <br/>for a few<br/>&gt; days.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Somewhere on my workbench, you would find my cell phone, not that I 
  <br/>care to<br/>&gt; take phone calls, but it is also my MP3 player and I 
  thoroughly <br/>enjoy<br/>&gt; listening to music while I'm carving.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; And finally, several books that inspire creativity or help solve 
  <br/>clues.<br/>&gt; Among other things, I have a book on making books and a 
  couple of <br/>code books<br/>&gt; I keep close by, and a writing tablet so that 
  if I suddenly think of<br/>&gt; something to write, I don't have to go to my 
  inside desk to do it <br/>(and<br/>&gt; frankly, I get far more inspired at my 
  workbench than I do at my <br/>other<br/>&gt; desk). I have a notebook with my 
  101 list and a few other select<br/>&gt; inspirational items in it, and a 
  notebook for keeping notes for <br/>myself in.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; SHELVES TO MY 
  RIGHT:<br/>&gt; Since I am left-handed, anything that goes to my right is 
  pretty <br/>much<br/>&gt; storage only. My little bench is hemmed in by a large 
  silver metal <br/>storage<br/>&gt; shelf and I managed to eek out some room on 
  the shelves to keep <br/>boxes, so I<br/>&gt; have several boxes that are 
  wanting to be placed and several that <br/>are<br/>&gt; waiting to be filled. I 
  also have a couple of pieces of old backer <br/>board.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; TO MY 
  LEFT:<br/>&gt; On the left side of my bench are three small storage 
  shelves.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Hitchhikers waiting to be turned loose.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; A jar of corks. A jar of corks? Gotta put 'em somewhere.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Card file of old designs I've used in boxes and stamps.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Box of wrong stamps. I used to keep these lined up around my 
  <br/>workbench at<br/>&gt; eye level. It made me smile to look at the parade of 
  silly <br/>mistakes I made<br/>&gt; as I carved, or the moments when I made one 
  cut too many, or I <br/>shortcutted<br/>&gt; by drawing directly on to my 
  carving material. I finally had to <br/>admit that<br/>&gt; there were so many 
  boo-boos on my shelf that I needed to take them <br/>off<br/>&gt; display to 
  allow room for other things, so I placed them in a hinged<br/>&gt; Tupperware 
  (TM) container that has served in various capacities <br/>ever since I<br/>&gt; 
  started letterboxing. I have to admit - I really miss looking at <br/>my 
  misfit<br/>&gt; army.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; India Ink and calligraphy pens.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Circle Cutter.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Illuminating table for making tracing 
  easier.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Rotary cutter.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; A ziplok bag of 
  brightly colored heavy cardstock. Surely good for<br/>&gt; something!<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; And finally,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME:<br/>&gt; I 
  have a large pegboard - with pegs:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Embroidery Hoops. I

&gt; the layers of dust.  I cleaned and cleared the corner workbench, <br/>
right by<br/>
&gt; the Very Dark Little Room at the back of the garage where things <br/>
unknown are<br/>
&gt; placed, right across the narrow walking space from the dryer, and <br/>
right<br/>
&gt; under the big giant open-faced fan that sounded like a 747 warming <br/>
up its<br/>
&gt; engines and blew gunk all over me whenever its switched was flipped <br/>
(and for<br/>
&gt; the record, it pulled enough power to turn off half the lights in <br/>
the house<br/>
&gt; too).  I staked my claim bravely and when my husband came home and<br/>
&gt; discovered that I was missing inside, he took a shot on finding me <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; garage (must've figured I was taking a load of clothes to the <br/>
dryer) and<br/>
&gt; found me there - exacto blade in hand, daring him to try to retake <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; workbench.  Now Fearless Fox is a wise man and he knows how to pick <br/>
his<br/>
&gt; battles - after 23 years of wedded bliss, he should.  He turned and <br/>
walked<br/>
&gt; away, but I knew it wasn't that simple.  To maintain control of the <br/>
corner<br/>
&gt; workbench, I was going to have to keep it occupied and filled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well in the last months, I've been lax in guarding my space, and a <br/>
couple of<br/>
&gt; bicycles have been stacked in front of it, a ladder, some bottles of<br/>
&gt; something were placed on the workbench and the storage shelves had <br/>
eased<br/>
&gt; their clutter back over near my collection of stuff.  Last weekend, <br/>
I again<br/>
&gt; retook the Workbench, cleaning out my craft cabinet and throwing a <br/>
lot of<br/>
&gt; stuff in and around it away, and taking other craft stuff stacked <br/>
on the big<br/>
&gt; metal shelves and placing it in the cabinet so I could make room <br/>
for the<br/>
&gt; intruding stuff around my Workbench.  I moved the bikes out of the <br/>
way, the<br/>
&gt; ladder too, and I again had my space and it was time to get things <br/>
in proper<br/>
&gt; order.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, my work area goes something like this:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ON THE BENCH:<br/>
&gt; A jar of clothes pins (I still haven't completely finished cleaning)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ink Pads-roughly 2 dozen.  They are stacked in two stacks against <br/>
the back<br/>
&gt; wall of the bench, and last weekend I marked the color on the side <br/>
of each<br/>
&gt; one with a Sharpie so I wouldn't have to keep unstacking them to <br/>
find the<br/>
&gt; color I wanted.  Odd that it took me that long to think of it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Baggie of index cards with cards cut down to size for LTC's.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A small vise to keep things together that are supposed to stay <br/>
together.  I<br/>
&gt; used it back when I backed my stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Magnifying Lamp.  A must for over-40 eyes.  In the base of it is a <br/>
shallow<br/>
&gt; bowl for collecting small things.  I keep my current exacto, a <br/>
gouge, and a<br/>
&gt; couple of pencil sharpeners there, and that's where I put things <br/>
when I'm<br/>
&gt; working on a project so I can reach and grab without taking my eyes <br/>
off what<br/>
&gt; I'm working on.  On, and one of those dental tools with the twisty <br/>
ends?  It<br/>
&gt; seemed like a good idea at the flea market, but I haven't found a <br/>
good use<br/>
&gt; for it yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A coffee can with old markers, writing pens, a couple different <br/>
awls,  I try<br/>
&gt; to keep at least one of a particular writing pen that I am fond of <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; can, but I am notoriously bad about stealing from myself, so this <br/>
does'nt<br/>
&gt; work out too well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box of Exactos.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box of gouge blades.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A couple of cans of canned air.  Very helpful for cleaning up a <br/>
project, or<br/>
&gt; revealing "loose hairs" on a carving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Large cutting board.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A stack of carving block - PZ Kut - White - B Grade, if you care.  <br/>
A few<br/>
&gt; other miscellaneous pieces, but mostly that.  A box with pink pearl <br/>
erasers<br/>
&gt; and other odd small carving chunks.  I like to keep at least 10 <br/>
clean blocks<br/>
&gt; on hand, in case I go into a carving frenzy and stampeaz is closed <br/>
for a few<br/>
&gt; days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Somewhere on my workbench, you would find my cell phone, not that I <br/>
care to<br/>
&gt; take phone calls, but it is also my MP3 player and I thoroughly <br/>
enjoy<br/>
&gt; listening to music while I'm carving.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, several books that inspire creativity or help solve <br/>
clues.<br/>
&gt; Among other things, I have a book on making books and a couple of <br/>
code books<br/>
&gt; I keep close by, and a writing tablet so that if I suddenly think of<br/>
&gt; something to write, I don't have to go to my inside desk to do it <br/>
(and<br/>
&gt; frankly, I get far more inspired at my workbench than I do at my <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; desk).  I have a notebook with my 101 list and a few other select<br/>
&gt; inspirational items in it, and a notebook for keeping notes for <br/>
myself in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SHELVES TO MY RIGHT:<br/>
&gt; Since I am left-handed, anything that goes to my right is pretty <br/>
much<br/>
&gt; storage only.  My little bench is hemmed in by a large silver metal <br/>
storage<br/>
&gt; shelf and I managed to eek out some room on the shelves to keep <br/>
boxes, so I<br/>
&gt; have several boxes that are wanting to be placed and several that <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; waiting to be filled.  I also have a couple of pieces of old backer <br/>
board.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; TO MY LEFT:<br/>
&gt; On the left side of my bench are three small storage shelves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hitchhikers waiting to be turned loose.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A jar of corks.  A jar of corks?  Gotta put 'em somewhere.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Card file of old designs I've used in boxes and stamps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Box of wrong stamps.  I used to keep these lined up around my <br/>
workbench at<br/>
&gt; eye level.  It made me smile to look at the parade of silly <br/>
mistakes I made<br/>
&gt; as I carved, or the moments when I made one cut too many, or I <br/>
shortcutted<br/>
&gt; by drawing directly on to my carving material.  I finally had to <br/>
admit that<br/>
&gt; there were so many boo-boos on my shelf that I needed to take them <br/>
off<br/>
&gt; display to allow room for other things, so I placed them in a hinged<br/>
&gt; Tupperware (TM) container that has served in various capacities <br/>
ever since I<br/>
&gt; started letterboxing.  I have to admit - I really miss looking at <br/>
my misfit<br/>
&gt; army.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; India Ink and calligraphy pens.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Circle Cutter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Illuminating table for making tracing easier.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rotary cutter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A ziplok bag of brightly colored heavy cardstock.  Surely good for<br/>
&gt; something!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ON THE WALL IN FRONT OF ME:<br/>
&gt; I have a large pegboard - with pegs:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Embroidery Hoops.  I remember using them for something to do with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, but it sure is escaping me right now!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Epoxy<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Glue gun<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandpaper<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Extra carving tools.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Coping saws.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Floral tape.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Color - map pencils, markers (cheapo markers, not the ones we <br/>
carry),<br/>
&gt; watercolor pencils (have y'all used these?  They are cool!), oil <br/>
crayons,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Leather punches<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Woodworking gouges<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sandpaper<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cropodile - this is a cool tool SandiBox had when she did her <br/>
logbook making<br/>
&gt; demo.  I just HAD to have one!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, a stack of store-boughts I need to put away.  I <br/>
occasionally<br/>
&gt; use them, but not very often.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ON THE FLOOR:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My backpack, packed and ready to go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A plastic box that has stuff in it like patches and other things <br/>
that I need<br/>
&gt; to have nearby, but stashed away.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *************************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Looking at this list, I realized my backpack list was very logical <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; everything had a purpose.  My workbench?  Wow!  It shows my <br/>
distractible<br/>
&gt; nature all over it.  I guess the difference is that my workbench is <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; center of my creativity and my backpack is the essentials of the <br/>
hunt.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So who dares take inventory of THEIR work area???<br/>

I do most of my tight linework with the Staedtler v-gouge, and smaller<br/>
circular shapes are done with the smallest of my Micro gouges.<br/>
<br/>
I think I have the smallest set, but I've long since lost any<br/>
packaging that came with those tools.<br/>
<br/>
Really, for me, tiny detail isn't the goal. I strive for a balanced<br/>
composition, but I'm just happy if I don't do a horrible hack job on<br/>
my carving.<br/>

embarassed to answer!<br/>
<br/>
I have a craft room in my house.  That's what we call it - The Craft <br/>
Room.  Problem is, you can't even walk into the room right now.  <br/>
Because in addition to all the crafty stuff in there... everything <br/>
from Acrylic paint to Zebra-striped felt... this room has also become <br/>
the catch-all for the stuff that doesn't have a home.  "Oh, just <br/>
throw it into the craft room for now." (And oh how I wish my family <br/>
wouldn't take that throwing part literally!) I keep promising to <br/>
clean it out, but it's an overwhelming job that I just can't bring <br/>
myself to start.<br/>
<br/>
And so my letterboxing supplies have taken over the dining room. If <br/>
it all fit into a tote, it wouldn't be so embarassing.  But I have <br/>
several crates, boxes and totes full of stuff.  Just at a glance I <br/>
see:<br/>
<br/>
Decorative paper - two crates full, "borrowed" from the scrapbooking <br/>
supplies to make fancy logbooks for postals.<br/>
<br/>
Completed logbooks - between SoccerChik and I we've filled up about <br/>
six of them over the past four years.<br/>
<br/>
A Zutter Bind-It-All - I just LOVE this little machine!<br/>
<br/>
O-Wires for the binder - various sizes and colors<br/>
<br/>
Sewing Box - how did that get out here?  Hmmm, need to throw it back <br/>
into the craft room.<br/>
<br/>
My backpack - we sure had fun today!<br/>
<br/>
Books on solving codes and making books<br/>
<br/>
Binders with clues - from my more organized days.  Now I realize that <br/>
they're outdated as soon as I print them, so I just print them before <br/>
we leave the house.<br/>
<br/>
Carving Material - pink stuff, white grade-b pz cut, orange grade-b <br/>
pz but, and some big erasers from the dollar store.<br/>
<br/>
A small box with tools (speedball and stadtler gouges), an exacto <br/>
knife, a box cutter (for trimming around stamp), wire cutters (for <br/>
the binding machine), a pair of tweezers, a glue stick, and a soft <br/>
toothbrush (bought and used only for cleaning newly carved stamps).<br/>
<br/>
Paper cutter<br/>
<br/>
Water-color paper (makes fairly rigid paperback covers for logbooks)<br/>
<br/>
Fun Foam doorhangers (for backing stamps)<br/>
<br/>
Felt in various colors (for wrapping stamps in boxes)<br/>
<br/>
Scissors, thread, awl, etc - for making codex logbooks<br/>
<br/>
Lock-In-Lock boxes - bought lots since they're getting harder and <br/>
harder to find.<br/>
<br/>
Camo tape<br/>
<br/>
Camo paint - Krylon Fusion<br/>
<br/>
Crocodile punch - yeah Lucy, I still like mine too!<br/>
<br/>
Container of sharpie markers<br/>
<br/>
Container of colored pencils<br/>
<br/>
Package of watercolor pencils -- aren't they fun?!<br/>
<br/>
Stamp pads and markers - the home edition (I have a whole 'nother set <br/>
in my backpack)<br/>
<br/>
And more, much, much more.<br/>
<br/>
Okay I'm done embarassing myself for now.  <br/>
