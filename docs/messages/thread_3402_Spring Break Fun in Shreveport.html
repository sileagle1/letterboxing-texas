                    <div class="plaintext-content">     I have decided the world is a small place and it is always fun <br>
to run across someone you have meet before - even if it is in a log <br>
book and they were there two days before you.  <br>
<br>
     Let me back up a bit so I don't confuse anyone.  My husband <br>
works 12 hour shifts on a rotating schedule.  4 days on then a couple <br>
days off, 3 graves then a day and a half off,  several more day <br>
shifts then back to nights.  Weekends and holidays always on the <br>
schedule for someone. The perk to this is that he is "suppose" to end <br>
up with 7 days off in a row once a month.  Well low and behold his 7 <br>
days this month fell the same time our kids are on spring break.  He <br>
managed to keep 3 of the days in a row and off we went to Shreveport <br>
to visit my Sister-in-law who is stationed at the Air Force base.<br>
<br>
     Now letterboxing doesn't excite my husband very much and since <br>
my sister and I have pretty much exhausted every box within driving <br>
distance during school hours, he decided to buy me(us) a GPS for <br>
Valentine's day.  Anything with electronic toys is fun so (gasp) <br>
Geocaching is fun.<br>
<br>
     Since we were headed to a new area I looked up all the boxes <br>
and caches within 10 miles of our hotel so we could go "exploring" <br>
while my S-I-L was working.  Well we got into town around 3 and got <br>
checked into the hotel and decided to go to the boardwalk.  On the <br>
way we stopped at the Bossier Zoo.  I went looking for JBanana's <br>
letterbox and my husband went for the cache.  We both returned to the <br>
car to check out our finds and what do I discover - BFL had been <br>
there 2 days before!  We all stamped/logged into both and rehid them <br>
and continued on to the boardwalk.  (I kept hoping to find BFL but no <br>
such luck.)  First we found a cache in the parking lot and then went <br>
looking for the letterbox.  We strolled (in the rain) and hunted for <br>
a couple of hours until dinner never sure we were reading the clues <br>
right and came up empty.<br>
<br>
     The next day - Tuesday - after sleeping in late we crossed the <br>
river and found the science center.   The river boat was at it's dock <br>
so we strolled up the river picked up a cache and wandered through <br>
downtown after a couple more caches.  The thing I like better about <br>
letterboxing is more of them are less urban than caches.  We found 1 <br>
out of the 2 we went for and covered a couple of miles to do it.  <br>
When we returned to our car at the river boat dock the boat was out.  <br>
We sent our 11 year old son under the dock and out he came on the <br>
other side with both the geocache and "rolling on the red".  BFL - I <br>
wouldn't have found them with a child to get under there.  After <br>
logging in and returning them we went over to the science center and <br>
spent several hours playing there.  We found Sam Hicks and looked <br>
for "discover the red" and never did find it.  However we did become <br>
members of the science center so we can go back again (or visit other <br>
ones).  While loading up I was rereading clues and realized that we <br>
walked right past JBanana's "Three of hearts: Queen of Hearts" so we <br>
went and found it and once again BFL had been there also.<br>
<br>
     After a long day of relaxing, walking, hunting and dinner we <br>
went back to the hotel to play in the casino.  Letterboxing is much <br>
more rewarding than gambling!  There is still a lot of boxes (and <br>
caches)left for another visit. Hopefully the stars will align again <br>
this year and my husband and kids will all be off at the same time <br>
and we can go again.  The question is how many Texan letter boxers <br>
are going to beat me there?<br>

                    <html><body><div>Oh you see - it is an AWESOME place to box!  I had planned on loading up my GPSr to do a little 'caching too, but since my trip wound up being somewhat serendipitous, I had it in my purse but the waypoints on it were far, far from Shreveport.  I'm very glad to know Rolling on the Red was there - disappointed you didn't find Sam Hicks.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've decided it is really much nicer when there are quite a few boxes to make a plan to get every last one of them, but be content to let some of them go too and expect to return for them.  I used to try to clean out Nacogdoches every time I went there, only to have Lucy Locket (when she lived there) plant a box the very day I thought I had finished all of them there!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will never forget the feeling of going to check my very first box, which had had no visitors for MONTHS.  I opened it and was fully prepared to find - yet again - an empty logbook.  Imagine my surprise when I turned the first page and saw Gryzzled Gryphon's stamp for the first time (he was only just coming up on the radar) and turned the page again and found that Silver Eagle and Baby Bear had been there the very day I was checking the box.  I jerked my head up, fully expecting to see their backs as they walked away from my box, but of course that was silly.  I did, however, make Fearless Fox drive me all around the park to see if they were camping somewhere.  So yeah - it's really cool to "bump into" a friend in a logbook!</div>
