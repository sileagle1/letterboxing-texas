event, I admit :-)<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately for me, events have conspired to prevent me from attending <br/>
tomorrow, so I'm posting the clues here. I'm not sure if Mama Fox will <br/>
have time to get the clues up on LbNA and AtlasQuest, so please print <br/>
them out, and take an extra copy for a friend.<br/>
<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>

Clues to *Jack Aubrey: H.M.S. Surprise*_<br/>
<br/>
This stamp was carved by Mama Fox of The Little Foxes in North Carolina, <br/>
and sent to JOY of TeamTexUS especially for this event. This box will be <br/>
pulled after the event, so be sure to hunt it now and send a big Texas <br/>
howdy to The Little Foxes.<br/>
<br/>
 From the Pavillion, walk on the paved trail past the restrooms and <br/>
volleyball courts, to the trail map. Walk up the trail 64 footfalls. <br/>
Take the grassy trail on your left for 24 footfalls. Look to your left <br/>
for a dead tree trunk. The box is at the base of the tree, covered with <br/>
bark and sticks. Please re-cover well.<br/>
<br/>
