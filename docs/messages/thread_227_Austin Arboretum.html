We were in Austin visiting my mother "nana".  Took the kids to the arboretum to find the letterbox by the cows.  The box was were it should be and is well intact.  The plastic bag that the box is in is getting ragged and I did not have anything to replace it with, so if you are planning to search for said box, please bring a new plastic bag. <br/>
