                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone! I am currently trying to get all these boxes organized <br/>
and on the same page... please bare with me while I sort this out. I <br/>
want them to be "other" boxes so as not to even come up on an area <br/>
search and yes, I do want to politely make finders aware that these are <br/>
unique and not open to the public... Trying to coordinate 40 boxes and <br/>
their creators is taking some time but I will do my best to not have <br/>
them become nuisances to all of you.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Queen Beeloved<br/>

stamps... although I would definately accept donations for carved as <br/>
well! My contact at the hospital was very interested in having some <br/>
craft time with the older kiddos to teach them the art of carving <br/>
their own, also some fun foam projects for the younger crowd was <br/>
mentioned. I'm leaving that up to her to coordinate though as she <br/>
seems very interested and willing to run with it.<br/>
