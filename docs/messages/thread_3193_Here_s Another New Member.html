<br/>
I am also new to letterboxing and to Texas.  I retired on July 31st and <br/>
moved to Texas from California on August 10th to join my daughters, <br/>
Frogkisses and Texas Pokey, in this beautiful state.  At least the <br/>
North East is beautiful.  I haven't seen any other parts except for the <br/>
Dallas area.  I saw how much fun my daughters and granddaughter, Horse <br/>
Rider, were having and I had to join too!  I'm having a great time.  I <br/>
was fortunate to meet Barefoot Lucy.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to meeting many more letterboxers so we can do an <br/>
Exchange.<br/>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007">I volunteer at Franklin Mountain State Park.  It is 37 
square miles of desert mountain - It runs from downtown El Paso to the New 
Mexico border.   Much of it is quite untouched, as it takes a good 
hike to get in there.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007">Note - a volunteer from any park is able to help in any 
park.  So I sometimes pop up in other places too.  That is how Hueco 
Tanks knows me.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007">Wyler Aerial Tramway is another park in El Paso.  It 
is a TRAM RIDE to the peak, with a nice platform up there for viewing the 
city.  I recommend a nice Friday  or Saturday afternoon trip, stay to 
watch the sunset, then watch the city lights come on.  Bring a picnic - 
there are tables up there.  I am trying to find a way to work a Letterbox 
into that place.  It will probably need to be kept in the gift shop and 
asked for.  I wonder what the boxing community thinks about that?  I 
will have to ask that question in another E-mail.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007">There is Hueco Tanks.  While not really inside the El 
Paso limits, it is only 10 miles outside the city and the park is considered 
part of the El Paso District.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007">Last is the Magoffin Home.  I understand that as of 1 
Jan 2008 it will become part of the Texas Historic Commission, and TPWD will no 
longer "own" it.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="922141322-25112007">Yeah - it is kinda lonely being the only real letterboxer 
out here.  There are a few that play at it, but not 
many.</span></div>
