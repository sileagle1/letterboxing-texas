                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to introduce myself to the group.  I am a new member of <br>
Letterboxing Texas and new to letterboxing in general.  I found out <br>
about it from an acquaintance and was very curious.  After our first <br>
find in late May (planted by Puddle Splasher) we were hooked.  Puddle <br>
Splasher warned it would be addictive and informed me about this <br>
group.  Thanks.  We (I have 2 young daughters that are always with me <br>
and love it!) have since found about 14 letterboxes.<br>
<br>
I look forward to learning more about the hobby!<br>

<div>Welcome, CrafTCrew!  I think I just saw your stamp in one of my boxes 
I was checking on last night.  I'll be looking for it in the others as I 
make it around to them, also.  Thanks especially for being careful to 
reseal the plastic bags tightly (soggy logbooks are no fun for finders!) and for 
carefully rehiding the boxes, covering them well so they'll not go 
missing!  I appreciate that very much and hope you and your family enjoy 
the adventures and discovery of many new and interesting places through 
letterboxing!  </div>

two children ages 7 & 11 who go with me letterboxing.<br>
My husband goes occassionally but not to often. I<br>
absolutely love this hobby because it gets us as a<br>
family out of the house and into nature and also we<br>
moved up here about a year ago and alot of the clues<br>
thus far have had a little bit of a history lesson.<br>
This may sound strange but the kids love it because<br>
that means they are not sitting around the house<br>
watching TV. "Blooming Flower" got me hooked on<br>
letterboxing. Well I'm still new to all this (we<br>
started 7/4/07) and still learning all the ropes so<br>
forgive me if I ever ask anything stupid. Well I<br>
worked the 7p-7a shift last night so I must wrap this<br>
up. <br>

Until next time,<br>
