love children and they are great letterboxers. I have a little problem <br>
with their Moms and Dads though. Children are Children and just <br>
sometimes they are not as careful to replace the letterboxes and <br>
recover them well. Either they don't know how or they don't understand <br>
the point but Moms and Dads please suppervise them and check to see if <br>
they have done it correctly before going on to the next box. Children <br>
do not know unless we teach and show and sometimes show and teach <br>
again. Let's make it fun for the children at the same time teaching <br>
them. We all will enjoy letterboxing better. <br>
