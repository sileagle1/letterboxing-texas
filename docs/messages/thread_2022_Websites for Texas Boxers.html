                    <html><body><div>We've welcomed 11 new members to this group in the past few weeks, so I thought I would make sure they know of what many folks on the list consider to be key resources for new Texas boxers:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> Oldest North American letterboxing clue site.  Called LBNA</div>
<div><a href="http://www.atlasquest.com">www.atlasquest.com</a> Fairly new letterboxing clue site.  Lots of tracking and mapping features.  Not as many box listings as LBNA.  Also has a talk list for Texas boxing, but it isn't very active.  
</div>
<div><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/newboxers">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/newboxers</a> Newboxers talk list.  An excellent list for getting questions answered.  We are always glad to answer questions here, but you get a broader flare on that list and you meet the nicest people.
<br clear="all"/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/letterbox-usa">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/letterbox-usa</a> The Big List.  While this list is very informative and is frequented by the Silverbacks - the old-timers, it isn't for the faint-hearted.  I suggest you watch and observe for awhile before you jump in and participate.
</div>
<div>And finally, a resource peculiar to us here in Texas:</div>
<div><a href="http://www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com">www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com</a> - maintained by Sea Dove of Birds of a Feather, this is a map-based listing of letterboxes in Texas.  If you will go to that site and email Sea Dove to give him permission to list your boxes, he'll put them on his map as you add them.  
</div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.info">www.letterboxing.info</a> Silent Doug's site for linformation on everything letterboxing.  He has a glossary of terms, suggestions, ideas, and even merchandise.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>With the possible exception of the Big List, these resources are (in my opinion) critical to the success of any letterboxer.  There are numerous other sites and lists, to the point you could be overwhelmed, but I encourage you to check the ones above out!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And of course, I'd love to hear others' opinion on this!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
