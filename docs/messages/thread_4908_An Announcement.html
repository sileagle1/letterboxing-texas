<div>Hurry, hurry, hurry; step right up to the oldest state park in Texas (and the only one in Coryell County) and witness death-defying feats of strength and skill! ! Patrons are urged to arrive before 4:30 pm and should stop at the park headquarters on Texas 236 and pay the price of admission and receive a souvenir map, and then proceed .3 miles south to the park entrance. Once inside, follow Park Road 14 around to the right and continue to the right through the gate where the park road intersects with Old River Road. Note that while the park remains open 24 hours a day, this gate closes at 4:30 pm.-- arriving before the gate is locked will save you a bit of a hike. Having successfully passed the gate, patrons should continue to the third parking area on the right, listed on your souvenir map as being near the Wash Pond, and park (if you come to a circle, you have gone too far). Exit your car and walk to the reflective warning sign on the same side of
 the road as that on which you parked. Whip out your compass and take a reading of 230 degrees and walk across the road in that direction. Upon reaching the other side of the road (and feeling much like the proverbial chicken), continue on the same reading into the woods for another 15 steps. See that grouping of rocks? Isn't that calliope music you hear? </div>
<div>Your next attraction is The Egress.</div>
