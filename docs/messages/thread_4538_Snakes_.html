                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have always had what I considered a "healthy" fear of snakes.  As long as I am a safe distance away from them, they don't bother me.  However, this past 6 months I have developed an irrational fear of them.  For one, I saw the movie "Snakes on a Plane", which, while highly unlikely, revealed to me how bad they can be.  I read about the snake incident at TALE7, and a friends father was bitten just a month ago.  I live in Dallas, where, with all the concrete, you wouldn't really expect to see too many, but I have seen at least 5 dead snakes which had been killed by cars while trying to cross the road, and heard reports that in Houston residents are being asked to check their yards for rattlesnakes before heading out.  I don't know why there are so many snakes this year!<br/>
<br/>
This fear is something that I am having to cope with while letterboxing.  I visited 4 parks today in Temple and Belton, thankfully with no sightings!  (Although I nearly jumped out of my skin when I saw a lizard-which I have NEVER been scared of.)  What tips do you have for being cautious of snakes on the trail?<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Knowledge is power.<br/><br/>Call down to Fairfield State Park and find out if they still have their snake program on the weekends. If they do, invest in a trip down there for it. You may be able to get a class closer to where you are, but the guy that teaches that class at Fairfield is really into it and I think you'll walk away with a healthy understanding of snake behavior. <br/>
<br/>I grew up in the outdoors and my dad taught me a lot about snakes, among other things being a healthy respect for them. He taught me things like snake recognition and which ones did what. I thought I had a good knowledge of snakes. The class at Fairfield took my knowledge up a level. <br/>
<br/>If they aren't still doing that program, find one somewhere. Start with state parks. The best thing you can do for yourself is learn. <br/><br/>Here are a couple of things to know:<br/><br/>Very likely, your fear of snakes is dying of a snake bite, right? Death is very rare with most species we see in East Texas. Lots of people get bitten by the more common snakes and never even seek medical attention, AND live to tell about it. Death is highly unlikely.<br/>
<br/>In a fight or flight situation, MOST species of snakes will choose to fly. If, however, you startle one and he is cornered, he will do just enough to get you to back off. Some species, like Water Moccasins, are said to be aggressive though.<br/>
<br/>Snakes not only use their venom as a defense mechanism, but as a hunting tool. It's very important for snakes to eat, so if they need to bite you, they will not dose you with their whole load of venom, or they won't have anything to hunt with. The exception to this is a young snake - they don't know how to measure their bite yet. That's why it is said that a young snake is more potent than a mature snake.<br/>
<br/>Most snakes in East Texas have a hinged jaw, meaning they can latch on to the side of your leg or your arm with their top fangs. The really dangerous, deadly Coral Snake does NOT have a hinged jaw, so he has to bite the end of your finger or your toe or some small appendage, so wear closed toe shoes and gloves. <br/>
<br/>The most deadly snake in our area, the Coral Snake, is brightly colored. You can remember the old adage if you want: "Red and black, bite him back. Red and Yellow kills a fellow." Or you can just avoid any snake with red, yellow and black. What the adage means, though, is that if a snake's red stripes are next to black stripes, he's harmless. If red is next to yellow, he's a Coral Snake and he's NOT harmless. Notice - the most deadly snake we have around here is brightly colored. The others are more camoflauged. He's telling you - "Surely you see me and you want to give me a wide berth. Right?" To which you reply, "Why yes, I do!"<br/>
<br/>Remember this - more people are injured trying to get away from a snake than by getting bitten by a snake. Don't try to scramble away or run. Take a deep breath and evaluate the situation, then put some distance between you and the snake. If you don't have time to do this, it was too late anyway. He already had you.<br/>
<br/>And if you do get bit, don't tourniquet. Applying a tourniquet generally results in losing the limb, so it should only be done in dire situations. Get help as quickly as you can. Hold the wound down and let it bleed away - gravity and bleeding will shed some of the poison. Don't panic - that increases your blood pressure, decreases your brain power, Let me just mention that all of this comes from my friend, She Who Volunteers Me for Everything. SWVMFE is a Wilderness First Aid trainer, and she had to recently re-up her training, since Lucy Locket got bit in fact, so I asked her to find out more about treating snakebite. This is what she told me - and she really emphasized the tourniquet stuff. <br/>
<br/>Snakes are cold-blooded, so they have to move around to regulate their body temperature. On a warm day following a cool night, you will find them sunning themselves. In the afternoon on a hot day, you will find them hiding somewhere cool (on the backside of a log, or under a rock)<br/>
<br/>The biggest thing you can do to be cautious of snakes on the trail is to understand their behavior first of all, and simply be aware that they are there and you are on their stomping ground (or slithering ground, as the case may be). Try to think like a snake and be very observant, which is an important thing anyway. <br/>
<br/>It does seem like a snakey year - our cats have already brought up a dozen or so small snakes to the front porch and I ran across about five of them as I was cleaning out beds (and I live in town). Hang in there and don't let them ruin your letterboxing. In fact, why don't you make a snake boxing buddy, a mental talisman to keep you mindful....<br/>

I completely agree that knowledge is power, but am so clueless knowing where to begin can be somewhat of an issue (hence the reason for my earlier post).  Thank you so much for all the information!  While making a trip down to Fairfield State Park will probably not be in my future, many of the subjects you touched on are great starting points for me to google.  I appreciate it!<br/>

&gt; The most deadly snake in our area, the Coral Snake, is brightly colored.<br/>
&gt; You can remember the old adage if you want:  "Red and black, bite him back.<br/>
&gt; Red and Yellow kills a fellow."  Or you can just avoid any snake with red,<br/>
&gt; yellow and black.  What the adage means, though, is that if a snake's red<br/>
&gt; stripes are next to black stripes, he's harmless.  If red is next to yellow,<br/>
&gt; he's a Coral Snake and he's NOT harmless.  Notice - the most deadly snake we<br/>
&gt; have around here is brightly colored.  The others are more camoflauged.<br/>
&gt; He's telling you - "Surely you see me and you want to give me a wide berth.<br/>
&gt; Right?"  To which you reply, "Why yes, I do!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Remember this -  more people are injured trying to get away from a snake<br/>
&gt; than by getting bitten by a snake.  Don't try to scramble away or run.  Take<br/>
&gt; a deep breath and evaluate the situation, then put some distance between you<br/>
&gt; and the snake.  If you don't have time to do this, it was too late anyway.<br/>
&gt; He already had you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And if you do get bit, don't tourniquet.  Applying a tourniquet generally<br/>
&gt; results in losing the limb, so it should only be done in dire situations.<br/>
&gt; Get help as quickly as you can.  Hold the wound down and let it bleed away -<br/>
&gt; gravity and bleeding will shed some of the poison.  Don't panic - that<br/>
&gt; increases your blood pressure, decreases your brain power,  Let me just<br/>
&gt; mention that all of this comes from my friend, She Who Volunteers Me for<br/>
&gt; Everything.  SWVMFE is a Wilderness First Aid trainer, and she had to<br/>
&gt; recently re-up her training, since Lucy Locket got bit in fact, so I asked<br/>
&gt; her to find out more about treating snakebite.  This is what she told me -<br/>
&gt; and she really emphasized the tourniquet stuff.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Snakes are cold-blooded, so they have to move around to regulate their body<br/>
&gt; temperature.  On a warm day following a cool night, you will find them<br/>
&gt; sunning themselves.  In the afternoon on a hot day, you will find them<br/>
&gt; hiding somewhere cool (on the backside of a log, or under a rock)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The biggest thing you can do to be cautious of snakes on the trail is to<br/>
&gt; understand their behavior first of all, and simply be aware that they are<br/>
&gt; there and you are on their stomping ground (or slithering ground, as the<br/>
&gt; case may be).  Try to think like a snake and be very observant, which is an<br/>
&gt; important thing anyway.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It does seem like a snakey year - our cats have already brought up a dozen<br/>
&gt; or so small snakes to the front porch and I ran across about five of them as<br/>
&gt; I was cleaning out beds (and I live in town).  Hang in there and don't let<br/>
&gt; them ruin your letterboxing.  In fact, why don't you make a snake boxing<br/>
&gt; buddy, a mental talisman to keep you mindful....<br/>

<p><span>Hmmm….  Well.  I will say that owning a gun isn’t
for everyone.  It is a very serious step in so many ways.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>#1.  It doesn’t make you invincible.  It only
gives you an equal chance against similarly armed bad-guys.  It doesn’t
mean you will win – or even survive.  It just gives you a chance.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>#2.  It puts a very serious responsibility on your shoulders. 
You must think about every moment.  Sure – if family is threatened –
you will act.  But what about if you are sitting in a restaurant and some
guy walks in waving a gun and shouting, but isn’t a direct threat to you
or your family?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>#3.  You must be aware that the very moment you add a gun to
your daily routine, some other things become more difficult.  Like going
into school to get the kids.  Entering the post office.  You must be
very aware of the law.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>#4.  You MUST understand that ANY confrontation you enter
into can escalate into a deadly encounter.  You must make every effort do
stay disengaged.  Leave rather than argue.  Argue rather than
fight.  Fight rather than shoot.  But once fully engaged you must be
willing to use your gun.  Unarmed, you might get your butt kicked. 
If you pull a pistol and don’t use it, it might get taken from you and
used anyway.  Things you should do anyway become a must.  Like
looking for all the exits in a restaurant so you can escape without problems
etc…<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>#5.  If you use your pistol for any reason, no matter how
lawful and justified.  You WILL be arrested.  Think of this.  If
a cop were around, you would not have needed to defend yourself.  So you
shot someone trying to beat your kid or whatever.  The cops arrive 7
minutes later.  There is a dead body on the floor, and you are standing
over it with a smoking pistol in your hands.  You will be arrested and
handcuffed on the spot.  Your pistol will be confiscated as evidence, and
you may or may not be taken to jail depending on the stories of the
witnesses.  Most cops are not dumb, and many support armed citizens. 
Still, you and your family will have months of stress, lots of $$$$ spent, and although
the grand jury may not indict you, the family of the one you shot may bring
civil charges on you that you have to defend against after the criminal charged
are dropped.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I am not trying to scare you.  But you do need to consider it
all the way through.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>That said, I rarely leave home without my pistol.  It is
better to be tried by 12 than carried by 6.  The stores I frequent - most
have signs in the windows saying that gun owners are welcome.  The owners
get it that no guns allowed signs tell the criminals that they will have the
upper hand in that store.  I do not go to my favorite Starbucks as much as
I used to.  The new manager knows about us, and he insists on giving us our
beverages FREE while we sit there and talk – he feels safer knowing we
are there.  I feel guilty taking free coffee.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>In over 10 years of carrying legally I have only drawn my pistol
twice.  Both times were hiking.  Once in the high-forests of New
Mexico (I was hiking alone) I saw a bear right on the trail as I came around a
big rock.  The sun was in my eyes and the bear was in a deep shadow. 
The bear was standing, upper paws outstretched.  I drew my pistol and
started backing up.  The bear didn’t move.  So I looked closer. 
It was not a bear – it was an 8 ft tall burned out tree.  It took a
while before my heart got back to normal on that one.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Another time we were miles up a trail and I and my handgun
instructor encountered 4 guys coming down.  They had no gear.  They
demanded our water.  Had they asked, we would have shared a little.  But
they demanded.  There were 4 of them and two of us, and they began
surrounding us as though they were going to take the water.  Not. 
Larry pulled his 1911 .45, and I pulled my Titanium .357.  I explained to
them that they might get the water, but it wouldn’t stay in.  Whey
shouted all sorts of obscenities, but they went down the trail.  Once they
were gone and we were certain we were secure, we cell-phoned the rangers to
pick them up at the bottom.  At four against two, we would have been
justified had it come to a fight.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Very often (they say 95% of the time) just drawing your weapon
stops the confrontation.  But you cannot count on that.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Your number one defense is awareness.  If you see something
that doesn’t feel right, go the other way.  Avoiding trouble is the
best defense.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Wow – you got me started…….  &lt;Grin&gt;.
Hope I didn’t scare you.  If you do decide to get a pistol, take the
classes.  Learn the law.  And learn to be aware and avoid
trouble.  It is more a lifestyle change than anything else.  Let me
know if I can help.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Thanks Mike for the great information! And for
the record, my husband told me the same thing about getting a gun. I'm thinking
it may be time for me to break down and get a concealed-carry license. :)<br/>

&gt; Taurus Arms makes a nice pistol called The Judge. It can load 5 shots of

&gt; Seriously, just be aware. Always use a stick to probe, not your hand.
Consider<br/>
&gt; carrying one of those grabbers to reach for the box instead of your arm.<br/>
&gt; Respect them - it is their home and you are an invader. Give them room and
they<br/>

&gt; Rocky is a rock rattler that lives in the rocky portion of the trail
leading<br/>
&gt; from the upper platform of Wyler Aerial Tramway State Park (There is a
letterbox<br/>
&gt; there) to the KFOX tower complex where some of our ham radio equipment is<br/>
&gt; positioned. I say hi every time I pass him on the trail. I know where he<br/>
&gt; lives. It is his home and I am the trespasser. I don't step on him, he
don't<br/>
&gt; strike at me. We co-exist.<br/>

 Hmmm..  Well.  I will say that owning a gun isn't for everyone.  It is a very<br/>
&gt; serious step in so many ways.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; #1.  It doesn't make you invincible.  It only gives you an equal chance against<br/>
&gt; similarly armed bad-guys.  It doesn't mean you will win - or even survive.  It<br/>
&gt; just gives you a chance.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; #2.  It puts a very serious responsibility on your shoulders.  You must think<br/>
&gt; about every moment.  Sure - if family is threatened - you will act.  But what<br/>
&gt; about if you are sitting in a restaurant and some guy walks in waving a gun and<br/>
&gt; shouting, but isn't a direct threat to you or your family?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; #3.  You must be aware that the very moment you add a gun to your daily routine,<br/>
&gt; some other things become more difficult.  Like going into school to get the<br/>
&gt; kids.  Entering the post office.  You must be very aware of the law.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; #4.  You MUST understand that ANY confrontation you enter into can escalate into<br/>
&gt; a deadly encounter.  You must make every effort do stay disengaged.  Leave<br/>
&gt; rather than argue.  Argue rather than fight.  Fight rather than shoot.  But once<br/>
&gt; fully engaged you must be willing to use your gun.  Unarmed, you might get your<br/>
&gt; butt kicked.  If you pull a pistol and don't use it, it might get taken from you<br/>
&gt; and used anyway.  Things you should do anyway become a must.  Like looking for<br/>
&gt; all the exits in a restaurant so you can escape without problems etc.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; #5.  If you use your pistol for any reason, no matter how lawful and justified.<br/>
&gt; You WILL be arrested.  Think of this.  If a cop were around, you would not have<br/>
&gt; needed to defend yourself.  So you shot someone trying to beat your kid or<br/>
&gt; whatever.  The cops arrive 7 minutes later.  There is a dead body on the floor,<br/>
&gt; and you are standing over it with a smoking pistol in your hands.  You will be<br/>
&gt; arrested and handcuffed on the spot.  Your pistol will be confiscated as<br/>
&gt; evidence, and you may or may not be taken to jail depending on the stories of<br/>
&gt; the witnesses.  Most cops are not dumb, and many support armed citizens.  Still,<br/>
&gt; you and your family will have months of stress, lots of $$$$ spent, and although<br/>
&gt; the grand jury may not indict you, the family of the one you shot may bring<br/>
&gt; civil charges on you that you have to defend against after the criminal charged<br/>
&gt; are dropped.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I am not trying to scare you.  But you do need to consider it all the way<br/>
&gt; through.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; That said, I rarely leave home without my pistol.  It is better to be tried by<br/>
&gt; 12 than carried by 6.  The stores I frequent - most have signs in the windows<br/>
&gt; saying that gun owners are welcome.  The owners get it that no guns allowed<br/>
&gt; signs tell the criminals that they will have the upper hand in that store.  I do<br/>
&gt; not go to my favorite Starbucks as much as I used to.  The new manager knows<br/>
&gt; about us, and he insists on giving us our beverages FREE while we sit there and<br/>
&gt; talk - he feels safer knowing we are there.  I feel guilty taking free coffee.<br/>
..... <br/>
&gt; Very often (they say 95% of the time) just drawing your weapon stops the<br/>
&gt; confrontation.  But you cannot count on that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Your number one defense is awareness.  If you see something that doesn't feel<br/>
&gt; right, go the other way.  Avoiding trouble is the best defense.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Wow - you got me started...  <grin>. Hope I didn't scare you.  If you do decide<br/>
&gt; to get a pistol, take the classes.  Learn the law.  And learn to be aware and<br/>
&gt; avoid trouble.  It is more a lifestyle change than anything else.  Let me know<br/>

a book.  It was written by a retired Army Col named David Grossman.  
The title is On Killing.  No – it doesn’t tell you how. 
It tells you what to expect from your body and mind afterward.  I wish I
had read that book before my first combat tour.  It was so good I made
sure there were a few copies with my son’s troop every time he deployed….
Along with another one of his books – On Combat.  I also sent them
some marksmanship manuals, reading the wind, sight picture and trigger control,
etc…..  but I digress.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

a hard time killing innocent animals.  I am not against it, I just don’t
do it myself.  But I do practice.  Comes a time when we can’t
get meat, I will get meat.  I am learning how to shoot a bow, I can re-use
arrows and they are quiet.  Bullets – they are loud, and there could
come a time when I run out.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
