<div>Okay, I'll do an intro...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm Ladybird Beetlebug and I have three 
boys, Sneaky Cat,8, Aslan,6, and Stinky Monkey,16 months. My husband goes with 
us on occasional letterboxing forays because he loves being outdoors and he 
loves hiking, etc. But he has not had a single flicker of interest in 
letterboxing until we came across Viewfinder's Ornette Coleman box. And then it 
was just a flicker, but hey! I'll take what I can get!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We live in almost East Texas, although that 
is stretching it a bit. We're between Dallas and Canton. We've only been 
letterboxing since last fall, but to hear my boys talk, you'd think we've been 
doing it forever. Stinky Monkey even has his own journal and will toddle after 
us, sit down when we are stamping, and hold his book in his lap and say, 
"Lah-dat! Lah-dat!" which alternately means, "That is mine", "Give it to 
me" or "Stamp in my book now, please."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are planning to come to the Denton 
gathering. We actually lived in Denton for 10 years before moving back to the 
farm where I grew up. So when I heard the gathering was in Denton I was so 
excited...not only my old stomping grounds, but an excuse to see lots of old 
friends and drive past my favorite quilt shop (in Lewisville) to 
boot!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So that's us, in a nutshell!</div>

know you, and look forward to a face-to-face one day. Maybe when you <br/>
bring the boys to find all the boxes here in Austin. We gramma types <br/>
love to have little ones stamp our logs.<br/>
