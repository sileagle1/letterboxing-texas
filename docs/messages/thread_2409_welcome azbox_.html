There are lots of boxes over here, but also lots on the east side as well.<br>
Actually the UP has gotten a lot of action over the past couple of<br>

to see which state could place boxes in all the that state's counties.<br>
Michigan won, and that included the remote counties up north.<br>
So, come to Michigan and letterbox. There's at least one in each<br>
