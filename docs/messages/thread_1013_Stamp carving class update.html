                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
I ended up with a very busy week, and haven't gotten to the library to<br>
ask them about their community room.  Next week I will, I promise.<br>
(Hey, I have to... my library books are due then! *grin*)<br>
<br>
I did try to schedule us at a Katy scrapbooking shop--Maridawn's--but<br>
they advised me that they never offer free classes, and all of their<br>
classes involve samples that their students copy exactly, using kits<br>
that the shop assembles for them, and co$t money. *sigh*<br>
<br>
Nothing would convince them that my free class would be good<br>
advertising for the shop, bring in new people, and so on.  Even when I<br>
explained that people usually pay $200 per day (not including<br>
supplies) to take one of my workshops, they insisted that they<br>
couldn't see any benefit for the shop to let us use their classroom<br>
area.  (And, yes, that is what people pay when I teach at national<br>
arts conventions.  I'm doing this as a freebie because it's local and<br>
it sounds like fun to me!)<br>
<br>
So anyway, I should be able to get to the library next week, and find<br>
out how to schedule their community room.  I'm pretty sure that<br>
Kroger's on Westheimer Pkwy & Mason has a community room upstairs as<br>
well, if the library doesn't work out.<br>
<br>
I'll update you next week when I see what the library says.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, ooh, that rain felt good last night, and the morning was<br>
absolutely gorgeous before the sun started heating things up again! <br>
It gives me hope that I may still be able to do some early-morning<br>
letterboxing this summer, without wilting.  Yaaayyy!<br>
<br>
Cheerfully,<br>

                    <html><body><div>If the Katy library is Harris Co, and they all work the same, I can tell you a bit about it.  I checked about the community room at Katherine Tyra / Bear Creek once, and was told their deal was that if you had a class or anything there it had to be free, you couldn't sell anything, and if someone wandered in, they would have to be able to be included.  Does that makes sense?  Of course you also had to leave it tidy and all that kind of normal stuff, and schedule around whatever was already on their calendar.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also checked with the powers that be at my church and as long as I am there, and we schedule around the calendar, we are welcome.</div>
