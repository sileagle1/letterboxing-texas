Hello all,<br>
<br>
We're back from a day in Bastrop SP and thought we'd report the <br>
good, bad and the ugly of our trip.<br>
<br>
On the good front, we successfully found Cool Cat, Lost Loblolly, <br>
Poison Ivy, Trail Rider, 10th Mountain Division and O-Knot #1.<br>
<br>
On the bad front, Skinny Pine was still in place, but its log book <br>
was soaked.  We dried off the stamp and rebagged and replaced, but <br>
we didn't have a dry log book with us.<br>
<br>
Now, for the ugly.  At some point, a fire went through portions of <br>
the park.  We found the quite charred remains of These Boots ARE <br>
Made for Walking, with the spiral from the notebook, some charred <br>
pages and a bit of the lid (Paul took a photo if you'd like to see <br>
it).  We also couldn't find Houston Toad.  The log that we thought <br>
it should be hidden inside was quite charred.  The box may still be <br>
there, but we couldn't find it or any remains of it anywhere.  It <br>
wouldn't be the first time we've missed a box, but the area was <br>
pretty crispy.  <br>
<br>
About this point, the kids refused to hike any more, so we couldn't <br>
check on any other boxes in the park.  We think the kids did pretty <br>
well for 3 and 7, so we were quite pleased with the day.<br>
<br>
We also had a fun time at Mountain Hill State Park yesterday on our <br>
way to Bastrop.  Found both ZZTop and Black Beans in place and in <br>
good shape.  <br>
<br>
That's it.  Hope everyone else had as good a weekend.<br>
<br>
