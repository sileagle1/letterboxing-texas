inputted wrong (they have different placers) or if someone accidentally <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for letting us know.  I checked the clues on LbNA and <br/>
AtlasQuest and the clues are correct for the boxes listed.  Since we <br/>
placed them at the same time (Lone Star Quilter and I are LB <br/>
partners), I guess we could have gotten them switched while placing, <br/>
but they have both been found and nobody mentioned the misplacement, <br/>
so the last finder must have accidentally got them backward. I hate <br/>
for you to go back and switch them.  Maybe someone will read this <br/>
and switch them back the next time they go out there to find them. I <br/>
never had that happen before.  Thanks again.<br/>
