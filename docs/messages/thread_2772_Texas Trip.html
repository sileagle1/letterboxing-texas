We found 3 boxes this weekend.  <br/>
<br/>
Falls Fest (Wichita Falls)<br/>
Mineral Wells State Park <br/>
Badge of Friendship (Weatherford)<br/>
<br/>
We didn't stop at the box in Clark Gardens.  It looked wonderful but<br/>
we were running short on time and money (There were 4 of us and we<br/>
didn't think we could spend the time to enjoy it for $24.00)  Maybe<br/>
next year.<br/>
<br/>
The boxes were all really neat and as usual we discovered some places<br/>
we would have never known about without letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great summer.<br/>
