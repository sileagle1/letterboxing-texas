remember all but Mission San Juan Capistrano was really neat because <br>
of the history and there is another nearby but I misread clues so i <br>
did not find it. It was hard getting the Sa Antonio land layout though <br>
(at least for this woman and her son).BROWN SIGNS is the clue and the <br>
missions are not really near the Alamo.<br>
<br>
Also the Texas Salamandr was nifty in San Marcos but bring a <br>
reacher/pincher thing.<br>
<br>
Texas Ranger in Waco is cool...bring duck food!<br>
<br>
Seems there was another...hum...<br>
<br>
But these were great. The River walk is currently ubder lots of <br>
construction but still nice. Seems Toyota is doing business there and <br>
for a while is/was paying for RW rides.<br>
