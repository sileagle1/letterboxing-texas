About ten years ago, before I met you,  I was living in Connecticut where I had been letterboxing. I flew out to San Diego with my husband so I could letterbox while he was at a conference. One of the boxes I found was your box at Torrey Pines. I'll never forget that beautiful location and your box - definitely one of the highlights of my trip. Then I moved back to Texas a few months later and met you at my first TALE event in Rusk. I love how letterboxing brings such good friends into your life!  Keep planting!  :)</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><div>Sent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE smartphone</div></div><br/><br/><div>-------- Original message --------</div><div>From: "sileagle1@yahoo.com [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS]" <letterboxingtexas> </letterboxingtexas></div><div>Date:12/01/2014  8:37 AM  (GMT-06:00) </div><div>To: LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com </div><div>Subject: [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Thanksgiving Thanks </div><div><br/></div>

                    <html><body><p>I was glad to help with this box, and have a new logbook ready to place in the box today. It is so sad what the hurricanes did to this area a few years ago. So much damage, and boxes missing.  I am now living near Beaumont, and very happy to be able to box again without driving a couple of hours to find a box. Living so close to Houston/Galveston is a bonus! I am looking forward to placing some boxes, and being out on the trails as much as possible. Looking forward to seeing everyone in March! Lucy Locket and I have our reservations, and ready to plan for another exciting event!<br/><br/>Blue Butterfly</p></body></html>
