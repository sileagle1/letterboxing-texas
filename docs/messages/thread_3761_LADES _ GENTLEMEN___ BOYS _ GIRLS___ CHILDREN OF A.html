Mushroom Hunter was in the mood to walk a tightrope, so we skeddadled<br/>
over and we heard a hum coming from the woods.  Following the sounds<br/>
of a calliope, we circled ever closer until we found the mini big top.  <br/>

&gt; The Greatest Show on Earth has arrived at a park near you<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Maybe.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After dealing with the transportation issues (the train broke down at a<br/>
&gt; most inconvenient time) and hiding out from Hurricane Gustav (didn't<br/>
&gt; want to get blown into another state), the Traveling Texas Circus has<br/>
&gt; made camp at a park known for owls and soggy waffles.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Free parking is available on Shirkmere Street, near the baseball field. <br/>
&gt; Hey, clowns like to play baseball too!.   But the Texas heat started<br/>
&gt; melting their makeup, so they decided to set up the big top under the<br/>
&gt; trees.  Follow the 3rd base line to the trees, and find the trail at the<br/>
&gt; northeast corner of the field.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Follow this trail for 19 steps until you reach the first junction.  Take<br/>
&gt; the trail to your right for 24 steps.  Then take the trail to the left<br/>
&gt; for 48 steps.  Don't despair, you're almost there!  Don't you<br/>
&gt; smell the elephants?  Now take the trail to your right for 32 steps. <br/>
&gt; See the large red and white striped tent located on your left, about 20<br/>
&gt; steps from the trail behind a large pine tree?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you enjoy the show!<br/>
