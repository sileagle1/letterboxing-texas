<div>Welcome, Janet!  
You didn't waste any time at all getting started, the ink must not even have 
been dry on the Family Fun article!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Don't worry about 
carving, letterboxing is about a whole lot more than a pretty stamp!  And 
it gets easier the more you do it.  My first stamps were so awful, I am 
actually glad many of them went missing.  It is one of those things that if 
you worry about being perfect you will never start, and if you never try 
planting a box you miss out on a part of letterboxing that is almost as 
addictive as finding boxes.  The carving tutorial by Scout Dogs on Atlas 
Quest is really a great place to start.  Feel free to ask any questions 
here.  Welcome to Texas Letterboxing!  -Mother of 
Five</div></body></html>

<div>Actually, my husband is lots of help when I'm deciding on the perfect spot 
for a box, because what looks good to me is too near where kids play, or too 
visible if not carefully recovered, or in a place where water will wash it away 
if and when it ever does rain again, or something, and he's the one who notices 
that and then says, "but what about this place?"  And it's the perfect 
place.  You'll be surprised how many good places you find or think of when 
you start looking - it becomes a mindset:  "now, why isn't there a 
letterbox here?  There should be a letterbox here, too.  And this is a 
good place for a letterbox!"</div>

<div>That's the truth. I have many more ideas for great places to hide  letterboxes than I have time to carve them right now. In fact... I have a list! You'll notice as you drive around, great little places you may have never noticed before - historical sites, old cemeteries, parks, festivals.... the list goes on and on. When I find a great letterbox, I always love that someone lead me to a neat place I probably would never have known about otherwise!</div>
