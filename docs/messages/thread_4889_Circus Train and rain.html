                    <div class="plaintext-content">Has the Circus retired to Florida for the winter?  We got a little rain in East Texas yesterday.  I was going to say "very little", but beggers can't be choosers. I understand that Central Texas got a lot more than we did, and that's a good thing.  Maybe that means that the threat of fire is gone, or reduced, at least for the time being.  I talked to my sister in Hamilton, northwest of Waco and she said they got about 4 1/2 inches of rain.  We hope to see some of you at S.F.A. State Park in a couple of weeks.  We're just driving over for the day Saturday.  I hope the beautiful weather holds. <br/>

                    <html><body><div dir="ltr"><div>We did indeed get rain in central Tx this weekend, up to 8" in some areas. Bird Dog awakened me early, early Fri am just to sit on the porch and watch the water fall from above. Downside for us was that we didn't figure what rain would do for our new very cheap pool cover. It's basically a large sheet of bubble wrap that we secure on the sides of the pool with 4x4's. (Read Bubba Land Pool Supply). Funny how rain water on the top of the cover makes it bow down. How long before all that weight causes the lovely cover to drop into the pool and release all leaves and debris and dirty water into the pristeen pool beneath? So here we are in the late of the night baling water off the top of the pool cover, careful not to pierce the cover or fall in ourselves. Amazing how much water accumulates with 4 inches of rainfall, measured by bucketful and sore muscles.</div>
<div>Looking forward to S.F. State Park.</div>
