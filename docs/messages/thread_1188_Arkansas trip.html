                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all!<br/>
I just got back from camping and fishing in Arkansas and planted <br/>
three boxes there.  There are hardly any boxes in that state so I <br/>
decided to do my part to spread letterboxing cheer!  Unfortunately, <br/>
I didn't have time to find any boxes as the only ones we passed were <br/>
in Little Rock and we were in a hurry to get up to Bull Shoals State <br/>
Park to set up our tent before it was midnight!  That is a beautiful <br/>
part of the country.  If you haven't been up there it is great.  <br/>
Also it has great trout fishing!  We also took a side trip down to <br/>
Blanchard Springs Caverns near Mountain View and all I can say <br/>
is "WOW"!  I had been to Natural Bridge Caverns near San Antonio but <br/>
these blew my mind!<br/>
We also had another run-in with ticks!  I apologize in advance to <br/>
anyone hunting my Lunker Trout Box.  I didn't realize it was tick <br/>
heaven at that park until an hour after I planted the box and saw <br/>
moving freckles!  I think I am going to buy stock in Deep Woods <br/>
Off!  LOL.  <br/>
I hope I can make the barnraising in Oct.! It sounds fun.  I can't <br/>
commit to it yet until it gets closer to the date.  In my line of <br/>
work, I often don't know when I'll be working until one or two weeks <br/>
beforehand.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Baby Bear and I took my father to Bull Shoals several years<br/>
ago (before letterboxing) and had a blast.  We had never<br/>
caught trout before and it was exciting.  We stayed at<br/>
a resort called Gaston's and went out in a boat with a<br/>
guide.  He helped us catch many fish, cleaned them for us, <br/>
then the restaurant cooked some for our dinner.  It was <br/>
expensive but worth it!<br/>
We also did a one day canoe trip on the Buffalo River out<br/>
of Ponca that I highly recommend.<br/>
You are right about not many boxes in Arkansas and part<br/>
of the reason is that their State Parks have strict rules<br/>
about boxes and geocaches.  I found out the hard way when<br/>
my only box in that state (Devil's Den in Devil's Den SP)<br/>
was confiscated.  I hope to go back next year and try <br/>
again.  There are just too many great places in that State.<br/>
Glad you had a good time and I look forward to finding your<br/>
boxes if I go.<br/>
