<div>Dusty, Grumpy Grinch doesn’t have access to this board, but I would be 
willing to wager they would really appreciate preteen and teen paperback 
novels.  It sounds like they would accept anything you would like to 
donate.  I asked them and confirmed they will be driving and will be able 
to haul a bunch of books back with them.</div>
