<div>The price for the 2" patch will remain at $2 each. I've gone ahead and ordered them and I'll email everyone who has asked with how to send money. </div>

<div>The large patches - I have to order at least 50, and the price for a 7" patch is $12 each. Obviously, I'm not going to order those and keep them on hand. I wouldn't mind holding as many as 5, but that means I need to get orders (and money) for 45 of them before I'll order them. I'm still shopping those out for the moment, but I don't look to find them much cheaper.</div>
