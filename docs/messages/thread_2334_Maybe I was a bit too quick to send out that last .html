</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My impression of how that whole thing went was that one person made an honest newbie mistake and it affected another person.  The affected person brought it to the AQ list to vent some frustration and ask advice on how to handle it.  Even though you would like to thump that gc'er on the head, you can see how he came to do what he did.  And the affected person did what many, many of us have done before - griped a little about something happening and asked for advice.  Other folks could relate and told their stories and the emotion got stronger and stronger both directions until the posts responded minimally to the OP.  Attacks became personal.  It got ugly, and in came the gc'er.  How horrifying it would be to find that my little bonehead move created such an uproar, and how horrifying to be the one who made the original post asking for help.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hopefully the two of them can take things out of the limelight and sort things out amicably.   It goes to show it is always, always a good thing to take a breath before you post, to stop to think about both sides of the situation, and to ask yourself how your post will contribute to the resolution of the situation.  I know sometimes it's just fun to post a "me too" post or a post that really doesn't contribute anything more than a funny comment, but save those for the innocuous threads, not for the intense ones!

                    <html><body><div>I think the key is to lay back and get a feel for every board you belong to. They all have their own personalities and just like friends, you know who to talk to about certain things.  A few boards have real stable personalities, some like the Big List are pretty turbulent but a lot of fun to watch and to participate in - when you wear your thick armor.  New lists are always fun because everyone is so excited to be on them and they are small and relatively intimate, and eventually they settle in and find their own personae.  I was one of the first 50 or so members of the newboxers list, and it was a collective sigh of relief to have a list like that after the Big List shenanigans.  After that, specialty lists and regional lists started popping up, so we had lots of different outlets for communicating.  And every list is different, and moreso, every list is constantly changing - One person on a list can totally change the dynamics.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I haven't much participated on AQ boards because I have enough with the lists I already belong to, but I'm betting if you were to look at them again in six months, you would be surprised how they evolve.  Lists also have a life of their own, and they do eventually die away as the need for them goes away or the owners are unresponsive to the changing needs.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sometimes it is easy to get caught up in the vacuum of a list or lists, and you forget that what you are seeing of folks is a small part of their big lives...it's all really just a matter of perspective!</div>
