Two of them are part of my Game Series and are long enough hikes to qualify for TX Treasure points.  The Yahtzee Game box should keep you entertained until you have time to find the box:<br>

Boots, I know what you mean about feeling a little let down now that TX is all green.  Whenever you work hard toward a goal it is a little bittersweet once you attain it.  One remedy is to set a new goal, but it's hard not to miss the way you used to feel.<br>
<br>
I sometimes get nostalgic and miss the way it used to be in the early years of letterboxing in TX when there were so few boxes that you thought nothing of driving hundreds of miles for 1 box.  But then I remember wishing for more boxes to find and wonder why I miss those days.  I guess it is like raising children:  I couldn't wait for them to grow up, be out of diapers and become more self-sufficient, but now I sometimes miss those days and wish they weren't growing up so fast.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, I think it is great that TX Letterboxing has continued to grow and even though I sometimes miss the old days, I wouldn't go back.  It's been a great ride and I hope it never ends!<br>
