It is great fun to take opportunities to meet other letterboxers, <br>
especially those that aren't regulars in our area.  The Boxalots <br>
come back to Louisiana to visit family fairly regularly it seems, so <br>
hopefully others will have the chance to meet them.  In the <br>
meantime, if you make it to Northwestern Louisiana, take a minute to <br>
plant a box for them to find on a return visit - they've planted <br>
several in the Shreveport/Bossier City area on their visits.<br>
<br>
It's funny to me how at gatherings and even small meet-ups like this <br>
one everyone falls in like old friends and speaks the same language <br>
and has a high level of mutual understanding in spite of diverse <br>
backgrounds.  Even the kids - throw them together and they play like <br>
old friends.  <br>
<br>
I'm really glad I played hookie from work for the last hour of the <br>
day and went to Rusk to meet up with The Boxalots.  What a nice <br>
break to the summer ho-hums!  I say we make 'em honorary Texans!<br>

Letterboxers are cool!<br>

                    <html><body><div>Thank all of you so much for planting these wonderful boxes in Rusk for us to find!  And for the Texas-sized hospitality!  I lurk on several area lists - and the Texas group is so active and clever.  I love to see what you all come up with - and it was a treat to realize that BarefootLucy (of the FBI) was in possession of the infamous TX Tour Bus and I could lay eyes on it.  You are all so very creative and terrific carvers....and terrific writers!  </div> <div> </div> <div>On the way home last night we were all talking about how the highlight of the day was meeting BarefootLucy, LucyLocket and Blue Butterfly and their children.  Our daughter Smart Cookie was so excited to meet "other letterboxing kids!" and loved the playtime at the park.  </div> <div> </div> <div>I loved hearing the stories you all shared and look forward to hearing more in the future!  It seemed like we could talk for hours.  We would
 love to make it to the October gathering....we'll see once we get settled in DC.  We would love to become Honorary Texans and will represent you well in the big LB world!  </div> <div> </div> <div>We were humbled that you all took time off to come meet us - it was truly the highlight of our day!  We are planning on several other boxes for the Shreveport/Bossier area in the future - come visit!</div> <div> </div> <div>Take care, The Boxalots</div> <div> </div> <div>PS - we escaped East Texas with no snake sightings, no poison oak or ivy and 20 stamps!  A Perfect Day!!  Thanks again!<br/><br/><b><i>ootlucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Blue Butterfly, Lucy Locket, and I (along with their Stinky Monkey <br/>and Roaring Lion, and my Lightning) had the opportunity to meet and <br/>exchange with the absolutely wonderful Boxalot family as they passed <br/>through East Texas today.

several of their boxes and they are worth the drive to La. It was such <br>
a perfect afternoon to exchange. Smart Cookie and Lightening were <br>
great playmates for Stinky Monkey and Roarin' Lion! I agree Lucy, <br>
let's make them honorary Texans!<br>
