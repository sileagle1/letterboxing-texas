                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, nothing this scary happened to me before the first TALE, but I was nervous.  This was back in 2004 when Baby Bear and I had decided to host the first TX LB Event (not counting the Dallas Gathering in 1998 among the few first TX letterboxers).  When I started planning, there was no TX Talklist, so I had no idea how many letterboxers existed in TX or would be willing to come to an Event.  The only way I could invite people was through the LBNA Talklist and via emails to the few letterboxers I had received messages from.  So when we were driving up to Bastrop we thought it was quite possible we would be the only ones attending!  As hosts, we were also worried about the weather, the facilities and how to make it fun if anyone did come.  What a pleasant surprise when over 30 enthusiastic people showed up on a beautiful day and happily entertained themselves without any help from us.  That is why I still don't plan too many activities (unless requested) at TALE because everyone seems to just enjoy meeting and talking with each other, then letterboxing.  As a host, I still worry about some things, but letterboxers are great, and no matter what happens they always make the best of it.  Looking forward to meeting new friends and visiting with existing ones!<br>

> Well, last night I had a dream about it. Everything that could go wrong did!! At one point I was sitting at the table doing exchanges, it was set up to where you stamped in the logbook and then passed it to the next person. Well, my pile was getting bigger and bigger and bigger! Everyone started getting mad at me b/c I was holding everything up. Then all of a sudden I was stamping into some boxes but got the stamps and logbooks all mixed up. I couldn't tell which one went to which box or where they belonged! So I ended up shoving them in my purse and running! LOL I ran to a bathroom b/c I had to use the facilities. However all the stalls were full with letterboxers stamping their sig stamps on the stall walls! I was getting nervous b/c it was taking everyone so long and I really had to go. I just knew it was them getting back at me for taking so long with the exchanges. Well then Blue Butterfly found out that I had shoved the boxes into my purse and<br>
>  started yelling at me for stealing boxes. (Which is hilarious b/c if any of you have ever met Blue Butterfly there isn't a mean bone in her body. LOL) She demanded I give them back to her. When I went to reach for my purse I realized it had been stolen during the scary movie we had all went to see! When I told her my purse had been stolen she apologized for making me see that movie b/c it was so dumb. Then I woke up.<br>

> So now I'm nervous about getting behind during the exchanges, going letterboxing and getting the boxes all mixed up, having to go to the bathroom, someone asking me to see a movie with them, and getting my purse stolen. Just thought I'd share all of that with you so if you see me looking nervous you know what I'm thinking. LOL<br>
