Whooping Crane Numbers May Pass Milestone<br/>
<br/>
AUSTIN, Texas  Wildlife biologists are eagerly watching the skies in <br/>
Texas this fall, wondering if this will be the year when Texas <br/>
whooping cranes will finally pass the 200-bird mark. Canadian <br/>
biologists report that the flock left their nesting grounds last month <br/>
with a record 41 chicks. If mortality is low on the 2,400-mile <br/>
migration route, not only will the flock that winters on the Texas <br/>
coast near Rockport set a new population record since counts began in <br/>
1938, it will also write a new chapter in the comeback story of an <br/>
endangered species that once numbered only 21 birds in the world.<br/>
<br/>
Texas winter flock of whooping cranes (the flock summers and nests in <br/>
northwestern Canada in Wood Buffalo National Park) represents the last <br/>
remaining natural flock of whooping cranes in the wild. When the <br/>
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge was created on the Texas coast in 1937 <br/>
to conserve migratory waterfowl, it also preserved habitat for the last <br/>
migratory flock of whooping cranes left on earth. A handful of <br/>
non-migratory whoopers were found in a non-migratory flock in Louisiana <br/>
at that time, but when the Louisiana birds died out in 1950 following a <br/>
devastating hurricane, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo birds represented the <br/>
last hope for the species.<br/>
<br/>
Texas citizens are asked to be on the watch for whooping cranes <br/>
migrating through the state. The cranes usually pass through a <br/>
migration corridor in Texas that extends from the Texas Panhandle <br/>
eastward to the Dallas-Fort Worth-area and southward to the wintering <br/>
grounds on the central Texas coast. The majority of the cranes pass <br/>
through Texas from late October through the end of November. Whooping <br/>
cranes are the tallest birds in North America, standing at more than <br/>
four feet tall. They are solid white except for black wing-tips that <br/>
are visible only in flight. They fly with necks and legs outstretched. <br/>
During migration, they often pause overnight to use wetlands for <br/>
roosting and agricultural fields for feeding, but seldom remain more <br/>
than one night. They nearly always migrate in small groups of less than <br/>
5-6 birds, but they may be seen roosting and feeding with large flocks <br/>
of the smaller sandhill crane.</div>

Team King <br/>
Thanks for that info. I am planning a camping trip to<br/>
Goose Island State Park after Thanksgiving. I want to<br/>
see the Whooping Cranes!! In July Hummerlady and I<br/>
experiance the Rostea Spoonbills near Corpus. On our<br/>
way back we letterboxed Goose Island and Aransas. <br/>
I am looking forward to finding a few boxes we missed.<br/>
Like Funhog's. I'll be inquiring about them as the<br/>
time gets closer. Please keep me informed about those<br/>
cranes. <br/>
thanks,<br/>
Grits<br/>
you may use my private e-mail.<br/>
