Whooping Crane Numbers May Pass Milestone<br>
<br>
AUSTIN, Texas  Wildlife biologists are eagerly watching the skies in <br>
Texas this fall, wondering if this will be the year when Texas <br>
whooping cranes will finally pass the 200-bird mark. Canadian <br>
biologists report that the flock left their nesting grounds last month <br>
with a record 41 chicks. If mortality is low on the 2,400-mile <br>
migration route, not only will the flock that winters on the Texas <br>
coast near Rockport set a new population record since counts began in <br>
1938, it will also write a new chapter in the comeback story of an <br>
endangered species that once numbered only 21 birds in the world.<br>
<br>
Texas winter flock of whooping cranes (the flock summers and nests in <br>
northwestern Canada in Wood Buffalo National Park) represents the last <br>
remaining natural flock of whooping cranes in the wild. When the <br>
Aransas National Wildlife Refuge was created on the Texas coast in 1937 <br>
to conserve migratory waterfowl, it also preserved habitat for the last <br>
migratory flock of whooping cranes left on earth. A handful of <br>
non-migratory whoopers were found in a non-migratory flock in Louisiana <br>
at that time, but when the Louisiana birds died out in 1950 following a <br>
devastating hurricane, the Aransas-Wood Buffalo birds represented the <br>
last hope for the species.<br>
<br>
Texas citizens are asked to be on the watch for whooping cranes <br>
migrating through the state. The cranes usually pass through a <br>
migration corridor in Texas that extends from the Texas Panhandle <br>
eastward to the Dallas-Fort Worth-area and southward to the wintering <br>
grounds on the central Texas coast. The majority of the cranes pass <br>
through Texas from late October through the end of November. Whooping <br>
cranes are the tallest birds in North America, standing at more than <br>
four feet tall. They are solid white except for black wing-tips that <br>
are visible only in flight. They fly with necks and legs outstretched. <br>
During migration, they often pause overnight to use wetlands for <br>
roosting and agricultural fields for feeding, but seldom remain more <br>
than one night. They nearly always migrate in small groups of less than <br>
5-6 birds, but they may be seen roosting and feeding with large flocks <br>
of the smaller sandhill crane.</div>

Team King <br>
Thanks for that info. I am planning a camping trip to<br>
Goose Island State Park after Thanksgiving. I want to<br>
see the Whooping Cranes!! In July Hummerlady and I<br>
experiance the Rostea Spoonbills near Corpus. On our<br>
way back we letterboxed Goose Island and Aransas. <br>
I am looking forward to finding a few boxes we missed.<br>
Like Funhog's. I'll be inquiring about them as the<br>
time gets closer. Please keep me informed about those<br>
cranes. <br>
thanks,<br>
Grits<br>
you may use my private e-mail.<br>
