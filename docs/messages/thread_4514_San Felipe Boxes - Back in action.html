Though I am sad that the boxes had to move, at least the Ranger was nice about it and mailed the boxes to Baby Bear.  I am especially glad that the Old 300 box is still alive since it is one of the few boxes that old with the original logbook.  Even if you have found it before, I recommend going again just to see all the visitors since 2002.<br/>
