The information included here was shared with someone else on the list<br/>
previously.  Fortunately - I didn't delete it, so I will post it to the<br/>
whole list.  The information is my opinions and experiences, and not the<br/>
final word.<br/>
<br/>
First - everyone knows I am about 1000% patriotic.  This means I will not<br/>
support the french.  And this also means Magellan is OUT!  Magellan is owned<br/>
by Thales.  Thales is a french aerospace company.  Sooooo.....  I have no<br/>
knowledge of any of the latest magellan stuff.  Don't WANT to know either!<br/>
And they will not get a penny from me.  I am not saying do not get one....<br/>
I AM saying I cannot help you there.<br/>
<br/>
I use, and HIGHLY recommend a Garmin.  Specifically, I use a GPS-map-60CS.<br/>
And I LOVE IT!   The best recommendation I can give it is that I have had<br/>
this one nearly 2 years now, and I have not found something I would replace<br/>
it with yet.<br/>
<br/>
Now - I ended up with the 60CS as my fourth GPS.  I outgrew each of the<br/>
first three for various reasons, as follows.  NOTE: these had an accuracy of<br/>
12-18 feet because of the patch antenna.<br/>
<br/>
Garmin E-Trex Yellow.  (Cheap, under $100).  Small display, no pixels, no<br/>
memory, limited waypoint names (6 char) Small - lightweight-easy to use.<br/>
Lasted 6 months.  Gave it to my son.  He took it to Iraq.  Destroyed in<br/>
combat.  Thrown in trash.<br/>
http://www.garmin.com/products/etrex/<br/>
<br/>
Garmin E-Trex Venture.  (under $150)  Better display.  More pixels.  Very<br/>
little memory, limited waypoint names (7 char) Small - lightweight-easy to<br/>
use.  Lasted 18 months.  Sent it to son in Iraq to replace E-Trex Yellow.<br/>
Destroyed in combat.  Sent destroyed unit to Garmin - repaired.  Now my<br/>
spare unit.<br/>
http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVenture/<br/>
<br/>
Garmin E-Trex Vista.  (under $300)  Better display.  More pixels.  Some<br/>
memory, longer waypoint names (8 char) Small - lightweight-easy to use.<br/>
Lasted 18 months. EATS BATTERIES!!!  Like one set every 10 hours!  Sold to<br/>
local hiker.<br/>
http://www.garmin.com/products/etrexVista/<br/>
<br/>
Garmin GPSMAP 60CS.  (under $400) Large detailed color display.  Quad Helix<br/>
antenna (much better (more sensitive) than E-Trex patch antenna). External<br/>
antenna available.  Large memory capacity.  Loadable maps (streets and/or<br/>
TOPO).  Easy to use, lots of functions, plus a real altimeter and a magnetic<br/>
compass built in.  If you look at that feature alone - it replaces your<br/>
normal compass too.  Best of all, more than 24 (I get nearly 30) hours of<br/>
operation on one set (2) Ni-MH rechargeable batteries. GPS weight 5.4 oz.<br/>
7.5 oz with batteries installed.  Typical accuracy for me is 7-9 feet. Fits<br/>
in the hand nicely.  On and On and On....  Hope I am convincing you to NOT<br/>
make the same mistakes I did.  Not much I don't like about it.<br/>
http://www.garmin.com/products/gpsmap60cs/<br/>
<br/>
I have dealt with this company.  Great service, best price at the time.<br/>
Shop around, perhaps you can beat it, but it is a good starting price.<br/>
$363.00.<br/>

<br/>
I put a lot of effort into this - hope it is helpful.  Lemme know if I can<br/>
do more.<br/>
