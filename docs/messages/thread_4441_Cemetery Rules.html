They said you can expect a visit from a priest in the next few days, at which time your power to use the internet will be vanquished.   I then called the N.O.M.O.R.E.I.R.A. (National Organized Mortals On Recon Excersises In Ridding Anamalies) foundation and gave them you address.  Could not wait for the Hatchet thing after seeing what you did. <br>

> You know, I hate to see anyone break cemetery rules, so I sent an email to the Upon Cemetery Association.  I didn't tell them what you did, Baby Bear, I just asked them if they knew and sent a link to the picture of you laughing at their sign.  I received an answer and thought I would share it with you:<br>

We do, however, have rules that must be obeyed.  First, you must purchase a plot from us and have it registered and notorized down at the courthouse, land records department.  Then, you must get a permit to dig.  We can help you with that, and we'll provide a shelter in case it rains.  Once your box is planted, we would suggest, if you want people to find it, that you purchase a nice tombstone.  We offer a nice selection to choose from.  Please ask Mr. B. Bear to contact us regarding his recent plant.<br>
