<div>Hey guys...</div>
<div>My family and I are planning a day at the 
Cedar Ridge Nature Preserve in the next few weeks. While we live near Dallas, we 
aren't in Dallas, and I'm not even sure what is near that area. We plan to look 
for Swing! Swing! Tribute to Benny Goodman, Ludwig's Letterbox, and The Wren. 
Can anyone give me any ideas of other areas near there where we can hunt for 
boxes or where there is an activity we shouldn't pass up? Are there any more 
boxes at the preserve that I might have missed the clues for? My boys (Stinky 
Monkey, Sneaky Cat, and Aslan) are so excited they are almost twins and 
even my husband is going along on this search. We haven't been letterboxing 
since last October and everyone is ready to get back into the swing of 
things.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks!</div>
