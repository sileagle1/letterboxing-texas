                    <div class="plaintext-content">I so appreciate it when someone takes a little bit of time on the<br/>
logbook.  It can be as simple as a pretty paper up front, stickers on<br/>
the cover, an unusual shape to the book.  I went through a period<br/>
where I was using all these one-of-a-kind logbooks.  I've largely<br/>
gotten out of that, because in general, I'm trying to go as small as<br/>
possible.  <br/>
<br/>
I love Sandibox' hand-sewn logbooks and wish I had the patience to<br/>
make them.  I often cut down paper to 2x3 inch size and use a binder<br/>
ring to hold it together.  I often try to personalize it in some way,<br/>
but it depends on how creative I'm feeling.  For instance, for my<br/>
recently planted bird house box, I cut a book down into the shape of a<br/>
little house.<br/>
<br/>
I also like it when the logbook has a little more information about<br/>
the local history, the area, or some quirky fact.<br/>
<br/>
To me, it's not a have-to, but it sure is an added bonus when the<br/>
logbook works with the stamp, the location and the clues to make a<br/>
unique total package.  (and I also like it when the paper is thick<br/>
enough to allow you to stamp on both sides).<br/>

<div>One of the most spectacular logbooks I've seen was created for the Old City Park letterbox in Dallas (placed by Viewfinder). The cover is a beautiful cross stitch of the gazebo in the park handmade by Ruby Tuesday. In fact the entire box is amazing. The box itself is a handmade wooden box with a hand-forged lock made by C2B2 of Colombia, MO, and the stamp is an amazing hand carved stamp by Raindear from Philadelphia, PA. Well worth finding! A wonderful joint, creative effort of some amazingly talented boxers.</div>

<div>You have to pay a fee to go into the park, however, it's a fabulous little village (living museum) portraying life in Dallas in the 1800's. Well worth spending a few hours. I think they have the box in the building where you buy your admission tickets however, so you can just request the box and not go into the park if you find yourself pressed for time.</div>

In truth the logbooks are very simple to make.  It's cutting the <br/>
pages down to size that I dislike... trying to get them uniform in <br/>
size.  But drilling the holes in the paper is a great stress <br/>
reliever, and the actual sewing is really quite easy.  Here's a link <br/>

<p>Aawww, thanks Dewberry, you're too kind. :) <br/><br/>In truth the logbooks are very simple to make. It's cutting the <br/>pages down to size that I dislike... trying to get them uniform in <br/>size. But drilling the holes in the paper is a great stress 
<br/>reliever, and the actual sewing is really quite easy. Here's a link <br/>to the instructions (not mine) in case anyone else would like to try:<br/><a href="http://www.sff.net/people/Brook.West/bind/bindit.html" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">

<br/>on<br/>&gt; the cover, an unusual shape to the book. I went through a period<br/>&gt; where I was using all these one-of-a-kind logbooks. I've largely<br/>&gt; gotten out of that, because in general, I'm trying to go as small 
<br/>as<br/>&gt; possible. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I love Sandibox' hand-sewn logbooks and wish I had the patience to<br/>&gt; make them. I often cut down paper to 2x3 inch size and use a <br/>binder<br/>&gt; ring to hold it together. I often try to personalize it in some 
<br/>way,<br/>&gt; but it depends on how creative I'm feeling. For instance, for my<br/>&gt; recently planted bird house box, I cut a book down into the shape <br/>of a<br/>&gt; little house.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I also like it when the logbook has a little more information about
<br/>&gt; the local history, the area, or some quirky fact.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To me, it's not a have-to, but it sure is an added bonus when the<br/>&gt; logbook works with the stamp, the location and the clues to make a<br/>
&gt; unique total package. (and I also like it when the paper is thick<br/>&gt; enough to allow you to stamp on both sides).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; dewberry<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">

<div>Cool! Just looking at this site reminded me that I want to take my grandsons there again soon! They would love watching the docents shearing the sheep, spinning the wool, and cooking etc. at the old farm. There is storyteller that sits on the front porch of the farmstead in costume and tells stories in first person about the farm. Great place for kids. It gets a little crowded later in the spring time with all the school field trips so this is a good time to go.</div>

<div>The one part of planting a box that I really don't enjoy is making the logbook.  Consequently, I have boring logbooks.  They get the job done, but it sure would be fun to have a little nicer book in my boxes!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone have any thoughts?  Preferences about what you like in a logbook?  Things you DON'T like in a logbook?  Cool ways to make logbooks?  My one preference is thick enough paper so that stamps don't bleed through if folks stamp on both sides of a page... </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Bear in mind, this is a BOX logbook, not a personal logbook...<br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>

<div>Just this week I was just thinking that I would like to invest in a better paper cutter. Next to covering my boxes with camo tape, my least favorite part of putting a box together is cutting down the paper for my logbooks. I like the rotary type cutters, but my little one will only cut about 6 sheets at a time so it takes a while. I usually like to put about 30+ sheets in my logbooks, especially since they've had so many visitors recently. I enjoy making the covers. That's part of the creative experience for me, but cutting all that paper down... bah!</div>

<p>I have a scrapbooking papercutter that I use to cut cards down - instead of a big chopping blade, it has a small wheel.  I also have a small round cutter that I got when I started buying the 3 container set of lock-n-locks - the only LNL available around here except the larger containers.  I figured I'd better try using the rounds too.  Lightning liked the round cutter -  I entered the kitchen one day right after I got it to see him happily cutting rounds - on my kitchen table - without anything underneath it.  ugh.  Thankfully, we have foregone buying nice furniture in favor of having fun with the kids, so I didn't have to get TOO upset about it!  (although I doubt he'll make THAT mistake again!) <br/><br/>
