<div>Well, thanks to a particular butterfly, I missed 
my chance at catching the bus.</div>
<div>If I had thoroughly read Friday's 
posts, I would have gone up there in the dark! I was sure I was going to be 
going head-to-head with the Gryphon as FF for this one, since it's right up the 
road.  Seems that Butterfly is a contender!  </div>
