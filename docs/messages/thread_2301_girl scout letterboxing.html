I took my troop letterboxing this weekend.  We had so much fun!  We <br/>
found 5 in the Bastrop SP area.  Don't worry-we had a troop stamp and <br/>
the girls wrote their names on one page of the log books.  What is a <br/>
bus?  I read somewhere about logging your finds on line-how do you do <br/>
that? <br/>

But, to answer your questions on logging your finds:</div> <div> </div> <div>You can go to <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/">www.letterboxing.org</a> or to <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/">www.atlasquest.com</a> to log your finds. There might be other sites too. If there are, I don't know about them. Some of the boxes are listed on both sites. There are really good tutorials on both sites on how to log in and search for your boxes.</div> <div> </div> <div>I bet y'all had a blast. Kids love this hobby. It's hard for me to explain to my daughter (she's 6) how important it is to be discreet. I keep telling her that she's going to be kicked out of the club. It cracks my older daughter up when I say that, but it has no effect on the little one at all. </div> <div> </div> <div>Have a great day,</div> <div>Janet<br/><br/><b><i>troop2123 &lt;vmhip@verizon.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hello Everyone,<br/>I took my troop letterboxing this weekend.
