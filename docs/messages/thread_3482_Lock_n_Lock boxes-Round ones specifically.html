<p>I had the same issue with the small round LnLs. I found a round hole<br/>punch at Hobby Lobby. It punches a 2 5/16" circle that fits perfectly<br/>inside. Its by The Paper Studio and was $13.99. Thank goodness for<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>A few years ago Lightning and I really got into birdwatching from our study, which has a window out to the front porch and the big tree where our bird feeder hangs.  We kept our bird feed in a trash can with a flip lid on the front porch and happily filled our feeder up with regularity.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Until the squirrels got wind of what was going on.  It wasn't that we didn't want the squirrels around, but they made a horrible mess as they swung from the feeder and slung feed everywhere.  Rather than trying to run them off, we put a baffle on the bird feeder and began feeding the squirrels on the ground and the birds, the squirrels, and the people were happy.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Until the squirrels realized the food source was sitting on the front porch.  Despite the fact they had food on the ground, the squirrels became preoccupied with raiding the motherload.  We would look out the window and see them peeking over the edge of the porch to see if we were peeking out the window, and they eventually got brave enough that it didn't matter if we were watching - they would step right on up on the porch and try to be nonchalant about checking out the trash can.  And then they started going in.  Lightning got it in his head that he was going to trap one in the trash can, although I warned him he would have his hands full if it actually happened.  He very methodically began trying different techniques for rigging the latch on the trash can so the squirrel could slip in but would have more difficulty getting out, but every time he began to approach the can while the squirrel was inside, the squirrel would hear him coming and explode out of the can, sometimes knocking it over, always startling the heck out of Lightning, and invariably escaping.  I have this perpetual vision of Lightning flying off his feet, the squirrel flying out of the can, and feed basically flying everywhere.  I wonder what the birds thought as they watched it going on...</div>

&gt; Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Lock'n'Lock boxes<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I had the same issue with the small round LnLs. I found a round hole<br/>&gt; punch at Hobby Lobby. It punches a 2 5/16" circle that fits <br/>
perfectly<br/>&gt; inside. Its by The Paper Studio and was $13.99. Thank goodness for<br/>&gt; those 40% off coupons. It was still more than I wanted to spend, but<br/>&gt; I don't have to spin in circles to cut the paper anymore. <br/>

&gt; bought another<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; set at Asel Art in Dallas (Plano) recently when I saw them. <br/>Today, a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxer told me that I can pinch the #1 nib to make it<br/>&gt; narrower for more<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; detailed carving if I heated it first and pinched it with <br/>
pliers.<br/>&gt; So I tried<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that since I have two #1's and it worked. I had to carve a very<br/>&gt; intricate<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp for an LTC ring, and I was pretty pleased with the final<br/>&gt; product. That<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamp is going to eventually end up as a planted letterbox in<br/>&gt; Denton for the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; North of the Lake event in June.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I was able to purchase my Lock n Locks from Target until just<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a beautiful Red Cardinal who frequents my bird feeder that <br>
hangs in my patio that I've been trying to take a picture of and <br>
everytime I see him I run to the front of the house to get my camera <br>
and when I get back to the patio and he's gone again. I've only <br>
gotten 1 picture but it's only of his head and shoulders as he was <br>
sitting on the grass up close to the patio floor and that's all I <br>
could see of him.<br>
<br>
I'll get him someday. :)<br>
