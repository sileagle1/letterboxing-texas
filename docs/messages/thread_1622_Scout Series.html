This is the link I would give to them.  I'm giving<br/>

Great idea for a Scout series!  Being a letterboxer and a Scout <br/>
myself....I love the idea of teaching kids to letterbox responsibly!<br/>
<br/>
And I thought your instructions were great.  Lots of good safety <br/>
and "rules to live by" info.  The only thing is that I couldn't read <br/>
the text very well on the page with the black and white textured <br/>
background.  Awesome graphic for your series, but me and the kiddos <br/>
couldn't read the words on that one page.<br/>
<br/>
If we are able to attend the gathering, my daughter wants to take <br/>
the time to do the series.  Especially since her Cub Scout brother <br/>
wouldn't be able to be there with us!  She thinks it'll be a great <br/>
bargaining tool...."if you'll clean my room, I'll stamp the Scout <br/>
series for you!?!"<br/>
<br/>
Even if we're not able to make the gathering, we will definitely <br/>
make the trip to do the Series at a later date.<br/>

I wonder if you could just put a plain white text box under the text <br/>
portion and have the background show all around it ... kinda like a <br/>
picture frame?<br/>
<br/>
We didn't know about the other two boxes...we were super excited <br/>
before...now we're almost delirious!!!<br/>
