and posted.  I hate that I procrastinate so badly in<br>
writing up clues!  <br>
<br>
For those of you who don't remember what I was doing,<br>
I placed a training series geared toward scouts so<br>
that there would be some boxes out there for scout<br>
groups to cut their teeth on before they approached<br>
"real" boxes in the wild.  Hopefully by the time they<br>
finish my series, they will understand the points that<br>
are important to letterboxers.<br>
<br>
I've posted them on LBNA, but I've written them up on<br>
a webpage to give some general information about<br>
letterboxing.  Scout leaders would have to email me<br>
for the link so I can follow who is doing the series. <br>
This is the link I would give to them.  I'm giving<br>
them to y'all now so you can go find the series if you<br>
want when you come to the gathering or otherwise, but<br>
also I'm hoping you'll review them for me and let me<br>
know if you think there is anything I should add!<br>

Begin at the link that says "Clues for Scout Series"<br>

<br>
Great idea for a Scout series!  Being a letterboxer and a Scout <br>
myself....I love the idea of teaching kids to letterbox responsibly!<br>
<br>
And I thought your instructions were great.  Lots of good safety <br>
and "rules to live by" info.  The only thing is that I couldn't read <br>
the text very well on the page with the black and white textured <br>
background.  Awesome graphic for your series, but me and the kiddos <br>
couldn't read the words on that one page.<br>
<br>
If we are able to attend the gathering, my daughter wants to take <br>
the time to do the series.  Especially since her Cub Scout brother <br>
wouldn't be able to be there with us!  She thinks it'll be a great <br>
bargaining tool...."if you'll clean my room, I'll stamp the Scout <br>
series for you!?!"<br>
<br>
Even if we're not able to make the gathering, we will definitely <br>
make the trip to do the Series at a later date.<br>

In addition to the six box series, there are two more<br>
boxes on that same trail, so you get a lot of bang for<br>

I wonder if you could just put a plain white text box under the text <br>
portion and have the background show all around it ... kinda like a <br>
picture frame?<br>
<br>
We didn't know about the other two boxes...we were super excited <br>
before...now we're almost delirious!!!<br>
