<br/>
Pink Cookie and I had a great time at Tale 8 as well! Thank you Silver Eagle &amp; Baby Bear and everyone else who helped made it another great event! I will post the pictures i have as soo as i can!  We can't wait until Tale 9!<br/>
<br/>
On a side note I wanted to let everyone know that we brought home more than just cooties this year... We had a stomach virus hit Pink Cookie Sunday night that kept her home from school on Mon. and me on Monday night that sent me home from work on Tues., it lasts about 24 hours. So if you've been ill that's what it was.<br/>
