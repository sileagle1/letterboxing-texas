                    <html><body><p>I thought I would mention that anyone who wants to bring their recipes for their gathering food and give them to me, I would put them on my letterboxing food blog. Be cool to include your sig stamp, if you don't mind it being posted to the internet. If you don't want that, no worries...<br/>
<br/>Also, someone mentioned a new recipe they thought I might want to post there, but I don't remember who it was. I'll always be glad to post letterboxers' recipes. It's just a fun site, nothing too awful serious.<br/>
<br/>Here's what I have so far:<br/><br/><a href="http://eatinglikeletterboxers.blogspot.com/">http://eatinglikeletterboxers.blogspot.com/</a><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>
