<div>Lucy, my last personal experience with most of those boxes was last 
  spring at the the Rusk gathering, and wonderful boxes they were, too!  
  I've heard from several finders of my Boxcar Willie recently and know that a 
  corner of the stamp is apparently broken, although all the finders report 
  being able to get a "perfect" image in spite of that.  You and I have 
  discussed doing repairs to this stamp already.  As for the others, I hope 
  none of the rest go missing or are arbitrarily removed by anyone other than 
  the owners, so maybe we can all enjoy them in January!  </div>

I'm sorry Texas Pecan Festival is missing.  What happened there?<br>

Midnight Run is one that I am responsible for and was carved by an<br>

<div>Above are the statuses I have so far.  Lightning and I will be going out to check boxes tomorrow, assuming we have no more tornado warnings - they've been popping all over the place this evening, with at least two sightings around us.  It looks like most of our work will need to be around Jim Hogg and Rusk State Park, but the good thing about that is that we can get a lot of boxes checked in one day.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dewberry, I don't actually recall what the deal was with Pecan Festival, but PurpleintexKim found it in distress and retrieved it.  I'm going to try to get it back from her and re-plant it before the gathering.  She also retrieved Gephyrophobia and I'm going to get it from her and refurb it for Catpawz so it can get back out there, hopefully by the gathering.  She sent Cherokee Nation back to Ruby, and if Ruby is amenable, I'll re-plant that one for her too.  It's taken a precious amount of work and help from so many boxers to get this county planted, I hate to see us lose even one little box from here!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And on that note, I would like to yet again mention to all of you how much I appreciate y'all going off your respective paths to put boxes around here.  As I check various boxes in the course of my coming and going, I always think how truly wonderful the Texas letterboxing community is to one another.  Y'all are awesome!

<div><font size="2">You're absolutely correct. It's not okay to remove a box without the owner's permission. I think this was just an overzealous "newbie" error. Hopefully the boxes will be repaired and returned to their original locations before the gathering down in Rusk in a few weeks.</font></div>
