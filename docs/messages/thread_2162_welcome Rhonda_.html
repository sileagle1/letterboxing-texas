<div>Welcome to a new 
Houston area letterboxer!  I do almost all of my letterboxing with my kids 
(ages 10, 8, 5, 3 and 1) in the Houston area.  Most all boxes around here 
are kid friendly, and many are in spectacular kid places (like Silver Eagle's 
Gordon Grouper, for example).  It just depends on what you are looking for 
(a long walk, a playground, a historical cemetery, etc) Houston has them 
all!  I would suggest looking at the boxes on LBNA and AQ, picking one or 
two close to home, and head out!  One tip I do have for going with kids is 
to use a group stamp to stamp into the boxes, with lots of individual stamps it 
can take a long time with lots of kids.  Also, I know kids LOVE to re hide 
boxes, and it is fine to let them help, as long as you are "checking their work" 
and making sure boxes are really well covered when you leave them.  If you 
have any specific questions about individual boxes or anything else, just feel 
free to ask!  Mother of Five</div></body></html>
