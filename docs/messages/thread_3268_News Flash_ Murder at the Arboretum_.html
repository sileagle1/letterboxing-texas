<p>I'm willing to consider offers. If we could only find the right 
    <br/>actors to play the parts. Let's see, I could see George Clooney as 
    <br/>Sterling Seagull, and maybe Brad Pitt as Kid Kodiak...what do you 
    <br/>think?<br/><br/>The Texians <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>,

    What a wonderful way to put together clues. Will there be a movie <br/>&gt;

    &gt; A body has been discovered on a popular hiking trail at an <br/>&gt; 
    arboretum <br/>&gt; &gt; nearbu. Police have identified the victim is one Ira 
    Boxer, age <br/>&gt; &gt; unknown, of Houston. Little is known of Mr. Boxer, 
    and attempts <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; locate next of kin have failed. When 
    found, Mr. Boxer was <br/>wearing <br/>&gt; &gt; only red boxer shorts 
    decorated with white hearts. In his hand <br/>he <br/>&gt; &gt; held a rubber 
    stamp, the image of which was the same red shorts <br/>&gt; with <br/>&gt; 
    &gt; white hearts and the letters "IRA". In addition, a log book <br/>&gt; 
    &gt; imprinted with many stamped images was lying in the dirt <br/>nearby. 
    <br/>&gt; &gt; The coroner, based on clues found at the scene, has ruled the 
    <br/>death <br/>&gt; &gt; a homicide.<br/>&gt; &gt; With certain information 
    contained in the logbook, as well <br/>&gt; &gt; as clues found at the scene, 
    several suspects have been <br/>&gt; identified. <br/>&gt; &gt; They 
    are:<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Sterling Seagull<br/>&gt; &gt; Kid 
    Kodiak<br/>&gt; &gt; Suzy Shoeless<br/>&gt; &gt; Rubus Trivialis<br/>&gt; &gt;
