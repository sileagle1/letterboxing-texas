                    <html><body><div>I lived in the San Fernando Valley for the first 15 yrs of my life. So, I was there during the Sylmar earthquake. My Nany actually lived IN Sylmar. At least with an earthquake you can pretty safely go outside and not have to worry about being sucked up into the air. If the ground starts opening up where you are standing you can move and stay away from buildings and trees that may fall on you. (But, truthfully, it was still scary) Tornados, they horrify me, they just scare the poop out of me. It's really hard trying to not terrify Cassandra when there's one around. I try to make a game out of it, when in truth, I'm praying for our lives.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, BF<br/><br/><b><i>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>I used to live in California with earthquakes.  Admittedly, it was pretty disconcerting when the ground started moving, but folks back home in Texas used to say they didn't understand how we could live where there were earthquakes.  I used to tell 'em "even if you feel an earthquake you don't necessarily have any damage, but when you feel a tornado, there is ALWAYS damage."  Still - we were glad we moved back when we did because we had 6 earthquakes in one year that were 4.0 or higher, and the very next year was the year of a big earthquake in LA.<br/><br/> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 6/20/07, <b class="gmail_sendername">Suzanne Coe</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:wilmcoe@yahoo.com">wilmcoe@yahoo.<wbr>com</wbr></a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid"> <div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div>I have to give y'all points for being able to live in a place where you have permanent designated "Severe Weather Shelters" in the mall &amp; the airport--that was a first for me!</div> <div> </div> <div>Sheba  <br/><br/><b><i>janet clark &lt;jayceeinbedford@<a href="http://yahoo.com/" target="_blank">yahoo.com</a>&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote style="BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"> <div> <div> <div>Welcome.
