                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am in San Antonio for the weekend... and had a great time <br>
letterboxing on Saturday, despite the heat! I came down from <br>
Amarillo, and stopped off in Lubbock real quick- so here's the boxes <br>
we did the past 2 days:<br>
<br>
Buddy Holly letterbox (Silver Eagle's)-Lubbock- 7/23 it's alive and <br>
well! We also ran into a cute but scrawny stray black cat while we <br>
were there- he's apparently living in the bushes at the base of Buddy <br>
Holly's sculpture. We did our stamp exchange, put the microbox back <br>
in its place (and kept the kitty from seeing- hehe) and then went to <br>
the convenience store at the corner nearby to get a small can of cat <br>
food and brought it back out for the kitty. He was HUNGRY, and <br>
devoured it. My sons loved the kitty more than the box, but I was <br>
happy to find the box. :-)<br>
<br>
Raymond Russell Park box- (Angi's- Anderson Family I believe)- San <br>
Antonio- 7/24 I know the web site said it was missing since Dec 03 <br>
but we went to look anyway- and didn't find it. I really do think <br>
it's missing because the area rocks looked somewhat rearranged (well- <br>
alot rearranged) and we could see a spot where it might've been but <br>
nothing there. So, we're confirming that it's still missing.<br>
<br>
Friedrich Warbler Box (Silver Eagle)-San Antonio- 7/24 It's alive and <br>
well! I took a friend with me (and without my kids) and it was his <br>
first letterboxing experience where we found something (the Raymond <br>
Russell one was his first hunt) and he thought it was REALLY cool to <br>
find a box and see what it's all about. :-)<br>
<br>
Texas Armadillo box- also in Friedrich Wilderness Park (Anderson <br>
Family)- San Antonio- 7/25 We looked for this one today (it got too <br>
hot to keep going yesterday so we'd stopped even though we were <br>
already out there) Anyway, this one was marked as missing Dec 03 on <br>
the web site too, but we wanted to check and we didn't find it. Found <br>
the tree mentioned in the clues, but nothing there, and looked all <br>
around nearby and downhill too- in case it might've been washed off <br>
by runoff- but nothing. So we're confirming that it is still missing.<br>
<br>
Comanche Feather (Wanda's)- San Antonio- 7/24- VERY cool place! The <br>
box is alive and well too. I wish I had taken a camera with me for <br>
the views we had from up there. I never knew there was that stone <br>
tower out there. :-)<br>
<br>
Peanuts box (Baby Bear's)- San Antonio- 7/24- Nice easy hunt! Saw 2 <br>
baby deer while we were out there (and a few CRAZY joggers who were <br>
out running in near-100-degree temps) and it was the first box that <br>
my friend actually found himself! :-) I hope he is hooked, but I'm <br>
not sure if he will sign on and get a nickname and all that though. <br>
He did sign all the logs with mine, and if you ever see a "Kalel" <br>
it's my friend.<br>
<br>
Anyway, that was our exciting weekend of hunting. If I get out to do <br>
more I will report back. <br>
<br>
And for those who are on here alot... is it important if I email the <br>
box owners directly also, or will posting here be enough to notify <br>
everyone? If I need to email people directly, it'd be no trouble.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone for the fun boxes!<br>
