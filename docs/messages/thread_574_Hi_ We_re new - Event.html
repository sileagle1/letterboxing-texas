Welcome.  That is amazing you already encountered<br>
another letterboxer on the trail.  I guess there<br>
are enough Texas letterboxers now that it is not<br>
so uncommon for this to happen.<br>
The TX LB Rodeo Event will be held at Brazos Bend SP<br>
on Saturday, March 19.  You can get more details<br>
by going to my Event website at:<br>
<br>
http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/Events/TLRE/<br>
<br>
It is also listed in the Links section of this talklist.<br>
Hope you can make it.<br>
