<br>
My family asked me what I wanted for Mother's Day and I said, "To go <br>
Letterboxing!"  We haven't been since the gathering in Bastrop, so I <br>
was real excited when they agreed.<br>
<br>
We only snagged one box, Silver Eagles Mercer Monarch, but it was a <br>
beautiful day in the park. We didn't find Baby Bears Houston Rocket <br>
either (it was reported missing on the clue sheet).<br>
<br>
Hope everyone enjoyed their day just as much as I did :)<br>
<br>
Happyhomeschoolers,<br>
