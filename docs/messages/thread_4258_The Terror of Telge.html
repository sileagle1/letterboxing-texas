&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, Texas.  I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas.  In doing my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas.  Most of the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote".  It had never been found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, at the cemetery tonight.  It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work.  This was our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our own.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How cool is that?  As most of you know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes!  I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes.  I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of my letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox<br/>
&gt; &gt; County, Texas. I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas. In doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas. Most of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild<br/>
&gt; &gt; turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because<br/>
&gt; &gt; that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of<br/>
&gt; &gt; photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling<br/>
&gt; &gt; coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his<br/>
&gt; &gt; coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote". It had never been<br/>
&gt; &gt; found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as<br/>
&gt; &gt; follows:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his,<br/>
&gt; &gt; coyote, at the cemetery tonight. It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a<br/>
&gt; &gt; great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work. This was<br/>
&gt; &gt; our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of<br/>
&gt; &gt; our own.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How cool is that? As most of you know, the usual subjects of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes! I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes. I'll try to beat<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, Texas.  I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas.  In doing my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas.  Most of the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote".  It had never been found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, at the cemetery tonight.  It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work.  This was our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our own.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How cool is that?  As most of you know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes!  I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes.  I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Instead of the usual high thread-count Egyptian cotton sheets I normally wear, when I go to Telge Park, I wear mosquito netting, because those little critters are the real "terrors of Telge". Of course, they are lower calories, so that's just a bonus.<br/>

I hope most of the boxes in Telge are still there.  The park had 2 major floods in spring, and I have not had a chance to check on the boxes.   May try to do some of that this weekend (being sure to bring my ghost busters gear just in case IRA the Bad New Boxer shows up).    <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What an amazing story.  Who better to have carved the stamp also, as I'm sure they were impressed.   Someone (I'm betting on IRA) took a poop in one of my boxes once, but I like your story better!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, Texas.  I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas.  In doing my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas.  Most of the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote".  It had never been found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, at the cemetery tonight.  It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work.  This was our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our own.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How cool is that?  As most of you know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes!  I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes.  I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/>
