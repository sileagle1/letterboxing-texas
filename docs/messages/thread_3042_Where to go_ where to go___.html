try to get out and go again next weekend, especially when I realized that<br/>
next weekend is LABOR DAY WEEKEND!<br/>
<br/>
Wow!  I can't believe how time flies.  Labor Day marks four years officially<br/>
for us (but no, we aren't the ones who have that annoying reminder on LBNA)<br/>
<br/>
Although I learned about letterboxing quite some time before actually<br/>
getting involved, I learned about it as a homeschooling activity and we<br/>
played it amongst ourselves as a sort of hide and seek with a twist on group<br/>
activities.  I somehow figured out that there was letterboxing in the bigger<br/>
world too and started checking it out.  It was about four years ago right<br/>
now that I was immersing myself in learning about it so that when we<br/>
actually made a trip out we wouldn't look like total newbs.<br/>
<br/>
The problem with studying about letterboxing is that there is very limited<br/>
studying that can really be done.  Back then, there was nothing but the Big<br/>
List in terms of talk lists.  There was only LBNA as far as websites.  And<br/>
somehow, studying on LBNA was feeding me just enough to whet my appetite,<br/>
but not enough to quench my thirst for knowledge.  Being the sort of person<br/>
who wants to know everything about something before trying it, it was<br/>
terribly hard for me to just say "Okay guys, let's give it a go."<br/>
<br/>
I can sort of remember the conversation going "Okay y'all, we're going<br/>
letterboxing."  And the response being "What's that?"  And the ensuing<br/>
attempt at explanation (how did YOU first explain it to someone???), ending<br/>
as I tapered off and said something like, "well, you know, it's sort of like<br/>
that...I think."  The obvious response to my feeble explanation was "WHY?"<br/>
To which I used the rare "Because I want to".  Now that particular line only<br/>
really works on my birthday and Mother's Day, and it also works around Labor<br/>
Day because Labor Day marks the time my dad died and they all knew that it<br/>
was best to get me out and busy rather than laying around the house and<br/>
slipping into a funk.  Fearless Fox, already the LSS, thought it was a<br/>
hoax.  Thought it was a trap.  Thought it had to be some sort of gimicky<br/>
something.  But figured it was wiser to humor me, so he told the kids we<br/>
were going letterboxing (I remember thinking "Didn't I just say that?")  I<br/>
printed off all seven clues that we could possibly reach, find, and return<br/>
home from in one day's time.  SEVEN!  That was ALL!  I read one clue, Baby<br/>
Bear's Tejas, that would take us down a path we had taken many, many times.<br/>
In fact, I could practically visualize where he was describing the box to<br/>
be.  It took my breath away to think there was a box just a few feet from<br/>
where our feet had travelled.  I hooked Fearless Fox by reading him the clue<br/>
and he was determined to disprove it.  Such a cynic he was!<br/>
<br/>
So off we went, stopping at Walmart to buy in cheap - three cheap<br/>
store-bought stamps (none for Fearless Fox, thank you) and a little flip<br/>
book of index cards.  And a stamp pad.  Black, of course, off the office<br/>
supplies aisle.  We passed a couple of boxes in Rusk, one in Alto, then<br/>
passed one closer to the park entrance, in our determination to go find the<br/>
one that we knew where was.  We followed the clues very closely, found<br/>
ourselves where we thought we would, and as we cautiously peeked, none of us<br/>
knowing what to expect, we saw the box.  It blew us all away!  Amazing!<br/>
Fearless Fox was still convinced there had to be a catch, but at least he<br/>
was a little interested.<br/>
