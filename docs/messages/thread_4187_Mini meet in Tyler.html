                    <div class="plaintext-content">I posted on the list a few weeks back about a meet in Tyler.  Thank you to all who have signed up on AQ and who have let me know you will be there.  In case it matters to anyone (it really matters to me!) I rented a large fan/mister today to set up at the pavillion.  Hopefully it will allow those who are a little less heat-tolerant (ME!) to enjoy the event a bit more.  I look forward to see/meeting you in a few weeks!<br>
