                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was such a lovely day Thursday that James and I decided to do some <br>
much needed letterbox maintenance. We went to "Hot & Cole" and all was <br>
fine. Then we went to Mabank to "The Blue Daisy" and after some <br>
searching, we found it and rehid it in a (maybe) better spot. The <br>
workers of the park had done some clean up and also some trees had <br>
rotted and fell so the clues need to be updated. Will do that as soon <br>
as I write this. Next we went to Purtis Creek. We had some information <br>
that some of our boxes were not in good shape. "Swimming up Stream" got <br>
a new stamp and log book. "Lions, Tigers, and Frogs" also needed <br>
attention. "The Great Outdoors" was in such bad shape that we brought <br>
it home to repair. It will be back in action soon with new clues. Next <br>
we went to "The Drifter". We replaced everything and put it back in the <br>
same spot. Captian Zach's box was perfect and needed no maintenance. We <br>
then went to "An Apple for the Teacher" and it needed no maintenance. <br>
We went to "The Eyes of Texas and all was well. That is as far as we <br>
got yesterday. I will update clues and have "The Great Outdoors" back <br>
as soon as we can. <br>
