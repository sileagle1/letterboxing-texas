<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I was looking at my 
latest issue of "Family Fun" (a wonderful magazine, by the way) this 
afternoon.  I was reading an article about how to get you kids to enjoy 
hiking when I find a bit all about Letterboxing.  About 3 years ago Family 
Fun ran an article about "Questing" and gave the LBNA website.  This is how 
we initially started letterboxing.  The bit I read today was short, but it 
also had the LBNA link.  It made me wonder if we might see some new boxers 
pop up.  It also made me wonder how all of us started letterboxing.  
We know Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's story, and I think Teamking started with 
the article in TIME.  What about the rest of you?

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="045455602-10052006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">My story is simple.  I ran in to a Letterbox Hybrid 
Geocache on the Geocaching.com website.  I had no idea what a Letterbox 
was, so I looked it up.  Google took me to LBNA.  I thought it was a 
cool idea.  So I had a stamp made.  This is my 
stamp.</font></span></div>

photo of me and the dog hiking in a field of yellow/orange poppies.  So the 
next weekend my handgun instructor and I hiked to the Letterbox Hybrid Geocache 
on Indian Peak.  This was 18 Sep 2005.  It was a tough hike.  So 
much that my partner wanted to quit and go back when he saw the final 
approach.  I agreed, it looked tough.  But I am not a quitter.  
So I told him to set up under some shade, I would be back.  Well, he isn't 
really a quitter either.</span></font></font></font></div>

<div><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><font size="2"><span class="045455602-10052006">The letterbox part of the Geocache was as cool as I 
expected it to be.  It was a store-bought Kokopeli stamp, in red ink.  
I stamped up, took a few photos, and we started back down.  We were both 
sore for a few days from that one.  But I was hooked.  If you look at 
the photos you can see how steep the last peak was.  The photo doesn't 
really do it justice!  Here is the hike:</span></font></font></font></div>

<div><font face="Arial"><font color="#0000ff"><font size="2"><span class="045455602-10052006">My next letterbox was Silver Eagle's Mogollon 
Mask.  This was a REAL letterbox, not a hybrid geocache.  This was 24 
Sept 2005.  It wasn't a tough hike, so my wife could come along.  We 
took two of the Texas Chihuahuas with us, Parker and Sammy.  Parker is the 
black one, Sammy is the pup.  The directions were a little confusing.  
After this weekend, I am beginning to think that Silver Eagle is 8 feet tall, 
because his estimate of distance is a lot longer than it should be.  I bet 
he has 5 ft legs and one pace is 48 inches on him!  &lt;grin&gt;  But 
find it we did, and stamped up.  Then walked the dogs around the park for a 
while.</span></font></font></font></div>

could put a physical letterbox Hybrid Geocache up there, he agreed.  So up 
it went.  Here is the stamp.</span></font></font></font></div>

<div>My introduction to letterboxing was serendipitous. I was an antique dealer in Connecticut and spent most of my weekends at "tag sales" (garage sales) hunting for treasures. One Saturday, I bought a lamp at a tag sale and the lady wrapped it in an old yellowed copy of the Danbury Post newspaper. When I got home and was unwrapping it, an article in that old paper caught my attention. It was a reporter's account of his weekend letterboxing adventure with some friends. I immediately went to the internet sites listed in the article (Connecticut Forestry Department Letterboxing and LBNA). Two hours later, my husband and I had located our first box. Five weeks later, I had found all thirty boxes hidden by the Forestry Department in each of their thirty forests in CT and "earned" my walking stick. Then I moved on to the LBNA site. Hiking has always been my favorite outdoor activity, so letterboxing was a natural fit! I've always been amazed by the incredibly interesting places I've discovered by letterboxing, but the most amazing part is the wonderful and fascinating people I've encountered through letterboxing.</div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I was looking at my latest issue of "Family Fun" (a wonderful magazine, by the way) this afternoon.  I was reading an article about how to get you kids to enjoy hiking when I find a bit all about Letterboxing.  About 3 years ago Family Fun ran an article about "Questing" and gave the LBNA website.  This is how we initially started letterboxing.  The bit I read today was short, but it also had the LBNA link.  It made me wonder if we might see some new boxers pop up.  It also made me wonder how all of us started letterboxing.  We know Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's story, and I think Teamking started with the article in TIME.  What about the rest of you?  -MO5</font></div></font></blockquote></body></html>
