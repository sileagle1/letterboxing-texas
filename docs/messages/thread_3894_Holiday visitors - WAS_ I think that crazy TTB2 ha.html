<p>Thanks! MeMa loves letterboxing, but can't get anyone in Baltimore <br/>to 
  go with her. We all had a great time today, but I'm afraid we've <br/>worn her 
  out. We probably hiked 4-5 miles today. Not bad for a 67-<br/>year 
  youngster!<br/><br/>She could probably put up with SoccerChik and I being night 
  owls and <br/>keeping her up until midnight or later, if it weren't for 
  early-bird <br/>hubby who wakes her up at 6am every day. She's leaving Sunday 
  and <br/>looking forward to getting some rest at home. ;)<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,

  Subject: [letterboxingtexas] I think that crazy TTB2 has gotten <br/>lost in 
  the<br/>&gt; pines!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; After loitering at my 
  house for several weeks, those crazy <br/>passengers <br/>&gt; of the Texas Tour 
  Bus 2 took off this morning in a big ole hurry! I <br/>&gt; thought I heard the 
  bus driver say something about going to Austin, <br/>&gt; but wasn't sure I 
  heard correctly. MeMa of 7 is still visiting from <br/>&gt; Baltimore, so she, 
  SoccerChik and I jumped in my car to to give <br/>chase.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; They 
  headed west on I-10 for 40 miles or so, and made a quick side <br/>&gt; trip to 
  San Felipe. I think the Ghost of Davy Crockett wanted to <br/>say <br/>&gt; 
  hello to some Old friends of his. Next, they veered back onto I-10 <br/>&gt; 
  and continued west to Columbus where they stopped at a regional <br/>LCRA 
  <br/>&gt; park to feed the kitties. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We chased the bus as it 
  turned northwest on Hwy 71, but lost it <br/>when <br/>&gt; we stopped in 
  Ellinger for some to-die-for kolaches at Hruska's <br/>Store <br/>&gt; &amp; 
  Bakery, then swung into Rosemary's Vineyard (MeMa's first name is <br/>&gt; 
  Rosemary and thought it would be cool to take home a bottle of <br/>Merlot 
  <br/>&gt; with "her" label). <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We thought we'd lost them for 
  good, but as we neared LaGrange, we <br/>&gt; heard the unmistakable sounds of 
  a home-grown Texas band <br/>&gt; (Uh...huh..huh.<wbr>.huh) and caught a glimps 
  of the passengers downing <br/>&gt; some brewskies. Before we could even park 
  the car, the were off <br/>&gt; again! I thought they made a wrong turn when 
  they stopped at <br/>another <br/>&gt; LCRA park just outside LaGrange to 
  whistle at some scantily dressed <br/>&gt; ladies, but they only tossed 
  something out the window and made <br/>their <br/>&gt; way back onto Hwy 
  71.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We didn't know where in the heck that bus driver was 
  headed! About <br/>&gt; 35 miles southeast of Austin, they stopped at Kendra 
  Macon's <br/>&gt; Roadhouse for some of the best burgers in the county. Between 
  bites <br/>&gt; of a HUGE bacon cheeseburger, Willie mumbled something about 
  <br/>Houston <br/>&gt; Toads. I think that boy's been smokin' some funny stuff! 
  After our <br/>&gt; long chase we were hungry too, so we rested for a spell on 
  the <br/>patio <br/>&gt; and enjoyed our grub.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Next thing we 
  knew, those crazy passengers ran out and jumped back <br/>&gt; onto the bus, 
  zipping across the road into a park, and leaving me <br/>&gt; stuck with their 
  tab! After settling up with Kendra, we tried to <br/>&gt; follow their path of 
  destruction. Seems they almost mowed down some <br/>&gt; guys in a golf cart 
  and ran through the entrance gate. The ranger <br/>&gt; was still shaking his 
  fist at them as we came through. The way I <br/>hear <br/>&gt; it, only two 
  wheels of that bus were touching the ground as they <br/>made <br/>&gt; a quick 
  left onto Park Road 1A. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As we made the corner, we saw some 
  kids on bicycles pointing up the <br/>&gt; road toward an overlook in the 
  northeast corner of the park. We <br/>&gt; followed - always keeping right on 
  Park Road 1A. We parked at the <br/>&gt; overlook, and although we enjoyed the 
  view, we didn't see that <br/>darned <br/>&gt; bus anywhere! <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  As we returned to our car, SoccerChik noticed a sign across the <br/>road 
  <br/>&gt; indicating that this park was the largest remaining habitat of the 
  <br/>&gt; Houston Toad. Maybe Willie was onto to something after all. And 
  <br/>&gt; guess what?!! There were tire tracks heading east past the sign, 
  <br/>and <br/>&gt; down the trail. We hurried down the trail ourselves, and soon 
  came <br/>&gt; to a trail post declaring no fires or bikes allowed... it didn't 
  <br/>&gt; forbid buses, which is good, cause those tire tracks were still 
  <br/>going <br/>&gt; east on the trail, down a hill. We continued for another 58 
  steps, <br/>&gt; passing two reflective trail markers nailed to trees. We were 
  <br/>nearly <br/>&gt; at the bottom of the hill and saw another of those 
  reflective trail <br/>&gt; markers nailed to a tall pine tree on the left. We 
  stopped there to <br/>&gt; catch our breath for a second. That's when we 
  noticed the tire <br/>tracks <br/>&gt; veered left into the forest. They seemed 
  headed straight toward a <br/>&gt; pair of pine trees about 15 steps from the 
  trail, but the tracks <br/>&gt; disappeared at the pine on the right, under the 
  boughs of a large <br/>&gt; fallen pine tree that rested against it.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; I fear that crazy TTB2 has gotten lost in the loblolly pines! We 
  <br/>&gt; were exhausted and decided that someone else would have to rescue 
  <br/>the <br/>&gt; passengers from their folly. We returned to our car and 
  headed home <br/>&gt; to Houston.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Hope ya'll had a festive New 
  Year's too!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; SandiBox<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>
