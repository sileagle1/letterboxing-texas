Houston on Saturday Oct. 29th from 3-5pm. There will be new Halloween  <br>
themed stamps planted in the park as well as some boxes out on the  <br>
table. Also an event stamp carved by Gramatrick.<br>
<br>
We are not allowed to reserve the park, so we'll try to get a table  <br>
as soon as we get there. Hopefully, there won't be a bunch of other  <br>
people.<br>
<br>
If you like, you can sign up for this event on Atlas Quest. If you'd  <br>
like to create a stamp, please let me know what you will be doing so  <br>
we don't have duplicates. All boxes should be planted prior to the  <br>
event so everyone can bring the clues with them, unless you plan on  <br>
bringing copies of your clue for everyone that day.<br>
<br>
I will be bringing 3 traveling event boxes:<br>
-The Munsters Traveling Event Box - with all 6 of the characters  -  <br>
carved by She Who Plants of Tennessee<br>
-my own Tribute to England Event box - with 3 stamps<br>
-Under the Sea - a collection of 10+ sea creatures created by  <br>
numerous people - this started out as a PLB (postal letterbox), but  <br>
will now be an event box<br>
<br>
Also, upon request only, ask me to see the 'TeamKing Pumpkin'. I'll  <br>
be carrying this one around so you'll have to ask to get it!<br>
<br>
Hope to see you there!<br>
