                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mr. Thomas Lea and Bobby Hill have gotten on the bus and have <br>
travelled to Lake Tawakoni State Park.  <br>
<br>
Make your way to Wills Point, which is in Van Zandt County.  At the <br>
intersection of US 80 and FM 45, follow 47 across the RR tracks and <br>
through downtown.  You should see signs to Lake Tawakoni SP.  You <br>
will eventually turn left onto FM 2475 North and it will take you <br>
into the park.  <br>
<br>
As you enter the park, follow the signs to the boat ramp/swimming <br>
area.  After you pass the rest rooms on your left, pull into the <br>
first parking lot on the right.  <br>
<br>
Look for the NATURE TRAIL sign a few yards on the other side of the <br>
WHEEL CHAIR ACCESSIBLE parking spaces.  <br>
<br>
To the Bus: <br>
<br>
At the NATURE TRAIL sign, follow the trail to the right.  <br>
<br>
As you follow the trail through the woods, you will come to a large <br>
clearing/group camping area.  Go through the clearing.  The trail <br>
will split. Follow the trail to the right.  <br>
<br>
Taking this trail, you will come to an intersection.  From here, go <br>
LEFT  for 70 steps.  Look to your right.  There is a tree that splits <br>
about 4.5-5 feet up.  (Some of the tree's branches come all the way <br>
out to the trail.)  The tree is about 16 steps off the trail.  The <br>
bus is parked behind this tree. <br>

my disbelief only 2 minutes prior I see this message posted.  <br>
Everything changed.  I started yelling at the kids - "The bus, The <br>
bus, get in the car".  I call Frogkisses and yell at her to get in <br>
the car Now!  I sent a text to TxTatas.  She calls back and can't <br>
go.  I rush out the house swing by and pick up my son from a friend's <br>
house (his dad now know's I crazy), stop to put gas in the car and we <br>
are on the road.  The devil on my left shoulder is saying drive <br>
faster and the angel on the right is saying it's not worth a ticket.  <br>
The devil won but the angel kept it reasonable.<br>
  <br>
We arrived to find Frogkisses waiting outside her car.  We take off <br>
down the trail and hurdled mud puddles in the trail.  It was still <br>
there! Yeah!  The hoodlums on the bus are and sound with us for just <br>
a little while.  We may let them hunt for eggs tomorrow as long as <br>
they can play nicely with Tadpole.<br>
