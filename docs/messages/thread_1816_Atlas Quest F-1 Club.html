Texas letterboxers about.<br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, when you listed a clue on AQ, a box started popping<br/>
up that would ask you if you wanted to hide this clue from search<br/>
engines (like Google).  I checked yes, because I don't want my<br/>
letterbox clues accidentally popping up when a non-letterboxer is<br/>
searching for info on the Arboretum, for example.  Last week, all of<br/>
those clues with the box checked were converted to F1 clues, because<br/>
that is a more secure way of ensuring that the clues are protected<br/>
from the search engines.  <br/>
<br/>
So, what do you think?  These are meant to be clues accessible to<br/>
everyone who's interested (aka letterboxers), and I don't really want<br/>
barriers to accessing the clues.  But, on the other hand, logging one<br/>
find on Atlas Quest in order to see the clues doesn't seem that onerous.  <br/>
<br/>
As you're the finders, I throw it out to you.  Are you uncomfortable<br/>
with the F1 requirement?  Your thoughts are appreciated.<br/>

<div>I agree - I love AQ for that, how easy it is to log boxes and notify the 
placers, and I love that I can list nearby boxes - I just wish more boxes were 
listed on <strong>both</strong> LBNA and AQ.  I usually log first on AQ and 
notify the placers, and then go back and repeat the process on LBNA.  --

all the way to Tombstone and beyond.  NO SIGN!  We missed it 
somewhere.  Must have removed it for the construction.  
DISAPPOINTMENT!  But we go to the shows in Tucson a lot, so we would 
return.  80 swings south thru Bisbee and Douglas, then back north to Rodeo 
NM and on to I-10 near Lordsburg.  And there was still the BISBEE 
BOX.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="990153901-19042006">Bisbee AZ is a lovely little town.  When the copper 
mine closed, the city almost closed with it.  But they turned it into a 
museum instead, and they now live off of tourism.  When you come to Bisbee 
from the south, you must go through a tunnel at Mule Mountain.  When you 
exit the tunnel, you are back in the 50s.  We did the letterbox in 
Bisbee.  The dogs drew a huge crowd, so Moni kept everyone's attention on 
the dogs while I slipped in and got the letterbox.  We stamped up, nobody 
ever asked what we were doing.  Then I replaced it - again unseen as the 
dogs got all the attention.  You see, when people see a Great Dane, 
everybody runs.  Some run to you, and some run away!  
&lt;grin&gt;.  And we had 3 dogs in the van that day.</span></div>

<div>Good distraction technique. I don't think it would work with my dog though (95 pound lab). He thinks the best way to protect me or anything I have is to lay on it. It would be pretty hard for me to stamp into the logbook with him on top of it (and me).</div>
