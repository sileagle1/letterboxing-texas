was nuts! Jumped the curb at the basketball courts -Some poor lady dove <br>
into a bathroom stall from fear! You should have SEEN her face! It took <br>
out the nets at the tennis courts...just kept on going with 'em stuck <br>
on the windshield! (I think the driver turned on the wipers -to no <br>
avail!) At any rate... I saw him swerve left at the first nature trail, <br>
skidding on loose gravel... almost took out the second nature trail <br>
sign with the map! It banked a sharp right after side swiping the green <br>
post on a bearing of 320 degrees, ricocheted off the evergreen and <br>
landed with a screetch behind a short tree bearing 30 degrees. Out the <br>
rear window I saw Janis flash the peace sign and smile cheerfully, so <br>
I'm sure all is well. A little shaken but not stirred! They're gonna <br>
have a frightful time pulling that poor bus out of the thorns around <br>
there! I'm glad no one was hurt. -Didn't get his plates but I did <br>
notice they were from Houston... boy, I've heard about those Houston <br>
drivers... but I NEVER would've believed it if it weren't for this! ;-)<br>
