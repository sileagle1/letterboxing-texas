heh heh - after retiring from the Army - my lifestyle went from active to 
civilian.  My workout dropped from an Airborne standard to a point where I 
was only running 6 miles in 50 minutes.  My weight shot up from 200 to 270 
pounds.  Can you imagine running 6 miles in 50 minutes weighing 270?  
But I could do it.  My BP was 145/100.  I was still training ROTC 
cadets.  Even in that condition I could put a hurt on most kids.  The 
doctor said I had to quit running or I would be looking at knee 
replacement.  My wife decided something needed to be 
done.</span></div>

(wife/kids) bought me a GPS unit.  I started hiking.  I mean - REAL 
hiking.  3000 ft elevation gain, 10 miles at a time.  We bought 
bicycles.  Some diet changes too.</span></div>
<div><span class="801082211-23012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="801082211-23012007">Today I have two bicycles and 4 GPS units.  This morning my weight 
is 212.  Not where I want to be, but every pound is a struggle - and a 
victory.  It is tough!</span></div>

<div><span class="801082211-23012007">I 
still train ROTC cadets.  And I still put a hurt on them.  May 1st 
will start my 12th year of Army retirement.  I would give up this wonderful 
job I have and go back in the army if they would take me.  They will 
not.  But I think I could still put a hurt on the young 
troopers.</span></div>

<br/>
&gt; Thank you. They say that first quote a lot at Weight Watchers.<br/>
<br/>
Hmmmm - weight watchers - haven't gotten that desperate yet....  still <br/>
going on my own.  I am 214 this morning.  It is a long way from the 270 <br/>
I was, but it seems a longer way to the &lt;200 I want.  I rode my bike 8 <br/>
miles in 30 minutes yesterday... I know it was a good workout because I <br/>
had cramps last night.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I just finished watching World Trade Center. Have you seen it? <br/>
<br/>
No.  I don't watch TV much.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Do you have time to watch movies? <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes.  I make an effort to sit with the wife now and then and just <br/>
watch TV.  But there is always more to do.  Last night my son's <br/>
girlfriend/future wife dropped in.  She is traveling from Ft. Hood <br/>
where she was with him to the Air Force academy where she is a nurse.  <br/>
So by the time we fed her and got her settled in the guest house and I <br/>
got everything done I needed to do it was midnight.  And I was up at 4 <br/>
to start work at 5.  Never enough hours in a day.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; The former Marine made me think of you. <br/>
<br/>
A lot of my friends tell me that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I thought they did a good job of the movie. Brought back a <br/>
&gt; lot of painful memories of that day though.<br/>
<br/>
Painful memories.  Want to see me bawl like a baby?  Sit down with me <br/>
and watch Black Hawk Down.  They were my friends.  Mike Durant wrote a <br/>
book... In the Company of Heros.  I have a personally autographed copy <br/>
on my shelf.  I have not read it.  Not sure I can.  He lives because of <br/>
Sgts Gordon and Shurgart, two heros who died defending Mike until they <br/>
were killed.  Needless deaths except for Klinton - wouldn't give them <br/>
the equipment needed to complete the mission he gave them.  It took the <br/>
Pakistani military (with the right equipment) to save them.<br/>
<br/>
Why wasn't I there?  I was tied up on a counter-narcotics mission to <br/>
the south.  Curse that mission, I should have been with the others.  I <br/>
might have made a difference.<br/>
<br/>
That is the difference between me and normal people I guess.  No, I <br/>
don't consider myself normal.  Normal people looked at flt 93 and said <br/>
to themselves "I am so glad I wasn't on that plane".  I think to myself <br/>
I wish I had been on that plane.  I could have made a difference.  What <br/>
could they have done to me with a box cutter?  A little pain, a little <br/>
blood.... but a determined attack would prevail.  It had to, or die.<br/>
<br/>
Ah-well - see.... you got me started.  Some days I regret retiring.  <br/>
Should have stuck it out.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  Have a good day,<br/>
<br/>
Are you kidding.  First they give me a power plant to play with.  Then <br/>
they pay me lots of $$$$ to play with it.  Then the send a bunch of <br/>
great people to play along with me.  And I don't have to leap out of <br/>
aircraft or get shot at anymore.  In the army overtime was expected and <br/>
not compensated for.  Double-time meant a run at 180 steps a minute.  <br/>
In this job, double-time means $60/ hr.  How could I possible have a <br/>
BAD day?<br/>
<br/>
You take care.<br/>
<br/>
Mike.<br/>
