                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, we have 3 more in the works... I don't know how long until we <br/>
can get them set, but hopefully by next weekend. Jim is the one with <br/>
the creative streak.. he likes making them intriguing.  We've had <br/>
lots of practice with geocaching on making neat containers, etc. <br/>
We had the same problem with #1, but I liked the location of <br/>
the "den" ...  I walk that trail frequently, and will keep an eye on <br/>
it.  Thanks for the comments...  we are always open to some <br/>
constructive criticism... that is how we learn!<br/>
<br/>
We've found most of the boxes in Georgetown, but there are still a <br/>
few more to get (Berry Springs Park, mostly).  Georgetown could use <br/>
more boxes, though.  That's ok... we can have fun planting more for <br/>
other folks to find.<br/>

&gt; Hi Moore9KSUcats!  And welcome to Letterboxing!  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   I have seen your name pretty regularly on the geocaching site.  <br/>
I've seen several of your caches that I thought looked <br/>
interesting...like the one having to do with "measurement".  Other <br/>
than those type of "themed" caches, the whole Geocaching thing just <br/>
didn't stick with me.  But...I'm really glad to see you begin <br/>
letterboxing!  YIPPEE!  Now we can look for great letterboxes by <br/>
someone who is so obviously creative and thoughtful.  :-)<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   My son and I went today and found both boxes.  We are so <br/>
impressed with your first carvings!  And what a beautiful park...I <br/>
live in Georgetown and never even knew that park was there!  We <br/>
especially liked the trail signs...like the one that points to GT <br/>
Country Club with the golf balls in the path!  LOL!  My son really <br/>
wanted to see if one of those balls would come out, but I was able to <br/>
convince him to leave them for the next person to find them.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Makin' Tracks #1 was very easy to find.  The only problem was <br/>
that we had a hard time wedging the rocks back...they wanted to keep <br/>
sliding down the hill.  I finally got them in place and wedged dirt <br/>
up under them and then covered the dirt area with leaves so it looked <br/>
more undisturbed.  Still, you may want to keep your eye on that one.  <br/>
Hopefully the rains won't dislodge it.<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Makin' Tracks #2 was a bit harder.  Still not too hard, but I <br/>
kept thinking it had to be in that big animal burrow.  Walked right <br/>
past the box several times before I thought...well, might as well <br/>
check here.  Voila!  Nice hiding spot.  ;-)<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   I like what you did to the containers.  Makes them very difficult <br/>
to spot.  I use camo tape, but it's probably much more labor <br/>
intensive than your method and your way works, too.  As I said...I <br/>
walked right past Makin' Tracks #2 SEVERAL times!  LOL!<br/>
