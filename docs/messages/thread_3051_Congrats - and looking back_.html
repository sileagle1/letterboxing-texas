Congrats to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear!!!  5 years - and you have done so<br/>
much for letterboxing in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
I just pulled out my first logbook and looked.....  Sad to say my first<br/>
letterbox was a Letterbox-Hybrid Geocache.  I have been a Geocacher longer<br/>
than Silver Eagle and Baby Bear have been a Letterboxing.  But still - it<br/>
was my first letterbox activity.  <br/>
<br/>
The really bad news is that it was what started me looking at Letterboxing.<br/>
And now all you good folks have to put up with my whining about no boxes in<br/>
El Paso.  <grin><br/>
<br/>
My second box was a Silver Eagle Letterbox.  I have come a long way since<br/>
then.  I pretty much only Geocache and Letterbox while we are on the road to<br/>
Dog shows and stuff, so my counts are not real high.  But - there isn't much<br/>
to pick from locally (whine whine).  Couple that with the fact that when we<br/>
are on the road we don't have time to make the big hikes, so we miss a few.<br/>
On top of that, my dog is not able to hike anymore.  Just getting too old.<br/>
He was along when I found the Silver Eagle box.  With 5 obedience titles, he<br/>
is the best dog I have ever owned.  I can't toss him aside for a new hiking<br/>
dog.  http://www.vonbonehenge.com/parker.html<br/>
<br/>
Today there are eight letterboxes in the El Paso area.  One from Silver<br/>
Eagle, one from Sandibox, one from Dane Lady (my lovely wife of 30 years) -<br/>
the other 5 are all mine.  I tried introducing a few folks to Letterboxing.<br/>
And I made most of my letterboxes Letterbox-Hybrids to try getting some<br/>
Geocachers interested.  So far, it has not worked.<br/>
<br/>
The high-point of my 2-years (on 18 Sept) Letterboxing is the day The<br/>
Grizzled Griffon blew through El Paso and snagged all my easy boxes.  I got<br/>
a big head thinking my boxes were worthy of his visit.  Then Dane Lady<br/>
explained that he was probably desperate for anything while driving through<br/>
to a real Letterboxing destination, and that was all there was.<br/>
Oh-well..... She is usually correct.<br/>
<br/>
Now the good news.  Yesterday was my birthday.  I took the day off from work<br/>
today.  The mission I was supposed to be on this weekend has been scrubbed.<br/>
We were to launch at 0800 this morning bound for a local mountaintop TV<br/>
station to replace a radio repeater for our small radio group.  My job was<br/>
to climb the 200 ft tower and pull a 1" dia cable to the top for the antenna<br/>
connector.  Yeah - I may be 52 now, but I can still put a hurt on young<br/>
soldiers!  <grin>.  Ask my son.  <br/>
<br/>
Access to the TV station is by hiking or an expensive tram ride.  We were<br/>
going to take the tram - then live up there till we were finished rather<br/>
than pay for multiple rides.  Two to maybe three days.  Last minute details<br/>
killed the trip.  NOT my fault!  So, the wife and I decided to do a few<br/>
things around the local area today.  Tomorrow we are going to Alamogordo NM<br/>
for a Hamfest - mostly to look at used radios etc.  SUNDAY - our mission is<br/>
to PLACE a Letterbox in Culberson County, and PLAN a letterbox for Hudspeth<br/>
County on the return trip.  So - with a little luck - and a lot of gas, one<br/>
more county colored in this weekend, and another to follow as soon as I can<br/>
design and order a stamp.  Thinking about Cornudas Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing has been fun.  You good folks on this list have enhanced the<br/>
fun.  Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
If I had one wish - it would be for Baby Bear to edit the name of his TOP of<br/>
TEXAS letterbox to add (missing) or something.  There have been a number of<br/>
times when I logged on, and saw it, and thought it was a new active box.<br/>
Yeah - if I looked more often I would remember it!  <grin><br/>
<br/>
Congrats Baby Bear and Silver Eagle.  Thanks for your efforts.<br/>

<div>I hear you Mike. My twelve year old lab can't hike with me anymore either (bad hips). It makes me so sad, because he used to be my happy companion on all my hikes. Like you, he's been too much a part of our family to bring in a new pup. Otis would never, I mean NEVER, win an obedience title, but he's the smartest dog I've ever had the privilege to know. He has an amazing understood vocabulary. Labs are great dogs.

  Strollers for dogs. It is kind of cool though, for dogs that like to go, but 
  have a hard time walking. Shoot, I may need a stroller soon myself, if I don't 
  suck it up and start getting stronger.</div>

<div>I hear you Mike. My twelve year old lab can't hike with me 
    anymore either (bad hips). It makes me so sad, because he used to be my 
    happy companion on all my hikes. Like you, he's been too much a part of our 
    family to bring in a new pup. Otis would never, I mean NEVER, win an 
    obedience title, but he's the smartest dog I've ever had the privilege to 
    know. He has an amazing understood vocabulary. Labs are great dogs.
