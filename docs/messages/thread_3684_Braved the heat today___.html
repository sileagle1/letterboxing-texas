&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Well, I just couldn't stand it one more day, just had to get out <br/>and go<br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxing! ! (This is just my second time to go <br/>letterboxing. ) So got<br/>&gt; &gt; up early and found 7 today!! Just about melted, (it was 95* at 10 <br/>
this<br/>&gt; &gt; morning) but had a great time! Got some great pictures, too!<br/>&gt; &gt; Found a box that had two logbooks, one stamp and a dog <br/>collar...???<br/>&gt; &gt; Didn't know what the collar was in there for, or why it had two<br/>
&gt; &gt; different logbooks, I'm new to all this...Someone *clue* me in on <br/>this<br/>&gt; &gt; please...!<br/>&gt; &gt; Suz<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/></div>

                    <html><body><div dir="ltr"><div>Well then - would you like another?  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We rescued two cats within a month of each other in May or so.  One was a gorgeous gray striped kitty about 6 months old who had ridden behind the headlight of a friend's truck for at least a day before he finally figured out where the funny noise was coming from.  She was horribly skittish - we didn't see her for two days after we got her in the house, and is still skittish of men although she's coming around to Fearless Fox.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shortly thereafter, Fearless Fox and I were walking late one night after it had rained and stopped to rest by a creek.  A baby baby - maybe 4 or 5 weeks old - ran across the street to us, soaking wet and muddy, crying unconsolably, and we took her home.  I bathed her and we took her to the vet.  She's a beautiful little calico - very striking features.  Lovable personality - too lovable.  She insists on sleeping in my face, which isn't cool.  She also has a hard time hitting the litter box and poops down the side of the box, which isn't cool either, and doesn't cover when she DOES hit it.  But then - she loves Trail Whale and that's a good thing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now the first cat has babies - two.  They are two weeks old.  The calico, who we have named Stinky (the litterbox thing), doesn't realize she isn't a co-mother to the babies, so she's making the mama cat a little nuts.  She keeps trying to move the babies, so the two cats get into rows over who has the authority to move them.  It's like a big custody battle in our house every day.  I'm afraid we're going to have a non-custodial catnapping any day now, and we're gonna have to hire a kitty defense lawyer, Racecat Haynes, because I don't see Stinky pleading guilty and doing time.  Right now, the mama cat has gone to have a bite to eat, so Stinky is trying to play with the babies, batting them around and they are yowling.<br/>
<br/>So you see - Stinky needs to go.  I love her to death - even tried to take her to the shelter one day but couldn't do it and brought her home.  But I'm a letterboxer, not a litterboxer, and I don't like the whole scooping thing.  The older cat would go outside - not Stinky.  She comes in to poop badly in the box.  She obviously wants to do good, but she can't quite master it.  Compound that with her propensity for making the older cat (tentatively named Delilah, which was the name we originally gave to Stinky, but it seemed more suitable to the very feminine mama cat instead of rough and tumble Stinky) a nervous wreck, so that we are soon going to have to get her a Rx for valium.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - if anyone wants sweet little Stinky, I would part with her to the right person.  Otherwise that collar is starting to look pretty good...</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Your kids dissect cats in bio class?!? Wow! Reminds me of my bio <br/>
class way-back-when. It was in a little school in Ecuador, and there <br/>
was no access to fancy, formaldihyded stuff. One day our bio teacher <br/>
caught a possom on the way to school, quickly changed the day's <br/>
lesson plan, and we were cutting that baby up before you could say <br/>
scalpel. It was a full grown male. With full intestines. Then Bobby, <br/>
(I think he went on to become a surgeon) nicked the bowel. Full <br/>
bowel, I might add. Yikes! And BL thinks Stinky is a problem.... <br/>
Happy back to school, JB!<br/>
