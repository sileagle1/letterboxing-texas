I am learning about AQ and will try to post them there as well. It <br/>
sure was fun visit my home state and leaving some little gifts for <br/>
all ya'll down there. The stamps aren't the best. I was a long way <br/>
away from my good carving tools. But the locations are important to <br/>
us. The Gerault Park box is planted on what was once my family's <br/>
farm, so it sure was fun putting it there. We (myself and the other <br/>
members of the extended Gerault Family who I have turned on to <br/>
boxing), "Its our park and we'll box if we want too!", Have fun and <br/>
take care of that state for me. I sure miss it some time. <br/>
