remember to check the list of local letterboxes before we head out for <br/>

realizing there are several letterboxes hidden there!  <br/>

I'm looking forward to getting more into this cool new hobby and to <br/>
making our first boxes to hide!<br/>

<div>Welcome to the Texas Letterboxing group Rayven! It's wonderful having a new boxing family in the DFW area! I live in the mid-cities area and have been boxing for about two years. There are quite a few boxes in this area which can keep you busy hunting for awhile, but we will all be looking forward to your boxes!</div>
<div>My trail name is pretty appropriate for our weather today, but it actually refers to my enjoyment of hiking in the woods, driving my Jeep down country roads, and canoeing.</div>
<div>Welcome,</div>

<div>Hey, Rayven!  </div>
<div>Welcome to Texas Letterboxing, especially the Fort Worth area!  Only a 
little over a year ago when I first discovered letterboxing, there were just a 
few boxes (and letterboxers) near here, but now, there are lots of really good 
ones, good stamps, good locations.  I hope you'll enjoy them all and I 
especially hope you'll enjoy finding all of mine!  But please please please 
be sure to exercise stealth when finding them so they aren't accidentally 
discovered, please please please reseal all the bags and boxes tightly so the 
rain doesn't destroy the logbooks, and please please please pretty-please always 
recover them well, so they aren't destroyed!  It's a sad thing to carve a 
stamp, make a logbook, create a letterbox in a great location, and then have it 
disappear.  Only today I discovered another one of my boxes sitting right 
out in the open clearly visible to anyone playing on the creekbank nearby (which 
kids frequently do!), and I'm trying to believe that our rains last night just 
washed away the covering bark and stuff.  But, having said all that, have a 
great time finding all the wonderful local boxes!  </div>
