                    <div class="plaintext-content">The morning dawned with a chill in the air, not unpleasant, a portent of things to come.  I stopped in an Humble place and was joined by Wills World and his boxer convert Lucky 13, who had yet to ink a stamp or log a find, but who was looking forward to the experience.  We drove to the island, arriving early enough to find and log a box or two.  Lucky 13 was now officially a letterboxer.

Of the eleven letterboxes, six were confirmed as missing in action and five were found to be available and in good condition.  The survivors are: Bishop's Palace by Bell Motel, Brown Bomber2 by Silver Eagle, Lightning Whelk: A Texas Symbol by WebWalkers, and, surprisingly enough, Felix and Hiding from Putty Tat, both by Birds of a Feather.  A few new boxes were also placed in conjunction with the event: Bettie's Key by Mosaic Butterfly, Isaac's Storm, the Storm of the Century by JMare, Don't be a Barnacle Head! , by Dawn's Glory, Keep a Light On For Me by Dawn's Glory and/or Dreamwalker, Treats Only Please by Lucy Locket, Prince John by Boots Tex and a six-box series by Lone Star Quilter, By the Bay: Quilt Block Series.  Unfortunately, the 5th box in the series, called Tall Ship, has already gone missing (see above), so you will have to settle for a five block quilt until it can be replaced.  So, if you haven't been to Galveston for a while, you have many new reasons to go! All in all, it was a great day with beautiful weather and beautiful letterboxing friends and what could be better?  Wills World, Lucky 13 and I shared a delicious evening meal with Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket, a perfect finish to the day.  Thank you all for making Eat Play Letterbox a memorable event.  I'll be posting a few photos this morning, so check them out.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">The morning dawned with a chill in the air, not
unpleasant, a portent of things to come. I stopped in an Humble place and was
joined by Wills World and his boxer convert Lucky 13, who had yet to ink a
stamp or log a find, but who was looking forward to the experience. We drove to
the island, arriving early enough to find and log a box or two. Lucky 13 was
now officially a letterboxer. We were the first ones to beautiful Kempner Park
(if you don't count the rowdy and curious dogs who greeted us with enthusiasm,
their owners more intent on social interaction than on minding their pets).
Just as I was hanging the Cool Ghoul in the live oak tree, with acorns raining
down, courtesy of a gang of greedy grackles gamboling above, I spotted Open Space,
a lovely family of three and we introduced ourselves. We talked while young
Alex filled his pockets with acorns, then was joined by Dad in a search for a
(shiver!) geocache that was somewhere in the park. Dawn's Glory and Dreamwalker
arrived and headed immediately to a bush where I knew a By the Bay letterbox to
be hiding. Coincidentally, and tragically, the hiding place of the box and the
geocache were one and the same and the box, unfortunately, was not to be found,
taken, I presume, by a misguided geocacher. Others began to show up: NLW, Lore
and JMarie (aka the Hippie Camper), Mosaic Butterfly and Corazon, then Blue
Butterfly and Lucy Locket. Megan (the Megster?) joined us later. The only one
who didn't make it was SandiBox. We missed you, SandiBox! We spent a couple of
hours doing exchanges and stamping in a few HIPS boxes, then had a quick picnic
lunch. Thanks to all of you for contributing to the food table. There was too
much food, in fact, and we had to force a few folks to finish off the brownies.
Then, it was down to business. After a few boxes known to be lost or retired
had been eliminated (thanks Barefoot Lucy), there were eleven boxes of unkown
status to be checked out, so, clues in hand, we scattered to check them out and
check them off. We all met back at the park (a few more brownies to finish off)
to compare notes. Of the eleven letterboxes, six were confirmed as missing in
action and five were found to be available and in good condition. The survivors
are: Bishop's Palace by Bell Motel, Brown Bomber2 by Silver Eagle, Lightning
Whelk: A Texas Symbol by WebWalkers, and, surprisingly enough, Felix and Hiding
from Putty Tat, both by Birds of a Feather. A few new boxes were also placed in
conjunction with the event: Bettie's Key by Mosaic Butterfly, Isaac's Storm,
the Storm of the Century by JMare, Don't be a Barnacle Head! , by Dawn's Glory,
Keep a Light On For Me by Dawn's Glory and/or Dreamwalker, Treats Only Please
by Lucy Locket, Prince John by Boots Tex and a six-box series by Lone Star Quilter,
By the Bay: Quilt Block Series. Unfortunately, the 5th box in the series,
called Tall Ship, has already gone missing (see above), so you will have to
settle for a five block quilt until it can be replaced. So, if you haven't been
to Galveston for a while, you have many new reasons to go! All in all, it was a
great day with beautiful weather and beautiful letterboxing friends and what
could be better? Wills World, Lucky 13 and I shared a delicious evening meal
with Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket, a perfect finish to the day. Thank you all
for making Eat Play Letterbox a memorable event. I'll be posting a few photos
this morning, so check them out.<br/>

> The morning dawned with a chill in the air, not unpleasant, a portent of things to come.  I stopped in an Humble place and was joined by Wills World and his boxer convert Lucky 13, who had yet to ink a stamp or log a find, but who was looking forward to the experience.  We drove to the island, arriving early enough to find and log a box or two.  Lucky 13 was now officially a letterboxer.  We were the first ones to beautiful Kempner Park (if you don't count the rowdy and curious dogs who greeted us with enthusiasm, their owners more intent on social interaction than on minding their pets).  Just as I was hanging the Cool Ghoul in the live oak tree, with acorns raining down, courtesy of a gang of greedy grackles gamboling above, I spotted Open Space, a lovely family of three and we introduced ourselves.  We talked while young Alex filled his pockets with acorns, then was joined by Dad in a search for a (shiver!) geocache that was somewhere in the park.  Dawn's Glory and Dreamwalker arrived and headed immediately to a bush where I knew a By the Bay letterbox to be hiding.  Coincidentally, and tragically, the hiding place of the box and the geocache were one and the same and the box, unfortunately, was not to be found, taken, I presume, by a misguided geocacher.  Others began to show up: NLW, Lore and JMarie (aka the Hippie Camper), Mosaic Butterfly and Corazon, then Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket.  Megan (the Megster?) joined us later. The only one who didn't make it was SandiBox.  We missed you, SandiBox!  We spent a couple of hours doing exchanges and stamping in a few HIPS boxes, then had a quick picnic lunch.  Thanks to all of you for contributing to the food table.  There was too much food, in fact, and we had to force a few folks to finish off the brownies.  Then, it was down to business.  After a few boxes known to be lost or retired had been eliminated (thanks Barefoot Lucy), there were eleven boxes of unkown status to be checked out, so, clues in hand, we scattered to check them out and check them off.  We all met back at the park (a few more brownies to finish off) to compare notes.  Of the eleven letterboxes, six were confirmed as missing in action and five were found to be available and in good condition.  The survivors are: Bishop's Palace by Bell Motel, Brown Bomber2 by Silver Eagle, Lightning Whelk: A Texas Symbol by WebWalkers, and, surprisingly enough, Felix and Hiding from Putty Tat, both by Birds of a Feather.  A few new boxes were also placed in conjunction with the event: Bettie's Key by Mosaic Butterfly, Isaac's Storm, the Storm of the Century by JMare, Don't be a Barnacle Head! , by Dawn's Glory, Keep a Light On For Me by Dawn's Glory and/or Dreamwalker, Treats Only Please by Lucy Locket, Prince John by Boots Tex and a six-box series by Lone Star Quilter, By the Bay: Quilt Block Series.  Unfortunately, the 5th box in the series, called Tall Ship, has already gone missing (see above), so you will have to settle for a five block quilt until it can be replaced.  So, if you haven't been to Galveston for a while, you have many new reasons to go! All in all, it was a great day with beautiful weather and beautiful letterboxing friends and what could be better?  Wills World, Lucky 13 and I shared a delicious evening meal with Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket, a perfect finish to the day.  Thank you all for making Eat Play Letterbox a memorable event.
