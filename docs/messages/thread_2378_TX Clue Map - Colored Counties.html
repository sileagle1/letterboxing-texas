                    <div class="plaintext-content">Not sure if anyone else noticed that the TX Clue Map on LBNA now has <br>
individual counties with letterboxes colored in.  I noticed at least <br>
one county that was not colored that should have been, so asked Choi <br>
about it.  He said The Eidolon is updating them manually on occasion, <br>
so if anyone finds any other counties that should be colored (or <br>
colored ones that should not be), let me know and I will forward to <br>
Choi.  I guess one of our long-term goals could be to color the entire <br>
state!  Thanks.<br>
