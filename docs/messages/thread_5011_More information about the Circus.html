<br/>
I was at first inclined to deny their request because I think it is generally bad form to give in in any way to someone who chooses to use intimidation to make themselves known, but I decided I have no right to make that decision since the Circus doesn't belong to me, and since the group should have some say in how this goes.<br/>
<br/>
I have approved the membership of this jackal "person", but I would suggest that if they choose to be heard on the list, that we not allow ourselves to be taken in by them.  In other words, I think healthy skepticism should be our watchword.<br/>
<br/>
I hope I don't regret the decision to allow them onto the group.  Let me also say that I made this decision completely on my own, and if allowing this member onto the list comes to trouble, I take the entire blame on my own shoulders and BootsTex and Silver Eagle had nothing to do with this decision.<br/>
