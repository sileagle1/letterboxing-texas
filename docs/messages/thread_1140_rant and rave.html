<div>I know how you feel Ruby, but at least yur box was 
still there.  I had 2 letters this week that people found the lid of our 
Sponge Bob box, but nothing else.  It is very frustrating to take the time 
to do all that goes into making a box only to have it come up missing a short 
time later.  It seems we are the placers of doomed boxes, and I know when 
we first started we didn't choose the best hiding spaces, but after losing a few 
boxes I have been much more selective in choosing hiding spots.  I was 
amazed when in Michigan I found boxes that had outlasted 3 Michigan winters 
(no small feat in a place where snowfall is measured in feet, not inches) with 
the original logbooks still intact.  As I told Teamking once, I never trust 
my kids to put boxes back, I live with them and I know how they put stuff 
away.  I hope you will re hide the boxes you pulled.  Maybe some of 
you have some tips to share on how to hide a box so that it stays put, if so I 
would love to hear them.  I think that as this hobby grows in Texas we all 
need to be a little more careful about how we do things.  -Mother of

                    <html><body>I'm not sure there is any rhyme or reason. . .initially I would say that boxes that are more remote or have a clue or anything to make them more difficult have a better chance of surviving. But on the other hand, I have seen some very easy public boxes last where you wouldn't think they would! So, who knows? Maybe it's just the luck of the draw on WHO goes to your box and WHEN. . .<div><br/></div><div>TeamKing<div><br/></div><div><br/><div><div>On Jul 30, 2005, at 9:53 PM, the carrascos wrote:</div><br/><blockquote type="cite"><span class="Apple-style-span"><div><span class="Apple-style-span">I know how you feel Ruby, but at least yur box was still there.
