close friend. We did everything together and 7 months after we left <br>
high school a drunk driver hit her coming home from church one Sunday <br>
morning. Killed her on the spot. It has been 19 years since she died <br>
and there has never been a week go by for the 19 years that I do not <br>
think of her and wonder what she would have been or grew up to be. <br>
This has inspired me to make a series of boxes in her memory in this <br>
coming new year. I hope to inspire someone to relive a fond memory of <br>
somebody they love just as JB did for me. Keep a eye out for the new <br>
boxes.<br>
