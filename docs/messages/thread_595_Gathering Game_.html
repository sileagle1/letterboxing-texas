    From: The Doubtful Guests <thedoubtfulguests@yahoo.com><br>
Subject: Congratulations to the Winner of the 1st Lbxg Clue Exchange <br>
Game & gather<br>
<br>
Ace Detective Claire de Lune, young, diminutive, and smart, beat out <br>
all others to solve the Clue Exchange Game mystery.<br>
<br>
NEWS FLASH:  Miss Scarlet Did It in the Kitchen with the Knife!<br>
<br>
(Not to be confused with MizScarlet...)<br>
(See photo evidence in this Group's Photos section.)<br>
<br>
Claire collected all 20 clue stamps from all the other detective <br>
attendees and deduced from her list who, what, and where, was missing.  <br>
She remained undaunted by the surprise suspect, Cruella DeVille, and <br>
the uncommon weapon, poison.<br>
<br>
Claire wins a copy of the Clue board game, stamped inside with all of <br>
the day's Clues.  2nd and 3rd place, a Nymph? and Kreepy Kelli, <br>
received MasterCarve tools, or a sheet of the pink stuff.  (write me)<br>
<br>
Thanks to all who came.  Special thanks to all the carvers who came <br>
through despite the last minute requests:  Tempus Fugit, Sewsoobizzy, <br>
GirlGuides, Schizokeet, Hikers and Hounds, Cyclonic, Music Woman, <br>
Chrissy, Kreepy Kelli, and Chili Pepper.  The stamps were Reallly <br>
Great.<br>
<br>
Glad to see those from out of town who received a "you came so far" <br>
gift: hand warmer packs.<br>
<br>
The stamps are now available as a traveling event set for any event <br>
that would like to play Clue Exchange.  "Clue Exchange was great fun, <br>
especially because most of us already had each other's sig stamps," <br>
said GirlGuides.  I recommend inviting local people to sign up to carve <br>
stamps and using this set as fill in or for the favorites.  Write me <br>
off list about the rules and lessons learned.<br>
