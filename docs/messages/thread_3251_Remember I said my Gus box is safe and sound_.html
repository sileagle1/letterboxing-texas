<div> Oh, by the way... The Mouse in Gus's Pocket scared the heck out of us because of the obvious close proximity to the gator playground. We've just started letterboxing and that was only our sixth box. You talk about some seriously fast stamping!!!  I kept gator watch while my husband dug out the box and he kept gator watch while I stamped fast and furiously!! The girls were begging the whole time for us to please leave NOW but we wanted that mouse!! My husband and I each carried a child and kept our oldest between us and hot-footed it out of there with a quickness!!!  We thought that you had dropped your marbles in the beaver pond to have put a box there, but we were doing the high-five gator-survival dance when we got back to the van!!!  Thank you for the family memory you helped us to create.  Our kids tell everyone about letterboxing and your box is the first one they mention.

<div> </div>
<div>I think I misguided everyone with my message!  I was forwarding on a message I got on one of MY boxes - so it sounds like the finder and her family had a great time!  Thing is, they are brand new boxers, and oh so brave!  I love folks who can celebrate in the face of danger!  I had no idea when I planted that box that it would be quite as precarious to find - since I placed it in Spring, we have had the 100 year flood and now we are into winter when the water is probably even a little higher than it was when I planted the box.  I need to check that box again and maybe adjust the location a bit.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now as to Brazos Bend, my son Lightning and I have memories of that park!  We attended the second annual gathering at that park and there came a torrential storm while we were camping - that was fun in itself (yes, it really was, although it ran us out of our tent).  Before the storm, we went to the observatory there and to get to it you have to cross a bridge over a small pond with all the standard alligator warnings.  As we crossed the bridge in the dark, Lightning (then 8 years old) and I held hands and I felt him squeezing my hand harder and harder and getting closer and closer to me.  When we were about halfway over, I asked him if he was scared.  He said he was, and I told him I was too.  Once we got inside the place, the speaker was kindly doing a little filler entertainment by expounding alligator stories.  One story he told was about actually seeing an alligator grab a deer off the bank near the bridge.  I heard Lightning groan as my heart sank.  I wanted to say "Thanks lady - Thanks a lot.  Is there another exit to this place, or do we have to cross that bridge again?"

<div>Yes there are!  They're not only around the gulf coast, they're even 
way up here around the DFW area.  They've been spotted from time to time in 
the Trinity River, and around the Ft. Worth Nature Center at Lake Worth, there 
are Gator warning signs all along the lakeshore area.  Once when 
PuddleSplasher and I were out there letterboxing and hiking, we heard one of 
them roar, and that's a sound not soon forgotten!  </div>

&gt; sounds like you all had a blast!  We found Gator Guy yesterday at <br/>
Brazos Bend and even though the alligators were hiding, we were <br/>
wondering how in the world the planter got that close to the <br/>
alligators?  Because we've been to the park when the alligators were <br/>
in abundance near the spot!  <br/>
