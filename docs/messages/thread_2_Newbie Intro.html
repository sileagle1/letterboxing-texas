                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, my name is Susan Tashiro. I am very new to letterboxing.  I've <br/>
been reading about geocaching and chanced upon <br/>
www.letterboxing.org   I saw that there are quite a few letter boxes <br/>
in South Texas...and a bunch around where I live, in Beeville.  I <br/>
saw that one was here in Beeville, so I went out this morning and <br/>
found it...my very first.  I really wasn't prepared...didn't have a <br/>
rubber stamp or inkpad with me.  I'll have to go back and stamp it. <br/>
I can't wait to go check out those at Goliad and the other <br/>
surrounding places.  This is going to be so much fun!<br/>
<br/>
Are any of you close to me?  Wanda, I saw you name on the box here.  <br/>
Are you in Beeville?<br/>
<br/>
Since there are so few of us on here and it seems that you all <br/>
already know each other, would it be a problem for you all to <br/>
introduce yourself to me? <br/>
<br/>
I sure wish it wasn't so windy.  I'd go to Goliad right now.<br/>

Texas letterboxer since there are so few of us.  I have been<br/>
letterboxing for about 1 1/2 years and have been busy<br/>
placing boxes hoping for this hobby to catch on here in Texas.<br/>
There were less than 10 boxes in Texas when I started so we<br/>
have come a long way!  In fact, I think we are ready for<br/>
our first Event, so keep watching the main Talklist for<br/>
my announcement about it.  <br/>
