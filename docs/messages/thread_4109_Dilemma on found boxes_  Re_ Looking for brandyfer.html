  Sat. and found a lot of boxes that were in desperate need of 
  maintenance.<span>  </span>I replaced bags on every box that we found 
  needed them; thank goodness I had just put a new box of freezer bags in my 
  backpack just for letterboxing because I used all most all of them.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o><font face="Times New Roman"><font size="3">Two of our 
  "founds" had water in the boxes and the stamp mountings were coming apart and 
  molding.<span>  </span>One log book was so waterlogged I was near crying 
  at the loss of it for the planter.<span>  </span>The stamps themselves 
  were still in good shape so I cleaned them up and removed the wood backing and 
  wrapped them in a paper towels.<span>  </span>The log book that was 
  totally soaked I didn't know what to do... leave it to mold in the box or take 
  it home and try to save it for the planter.<span>  </span>So I thought 
  what would I want someone to do if they found one that I planted in the same 
  situation.<span>  </span>Well, I took it home and was able to save 15 
  pages of logs from the time it was planted until Jan. this year.<span>  
  </span>Some of the stamps are faint and some are still very good.<span>  
  </span>I noticed some names that I have seen on posts in the pages from 2007. 
  <span> I left some blank index cards in the box for a temporary 
  fix.</span></font></font></o></p>
