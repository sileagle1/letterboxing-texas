Sounds like a fun weekend in a fun park.  Be sure to let me<br/>
know the status of my Dinosaur Valley box in Dinosaur Valley SP.<br/>
As far as a recommended route, I would drive around the Brenham<br/>
area to see the wildflowers and if you have time, going to Lake <br/>
Somerville for the 2 letterboxes there.  Then head to Independence <br/>
for another letterbox and visit the Anique Rose Emporium.  Next, head <br/>
to Washington-On-Brazos SP for the 3 boxes there and more <br/>
bluebonnets.  Continue north on Hwy 6 to College Station for 2<br/>
boxes there, then Messina Hof winery in Bryan for letterbox and<br/>
good wine tasting.  Continue on Hwy 6 to Waco for several boxes<br/>
and enjoy the Texas Ranger Museum and/or the Suspension Bridge.<br/>
You could then head to Lake Whitney SP to find the box there<br/>
before arriving at Glen Rose.<br/>
On the way back to Houston, you could head east to Confederate<br/>
Reunion Grounds SP and Fort Parker SP for the boxes there.  Then<br/>
south on I45 to Huntsville, where you can visit Sam Houston's<br/>
house and statue, plus 2 letterboxes.  Finally back to Houston,<br/>
exhausted.  Have fun!<br/>
