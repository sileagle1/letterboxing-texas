                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have never in my (very long) life seen as many mosquitoes as I saw in<br>
while signing into a letterbox in Galveston! My Houston buddies had warned<br>
me about the sudden surge in the mosquito population, but I had no idea.<br>
Please picture the three of us (LSS, oldest son & I) blissfully walking<br>
along birding trail, pointing at various flora and fauna. Exactly at the<br>
moment we locate the box and retrieve it to stamp in, hordes of these tiny<br>
monsters attack. <br>
Oldest son (who is normally a very stoic individual) takes off sprinting<br>
back to car, loudly spitting out mouthsful of mosquitoes as he runs.<br>
I am squatting on path, trying to stamp in carefully, while LSS takes his<br>
hat and starts swatting me very vigorously, yelling "There are thousands of<br>
them on you!" (Yes - YOU try stamping in with a madman hitting you!)<br>
As fast as I can, I write quick note (not bothering to change from colored<br>
marker to pen) and begin re-sealing baggies. (Have you ever tried sealing a<br>
baggie while choking on bugs and avoiding your over-zealous bug-swatting<br>
spouse?)<br>
The box had been left exposed, sitting near trail, so we had to dig out<br>
clues again & try to find correct spot as intended by placer...by this time<br>
my light blue shirt looked like CSI prop - covered in tiny blood splatters<br>
from swatted mosquitoes. <br>
Quickly hid the box - looked at it from trail (while wildly waving our arms<br>
around our heads and kicking out with our legs) to make sure we couldn't see<br>
it & took off running. <br>
<br>
I think we're going to wait until December to find the other boxes in that<br>
area...<br>

Husband takes a look and says 'you better get this one on your own!' Boo. Okay, well, we're here. I'll go for it. I hopped out and spent at least a minute spraying myself down head to toe with spray before even entering the trail. Then I tore off down the trail to try to escape the swarm. No luck. Another swarm picked up my scent and attacked. How bad did I want this box? Should I turn back? No. I was here. I better get it. I found the box quickly and stamped as fast as I could. No point trying to protect myself. Too many. Just hurry! I finally finished and raced back to the car. Only. . .the car was gone! Ahhh!! Stuck out here with the swarms all over me. Then I see our car coming down the road. Whew! Husband picks me up and we race off.' 'I had to get away from that swarm!" he said. "I had to kill dozens of them in the car and I didn't want them in again!'' (reminds of that scene in Aliens when Ripley gets to the platform and the ship is gone) That was last year. When I went back this year, I thought, it can't STILL be that bad. . .but it was exactly the same.

<div>When my son was younger, and so therefore, was I, lol, we went camping every other weekend in the fall and spring. We tried to go to a different state park each time. Once, we went to Beaumont. When we got there, we went into the campers' restrooms. I took him in with me as he was so young. I thought it was strange when we walked in that the walls were black. Well, they were black because they were completely covered with mosquitos! Within seconds, we were completely covered with them - bodies, hair, faces, in our noses, it was awful. After we escaped, we drove back home- after stopping at the first gas station to clean up! "Beaumont" became our word for a yucky place for quite a while, as in "That place is beaumont!"</div>

<div> </div><tt>I have never in my (very long) life seen as many mosquitoes as I saw in<br/>while signing into a letterbox in Galveston! My Houston buddies had warned<br/>me about the sudden surge in the mosquito population, but I had no idea.<br/>Please picture the three of us (LSS, oldest son &amp; I) blissfully walking<br/>along birding trail, pointing at various flora and fauna. Exactly at the<br/>moment we locate the box and retrieve it to stamp in, hordes of these tiny<br/>monsters attack. <br/>Oldest son (who is normally a very stoic individual) takes off sprinting<br/>back to car, loudly spitting out mouthsful of mosquitoes as he runs.<br/>I am squatting on path, trying to stamp in carefully, while LSS takes his<br/>hat and starts swatting me very vigorously, yelling "There are thousands of<br/>them on you!" (Yes - YOU try stamping in with a madman hitting you!)<br/>As fast as I can, I write quick note (not bothering to change from colored<br/>marker to pen) and begin re-sealing baggies. (Have you ever tried sealing a<br/>baggie while choking on bugs and avoiding your over-zealous bug-swatting<br/>spouse?)<br/>The box had been left exposed, sitting near trail, so we had to dig out<br/>clues again &amp; try to find correct spot as intended by placer...by this time<br/>my light blue shirt looked like CSI prop - covered in tiny blood splatters<br/>from swatted mosquitoes. <br/>Quickly hid the box - looked at it from trail (while wildly waving our arms<br/>around our heads and kicking out with our legs) to make sure we couldn't see<br/>it &amp; took off running. <br/><br/>I think we're going to wait until December to find the other boxes in that<br/>area...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></tt>
