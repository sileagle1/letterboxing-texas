                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everybody, <br/>
Despite the soggy conditions, I hauled my cousin, (who is visiting <br/>
from WV)around Sat and Sun looking for letterboxes. I carved him a <br/>
stamp, made him a logbook and told him that he was now a <br/>
letterboxer! Well, my tactics seem to have worked, cause he had a <br/>
blast and was eager to keep going even when we were still at Bastrop <br/>
Park at 7pm on Sunday night--still a good 3 hours from home! <br/>
We were expecting rain so we were not surprised to find it pouring <br/>
when we arrived at Lake Whitney SP at 9:15pm on Saturday. We went to <br/>
the camp site and decided we were better off sleeping in the <br/>
vehicle. It was really pouring and the lightening show was <br/>
fantastic. <br/>
Here is the rundown of boxes found and not found. <br/>
<br/>
The Raven-not found (already listed as missing)<br/>
Steamboat Sam-found (great things to see here)<br/>
Comanche-not found (could not find Parker Springs sign, but found 2 <br/>
posts where we thought it would be, box may be missing)<br/>
Ambling Armadillo-placed Fort Parker SP<br/>
Gone Fishin-found (nice park)<br/>
Dinosaur Valley-found (water WAY too high for track sighting)<br/>
Howling at the Moon-placed Dinosaur Valley SP<br/>
Houston Toad-found (great stamp)<br/>
Trail Rider-found * (log book is FULL)<br/>
Cool Cat-found (placed by one of our younger boxers-5 year old Lily)<br/>
Poison Ivy-found*<br/>
Lone Star Letterboxers-placed Bastrop SP<br/>
<br/>
Roarin Roadster-HH released. (found at Hoggs Pecans)<br/>
Madison on the Lake HH released. (found Gone Fishin-Lake Livingston)<br/>
<br/>
(*=I had already found these previously. My newbie cousin had not.)<br/>
<br/>
SOMEHOW I completly missed the Dino Mite box on my list and did not <br/>
have the clues with me. But, as we did not see the tracks for the <br/>
high water we want to revisit soon-when we are begging for rain. <br/>
<br/>
We stopped at Confederate Reunion SP and lo and behold it was re-<br/>
inactment weekend. We drove through the park but did not stop to <br/>
look for boxes as there were people everywhere. Another one I will <br/>
get back to for more exploration.<br/>
<br/>
All in all we traveled about 1000 miles and had a great time--<br/>
despite the rain. I have discovered as much as I tell myself that I <br/>
will go to the park and get the box and go to the next park--IT <br/>
DOESNT WORK. I love the trails and sights too much. The wildflowers <br/>
were awesome this weekend. And, I just this moment found a tick <br/>
crawling on my pants. I carried some stuff in from the car this <br/>
morning and it must have been on it. <br/>
One note about Baby Bears Poison Ivy box at Bastrop-In March a <br/>
family must have stumbled across it while playing on the rocks. They <br/>
wrote in the log "we have no idea what this book is but we are <br/>
signing anyway". They were from Huntsville. We got a laugh from that <br/>
one. They must have put it back right where it belonged because <br/>
Eoghan and Pumpkin Princess were the next to stamp in. <br/>
<br/>
I have rambled enough,<br/>
