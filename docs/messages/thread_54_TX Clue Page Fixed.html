                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ever since I planted the first boxes in Nueces County<br>
they have been showing up in the wrong region of Texas<br>
(Eastern instead of Gulf Coast).  After months of badgering<br>
from me, Wes (the LBNA Webmaster) just informed me that it <br>
has been fixed.  With all the new Texas letterboxers out<br>
there I did not want anyone getting confused looking for<br>
boxes so that is why I pushed hard to get this fixed.  Of<br>
course, there are a lot of counties with no boxes in them<br>
yet that could show up wrong in the future, so please<br>
check to make sure your boxes are in the correct region<br>
after you post the clues, especially if it is in a new<br>
county.  If you find any mistakes on the Texas Clue page<br>
now or in the future, please notify me so I can send<br>
one message to Wes.  Thanks, and keep the boxes coming!<br>
