<div>Hey everyone!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My family is new to letterboxing. We have 
had one successful find and two fruitless searches. I have three sons and each 
of them has decorated their own letterboxing book and chosen their stamp. They 
are very excited about the concept and we have a special backpack that our 
letterboxing stuff lives in. Our goal this year is to try to go on a hunt at 
least once a month. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What else to tell you? We live on a

hope to add a few milk goats. My husband gets to work from home, which is 
wonderful. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm closest to the Dallas area as far as big 
cities go, and the second closest bigger city is Tyler. </div>
<div>Glad to be here!</div>

<div>Welcome to all the new boxers that have introduced themselves in the past few days!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Vicki, how fortunate you are to live on a farm and have those chickens (and future goats). I buy eggs from a local farmer each week at the McKinney farmers market and last week he brought me some blue and green eggs (Ameraucana or Araucana hens?), and one guinea egg. It takes me about thirty minutes to fix breakfast because I refuse to crack the shells so have prick the shells and blow out the whites and yolks to preserve the gorgeous shells. Okay... I majored in art in college, not farming, so don't laugh.</div>
<div>Anyway, welcome to the Texas group. It's a witty, nice group of people. Every great once in awhile, one or two of us might get a little feisty, so if someone sounds a little too cranky, just ignore us.... but that's pretty rare on this list. There are nice people on this list who love to hear about each other's letterboxing adventures... and misadventures!</div>

<div>Hey, Puddlesplasher,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We do feel incredibly blessed to live on 
this farm. It is the one I grew up on, my parents bought it in the early 60s. 
While only 11 acres of it are legally mine, it is almost 300 acres and there 
aren't any fences and it feels like one big farm. One of my brothers and 
his 7 kids live here as well, and my parents are still active on the farm. My 
brother and dad work together as farmers--they raise plants, nursery stock, 
pecans, and Christmas trees for the cut-your-own business. My husband (not a 
farmer) likes composting and gardening and is able to work from home on the 
computer. We are just so happy to be here.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have Americauna hens too. They can lay 
pink, green, or blue eggs. The fun thing is that you don't know what color they 
will lay, but whatever color it is, that is what they lay for life. So they 
don't lay a green one day and a blue the next. The Araucana chickens only 
lay blue...it is a very pretty light blue egg. The chickens look so similar 
that it is hard to tell them apart...lots of innerbreeding. They have these 
great ruff of feathers around their neck that make them look like beards almost. 
My niece (who is NOT a chicken person) was horrified that one of my hens that 
looked especially like Abe Lincoln was actually a <em>GIRL</em>. I also have 
Buff Orpingtons, Barred Rocks, Cochins, Wyandottes, Spitzhaubens, and Marans. I 
did have a great turkey until the local bobcat carried him off. I hope to have 
turkeys again, I LOVE listening to them. I'm thinking I may try to hatch out 
some in the spring. I also had guineas a few years ago, but they refused to nest 
in the coop and took to the trees. The owls picked them off one by one. Guineas 
are such strange birds...not just in looks but also in the brain dept. It is 
like they've all been clonked once really hard.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I'm new enough to letterboxing that it 
seems weird to refer to myself with my trail name. But I'll introduce my family 
that way. My husband hasn't thought of his yet as he hasn't gone with us yet, 
but my kids are Sneaky Cat, Aslan, and Stinky Monkey. Mine is Ladybird 
Beetlebug.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So speaking of letterboxing, I'd love 
someone on this list to point us in the right direction. I'd love to take the 
kids and go to some sites where I'd actually find a letterbox. Where are your 
favorite websites for finding directions? How do I really get started? I'm just 
kind of bummed that we've only had one out of three be where they were supposed 
to be. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks everyone!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Vicki</div>

<div>When it gets closer to Christmas, you'll have to tell me where he does the cut-your-own Christmas trees. I'd love to do that with my grandsons.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Pink eggs? Now I need a pink egg for my "collection"! I thought they laid a different color each time.. I didn't know they laid the same color time after time. That's so cool. Thanks for the education. Next year at the Ft Worth Stock Show, I'll look for them. You're family farm sounds wonderful!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are having a small problem with missing boxes right now in parts of Texas that had so much rain and flooding this summer. It's really hard to know which ones are still available since many of the areas where boxes are hidden are inaccessible due to high water blocking the way. I think many of us are reluctant to mark a box as missing until we are able to actually verify it for ourselves and most of us have boxes scattered around the state so that may take awhile.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will go to the LBNA and AQ sites and mark my boxes which I'm unable to check or haven't had a report on recently as possibly inaccessible or missing. I tried to check on the ones at Lake Grapevine last week, but the trail leading to them is still underwater. I'd hate for anyone to make a special trip out to find any of my boxes and not be able to get to them.</div>

&gt; We are having a small problem with missing boxes right now in parts <br/>
of Texas that had so much rain and flooding this summer. It's really <br/>
hard to know which ones are still available since many of the areas <br/>
where boxes are hidden are inaccessible due to high water blocking <br/>
the way. I think many of us are reluctant to mark a box as missing <br/>
until we are able to actually verify it for ourselves and most of us <br/>
have boxes scattered around the state so that may take awhile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will go to the LBNA and AQ sites and mark my boxes which I'm <br/>
unable to check or haven't had a report on recently as possibly <br/>
inaccessible or missing. I tried to check on the ones at Lake <br/>
Grapevine last week, but the trail leading to them is still <br/>
underwater. I'd hate for anyone to make a special trip out to find <br/>
any of my boxes and not be able to get to them.<br/>

&gt; Hey, Puddlesplasher,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We do feel incredibly blessed to live on this farm. It is the one I <br/>
grew up on, my parents bought it in the early 60s. While only 11 <br/>
acres of it are legally mine, it is almost 300 acres and there aren't <br/>
any fences and it feels like one big farm. One of my brothers and his <br/>
7 kids live here as well, and my parents are still active on the <br/>
farm. My brother and dad work together as farmers--they raise plants, <br/>
nursery stock, pecans, and Christmas trees for the cut-your-own <br/>
business. My husband (not a farmer) likes composting and gardening <br/>
and is able to work from home on the computer. We are just so happy <br/>
to be here.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have Americauna hens too. They can lay pink, green, or blue eggs. <br/>
The fun thing is that you don't know what color they will lay, but <br/>
whatever color it is, that is what they lay for life. So they don't <br/>
lay a green one day and a blue the next. The Araucana chickens only <br/>
lay blue...it is a very pretty light blue egg. The chickens look so <br/>
similar that it is hard to tell them apart...lots of innerbreeding. <br/>
They have these great ruff of feathers around their neck that make <br/>
them look like beards almost. My niece (who is NOT a chicken person) <br/>
was horrified that one of my hens that looked especially like Abe <br/>
Lincoln was actually a GIRL. I also have Buff Orpingtons, Barred <br/>
Rocks, Cochins, Wyandottes, Spitzhaubens, and Marans. I did have a <br/>
great turkey until the local bobcat carried him off. I hope to have <br/>
turkeys again, I LOVE listening to them. I'm thinking I may try to <br/>
hatch out some in the spring. I also had guineas a few years ago, but <br/>
they refused to nest in the coop and took to the trees. The owls <br/>
picked them off one by one. Guineas are such strange birds...not just <br/>
in looks but also in the brain dept. It is like they've all been <br/>
clonked once really hard.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well I'm new enough to letterboxing that it seems weird to refer to <br/>
myself with my trail name. But I'll introduce my family that way. My <br/>
husband hasn't thought of his yet as he hasn't gone with us yet, but <br/>
my kids are Sneaky Cat, Aslan, and Stinky Monkey. Mine is Ladybird <br/>
Beetlebug.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So speaking of letterboxing, I'd love someone on this list to point <br/>
us in the right direction. I'd love to take the kids and go to some <br/>
sites where I'd actually find a letterbox. Where are your favorite <br/>
websites for finding directions? How do I really get started? I'm <br/>
just kind of bummed that we've only had one out of three be where <br/>
they were supposed to be. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; Welcome to all the new boxers that have introduced themselves in <br/>
the past few days!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Vicki, how fortunate you are to live on a farm and have those <br/>
chickens (and future goats). I buy eggs from a local farmer each week <br/>
at the McKinney farmers market and last week he brought me some blue <br/>
and green eggs (Ameraucana or Araucana hens?), and one guinea egg. It <br/>
takes me about thirty minutes to fix breakfast because I refuse to <br/>
crack the shells so have prick the shells and blow out the whites and <br/>
yolks to preserve the gorgeous shells. Okay... I majored in art in <br/>
college, not farming, so don't laugh.<br/>
&gt; Anyway, welcome to the Texas group. It's a witty, nice group of <br/>
people. Every great once in awhile, one or two of us might get a <br/>
little feisty, so if someone sounds a little too cranky, just ignore <br/>
us.... but that's pretty rare on this list. There are nice people on <br/>
this list who love to hear about each other's letterboxing <br/>
adventures... and misadventures!<br/>

&gt; Hey everyone!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My family is new to letterboxing. We have had one successful find <br/>
and two fruitless searches. I have three sons and each of them has <br/>
decorated their own letterboxing book and chosen their stamp. They <br/>
are very excited about the concept and we have a special backpack <br/>
that our letterboxing stuff lives in. Our goal this year is to try to <br/>
go on a hunt at least once a month. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; What else to tell you? We live on a farm. We have chickens and a <br/>
few cows (one bottle fed baby) and this year we hope to add a few <br/>
milk goats. My husband gets to work from home, which is wonderful. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm closest to the Dallas area as far as big cities go, and the <br/>
second closest bigger city is Tyler. <br/>
&gt; Glad to be here!<br/>
&gt; Vicki<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Hey again Vicki!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I see by your trail names that you have at least one Chronicles of Narnia fan!  That series are my seven favorite books ever - but most especially, The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe.  I wish I had kept count of how many times I've read that book both to myself and out loud, always from the only set I've ever owned, the one I got when I was about 10 years old - each of the books is marked 95 cents!  My two kids begged to hear it every couple of years or so, so that it is a family tradition to listen to Mom read LWW.  Nothing like all four of us laying on the living room floor and me holding the book over my head and starting it out - "Once there were four children whose names were Peter, Susan, Edmund, and Lucy". 
<br/><br/>My family lives in Cherokee County, which is the 3rd most box-populated county in Texas, based on listings from LBNA.  I was a little surprised to find it that close to the top, until I ran numbers a few minutes ago!  Harris County is by far the most populated with 323 listings, followed by Tarrant County with 142, then Cherokee with 85.  Cherokee County owes its high numbers in large part to JB Kokopelli's monthly holiday series - seven series in the county so far, with 5-6 boxes in each.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You are in a pretty good place for going in various directions for boxes.  Dallas, of course, has quite a few, spread nicely across the county.  You can go down I-45 fairly easily, where there are several pockets of boxes along the way (see sitreps by Amy and by JB Kokopelli in the past few days for reports on the I45 area).  Tyler has just gotten a fair number, and so has Athens as Lois pointed out.  And the Cedar Creek area, which Lois has been diligently planting lately.  Cherokee County with Rusk and Jacksonville both having lots of boxes is just south of Tyler.  North of I20 is pretty slim still.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As far as sites go, there is <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> (LBNA) and <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com">www.atlasquest.com</a> (AQ), both very good sites.  Lots of individuals have boxes on personal sites as well and if you read peoples' blogs and personal pages, you might find otherwise unlisted boxes.  I personally prefer 
<a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a> because it stays very simple, without a lot of bells and whistles - just boxes.  Atlasquest does all but wash the dishes, but it is very distracting to me and I spend way too much time getting ready to go boxing and not enough time actually boxing when I use AQ.  A lot of folks list their boxes on one or the other and a lot list their boxes on both.  LBNA is still a little bigger for the time being - 1644 listings on LBNA and 994 on AQ in Texas.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe we should just have a Christmas gathering at your cut-your-own place and all come get a tree and leave a box in your area!  Wouldn't that be fun?</div>

<div>Do either of you make goat cheese? I've been considering ordering the "stuff" to make mozarella from a place up in Massachusetts. I've read that it's pretty straight-forward. Just wondering if you had any experience in case I don't "stretch" it correctly or something, and need to ask questions.</div>

<div>Hi, Vicki, and welcome to the Tx List.  I'm just catching up on some 
recent posts and read your introduction as well as some of the responses, and 
really have nothing new to add to what others have said other than this: read as 
much as you can about letterboxing on the Newboxers link (on LBNA) or on AQ and 
that will be helpful, too.  As for Lucy's idea ("Maybe we should just have 
a Christmas gathering at your cut-your-own place<br/>and all come get a tree and 
leave a box in your area! Wouldn't that be fun? -- BarefootLucy") - hey!  
I'm all for that!  Just the idea of Christmas weather sounds pretty good 
right about now (I've just got home from a commute through North 
Dallas-Grapevine-Southlake traffic and it's really really hot out there!) -- 
Glad to have you join us and say hello to those chickens for me.</div>

<div>Today I went down to Central Market in Plano and asked the "cheese lady", who was busy making fresh mozzarella cheese, where I could find their <u>local</u> goat cheese. She told me they didn't have any right now because "Debbie's goats were nursing right now".  Once again, this city girl didn't realize that was an issue, but hey, it makes sense to me that the little boogers don't want to share mama's milk. Guess I'll wait my turn. Next thing you know, I won't be able to get any honey because the queen bee is on vacation in Aruba or something. I'm trying to support my local farmers and keep our money in Texas, but I have a lot to learn.</div>

<div>
<div>That's the kind I want to make. I need to order some vegetable rennet tablets and citric acid, but other than that, it's basically milk and salt. Of course they recommend that for the best results, you buy local milk so it hasn't been super pasturized for hauling long distances. There are some dairies around my area that sell milk to the public, so I may give it a try. Maybe it can become my "signature dish" at family events and letterboxing events. People would remember me forever.... "wasn't she that strange woman that used to always bring that awful cheese to all the events?..... Yep, even the flies wouldn't go near it!"</div>

<div>If you don't want to go goat, there is a 
super dairy here near me. It is a family run raw milk (cow--Guernsey) dairy that 
sells its milk for $7 a gallon. They aren't actually certified yet, but they 
will be any day now. (They were given their certification only to have it taken 
away because the vet who did the TB/Brucelosis test did it in house instead of 
sending it to Austin so they had to re-run that test and have Austin analyze the 
findings.) I've been drinking their milk now for a while and it is fabulous. For 
more info, search for hallsfamilyfarm.com</div>

<div>That's the kind I want to make. I need to order some 
  vegetable rennet tablets and citric acid, but other than that, it's basically 
  milk and salt. Of course they recommend that for the best results, you buy 
  local milk so it hasn't been super pasturized for hauling long distances. 
  There are some dairies around my area that sell milk to the public, so I 
  may give it a try. Maybe it can become my "signature dish" at family events 
  and letterboxing events. People would remember me forever.... "wasn't she that 
  strange woman that used to always bring that awful cheese to all the 
  events?..... Yep, even the flies wouldn't go near it!"</div>

</p><div>I've only made it one time, and it was 
    with a friend. She did the "quick" kind that you do on a stove top and we 
    had cheese in under an hour. It was magnificent. I asked her how long it 
    kept and she said she didn't know...she'd never had to find out with her 
    three sons eating it as fast as she could make it.</div>

<div>Do either of you make goat cheese? I've been considering 
      ordering the "stuff" to make mozarella from a place up in Massachusetts. 
      I've read that it's pretty straight-forward. Just wondering if you had any 
      experience in case I don't "stretch" it correctly or something, and need 
      to ask questions.</div>

<div>Hey everyone!<br/><br/>My family is new to letterboxing. We have had 
        one successful find and two fruitless searches. I have three sons and 
        each of them has decorated their own letterboxing book and chosen their 
        stamp. They are very excited about the concept and we have a special 
        backpack that our letterboxing stuff lives in. Our goal this year is to 
        try to go on a hunt at least once a month. <br/><br/>What else to tell 
        you? We live on a farm. We have chickens and a few cows (one bottle fed 
        baby) and this year we hope to add a few milk goats. My husband gets to 
        work from home, which is wonderful. <br/><br/>I'm closest to the Dallas 
        area as far as big cities go, and the second closest bigger city is 
        Tyler. <br/>Glad to be here!<br/>Vicki </div>

<div>Sure...but they know me by the name Vicki. 
&lt;g&gt; We've been giving them hell because we are wallsfamilyfarm.com and 
they are hallsfamilyfarm.com and we live near each other and our kids play 
together.  They threatened to start growing Christmas trees and we 
threatened to start milking cows. LOL. You can freeze the raw milk in the gallon 
jugs. I do it all the time. I'm raising three pigs and when they don't sell 
their milk in the allotted time, then they give it to me to give my pigs and I 
toss it into my freezer until I need it. Anyway it freezes great, you just have 
to shake it up real good when it thaws as it will separate the cream 
out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I actually talked to Kelly today and their 
test is back from Austin. They've tried to get their inspector on the phone to 
give him the numbers on their certs, but he has been out of office. They expect 
their certification to go into effect tomorrow. </div>

<div>Hey everyone!<br/><br/>My family is new to letterboxing. We have 
            had one successful find and two fruitless searches. I have three 
            sons and each of them has decorated their own letterboxing book and 
            chosen their stamp. They are very excited about the concept and we 
            have a special backpack that our letterboxing stuff lives in. Our 
            goal this year is to try to go on a hunt at least once a month. 
            <br/><br/>What else to tell you? We live on a farm. We have chickens 
            and a few cows (one bottle fed baby) and this year we hope to add a 
            few milk goats. My husband gets to work from home, which is 
            wonderful. <br/><br/>I'm closest to the Dallas area as far as big 
            cities go, and the second closest bigger city is Tyler. <br/>Glad to

<div>My husband shakes up his orange juice so much it's like drinking orange foam. I always have to let the carton settle back down a bit before pouring some for myself. Once, when my kids were little, he picked up a bottle of Italian salad dressing and started to shake it. Unfortunately, my daughter hadn't put the lid back on tightly so we had to clean that oily mess off everything in the kitchen. We still duck when he starts to shake something up!</div>

<div>Sure...but they know me by the name Vicki. &lt;g&gt; We've been giving them hell because we are wallsfamilyfarm.<wbr/>com and they are hallsfamilyfarm.<wbr/>com and we live near each other and our kids play together.  They threatened to start growing Christmas trees and we threatened to start milking cows. LOL. You can freeze the raw milk in the gallon jugs. I do it all the time. I'm raising three pigs and when they don't sell their milk in the allotted time, then they give it to me to give my pigs and I toss it into my freezer until I need it. Anyway it freezes great, you just have to shake it up real good when it thaws as it will separate the cream out.</div>

<div>I actually talked to Kelly today and their test is back from Austin. They've tried to get their inspector on the phone to give him the numbers on their certs, but he has been out of office. They expect their certification to go into effect tomorrow. </div>

<div>Thanks for the website. It looks like they're not <u>too</u> far from McKinney. I'll give them a week or so to get their certification before I call and set up a time to come out, but if they don't have it yet (bureaucracy can take forever), I'll just give the "donation" instead. Shall I tell them you recommended them?</div>

<div>Okay, I lied. They have Jerseys, not Guernseys. (I knew that! Duh!) and they aren't selling their milk to the public until they get that certification. They are taking "donations" until that time. </div>

<div>Today I went down to Central Market in Plano and asked the "cheese lady", who was busy making fresh mozzarella cheese, where I could find their <u>local</u> goat cheese. She told me they didn't have any right now because "Debbie's goats were nursing right now".  Once again, this city girl didn't realize that was an issue, but hey, it makes sense to me that the little boogers don't want to share mama's milk. Guess I'll wait my turn. Next thing you know, I won't be able to get any honey because the queen bee is on vacation in Aruba or something. I'm trying to support my local farmers and keep our money in Texas, but I have a lot to learn.</div>

<div>Mmmm. Sign me up as a taster. I had a sample of a salad at Starbuck's, it had cherry tomatos, goat cheese, olives, and a bit of lettuce, the dressing was a typical italian (I guess), but it was so good. They use little scoops of the cheese. Oh man, now I'm hungry. </div>

<div>Do either of you make goat cheese? I've been considering ordering the "stuff" to make mozarella from a place up in Massachusetts. I've read that it's pretty straight-forward.

<div>Hey everyone!<br/><br/>My family is new to letterboxing. We have had one successful find and two fruitless searches. I have three sons and each of them has decorated their own letterboxing book and chosen their stamp. They are very excited about the concept and we have a special backpack that our letterboxing stuff lives in. Our goal this year is to try to go on a hunt at least once a month. <br/><br/>What else to tell you? We live on a farm. We have chickens and a few cows (one bottle fed baby) and this year we hope to add a few milk goats. My husband gets to work from home, which is wonderful. <br/><br/>I'm closest to the Dallas area as far as big cities go, and the second closest bigger city is Tyler. <br/>Glad to be here!<br/>Vicki </div>

<div>Hey, Puddlesplasher,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We do feel incredibly blessed to live on this farm. It is the one I grew up on, my parents bought it in the early 60s. While only 11 acres of it are legally mine, it is almost 300 acres and there aren't any fences and it feels like one big farm. One of my brothers and his 7 kids live here as well, and my parents are still active on the farm. My brother and dad work together as farmers--they raise plants, nursery stock, pecans, and Christmas trees for the cut-your-own business. My husband (not a farmer) likes composting and gardening and is able to work from home on the computer. We are just so happy to be here.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have Americauna hens too. They can lay pink, green, or blue eggs. The fun thing is that you don't know what color they will lay, but whatever color it is, that is what they lay for life. So they don't lay a green one day and a blue the next. The Araucana chickens only lay blue...it is a very pretty light blue egg. The chickens look so similar that it is hard to tell them apart...lots of innerbreeding. They have these great ruff of feathers around their neck that make them look like beards almost. My niece (who is NOT a chicken person) was horrified that one of my hens that looked especially like Abe Lincoln was actually a <em>GIRL</em>. I also have Buff Orpingtons, Barred Rocks, Cochins, Wyandottes, Spitzhaubens, and Marans. I did have a great turkey until the local bobcat carried him off. I hope to have turkeys again, I LOVE listening to them. I'm thinking I may try to hatch out some in the spring. I also had guineas a few years ago, but they refused to nest in the coop and took to the trees. The owls picked them off one by one. Guineas are such strange birds...not just in looks but also in the brain dept. It is like they've all been clonked once really hard.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I'm new enough to letterboxing that it seems weird to refer to myself with my trail name. But I'll introduce my family that way. My husband hasn't thought of his yet as he hasn't gone with us yet, but my kids are Sneaky Cat, Aslan, and Stinky Monkey. Mine is Ladybird Beetlebug.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So speaking of letterboxing, I'd love someone on this list to point us in the right direction. I'd love to take the kids and go to some sites where I'd actually find a letterbox. Where are your favorite websites for finding directions? How do I really get started? I'm just kind of bummed that we've only had one out of three be where they were supposed to be. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks everyone!</div>

<div>Welcome to all the new boxers that have introduced themselves in the past few days!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Vicki, how fortunate you are to live on a farm and have those chickens (and future goats). I buy eggs from a local farmer each week at the McKinney farmers market and last week he brought me some blue and green eggs (Ameraucana or Araucana hens?), and one guinea egg. It takes me about thirty minutes to fix breakfast because I refuse to crack the shells so have prick the shells and blow out the whites and yolks to preserve the gorgeous shells. Okay... I majored in art in college, not farming, so don't laugh.</div>
<div>Anyway, welcome to the Texas group. It's a witty, nice group of people. Every great once in awhile, one or two of us might get a little feisty, so if someone sounds a little too cranky, just ignore us.... but that's pretty rare on this list. There are nice people on this list who love to hear about each other's letterboxing adventures..<wbr/>. and misadventures!</div>

<div>Hey everyone!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My family is new to letterboxing. We have had one successful find and two fruitless searches. I have three sons and each of them has decorated their own letterboxing book and chosen their stamp. They are very excited about the concept and we have a special backpack that our letterboxing stuff lives in. Our goal this year is to try to go on a hunt at least once a month. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What else to tell you? We live on a farm. We have chickens and a few cows (one bottle fed baby) and this year we hope to add a few milk goats. My husband gets to work from home, which is wonderful. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm closest to the Dallas area as far as big cities go, and the second closest bigger city is Tyler. </div>
<div>Glad to be here!</div>

<div>We are 45 miles East of Dallas. (Go 
to wallsfamilyfarm.com) I have no idea how inbreeding effects the 
chickens eggs...haven't studied chicken genetics myself, LOL. I know you don't 
get mottled eggs when you breed them randomly, just different shades of brown 
and white, etc!</div>
