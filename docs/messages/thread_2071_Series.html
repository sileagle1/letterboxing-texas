<div>I have done a couple of 
series, and I have another ready to be planted.  It is interesting you 
should ask this today, because I just thought of and idea, and I'd like to see 
if there is any interest.  If you box with kids (and I almost always do!) 
series are good because there is more "bang for the buck".  I was thinking 
of the theme of "Mythical Creatures" for a series, and there are so many to 
chose from!  So then I thought what if anyone who was interested could sign 
up to carve a stamp and make a logbook and send them to me.  Then I will 
plant and maintain the boxes, all along one trail.  Each contributor can 
take credit for their own box, I'll just send on the clues and you can each post 
them.  I will also stamp all the stamps and send them to the contributors, 
so that you can have the stamps in case you are not from the Houston area.  
Does this make sense?  If not it is most likely because I am so distraught 
over sending my little boot wearing boy off to kindergarten tomorrow.  But 
if it does and you are interested let me know...I'll only have 2 kids at home 
all day this school year, and I need something to do with all this extra free 
time!  MO5</div></body></html>

Hey MO5,<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the info.  I'm going to be doing my boxing with my dogs and <br/>
sometimes my husband.  And series types interest both of us. He's <br/>
thinking about Star Trek or sticking with history type stuff.  I'm <br/>
wanting dogs.  You know, breeds and misc. dog things.  Thought it would <br/>
be fun.<br/>
