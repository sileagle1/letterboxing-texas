<br/>
I'm going to be in Houston beginning Sunday the 30th of April. I'll be<br/>
attempting a few finds in the area (which shouldn't be a problem,<br/>
considering that there seems to be NO shortage of 'boxes...).<br/>
<br/>
Since this is a business trip, I'll probably be doing my boxing after<br/>
dark. I'd appreciate any help I can get narrowing down some select<br/>
boxes that are accessible at night and are in relatively safe<br/>
locations. Or I'm going to have to fake a headache or something...<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't be asking for help if there weren't so many... but I'll be<br/>
glad to help any of y'all should you get to my neck of the woods<br/>
(metro Atlanta, and southwest thereof).<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! Contact me off-list if you like.<br/>
