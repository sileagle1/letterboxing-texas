                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had to pick up my son from college yesterday so I decided to leave a few days early and turn it into a letterboxing trip.  I started in San Marcos at the parks I placed boxes in earlier this year since a couple of people have since also placed some there.  I also wanted to place a few more as extra incentive for others to visit.  The weather was nice and cool and great for hiking, which was good since I did a lot of hiking!  Some of the boxes I found and placed were pretty far along the trails, which complements the earlier closer ones nicely.  At most of the parks I was the only one there and it made the 9 or 10 miles of hiking seem pleasant.<br/>
<br/>
The next day I revisited my Jacob's Well box in Wimberley since I had a report that the log was wet.  After replacing the container and log I decided to see if I could place the box at the actual well this time.  I found a different access point that lets you walk to the well without waiting for a Saturday tour, so I relocated the box up on a bluff above the well for a beautiful view.  If you have already printed the clues you will need to reprint them before you visit and even if you have already stamped into the box I recommend a visit just to see the well.  I stayed in Wimberley that night to see the Trail Of Lights at Emily Ann Theater and I also recommend that.  In fact, if you have never seen the Hill Country Regional Christmas Lighting Trail you should do it, or at least do Johnson City and Marble Falls.  Here are links:<br/>

<br/>
The next day I got up early to get in a little more boxing before picking up my son in Austin.  I decided to visit a growing band of pirates and had so much fun I added a new member to their ranks.  Next time you are in Austin I highly recommend these boxes based on  Talk Like A Pirate Day.  Then, for my last stop I placed a new game letterbox that I have been working on for awhile.  It is actually a puzzle that I hope you find as challenging and fun to solve as I did to create.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone has a safe and fun Christmas and finds time to do a little letterboxing!<br/>

I started in San Marcos at<br/>&gt; the parks I placed boxes in earlier this year since a couple of people have<br/>&gt; since also placed some there. I also wanted to place a few more as extra<br/>&gt; incentive for others to visit. The weather was nice and cool and great for<br/>&gt; hiking, which was good since I did a lot of hiking! Some of the boxes I<br/>&gt; found and placed were pretty far along the trails, which complements the<br/>&gt; earlier closer ones nicely. At most of the parks I was the only one there<br/>&gt; and it made the 9 or 10 miles of hiking seem pleasant.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The next day I revisited my Jacob's Well box in Wimberley since I had a<br/>&gt; report that the log was wet. After replacing the container and log I decided<br/>&gt; to see if I could place the box at the actual well this time. I found a<br/>&gt; different access point that lets you walk to the well without waiting for a<br/>&gt; Saturday tour, so I relocated the box up on a bluff above the well for a<br/>&gt; beautiful view. If you have already printed the clues you will need to<br/>&gt; reprint them before you visit and even if you have already stamped into the<br/>&gt; box I recommend a visit just to see the well. I stayed in Wimberley that<br/>&gt; night to see the Trail Of Lights at Emily Ann Theater and I also recommend<br/>&gt; that. In fact, if you have never seen the Hill Country Regional Christmas<br/>&gt; Lighting Trail you should do it, or at least do Johnson City and Marble<br/>&gt; Falls. Here are links:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.emilyann.org/tol.cfm">http://www.emilyann.org/tol.cfm</a><br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.tex-fest.com/regional/">http://www.tex-fest.com/regional/</a><br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The next day I got up early to get in a little more boxing before picking up<br/>&gt; my son in Austin. I decided to visit a growing band of pirates and had so<br/>&gt; much fun I added a new member to their ranks. Next time you are in Austin I<br/>&gt; highly recommend these boxes based on Talk Like A Pirate Day. Then, for my<br/>&gt; last stop I placed a new game letterbox that I have been working on for<br/>&gt; awhile. It is actually a puzzle that I hope you find as challenging and fun<br/>&gt; to solve as I did to create. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I hope everyone has a safe and fun Christmas and finds time to do a little<br/>&gt; letterboxing!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Silver Eagle<br/>&gt;<o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p><span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That would be great to finally meet y'all.  If you fly into Austin you could do these and other area boxes before or after the Event.  If you fly into San Antonio it will be a little more driving but could still do before or after Event, or some of the boxes in that area.  Since that should be a good time of year to visit weather-wise, you might want to stay longer and visit other areas in the Hill Country.  The drive west from Austin on Hwy 290 is nice and takes you to many wineries and boxes on the way to Fredericksburg, where you can climb Enchanted Rock.  Pedernales and Inks Lake State Parks have lots of trails and boxes, including some Renegades.<br/>
