                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Wes & Grace,<br>
Great to hear from you! <br>
We have left several HHs, with varying results ;-). When we first started<br>
letterboxing we were the only boxers in the DFW area - so a couple of our<br>
HHs languished and we finally pulled them to send out in Postal Letterboxes,<br>
or to become regular boxes. <br>
We sent The Texas Tick HH to a Hitchhiker Hotel, where he apparently loved<br>
it so much he stayed for 6 months - until Silver Eagle rescued it and Hawk<br>
took it under her wing.<br>
One of our HHs, The Devil Dog, is traveling around in the Carolinas, but we<br>
haven't heard about it lately. <br>
Here's the website to track them:<br>
http://alum.wpi.edu/~p_miner/travelers.html<br>
And there is a talklist specifically to give & take info about HHs:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers/?yguid=183340440<br>
<br>
Let me know if I can be more helpful-<br>

Does anyone have any experience with leaving a hitchhiker?  How do <br>
you keep track of where your hiker is?  Is there a website to keep <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds like you are confusing letterboxing with geocaching. In letterboxing, yes, the hitchhiker would be a stamp. It can be a stamp by itself (with logbook) in a baggie, or in it's own box. Then there variations on hitchhikers - each with it's own name and travel idea. Check out the info on Wanda & Pete's Hitchhiker pages for the basics.<br>
<br>
We don't usually leave items in boxes unless it is some sort of first finder prize, or other finder prize. In this case, the finder would keep it.<br>
<br>
Hope that helps.<br>

That's your "thank you" to someone who took the time to carve that stamp and add to your letterboxing pleasure with a neat surprise! It is also thoughtful to post to the travelers list or to Wanda&Pete's Hitchhiker List to help track the HH.but only give the location where you found it - not the location in which you left it. If you read posts about hitchhikers you'll notice that folks often give a little clue as to where they might have left it - but nothing specific.<br>

<div>If you go to Silent Doug's site at <a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/">http://www.letterboxing.info/</a> , the one you mentioned,   he has a glossary that gives a good explanation of most letterboxing terms, including HH. They actually don't have to be that tiny. It can be a little sketchpad. Most of the ones I've seen have been little spiral sketchpads in a small plastic bag. Just as long as it's small enough to put in the container with another LB. </div>

Missouri."  You generally also don't tell the box owner where you <br>

Occasionally, there are HHs that are on a specific mission, like <br>
racing across the US and in those cases, the owners definitely want to <br>
know where you left it.<br>

Many letterboxers are going to smaller containers, so sometimes, <br>
particularly in an urban area, finding a HH-friendly container can be <br>
a challenge!<br>

Tired of swatting mosquitoes, we decided to carve for awhile. The result was a handful of bug stamps, the better of which were carved by her. <br/>
<br/>We decided to release these as hitchhikers, so I set about making logbooks and getting them ready to go. At that time, I was fairly new to the idea of HH's, so I didn't think to put contact information in the logbook.<br/>
<br/>Off they went, "infesting" boxes around the area. Some of them we have never heard from again, one we hear from more often than others, but most we hear from every few months.<br/><br/>One of them was nearly lost - the finder tried desperately to figure out who it belonged to so they could report that it needed a logbook. Since I hadn't put contact information in the logbook, and since I didn't have that particular one listed (I had actually forgotten some of them), locating the launcher was really tough for her! She finally posted on the Traveller yahoo group and I HAPPENED to see it and I wrote to her. She graciously replaced the logbook, noted it with my contact information and sent it along its way and continued working to locate us. She sent the logbook along to me and I was fascinated to see where all this silent HH had been. It moved along and I have never heard from it again since then.<br/>
<br/>Time to Spray, on the other hand, communicates very frequently. It's an eerily realistic cockroach carved by SJZ. It moves almost constantly and has criss-crossed the country at least twice, and come back through East Texas at least once. I've sent new logbooks to it on at least three occasions and received the old ones back. I find it ironic that it turns up any and everywhere - proving the point that no one is immune to a roach infestation.<br/>
<br/>But I digress. I had recently thought how I hadn't heard from any of my HH's in quite a long time. Next thing I knew, I heard from two of them in one week! Flutterby, a neat little butterfly, turned up on the West Coast earlier this week and Time To Spray popped up again on the East Coast.<br/>
<br/>The thing I love about HH's is the surprise when I find them, but also the surprise of seeing a little note about them in my inbox, and even better, an old logbook in my mailbox.<br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>

Since I hadn't put contact information in the logbook, and since I didn't have that particular one listed (I had actually forgotten some of them), locating the launcher was really tough for her! She finally posted on the Traveller yahoo group and I HAPPENED to see it and I wrote to her. She graciously replaced the logbook, noted it with my contact information and sent it along its way and continued working to locate us. She sent the logbook along to me and I was fascinated to see where all this silent HH had been. It moved along and I have never heard from it again since then.<br>

It moves almost constantly and has criss-crossed the country at least twice, and come back through East Texas at least once. I've sent new logbooks to it on at least three occasions and received the old ones back. I find it ironic that it turns up any and everywhere - proving the point that no one is immune to a roach infestation.<br>

&gt; About five years ago, my daughter, SJZ, and I sat on the barge in the middle of the lake in the summertime, bored to tears while the guys fished.  Tired of swatting mosquitoes, we decided to carve for awhile.  The result was a handful of bug stamps, the better of which were carved by her. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We decided to release these as hitchhikers, so I set about making logbooks and getting them ready to go.  At that time, I was fairly new to the idea of HH's, so I didn't think to put contact information in the logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Off they went, "infesting" boxes around the area.  Some of them we have never heard from again, one we hear from more often than others, but most we hear from every few months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of them was nearly lost - the finder tried desperately to figure out who it belonged to so they could report that it needed a logbook.  Since I hadn't put contact information in the logbook, and since I didn't have that particular one listed (I had actually forgotten some of them), locating the launcher was really tough for her!  She finally posted on the Traveller yahoo group and I HAPPENED to see it and I wrote to her.  She graciously replaced the logbook, noted it with my contact information and sent it along its way and continued working to locate us.

&gt; Time to Spray, on the other hand, communicates very frequently.  It's an eerily realistic cockroach carved by SJZ.  It moves almost constantly and has criss-crossed the country at least twice, and come back through East Texas at least once.  I've sent new logbooks to it on at least three occasions and received the old ones back.  I find it ironic that it turns up any and everywhere - proving the point that no one is immune to a roach infestation.<br/>
