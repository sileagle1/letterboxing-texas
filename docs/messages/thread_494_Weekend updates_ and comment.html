If you are talking about my box, then I find your comment rude. Olde Towne Spring is just that. . .a town. Yes, there are people, there are businesses. If you don't prefer these type of placements, then why did you go? To write a rude comment about your dissatisfaction and inability to find a box due to the placement is unnecessary.<br/>

&gt;Below is a listing of the boxes I found this weekend on the North side of Houston.  Really enjoyed walking around Mercer and Jesse Jones parks, which also reminded me what letterboxing should really be about.  This leads me to my comment, which ties into how I started my day (which made me very disappointed about letterboxing).   I went to Olde Town Spring, to find a box placed in a high traffic area, with no parking, and people everywhere.  After parking 1/4 mile away, and walking back to the spot, I then had to keep going back and forth in front of the establishment, as the two hostesses on the porch kept watching me, wondering what the heck I was doing.  After 15 minutes of this, I finally decided the rock must be missing, or I was just unwilling to dig around while people in the establishment were now looking out the window at me.   I can't tell you if the box is missing, just will say I no longer will be going after any box not located in a park, or protected area.  Plea<br/>
&gt; se make<br/>
&gt; it clear on your clues that the box is in a public area.   Okay, enough about my preferences, here are the 15 boxes I found, and the new one I placed.   Take care.<br/>

<p><span>Baby Bear,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I’m sorry you
were frustrated looking for that letterbox – I’ve made two trips
trying to find a couple of Raindear’s boxes because of folks hanging
around nearby, but I have to say that the finding was all the sweeter on the
second time around!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>You and Silver Eagle
really blazed the trail for the rest of us to letterbox in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:state>, so I’m personally very grateful
to you guys. I love this sport/hobby and my family has enjoyed being pulled
along into its wake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Since you were so frustrated
about this particular box, I can understand that perhaps you dashed off the
email below without thinking it through or re-reading it – but please
stop a moment and consider that the phrase “which also reminded me what
letterboxing <b><span>should</span></b> really be
about.” Sounds as though you believe there is only ONE right way to
letterbox. One of the things that most appeals to me about this activity is
that we can all choose to letterbox however we wish – there are no rules-
there is no governing body who decides what it SHOULD be about. Thank goodness!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Our family has placed
a very wide assortment of boxes in hugely different situations from State parks
to hamburger joints. We love having variety! Some folks who have found the
boxes have enjoyed the stealth and subterfuge it takes to box in urban areas
and some don’t. Personally I always wonder why someone would pursue a box
in the city if they hate urban boxing! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>We recently found a
box that required a lot of acting of my part – (really, really bad
acting!) but my husband &amp; I have laughed about it ever since. We’ve
been lucky enough to find several of your boxes – and even though they
were not “urban”, they were in spots which required waiting for
people to move away, or to pretend to drop my purse or whatever. To me, that’s
part of the challenge. Perhaps in the future you could write and ask the placer
of a box whether you will have to employ strategy to search for it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>But I hear your pain!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>And I promise to make
it clear in our clues that you will have to pretend to drop your purse to get
this box!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Take care,<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Ruby Tuesday<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>PS – Am I crazy?
Baby Bear’s post made me more anxious than ever to look for TeamKing’s
Olde Town Spring letterbox!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Below is a listing of the boxes I found this weekend on the North side
of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:city>. 
Really enjoyed walking around Mercer and Jesse Jones parks, which also reminded
me what letterboxing should really be about.  This leads me to my comment,
which ties into how I started my day (which made me very disappointed about
letterboxing).   I went to Olde Town Spring, to find a box placed in
a high traffic area, with no parking, and people everywhere.  After
parking 1/4 mile away, and walking back to the spot, I then had to keep going
back and forth in front of the establishment, as the two hostesses on the porch
kept watching me, wondering what the heck I was doing.  After 15 minutes
of this, I finally decided the rock must be missing, or I was just unwilling to
dig around while people in the establishment were now looking out the window at
me.   I can't tell you if the box is missing, just will say I no
longer will be going after any box not located in a park, or protected
area.  Please make it clear on your clues that the box is in a public
area.   Okay, enough about my preferences, here are the 15 boxes I
found, and the new one I placed.   Take care.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Since you were so frustrated about this particular box, I can understand that perhaps you dashed off the email below without thinking it through or re-reading it  but please stop a moment and consider that the phrase which also reminded me what letterboxing <b><span>should</span></b> really be about. Sounds as though you believe there is only ONE right way to letterbox. One of the things that most appeals to me about this activity is that we can all choose to letterbox however we wish  there are no rules- there is no governing body who decides what it SHOULD be about. Thank goodness!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Our family has placed a very wide assortment of boxes in hugely different situations from State parks to hamburger joints. We love having variety! Some folks who have found the boxes have enjoyed the stealth and subterfuge it takes to box in urban areas and some dont. Personally I always wonder why someone would pursue a box in the city if they hate urban boxing! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>We recently found a box that required a lot of acting of my part  (really, really bad acting!) but my husband &amp; I have laughed about it ever since. Weve been lucky enough to find several of your boxes  and even though they were not urban, they were in spots which required waiting for people to move away, or to pretend to drop my purse or whatever. To me, thats part of the challenge. Perhaps in the future you could write and ask the placer of a box whether you will have to employ strategy to search for it?<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>But I hear your pain!!!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>And I promise to make it clear in our clues that you will have to pretend to drop your purse to get this box!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Take care,<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>PS  Am I crazy? Baby Bears post made me more anxious than ever to look for TeamKings Olde Town Spring letterbox!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Below is a listing of the boxes I found this weekend on the North side of <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:city>.  Really enjoyed walking around Mercer and Jesse Jones parks, which also reminded me what letterboxing should really be about.  This leads me to my comment, which ties into how I started my day (which made me very disappointed about letterboxing).   I went to Olde Town Spring, to find a box placed in a high traffic area, with no parking, and people everywhere.  After parking 1/4 mile away, and walking back to the spot, I then had to keep going back and forth in front of the establishment, as the two hostesses on the porch kept watching me, wondering what the heck I was doing.  After 15 minutes of this, I finally decided the rock must be missing, or I was just unwilling to dig around while people in the establishment were now
 looking out the window at me.   I can't tell you if the box is missing, just will say I no longer will be going after any box not located in a park, or protected area.  Please make it clear on your clues that the box is in a public area.   Okay, enough about my preferences, here are the 15 boxes I found, and the new one I placed.   Take care.<o:p></o:p></span></p></div>
