                    <div class="plaintext-content">Whew.  It's 11:38 p.m. and I'm finally home.  Yesterday (was it really only yesterday?) Sallimander and I traveled to Austin to attend a meeting today.  We were lucky enough to be able to drive down and attend the Day of the Dead BBQ.  Oh my goodness!  Thank you so much, Bell Motel and Whiz Gee.  You are awesome hosts.  We had the best time and the boxes you planted for the event are amazing.  It was so much fun.  We were in Austin with a fellow teacher and her husband.  They asked several times where we ate dinner last night.  How does one explain to middle aged-ultra conservative people that you met some people online but you don't know their real names, but you are going to their house because they want to feed you dinner and send you into the woods to find pieces of Tupperware?  We said we ate grilled salmon at a local place but we couldn't remember the name of it.  :)  Lame, huh?  I just didn't expect them to press the point and ask several times!<br/>
<br/>
This morning we went to a really great meeting.  And that's not sarcastic.  After, we decided to get one box before heading out of Austin.  I'm working toward gathering all of Boots Tex's governor boxes and even though there is more than one in Austin, I really wanted to go to Oakwood Cemetery.  Beautiful carve, as usual.  And we headed back north (well, it's not a big detour to Lammes' candy store).<br/>
<br/>
By this time, it was 4:30ish and traffic was building.  I've been hungry for a steak and I thought we could easily find a Saltgrass somewhere north of Austin.  Alas, it was not to be.  We pulled off in Salado and asked a local for a recommendation.  She suggested we stay out of Salado and eat at BJ's in Temple so we continued north.  After a delicious meal, I was checking my email as we walked back to the car.<br/>
<br/>
Lo and behold, we got the email about the circus.  Now, let me stop and say here that I'm a very scary person.  As I read the clues, I knew where to go (well, generally, as you'll discover).  We decided that this may be our only chance at the circus.  We decided to at least drive by.  I certainly wasn't committing to getting out of my vehicle.  Not at a cemetery AT NIGHT!  No way, Jose.<br/>
<br/>
We pulled into Waco and to the Texas Ranger Museum around 7:20.  I was terrified circling the cemetery in the dark safely locked in my car.  Now, I grew up in cemeteries.  That's what our family does - we go cemetery trekking on Sunday afternoons.  They are interesting historical snapshots.  We are, however, clearly out of the gates well before dusk begins to set.  And there I was in a cemetery at night.  In the dark.<br/>
<br/>
So we get out.  And start walking.  There is a small gate with  a stone with a Confederate flag.  We think we are in the right spot.  It's dark, remember, and I don't have a flashlight.  I do, however, have my .38 Special (though it wouldn't help against anything that I was currently afraid of).  So close your eyes and picture this.  AndPlus2 and Sallimander (two extremely NON-outdoorsy people) both dressed in business casual, me in my heels, traipsing around the cemetery using our Blackberries as flashlights and trying to rationalize clues when we can't see the writing on the headstones at all.  We wander around for about an hour - me terrified and hobbling over the graves with my heels sinking into the ground and trying to counter-balance myself by walking on my tiptoes.  We searched every dead tree we could find but I didn't get the spice clue.  I thought I knew what I should be looking for, but I couldn't read any headstones and the "spittoon" was out of the question.  I simply couldn't find it.<br/>
<br/>
About this time, I had a song run through my head.  Do you remember Ray Stevens and his song Sittin' Up With the Dead (http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyLE6t1MxiY)?  That didn't help the situation much.<br/>
<br/>
I finally found the right spot and found Herman and Charlotte (though I'm still concerned their ghosts are unpleased that I stomped all over their graves and accidentally called them Sherman and Harlot).  I FOUND THE CIRCUS!  It was completely worth the 80 minutes I wandered in a cemetery at night.  I think I only suffered a mild heart attack.  And my stomach was knotted all the way to Athens.  I'm fairly certain I have an ulcer now.  Once I recover, the circus will be on its way again.  Whew.<br/>

<div>Congratulations, AndPlus2 and SalliMander!  I hate to 
admit it, but I've "dug around" in that cemetery by the light of a cell 
phone, too.  What a fun way to end a weekend!  -- Bell

<p>Whew. It's 11:38 p.m. and I'm finally home. Yesterday (was it really only 
  yesterday?) Sallimander and I traveled to Austin to attend a meeting today. We 
  were lucky enough to be able to drive down and attend the Day of the Dead BBQ. 
  Oh my goodness! Thank you so much, Bell Motel and Whiz Gee. You are awesome 
  hosts. We had the best time and the boxes you planted for the event are 
  amazing. It was so much fun. We were in Austin with a fellow teacher and her 
  husband. They asked several times where we ate dinner last night. How does one 
  explain to middle aged-ultra conservative people that you met some people 
  online but you don't know their real names, but you are going to their house 
  because they want to feed you dinner and send you into the woods to find 
  pieces of Tupperware? We said we ate grilled salmon at a local place but we 
  couldn't remember the name of it. :) Lame, huh? I just didn't expect them to 
  press the point and ask several times!<br/><br/>This morning we went to a really 
  great meeting. And that's not sarcastic. After, we decided to get one box 
  before heading out of Austin. I'm working toward gathering all of Boots Tex's 
  governor boxes and even though there is more than one in Austin, I really 
  wanted to go to Oakwood Cemetery. Beautiful carve, as usual. And we headed 
  back north (well, it's not a big detour to Lammes' candy store).<br/><br/>By 
  this time, it was 4:30ish and traffic was building. I've been hungry for a 
  steak and I thought we could easily find a Saltgrass somewhere north of 
  Austin. Alas, it was not to be. We pulled off in Salado and asked a local for 
  a recommendation. She suggested we stay out of Salado and eat at BJ's in 
  Temple so we continued north. After a delicious meal, I was checking my email 
  as we walked back to the car.<br/><br/>Lo and behold, we got the email about the 
  circus. Now, let me stop and say here that I'm a very scary person. As I read 
  the clues, I knew where to go (well, generally, as you'll discover). We 
  decided that this may be our only chance at the circus. We decided to at least 
  drive by. I certainly wasn't committing to getting out of my vehicle. Not at a 
  cemetery AT NIGHT! No way, Jose.<br/><br/>We pulled into Waco and to the Texas 
  Ranger Museum around 7:20. I was terrified circling the cemetery in the dark 
  safely locked in my car. Now, I grew up in cemeteries. That's what our family 
  does - we go cemetery trekking on Sunday afternoons. They are interesting 
  historical snapshots. We are, however, clearly out of the gates well before 
  dusk begins to set. And there I was in a cemetery at night. In the 
  dark.<br/><br/>So we get out. And start walking. There is a small gate with a 
  stone with a Confederate flag. We think we are in the right spot. It's dark, 
  remember, and I don't have a flashlight. I do, however, have my .38 Special 
  (though it wouldn't help against anything that I was currently afraid of). So 
  close your eyes and picture this. AndPlus2 and Sallimander (two extremely 
  NON-outdoorsy people) both dressed in business casual, me in my heels, 
  traipsing around the cemetery using our Blackberries as flashlights and trying 
  to rationalize clues when we can't see the writing on the headstones at all. 
  We wander around for about an hour - me terrified and hobbling over the graves 
  with my heels sinking into the ground and trying to counter-balance myself by 
  walking on my tiptoes. We searched every dead tree we could find but I didn't 
  get the spice clue. I thought I knew what I should be looking for, but I 
  couldn't read any headstones and the "spittoon" was out of the question. I 
  simply couldn't find it.<br/><br/>About this time, I had a song run through my 
  head. Do you remember Ray Stevens and his song Sittin' Up With the Dead (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RyLE6t1MxiY">http://www.youtube.<wbr/>com/watch?<wbr/>v=RyLE6t1MxiY</a>)? 
  That didn't help the situation much.<br/><br/>I finally found the right spot and 
  found Herman and Charlotte (though I'm still concerned their ghosts are 
  unpleased that I stomped all over their graves and accidentally called them 
  Sherman and Harlot). I FOUND THE CIRCUS! It was completely worth the 80 
  minutes I wandered in a cemetery at night. I think I only suffered a mild 
  heart attack. And my stomach was knotted all the way to Athens. I'm fairly 
  certain I have an ulcer now. Once I recover, the circus will be on its way 
  again. Whew.<br/><br/>Heather<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>
