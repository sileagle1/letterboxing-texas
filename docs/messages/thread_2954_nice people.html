</p><div>It really makes me happy to realize what nice people share this letterboxing game. I hid a box in Reno, NV when I was out there and had hopes of returning before now to check on it. But... life happens and I haven't made it back out there. I've received several emails from boxers recently who have found the box who informed me that the logbook was full and people had been stamping paper and leaving it in the box so the lid was barely closing on the box now. Tonight I received this nice message:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div class="header"><font color="#ff0000"><b>Subject</b>: Golden Bear, Reno, NV</font></div>
<div class="header"><font color="#ff0000">Hey, just sent you a message about this box and then saw that you were listed as living in Texas. If you would like me to, I can plant a new logbook for you in a new container (I have a slightly larger lock-n-lock with me) and mail you the other one. Or not. Whichever. But if you would like me to, I would need to do it quickly - we are leaving on Friday evening.<br/>The Wandering B's</font></div>
<div class="header"><font color="#ff0000"></font> </div>
<div class="header">Obviously, I jumped on that offer, but I just wanted to share this with the list, because they were so nice! Now THAT's what letterboxing is all about - people helping others maintain their boxes so they will be out there for a long time for others to find.</div>
