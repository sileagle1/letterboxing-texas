To have a famous Texan for an ancestor is very exciting.  I've thought about doing a King Fisher letterbox, but haven't gotten to that area yet, have you placed one in honor of your GGGrandfather?<br/>

Since you are a relative, you could probably get away with placing a letterbox inside the little metal fence over the grave.  That would be cool.  I'm a fifth generation Texan myself.  In fact, when King Fisher was born in Collin County, my GGGrandfather was building the Bethlehem Baptist Church north of Farmersville (see my letterbox Brother Ben).  Maybe he knew your GGGGrandfather, Job (or Jobe) Fisher.  I guess we could speculate forever about that.<br/>

              Since you are a relative, you could probably get away with
              placing a letterbox inside the little metal fence over the
              grave. That would be cool. I'm a fifth generation Texan
              myself. In fact, when King Fisher was born in Collin
              County, my GGGrandfather was building the Bethlehem
              Baptist Church north of Farmersville (see my letterbox
              Brother Ben). Maybe he knew your GGGGrandfather, Job (or
              Jobe) Fisher. I guess we could speculate forever about
              that.<br/>

              &gt; comes from my Dad's side, I think his grandmother was

              &gt; King Fisher. I don't have my family tree on this

              &gt; a while since i looked things up, but i grew up with

              &gt; me, WE are TEXANS and King Fisher was your relative
              and no matter what <br/>
              &gt; you read he didn't kill "that" many people...LOL I
              love that part! The <br/>
              &gt; Pendencia is where he had his ranch, I've found an
              old Texas map that <br/>
              &gt; has the Pendencia on it and want to order it one
              day...I love old Texas <br/>
              &gt; maps! We (the Family) are in possession of King
              Fisher's gun, the one <br/>
              &gt; that was on him when he was shot. I've always wanted
              try to tie my <br/>
              &gt; family history into my trail name but never have been
              creative enough to <br/>
              &gt; come up with a name and a stamp so I'm still in trail
              name limbo...and <br/>
              &gt; we've been letter-boxing for 5 yrs...although not
              actively all that time.<br/>
              &gt; Would love to do a box in King Fisher's honor, i even
              have a picture <br/>
              &gt; of him and was trying to carve it at one time but
              never finished....and <br/>
              &gt; I'd really want it to be planted close to his grave
              site and we don't <br/>
              &gt; get through that part of the country often...one day
