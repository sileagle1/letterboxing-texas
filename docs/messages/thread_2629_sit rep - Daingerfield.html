could have been there - hopefully next year!<br/>
<br/>
     I went to the Daingerfield State Park on Sunday, to hike and <br/>
search for the 9 boxes that JKC put there. <br/>
<br/>
     First I have to say that it was was a very enjoyable series.  <br/>
The park is nice and we really liked the trail around the lake.  The <br/>
walk was an easy one, relatively flat ground, nice path, and I liked <br/>
that there was also a path going back to the area of your car.  The <br/>
stamps were great.  And the smoldering ground, smoke, and soot make <br/>
things all that more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
    I believe that the park did a controlled burn, since some of the <br/>
trees had the needles, etc pulled away from their trunks and the <br/>
charred areas didn't cross the paths...  But I didn't get to ask at <br/>
the desk because they were closed when we were leaving.  Half of the <br/>
park was burned and a lot of areas still had places that were <br/>
smoldering.  <br/>
<br/>
     Sadly, some of the boxes were hit by this.  Danger, Heron, Bass, <br/>
and Grasshopper were fine (even though Grasshopper was in a burned <br/>
area).  Rattler and Armadillo were fine as far as the stamp and log.  <br/>
The boxes were slightly melted on one side.  They got new bags and <br/>
will have to be opened a little carefully.  Deer and Lizard were <br/>
definately melted.  I did not find Frog.  They had cleared around the <br/>
tree where it was hidden.  It might have been picked up or could be <br/>
in the area in what they raked - but that area was still smoldering <br/>
pretty badly, so I couldn't look very well.  GG will remain first AND <br/>
only finder on those :) - unless they get replaced... <br/>
<br/>
     So, in addition to marker fingers, I had some soot smudges here <br/>
and there, and looked like I really had a good time doing something <br/>
or had a bad time doing something, depending on what anyone may have <br/>
thought that I had been doing. :)  I think the soot on my backpack <br/>
might be there a while.<br/>
<br/>
     I hope some others get the opportunity to enjoy this park and <br/>
find these boxes.  JKC did a good job with them and I feel bad that <br/>
they had problems so quickly.  You might want to call ahead for a <br/>
fire report before making the drive out there, if this is something <br/>
the park does annually or something.  If we had gotten there a little <br/>
sooner, I don't think we would have been allowed in the area.<br/>
<br/>
     If this was a controlled burn, I wonder how often other parks do <br/>
this...?<br/>
<br/>
 ((A side note - for anyone who likes crawfish or cajun food - there <br/>
is a neat little place you can stop on your way out there if you are <br/>
going up from the south.  It is the Crawfish Shack.  It is in Big <br/>
Sandy on 155, after you cross over the Sabine bridge and the bridge <br/>
right after that.  It's on the right, across from the Industrial <br/>
Park. They are currently open 7 days a week.  It is a little stand <br/>
like they have at fairs, where you walk up to the window.  You can <br/>
get the food to go, or you can walk around the back, where they have <br/>
it tented in with picnic tables, heaters this time of year, a sink to <br/>
wash up in,...  There was a truck parked there also, that said Circle <br/>
M crawfish and had the number 903-360-8946.))<br/>
