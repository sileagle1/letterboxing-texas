I just got back from a weekend trip to Austin and had a blast.  I <br>
had some business down there on Sat., so went a day early to box my <br>
butt off.  Baby Bear's Waco box is in a beautiful location right by <br>
the river.  Then I found Silver Eagles Salado College.  If you <br>
haven't been there -it is very interesting that the town has just <br>
left these old ruins up on the hill there.  Had a couple of misses <br>
in Georgetown and Round Rock with missing boxes so went on to <br>
Austin.  Ginger Cat has done a great job of planting boxes by great <br>
places to throw back a pint or two! :)  Austin is such an <br>
interesting place and I used to just explore the campus and the <br>
capitol before I got into LB.  Now I discovered a "mountain" (Mt. <br>
Bonnell) that you can climb the 99 steps to the top for a stunning <br>
view of the river!  Silver Eagle's USA box also showed me a great <br>
natural spring pool I am going to have to take my kids swimming in <br>
next time at Barton Springs Pool.  Thanks to all who planted on the <br>
way to and in Austin for a great weekend.<br>
<br>
on a second note:  Welcome, Welcome, Welcome, to all you new <br>
boxers!  You have found a great "home" on this list for Texas <br>
boxers.  Unlike the big USA talklist, everyone here is encouraging, <br>
and very patient with new boxers (I was one myself back in August).  <br>
Enjoy your new hobby, and if you come to Arlington, feel free to <br>
plant until you drop! :)<br>
