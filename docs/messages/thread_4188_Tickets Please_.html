                    <div class="plaintext-content">    Wow! I had a house full of visitors this week. Stinky Monkey, Roarin' Lion and Baby Sister were all here. Lucy Locket decided to come down and spend some time with us and brought a bus load of people with her. I told her there wasn't much room left for visitors but we could manage for a couple of days. This was a very rambunctious group! They unloaded and spent a few nights just hanging out and having a little R&R before the bus headed back down the road. They were very glad to be in East Texas away from all the hustle and bustle of the big DFW metro area.<br>
      Alas, all good things must come to an end, so I loaded the bus and headed to Tyler. I told the riders that after all that rest, they needed a  little exercise. So,I made my way to the itersection of Cumberland Rd. and S. Broadway (hwy 69) and turned west. I followed the road around and made a left. Parking at the trailhead on the right, I took the rowdy group on a little hike. I followed the trail to a "Y" and went right. From the culvert farthest up the trail, I walked another 156 steps to an Oak tree on my right and looked left. The crew was getting hot and needed a rest so I took them about 22 steps off the path to a fallen tree to rest in the shade. They all climbed into the hollow end of the fallen tree for a nap. I wished them happy trails and headed back home to a very quiet house.<br>

I've been sitting on my phone waiting for the posting email ever since LL snatched that box just a couple of hours before I got there.  I got the email and raced out the door!  As our house is usually the one who hosts out of town guests, it's known in the family as The Hotel.  I can assure you, though, that no one has ever ever shown up before with the likes of these in tow!  Ghosts?  My house may never be the same again!<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <html><body><p>Hi Heather,<br/><br/>Well your first message DID eventually post, and it looks like you posted it about the time I saw the message that it had been hidden!<br/><br/>Lightning and I had just finished the daunting task of mowing our yard which had not been mowed in far too long since our lawnmower had been in for repairs for awhile- it was horribly thick and difficult to mow, and it proved to be quite a job, and I hurt my shoulder in the midst of it while trying to restart the mower with the pull cord (I hate those things!) so we rewarded ourselves with lunch at Lupe's. A nice big lunch with Cokes and everything. We returned home happy with our job, sluggish from our meal, and pleased to be almost cool and dry again. <br/>
<br/>And then I checked my email. And there was the message by Blue Butterfly. 11:51 was when it was sent. And it was 2:10-ish. A wedding we were to attend at 6:00. I calculated that to be roughly 2 hours 20 minutes of lost time on my part and 3 hours 50 minutes before we were to be dressed and clean and at the wedding. I was also contemplating an Urgent Care visit for my shoulder. Time was tight. <br/>
<br/>I looked to see if there was a post by you or Texas Dragonfly or even JBK or Maydelle Queen Bee to say the box had been retrieved, almost hoping there would be that message so I would know a trip to Tyler was unnecessary. There wasn't. I knew I had to make the trip on the off chance you were off studying and TX Dragonfly was out of town and JBK was working cows with her dad and MQB was on another mission of some sort. <br/>
<br/>I dragged my stinky, sweaty self back into the convertible, wishing I had the AC'd van but Fearless Fox was off in it. As I pointed myself toward Tyler, I called Fearless Fox to see if he was anywhere near an intercept course, but he was at the lake in the opposite direction. He offered that I could come to where he was and get the van, to which I told him (in my best DUH voice) "I'm going after the TOUR BUS. You KNOW I'm on a timeline. This is a RACE!" Translated - "That would be like stopping for coffee..." He's pretty quick and right away said "Oh - yeah - you'd better hurry." and hung up so as not to distract me while I made my way out of town.<br/>
<br/>And off I went. Now if you remember, this is the convertible I lovingly call Fearless Fox's Midlife Crisis. If you've ever seen it, you know it was a pretty sad midlife crisis. In fairness, he bought it from a buddy who needed cash so it wasn't exactly a midlife crisis. Not to say we don't have a good time with it, but as convertibles go, it's not much to look at. So anyway, I hit the highway and cranked up the music and was glad for the wind whipping through the car, further drying me off from the mowing extravaganza. <br/>
<br/>Now - I'm used to driving a mini-van. Mini-vans don't particularly drive fast unless you really make them, and besides that, in Police Officer World, mini-vans pretty much fly under the radar unless the driver is flagrantly mis-driving. I don't really tend to drive badly, and I really am not a speeder most the time either. But I was in the convertible. Convertibles, even homely ones, attract the attention of police officers. And this little convertible does like to fly. Add to that the fact that I had been telling myself "Hurry, hurry" for the last fifteen minutes or so, and you see where this is going. I got pulled over, having missed the reduced speed sign in my preoccupation to get where I was going. Geez...and again the mantra "This would be like stopping for coffee..." crossed my mind. Thankfully I had not walked out of the house without my day planner, which is where my driver's license lives. I almost did. The officer greeted me and we exchanged pleasantries and I gave him my license. As he wrote stuff down from it, I noticed his name. He had the same last name as a scoutmaster friend of mine, who happened also to graduate from my high school a couple of years ahead of me. I dropped the name. The officer smiled and acknowledged that was his dad, and we began the Exchanging of the Pedigree, as a friend of mine likes to call it. I tacked on my scouting credentials and he quit writing. He went back to his car and returned a few minutes later to say he had called his dad and got the a-okay on me and was going to give me a warning. Then he asked me where I was headed in such a hurry. I told him I was on my way to pick up some folks who had just gotten to Tyler on a bus. I did not lie. <br/>
<br/>And off I went. When I arrived at the trailhead, there were two cars there. I just knew I was on the heels of someone and that I might actually get to meet Heather or see one of the others on the trail. I contemplated leaving a quick note on the windshields to say something like "If you just got the LB, you're a turkey" or something along those lines, but I realized that would be freakish for a nonletterboxer to find that, which almost certainly one of them would have been so I didn't. As I walked the trail, I startled a deer on the trail. Again, I had a sense that I was too late - the deer appeared quite traumatized, as if it had just been assaulted by a wild bunch of hooligans. I found my way to the hiding spot very easily, took a deep breath and went in for the find. No box. I searched the ends of the three pieces of downed tree there, although it was quite obvious from the description which one it had been in. <br/>
<br/>At that point, I realized I had spent three hours sweating my rear end off in the yard, eaten a big meal, then immediately went back out into the heat - in the middle of the afternoon - for a hike - in the middle of July. For nothing. Now y'all know how I hate the heat. What was I doing???? I realized I had been uncontrollably drawn out of my AC'd house for this siren of the Texas LB world!<br/>
<br/>There was nothing to do but get back in the car and drive home, stopping off at the lake to tell Fearless Fox I had come up empty-handed. He seemed to be as bummed as I was. I eventually got back to the house and checked email, only to see that Heather's message was sent just minutes after I left the house. If only I had had this email address directed to my phone...that WILL change as I prepare to keep watch until it moves again.<br/>
<br/>Nice job, Heather, and congratulations on snagging the Bus! By the way, there was some poison ivy in the area, so you may want to scrub your ankles and hands with Tecnu or the anti-PI agent of your choice.<br/><br/>-- <br/>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm so sorry, but I did enjoy hearing your 
story.  I'm glad you didn't get a ticket.  I never have such 
luck.  My mother doesn't even get stopped ("They don't worry about old 
women in Cadillacs." - I bet if I drove it, I'd get stopped!  I love that 
you told him you were picking up people who just got into Tyler on a bus.  
That's just perfect!  I'm glad you didn't try to drop any names.  W. 
Nelson, K. Friedman, D. Crockett ... you might have been arrested for 
intoxication (or insanity!).</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Yeah, um, I didn't see the poison ivy.  I 
charged forth as soon as I got the email in my hideously mismatched t-shirt and 
stretchy shorts.  It was definitely a "come as you are" event.  I 
would have been mortified about two decades ago as we saw some nice looking guys 
on the trail exercising.  It's just that now they are all at least 15 years 
my junior and I didn't care - I was on a mission.  I rushed headfirst into 
the brush with no regards to anything poisonous.  I guess I'm ok since I'm 
not covered in rash today.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I'm sorry we didn't meet on the trail (after *I* 
had already retrieved the bus, of course!).  The one time we met (in 
Lindale) I didn't get to exchange with you.  It was a short boxing day with 
two grumpy girls on that trip.  Thanks for your story.<br/></font></div>

<p>Hi Heather,<br/><br/>Well your first message DID eventually post, and it 
  looks like you posted it about the time I saw the message that it had been 
  hidden!<br/><br/>Lightning and I had just finished the daunting task of mowing 
  our yard which had not been mowed in far too long since our lawnmower had been 
  in for repairs for awhile- it was horribly thick and difficult to mow, and it 
  proved to be quite a job, and I hurt my shoulder in the midst of it while 
  trying to restart the mower with the pull cord (I hate those things!) so we 
  rewarded ourselves with lunch at Lupe's.  A nice big lunch with Cokes and 
  everything.  We returned home happy with our job, sluggish from our meal, 
  and pleased to be almost cool and dry again.  <br/><br/>And then I checked 
  my email.  And there was the message by Blue Butterfly.  11:51 was 
  when it was sent.  And it was 2:10-ish. A wedding we were to attend at 
  6:00. I calculated that to be roughly 2 hours 20 minutes of lost time on my 
  part and 3 hours 50 minutes before we were to be dressed and clean and at the 
  wedding.  I was also contemplating an Urgent Care visit for my 
  shoulder.  Time was tight.  <br/><br/>I looked to see if there was a 
  post by you or Texas Dragonfly or even JBK or Maydelle Queen Bee to say the 
  box had been retrieved, almost hoping there would be that message so I would 
  know a trip to Tyler was unnecessary.  There wasn't.  I knew I had 
  to make the trip on the off chance you were off studying and TX Dragonfly was 
  out of town and JBK was working cows with her dad and MQB was on another 
  mission of some sort.  <br/><br/>I dragged my stinky, sweaty self back into 
  the convertible, wishing I had the AC'd van but Fearless Fox was off in 
  it.  As I pointed myself toward Tyler, I called Fearless Fox to see if he 
  was anywhere near an intercept course, but he was at the lake in the opposite 
  direction.  He offered that I could come to where he was and get the van, 
  to which I told him (in my best DUH voice) "I'm going after the TOUR 
  BUS.  You KNOW I'm on a timeline.  This is a RACE!"  Translated 
  - "That would be like stopping for coffee..."  He's pretty quick and 
  right away said "Oh - yeah - you'd better hurry." and hung up so as not to 
  distract me while I made my way out of town.<br/><br/>And off I went.  Now 
  if you remember, this is the convertible I lovingly call Fearless Fox's 
  Midlife Crisis.  If you've ever seen it, you know it was a pretty sad 
  midlife crisis.  In fairness, he bought it from a buddy who needed cash 
  so it wasn't exactly a midlife crisis.  Not to say we don't have a good 
  time with it, but as convertibles go, it's not much to look at.  So 
  anyway, I hit the highway and cranked up the music and was glad for the wind 
  whipping through the car, further drying me off from the mowing 
  extravaganza.  <br/><br/>Now - I'm used to driving a mini-van.  
  Mini-vans don't particularly drive fast unless you really make them, and 
  besides that, in Police Officer World, mini-vans pretty much fly under the 
  radar unless the driver is flagrantly mis-driving.  I don't really tend 
  to drive badly, and I really am not a speeder most the time either.  But 
  I was in the convertible.  Convertibles, even homely ones, attract the 
  attention of police officers.  And this little convertible does like to 
  fly.  Add to that the fact that I had been telling myself "Hurry, hurry" 
  for the last fifteen minutes or so, and you see where this is going.  I 
  got pulled over, having missed the reduced speed sign in my preoccupation to 
  get where I was going.  Geez...and again the mantra "This would be like 
  stopping for coffee..." crossed my mind.  Thankfully I had not walked out 
  of the house without my day planner, which is where my driver's license 
  lives.  I almost did.  The officer greeted me and we exchanged 
  pleasantries and I gave him my license.  As he wrote stuff down from it, 
  I noticed his name.  He had the same last name as a scoutmaster friend of 
  mine, who happened also to graduate from my high school a couple of years 
  ahead of me.  I dropped the name.  The officer smiled and 
  acknowledged that was his dad, and we began the Exchanging of the Pedigree, as 
  a friend of mine likes to call it.  I tacked on my scouting credentials 
  and he quit writing.  He went back to his car and returned a few minutes 
  later to say he had called his dad and got the a-okay on me and was going to 
  give me a warning.  Then he asked me where I was headed in such a 
  hurry.  I told him I was on my way to pick up some folks who had just 
  gotten to Tyler on a bus.  I did not lie.  <br/><br/>And off I 
  went.  When I arrived at the trailhead, there were two cars there.  
  I just knew I was on the heels of someone and that I might actually get to 
  meet Heather or see one of the others on the trail.  I contemplated 
  leaving a quick note on the windshields to say something like "If you just got 
  the LB, you're a turkey" or something along those lines, but I realized that 
  would be freakish for a nonletterboxer to find that, which almost certainly 
  one of them would have been so I didn't.  As I walked the trail, I 
  startled a deer on the trail.  Again, I had a sense that I was too late - 
  the deer appeared quite traumatized, as if it had just been assaulted by a 
  wild bunch of hooligans.  I found my way to the hiding spot very easily, 
  took a deep breath and went in for the find.  No box.  I searched 
  the ends of the three pieces of downed tree there, although it was quite

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just read about the TTB2 being dropped off in Tyler and I know exactly where it was hidden and I'm pretty sure that I could have gotten to it before &+2 but I'm out of town at the LBCON in St. Louis.  A little too far away to grab the bus but I'm having a great time here meeting Der Mad Stamper, Amanda from Seattle, Wassamatta u, and the Green Tortuga (also known as Ryan, the webmaster) just to name a few.  I am very humbled to be among these wonderful people.  We're not getting a lot of sleep but meeting all the boxers that are here (280+) and finding the wonderful boxes that are hidden here, and all of the exchanges has been an amazing experience. We even did some night boxing in a local cemetary near the UMSL campus where we are staying and Ryan was made up as a ghost and tryed scaring us as we walked through the grounds searching for letterboxes.  <br>
<br>
It's been a wonderful time even though I haven't had much sleep.  A group of us went on a sightseeing/letterboxing excursion on Friday and one of our stops was at the Gateway Arch.  Several boxers in the group rode the tram to the top of the Arch and the boxers that rode in the tram with actually exchange stamps while riding the to the top of the Arch.  The view from the top of the Arch is absolutely amazing.  <br>
<br>
A Big Congratulations to &+2 on finding the TTB2.  I will be watching to see where it lands next.<br>

  boxers in the group rode the tram to the top of the Arch and the boxers that 
  rode in the tram with actually exchange stamps while riding the to the top of 
  the Arch. The view from the top of the Arch is absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>A 
  Big Congratulations to &amp;+2 on finding the TTB2. I will be watching to see 
  where it lands next.<br/><br/>Mothers Love<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,

  Heather,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Well your first message DID eventually post, and it 
  looks like you posted it<br/>&gt; about the time I saw the message that it had 
  been hidden!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lightning and I had just finished the daunting 
  task of mowing our yard which<br/>&gt; had not been mowed in far too long since 
  our lawnmower had been in for<br/>&gt; repairs for awhile- it was horribly 
  thick and difficult to mow, and it<br/>&gt; proved to be quite a job, and I 
  hurt my shoulder in the midst of it while<br/>&gt; trying to restart the mower 
  with the pull cord (I hate those things!) so we<br/>&gt; rewarded ourselves 
  with lunch at Lupe's. A nice big lunch with Cokes and<br/>&gt; everything. We 
  returned home happy with our job, sluggish from our meal,<br/>&gt; and pleased 
  to be almost cool and dry again.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And then I checked my email. 
  And there was the message by Blue Butterfly.<br/>&gt; 11:51 was when it was 
  sent. And it was 2:10-ish. A wedding we were to<br/>&gt; attend at 6:00. I 
  calculated that to be roughly 2 hours 20 minutes of lost<br/>&gt; time on my 
  part and 3 hours 50 minutes before we were to be dressed and<br/>&gt; clean and 
  at the wedding. I was also contemplating an Urgent Care visit for<br/>&gt; my 
  shoulder. Time was tight.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I looked to see if there was a post 
  by you or Texas Dragonfly or even JBK or<br/>&gt; Maydelle Queen Bee to say the 
  box had been retrieved, almost hoping there<br/>&gt; would be that message so I 
  would know a trip to Tyler was unnecessary.<br/>&gt; There wasn't. I knew I had 
  to make the trip on the off chance you were off<br/>&gt; studying and TX 
  Dragonfly was out of town and JBK was working cows with her<br/>&gt; dad and 
  MQB was on another mission of some sort.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I dragged my stinky, 
  sweaty self back into the convertible, wishing I had<br/>&gt; the AC'd van but 
  Fearless Fox was off in it. As I pointed myself toward<br/>&gt; Tyler, I called 
  Fearless Fox to see if he was anywhere near an intercept<br/>&gt; course, but 
  he was at the lake in the opposite direction. He offered that I<br/>&gt; could 
  come to where he was and get the van, to which I told him (in my best<br/>&gt; 
  DUH voice) "I'm going after the TOUR BUS. You KNOW I'm on a timeline. 
  This<br/>&gt; is a RACE!" Translated - "That would be like stopping for 
  coffee..." He's<br/>&gt; pretty quick and right away said "Oh - yeah - you'd 
  better hurry." and hung<br/>&gt; up so as not to distract me while I made my 
  way out of town.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And off I went. Now if you remember, this is 
  the convertible I lovingly<br/>&gt; call Fearless Fox's Midlife Crisis. If 
  you've ever seen it, you know it was<br/>&gt; a pretty sad midlife crisis. In 
  fairness, he bought it from a buddy who<br/>&gt; needed cash so it wasn't 
  exactly a midlife crisis. Not to say we don't have<br/>&gt; a good time with 
  it, but as convertibles go, it's not much to look at. So<br/>&gt; anyway, I hit 
  the highway and cranked up the music and was glad for the wind<br/>&gt; 
  whipping through the car, further drying me off from the mowing<br/>&gt; 
  extravaganza.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now - I'm used to driving a mini-van. Mini-vans 
  don't particularly drive<br/>&gt; fast unless you really make them, and besides 
  that, in Police Officer World,<br/>&gt; mini-vans pretty much fly under the 
  radar unless the driver is flagrantly<br/>&gt; mis-driving. I don't really tend 
  to drive badly, and I really am not a<br/>&gt; speeder most the time either. 
  But I was in the convertible. Convertibles,<br/>&gt; even homely ones, attract 
  the attention of police officers. And this little<br/>&gt; convertible does 
  like to fly. Add to that the fact that I had been telling<br/>&gt; myself 
  "Hurry, hurry" for the last fifteen minutes or so, and you see where<br/>&gt; 
  this is going. I got pulled over, having missed the reduced speed sign 
  in<br/>&gt; my preoccupation to get where I was going. Geez...and again the 
  mantra<br/>&gt; "This would be like stopping for coffee..." crossed my mind. 
  Thankfully I<br/>&gt; had not walked out of the house without my day planner, 
  which is where my<br/>&gt; driver's license lives. I almost did. The officer 
  greeted me and we<br/>&gt; exchanged pleasantries and I gave him my license. As 
  he wrote stuff down<br/>&gt; from it, I noticed his name. He had the same last 
  name as a scoutmaster<br/>&gt; friend of mine, who happened also to graduate 
  from my high school a couple<br/>&gt; of years ahead of me. I dropped the name. 
  The officer smiled and<br/>&gt; acknowledged that was his dad, and we began the 
  Exchanging of the Pedigree,<br/>&gt; as a friend of mine likes to call it. I 
  tacked on my scouting credentials<br/>&gt; and he quit writing. He went back to 
  his car and returned a few minutes<br/>&gt; later to say he had called his dad 
  and got the a-okay on me and was going to<br/>&gt; give me a warning. Then he 
  asked me where I was headed in such a hurry. I<br/>&gt; told him I was on my 
  way to pick up some folks who had just gotten to Tyler<br/>&gt; on a bus. I did 
  not lie.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And off I went. When I arrived at the trailhead, 
  there were two cars<br/>&gt; there. I just knew I was on the heels of someone 
  and that I might actually<br/>&gt; get to meet Heather or see one of the others 
  on the trail. I contemplated<br/>&gt; leaving a quick note on the windshields 
  to say something like "If you just<br/>&gt; got the LB, you're a turkey" or 
  something along those lines, but I realized<br/>&gt; that would be freakish for 
  a nonletterboxer to find that, which almost<br/>&gt; certainly one of them 
  would have been so I didn't. As I walked the trail, I<br/>&gt; startled a deer 
  on the trail. Again, I had a sense that I was too late -<br/>&gt; the deer 
  appeared quite traumatized, as if it had just been assaulted by a<br/>&gt; wild 
  bunch of hooligans. I found my way to the hiding spot very easily,<br/>&gt; 
  took a deep breath and went in for the find. No box. I searched the 
  ends<br/>&gt; of the three pieces of downed tree there, although it was quite 
  obvious from<br/>&gt; the description which one it had been in.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; At that point, I realized I had spent three hours sweating my rear 
  end off<br/>&gt; in the yard, eaten a big meal, then immediately went back out 
  into the heat<br/>&gt; - in the middle of the afternoon - for a hike - in the 
  middle of July. For<br/>&gt; nothing. Now y'all know how I hate the heat. What 
  was I doing???? I<br/>&gt; realized I had been uncontrollably drawn out of my 
  AC'd house for this siren<br/>&gt; of the Texas LB world!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  There was nothing to do but get back in the car and drive home, stopping 
  off<br/>&gt; at the lake to tell Fearless Fox I had come up empty-handed. He 
  seemed to<br/>&gt; be as bummed as I was. I eventually got back to the house 
  and checked<br/>&gt; email, only to see that Heather's message was sent just 
  minutes after I left<br/>&gt; the house. If only I had had this email address 
  directed to my phone...that<br/>&gt; WILL change as I prepare to keep watch 
  until it moves again.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Nice job, Heather, and congratulations 
  on snagging the Bus! By the way,<br/>&gt; there was some poison ivy in the 
  area, so you may want to scrub your ankles<br/>&gt; and hands with Tecnu or the 
  anti-PI agent of your choice.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot

<br/>The PI wasn't very high and it wasn't right at the mouth of the log, so you're probably okay unless you wore sandals. I don't usually get the itch until two or three days later, after I notice a raised red patch that gets a little rough, then the itch starts. I usually just scrub with Tecnu if I see PI, just to make sure. <br/>
