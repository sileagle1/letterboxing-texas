gathering.   Many of you we don't know very well, so we're thrilled to<br>
have so many new faces. We started playing around with some of the<br>
attendees and decided that:<br>
<br>
I hope the Tulip Mania Family can chat with Blooming Flowers.<br>
We'll put Queen Beeloved next to BusyBeesFamily, or is that too many<br>
queen bees? <br>
Perhaps strawberry & the peas will hit it off.<br>
Will LionsMane and Celtic Lions clash or roar in tandem?<br>
I guess Lucy can go Barefoot in the Sandibox.<br>
We need a hammock for Onslow.  (although he might like cozy chair<br>
books, the telly is really more his style).<br>
<br>
We're planning in earnest now. . .and look forward to seeing you all.<br>

<div> </div>
<div>My head is spinning at the moment trying to come up with a PT and finish my box for y'all (and then there's the perennial scout stuff), and yet you come up with a SEATING CHART?  How do y'all do it?  LOL</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All kidding aside, it does seem there will be a lot of newbies there, and I would like to let them particularly know we are looking forward to meeting up with them.  Please realize these gatherings are great opportunities to learn a lot about letterboxing, as well as get a very large dollop of boxes all at one time!  This will be a good chance to see boxers doing what boxers do, as well as a chance to add your own flare to it.

This will be my first, obviously, as I'm only been boxin' for almost 2 months now. I'm not even stressing how many boxes we find that weekend.
