                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning, guys!<br>
There's an offer for Mid-Atlantic Letterboxing T-shirts on the LbNA list<br>
and that made me wonder if we have Texas T-shirts with the state-shaped<br>
logo? I've poked around a bit, but was not able to find the answer.<br>
If we don't have Texas Letterboxing shirts, I'd be happy to try to get<br>
some made & take orders. I live in the Dallas area and know of a place<br>
where we've made reasonably-priced shirts for various teams I coach.<br>
Anybody interested?<br>
