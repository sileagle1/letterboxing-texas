so, one good enough for Geocaching.  I think my first GPS was like $119

me.  I know other folks who are still using that model and are happy with 
it.</span></div>

It's amazing how you can live in a city for 10 years and not know that there is a wildlife reserve just a few miles away. Talk about boring. The funny thing is, I didn't know how boring it was till my eyes were opened with lb'g, lol.<br/><br/>Janet, BF<br/><br/><b><i>Christine Auger Velez &lt;christineauger@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hi there everyone!  I'm Chrispy, mama to Nutcracker and Mono, and wife to Avion.  My little ones are still very little, so we are restricted to
