                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have not been participating on this List much lately because of real <br/>
life and even some letterboxing, but it feels like there is a dark <br/>
cloud hanging over us.  Some people are being overly sensitive to <br/>
opinions being expressed, or maybe words are being misinterpreted and <br/>
tempers are flaring.  This has all the symptoms of cabin fever.  We are <br/>
like a big family that has been couped up together too long and just <br/>
need a break.  I suggest everyone take a few days off from the List and <br/>
go do something fun, like letterboxing.  Then when you come back, <br/>
hopefully everyone will be refreshed and excited to tell about their <br/>
adventures.  This does not mean we have to stop talking about sensitive <br/>
subjects or express opinions.  I just think we will be better able to <br/>
handle them with a fresh outlook.  So get out there and do what <br/>
letterboxing is really about:  enjoying the great outdoors!<br/>

<div>Well, SE, today Puddle Splasher and I did just as you advised, never mind 
that we didn't read this posting until now.  We spent a wonderful day 
outdoors playing in the parks, woods, trails, and finding some great 
letterboxes!  First, even though she'd already located all these 
previously, PS accompanied me on a search for Stargazer's Safari Series at 
several parks around the shores of Lake Worth, and we found 3 of the 4 (sadly, 
one has gone missing - boo hoo!  They're all beautiful stamps as we've come 
to expect from Stargazer).  Then we made the loop west around FW to the 
south side and explored several pretty little neighborhood parks north and south 
of I 20, and found more of Stargazer's and/or PEAS' Endangered Species 
series, also discovering in the process: </div>
<div>a.  We're both out of shape when it comes to huffing and puffing up a 
steep path to a hilltop, but ...</div>
<div>b.  The view from the summit was spectacular! (in Oakmont Park, 
finding Kangaroo Rat.)  And we found a HH there that made that extra-heavy 
breathing effort even more worthwhile.  Neither of us had ever known that 
hill existed!  Great discovery!</div>
<div>We also found a couple of PEAS National Park Series (and a bonus!) to round 
off our afternoon before we committed ourselves to the evening traffic flow 
going home.</div>
<div>So today was a great letterboxing day for both of us, and thanks to the 
placers who created those lovely boxes and put them there for us to discover, 
taking us to new and previously unknown pockets of the metroplex!  We 
figure we still have several days' worth of letterboxing to do just to find the 
rest of the letterboxes in our local vicinity, and by the time we find those, 
who knows how many more new ones there will be waiting to be discovered!  I 
foresee regular letterboxing adventures on throughout the new year!  </div>

I forgot to mention that we visited the PEAS' Scrapyard today, too, <br/>
and what a clever and fun box that is!  FIVE stamps, all from scraps, <br/>
inspired (and partly carved) by the PEAS' son (youngest family <br/>
member, maybe?) - Nice walk in the park, good location, but the <br/>
stamps and the cleverness of the idea for this box was what we both <br/>
enjoyed about it!  Thanks, PEAS. -- Viewfinder<br/>
