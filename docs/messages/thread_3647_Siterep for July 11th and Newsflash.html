                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maydelle Queen Bee and I decided that it was time for us to finally <br/>
go boxing together.  So we started out in Rusk at around 11 am and <br/>
headed for Turnertown, where I wanted to place my new box "Honky <br/>
Tonk Blues."  While we were looking for a place to plant the box, I <br/>
realized that we were at the location of the "Joe Roughneck" box, so <br/>
we decided that MQB should go ahead and get it, since I already had <br/>
it.  Found the box with no problem and went back to Turnertown, <br/>
where we finally had success in placing my box.  We then went to New <br/>
London for MQB to pick up the box there, and then we headed to <br/>
Kilgore.  I placed 4 new boxes in Kilgore and then we went to <br/>
Danville and tried to locate the Danville Cemetery to place another <br/>
box.  Well between my GPS (Gertie) and a book that I had about the <br/>
cemetery, we were having a hard time finding this cemetery.  So, MQB <br/>
was able to Google it on her phone, and we finally managed to get to <br/>
the Danville Cemetery.  The next challenge was trying to find the <br/>
headstone for Karen Silkwood, who was the inspiration for the box.  <br/>
Again, MQB came through with her phone/computer and we finally found <br/>
it and placed the box.  Next we went to Synergy Park and picked up <br/>
the 3 boxes there.  If you have never been to this park, I highly <br/>
recommend it.  It is so peaceful.  We then drove to Kilgore and <br/>
started with the Build a Doll Series and Race Car.  The clue states <br/>
that it is a 1 mile trip...little did we know that it meant 1 mile <br/>
one way...which then made it a two mile walk.  We did manage to find <br/>
all the boxes and it was a great series, and we were the first <br/>
finders for Race Car, so I let MQB keep the prize for that one.  <br/>
However after the 2 1/2 mile hike (after finding Race Car) we headed <br/>
back to the car and decided that we needed an Icee break.  If you <br/>
are ever hot and tired while letterboxing, let me tell you that <br/>
Icees are great.  They have a way of cooling you off and giving you <br/>
a little pep.  We realized while MQB was stamping in at the Doll <br/>
Series that she had hit her 100 mark, which is a great feeling.  <br/>
After the Icee we went and picked up the Spring Series by <br/>
frogkisses.  While we were getting the Spring Series, we did notice <br/>
a squirrel who was climbing down a vine to a creek and getting <br/>
water.  This was such a cute sight.  This is a really nice series <br/>
also.  At that point, I realized that I only needed 1 more box to <br/>
have my 700th find.  So we proceeded to Old Tyme Mill by Blue <br/>
Butterfly and I got my 700th find.  Well after all the walks, we <br/>
decided to call it a day and head home.  We got home around 9 pm, <br/>
tired and out of energy.  We had a great time, and MQB, when are we <br/>
going out again???<br/>
<br/>
JBK boxes placed - 6<br/>
JBK boxes found - 13<br/>
MQB boxes found - 23<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
*******NEWSFLASH*******<br/>
Out of staters beware...it appears that a certain letterboxer, who <br/>
in his years of boxing had never left the state of Texas to box, has <br/>
recently been discovered crossing state lines to box.  One Gryzzled <br/>
Gryphon, headed into Oklahoma where he finally located 3 boxes in <br/>
Hugo and 1 in Frogville.  Who knows where he might head to next?????<br/>
