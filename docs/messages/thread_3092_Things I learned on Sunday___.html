                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sunday, DH had about 5 minutes of work to do at the office, so he<br/>
suggested that we have breakfast up there and then do some lbing.  I<br/>
thought this was a great plan, mostly because I spent 4 hours on<br/>
Saturday playing a video game.  Not sure what the guys did.  This was<br/>
our first real lbing trip as a family.  Boy, did I ever learn some<br/>
valuable lessons.<br/>
<br/>
1- DH and I should NEVER attempt any home improvement project that<br/>
will take more than 3 hours.  EVER.  There is no way it will end with<br/>
two living adults.<br/>
<br/>
2- There was a reason that we bought a car with a navigation system.<br/>
<br/>
3- Letterboxing with navigation feels like cheating.  But you are more<br/>
likely to have an intact family afterwards.<br/>
<br/>
4- Even when you own a navigation system, make sure you print some<br/>
sort of map for the child in the car seat.  It doesn't matter if he<br/>
can see exactly where you are on the navigation screen, he's still<br/>
going to badger you with questions.  Budget rental car maps from out<br/>
of state work fine until they start reading.  <br/>
<br/>
5- If you are navigator, make sure you read EVERY line on the clue,<br/>
out loud, twice.  Even if you accidently find yourself in the right<br/>
place, skipping 3 lines on the clue.  Trust me on this one.<br/>
<br/>
6- Avoid cemetery boxes when with DH.  He gets the willies and gets<br/>
moody.  Or at least make sure you don't go to three in a row.<br/>
<br/>
7- Over plan your route.  Just having a pile of clues in the same area<br/>
may work fine when you are in charge and lbing with a 5 year old, but<br/>
it's not going to work with a LSS.  Know exactly where you want to go<br/>
next.  If you can get exact directions (road, not clue) between boxes,<br/>
you could save a life.<br/>
<br/>
8- Always make spouse program the address of the next box into the<br/>
navigation system BEFORE moving the car.  Or you are going to hear<br/>
constant whining about not knowing where he is going for the next 5<br/>
minutes as you drive the two miles to the next park. (And we didn't<br/>
even turn!)<br/>
<br/>
9- When faced with a number of boxes near each other that require<br/>
walking, make sure you don't start with the one near the nifty<br/>
playground.  Because the 5 year old will barter boxes for playground time.<br/>
<br/>
We actually had fun, though it was a little warm from us.  We hit 5<br/>
locations and found 2 boxes.  I will make very different choices about<br/>
any other treasure hunting adventures we plan with DH.  More nature<br/>
walks, less headstones.  He did take the camera out of the car a<br/>
couple of times, so it wasn't a complete loss for him.  I do<br/>
understand why my mother printed 3 copies of all the boxes in VT. <br/>
Because there is no way my parents could survive a letterboxing<br/>
adventure sharing.  <br/>
<br/>
As a side note, DH did tell me that I am banned from printing clues. <br/>
I have a binder with local clues in it.  After we find the box, I take<br/>
the clue out.  Well, the binder is very full.  If I want to print any<br/>
more, they have to be within 10 minutes of the house or school, we<br/>
have to be going on a trip out of DFW or I have to find about 15 boxes<br/>
and remove those clues.  Z is viewing this as a change.  We have a 1pm<br/>
dismissal on Friday and he wants to hit at least 2 boxes.  Then there<br/>
is the 4 day weekend next week.  He thinks we could easily pick up 110<br/>
in 4 days, because that is as high as he can count.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Don't get me wrong.  I think navigation systems are WONDERFUL.  DH can<br/>
be driving directly into the sun at 8am and swear that we are going<br/>
West.  It just felt like cheating.  Mostly because all the other boxes<br/>
I've done have been close by and I haven't needed a map to get to my<br/>
starting point.<br/>
<br/>
But I was raised with a man that over over planned EVERYTHING with<br/>
maps.  When I was looking at colleges, he spent 3 weeks planning the<br/>
route that we needed to take.  He bought a map of New York and<br/>
highlighter the route for us, plus two side trips that we might want<br/>
to take.  Of course, he wasn't going with us, so the first thing my<br/>
mother did after leaving the house was stop at her best friend's house<br/>
so we could ditch all the maps.  We were gone for a week and had an<br/>
absolute blast.  I think we used a little map on the back of a hotel<br/>
brochure once to get somewhere.<br/>
<br/>
I agree that navigations systems are just another item that we can use<br/>
to keep us safe, but the first time using it made me feel like I was<br/>
missing something.<br/>

&gt; I strongly disagree.  If you are traveling and have a limited time<br/>
to spend<br/>
&gt; - using the GPS to help you route from one box to another only makes<br/>
sense.<br/>
&gt; It is easy to get lost in strange areas, and trying to navigate can<br/>
even get<br/>
&gt; you into an accident.  But that gentle voice on the GPS saying "In<br/>
point two<br/>
&gt; miles turn left on highway 28" just makes LBing safer.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; And SAFER gets you home!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I couldn't believe any letterboxers on this list would call<br/>
something that<br/>
&gt; makes LBing safer cheating.<br/>

&gt; After SJZ's and my post-Thanksgiving letterboxing foray to Dallas, I<br/>
&gt; couldn't agree more!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SJZ is a lot of things, but she is NOT a navigator.  After spending<br/>
&gt; 2.5hours on Plano Parkway and another combined 3 hours on the tollway,<br/>
&gt; I was<br/>
&gt; wishing for a navigation system.  Heck - I was wishing for a donkey<br/>
with a<br/>
&gt; sense of direction.  And to compound matters, we had agreed that we<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; stop at every Starbucks we passed that weekend, so extra road time meant<br/>
&gt; extra coffee stops.  After realizing we had already BEEN to the same<br/>
&gt; Starbucks at least once before, we decided we would only stop at every<br/>
&gt; different Starbucks from then on.  It was a very expensive, very<br/>
&gt; nervous weekend by the time we factored in all that coffee!<br/>
