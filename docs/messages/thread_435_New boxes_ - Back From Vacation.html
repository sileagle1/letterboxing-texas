Yep, I managed to place one during my recent vacation.<br/>
This was the first box I have created that I did not<br/>
know where it was going to be placed ahead of time since<br/>
the vacation destination was a surprise from my wife.  All<br/>
she would say is that it would be tropical, so the stamp<br/>
is at least appropriate.<br/>
Now if I can just find the time to find all the new<br/>
local boxes.  Ya'll were busy while I was gone!<br/>

could really get excited about a Texas gathering in Belize!<br/>
