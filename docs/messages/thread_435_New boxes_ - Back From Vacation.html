Yep, I managed to place one during my recent vacation.<br>
This was the first box I have created that I did not<br>
know where it was going to be placed ahead of time since<br>
the vacation destination was a surprise from my wife.  All<br>
she would say is that it would be tropical, so the stamp<br>
is at least appropriate.<br>
Now if I can just find the time to find all the new<br>
local boxes.  Ya'll were busy while I was gone!<br>

After a lovely but somewhat chilly, rainy weekend camping at Lake Texoma, I<br>
could really get excited about a Texas gathering in Belize!<br>
(Have you ever been really soaking wet & had to pack up the tents to drive<br>
home??? I'm still not warm!)<br>
