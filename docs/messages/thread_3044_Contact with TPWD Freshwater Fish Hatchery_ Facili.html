I have several successful letterbox/geocache hybrids in the park.  I <br>
would be willing to list them for you.  And - with permission - give <br>
out the contact info for the local rangers supporting it.<br>
<br>
In fact, list mine - and the others in the park.  Only about 1/2 of <br>
what is in the park is mine.<br>
