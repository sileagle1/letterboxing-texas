                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here are some instructions I copied and filed away a looong time <br>
ago. This was from Sir Balthazar on the big list:<br>
<br>
Fake Rock Making <br>
<br>
My material of choice is Amaco Sculptamold Modeling Compound. Three <br>
pounds of it is about $5 + tax. Three pounds makes lots of rocks! It <br>
sets up in about 30 minutes and is very nicely hard after a day. <br>
<br>
I am now mixing craft paint in with the wet material as I mold it so <br>
the color goes through the entire "rock". Choose colors from your <br>
area. Grey and black mottling can be very persuasive as just a <br>
concrete lump. <br>
<br>
I mold the material around a film canister or food container <br>
(T*pperware). I put the lid side down on the container so it can be <br>
opened later. Sometimes I have to scrape away a little of the <br>
material if it has overlapped the lid. No problem, the stuff can be <br>
carved and sanded. <br>
<br>
After it is thoroughly dry, I spray the rock with at least two coats <br>
of clear, matte-finish sealer. <br>
<br>
I have recently purchased a product from the hardware store that <br>
shows lots of promise: premixed "Flexall" flexible all-purpose <br>
filler. It is water-proof and stays tacky for a couple hours. That <br>
is long enough to dribble sand on the surface. The color is a slate <br>
gray. It sets up pretty hard after a day. Not a bad thought to coat <br>
the outside of the Amaco plaster stuff as a last sealant against <br>
water. <br>
<br>
More thoughts on this: Steve Rayvenhaus says he is experimenting <br>
with Liquid Nails and twigs. I got some of the Liquid Nails and want <br>
to get some pea-gravel to glue to the food containers, too. <br>
<br>
I have also used oven-hardening clay. It is pretty much okay as it <br>
is but I have sprayed it with a spackled rock paint and again, folks <br>
look right past them. One is in a very high traffic downtown <br>
location and has remained safe there, much to my surprise. Again, <br>
waterproof these babies. <br>
<br>
 I think you would be surprised at how brazen one can be with a fake <br>
rock. Folks see what they think should be there, not what is truly <br>
there. Heck, with fake rocks, hollow rocks, Liquid Nails and twigs, <br>
we could make whole centerpieces in which to hide letterboxes. <br>
<br>
Now a small caveat: my Amaco rocks are pretty lightweight. They have <br>
also not yet gone through a California winter. You might have to use <br>
more sealant for your area, maybe even put some real rocks glued <br>
together with it to give it weight. I don't know. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm glad that was the set of instructions that you needed. I hadn't <br>
been on the big list in over a year - maybe two? - until I started <br>
reading a little here and there in the last few weeks. I think Sir B. <br>
was one of the ones way back when, who got fed up with the constant <br>
nastiness. Isn't there a northwestern U.S. list? He may be active on <br>
that one. <br>
