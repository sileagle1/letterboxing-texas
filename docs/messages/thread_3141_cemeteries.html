had to jump in on the cemetery thread.<br>
<br>
I volunteer to catalog cemeteries.  I make a list of<br>
all the headstones/markers in a certain cemetery in<br>
row order including the names, dates and anything that<br>
is on the headstones.  I type it up and send it to the<br>
local genealogical society and they in turn post it to<br>
their GenWeb website.  They post them by alphabetical<br>
order. So if you see a listing on a GenWeb website and<br>
it shows the person who cataloged the cemetery I would<br>
suggest contacting them to see if they recorded it by<br>
rows or not.  If they did they should be able to tell<br>
you by looking at their notes exactly where to find<br>
the grave.<br>
<br>
Happy Trails!!<br>
