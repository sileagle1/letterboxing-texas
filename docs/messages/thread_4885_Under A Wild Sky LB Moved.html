I wouldn't resort to "an eye for an eye" because, after all, they know where your box is hidden.  But, the cache could perhaps be moved and the placer notified of the new coordinates. Or, would that be considered "an eye for an eye"?  Silver Eagle has exhibited remarkable restraint.  Even if a "newbie" geocacher had never heard of letterboxing, don't you think that, upon finding one, common sense would kick in?<br>

<div><font size="2">Glad to hear the geocacher realized that his original actions were unsportsmanlike, and corrected them. Of course, anyone who knows me knows I was just kidding about the geocache "going missing", because that's obviously just as unsportmanlike. Still, who thinks like that? "Oh there's a box already located in the spot where I want to place mine, so I'll just move it?" Interesting. Since Viewfinder actually had a similar thing happen to one of her boxes about five years ago, it became part of our Texas Letterboxing vernacular: someone had placed a "big honking geocache" right on top of her letterbox. When she contacted them, they refused to move it. As a letterboxing community, we were all up in arms. But that was then, this is now.</font></div>

Of course, anyone who knows me knows I was just kidding about the geocache "going missing", because that's obviously just as unsportmanlike. Still, who thinks like that? "Oh there's a box already located in the spot where I want to place mine, so I'll just move it?" Interesting. Since Viewfinder actually had a similar thing happen to one of her boxes about five years ago, it became part of our Texas Letterboxing vernacular: someone had placed a "big honking geocache" right on top of her letterbox. When she contacted them, they refused to move it. As a letterboxing community, we were all up in arms. But that was then, this is now.</span><o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Puddle Splasher</span><o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>

<div><font color="black" face="arial" size="2">I <u><em>was</em></u> trying to restrain myself, but since PuddleSplasher brought it up anyway... I still burn over that geocache-letterbox incident to which she referred.  My little letterbox had been well-hidden in its location for a couple of years at the time (a very small and personally-meaningful letterbox in a really good location, by the way, not that it matters).. and I discovered that great honkin' geocache planted right on <u>top</u> of my little letterbox -- and I do mean great honkin' -- it was about the size of a double-shoebox, bright plastic, highy visible even from a distance, nothing subtle about it nor its placement).  I did contact the placer and let him know I already had a small letterbox in that exact place and asked him to please move his letterbox at least a short distance away, not in the precise same location as my letterbox, and the response was: move your letterbox; my geocache stays.  And while I fumed about it, the Great Honker consumed my little letterbox, literally swallowed it right up (I guess Great Honkers eat Lesser Honkers).  Well, that is, when I did go to move the letterbox to protect it, I discovered my logbook inside the geocache box, but of course the stamp was gone, apparently as a "prize" for a geocacher.  So that little box was never replaced.  And I still burn to think of the absolute rudeness of the geocacher, who clearly didn't know how to play his game either.  Good to hear your experience was at least a little more friendly even if it was still (in the words of Tommy Lee Jones) "what I consider Rude Behavior!"  </font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did post a note to the National Group since I thought more Letterboxers that also Geocache might see it and respond, which they did.  This note is a follow up just to the TX Group since the Cacher decided NOT to move the cache but move my box, thus requiring new directions that I figured the National Group would not care about.  Even though I'm not happy about losing my original spot, I am glad to at least have a chance to retrieve the box.  Now I just have to get to it before a Geocacher takes the stamp since it is still in the area of the Geocache.  If only their game did not involve taking things from the box we could all get along much better, assuming everyone has a basic set of good manners.<br>
