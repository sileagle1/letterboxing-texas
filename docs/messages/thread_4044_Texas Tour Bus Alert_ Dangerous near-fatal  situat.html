                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a leisurely morning of Easter egg hunts and candy consumption, Trainboy, Munchkin & I dropped off Dinoguy and Fixitman at home and went on a moose hunt. As we started down the trail there was such a racket coming from one of the other paths that we took a detour to see what all the noise was and found a bunch of rowdy rascals hanging around a broken down bus. <br>
<br>
Noticing what a predicament they were in I offered to tow them home and have Fixitman help them with their engine troubles. They jumped at the offer and while we went on a moose hunt those rascals decided to try spit shining my truck. <br>
<br>
Now I have a truck covered in saliva and a horde of extra guests for Easter dinner tomorrow. Guess I'll have to go to the store and buy a larger ham!<br>

Cheers and kudos, ALLyall! Have fun.<br>
