<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="890052611-06092007">Welcome to the group.  I am Mike in El Paso, the lone 
far-west Texas Letterboxer.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="890052611-06092007">I have fond memories of Shreveport, for the few short hours 
that it was.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="890052611-06092007">I had been on special assignment to Redstone Arsenal in 
Alabama for about 45 days when Gulf War-I started on 2 Aug 1990.  Soldiers 
from my unit had deployed by 6 aug 1990.  I was ordered to complete my 
present mission before returning.</span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">I 
had driven from Ft. Bliss to Redstone Arsenal, so on 1 Oct 1990 I loaded up my 
gear.  Then drove to the Huntsville airport to pick up my wife.  
Knowing I only had a little time before deploying into combat - she flew down to 
make the trip back with me.</span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">Being a soldier meant being broke.  So the first night we made 
Vicksburg MS, parked the van on the east side of the Mississippi River, and with 
a loaded gun under my hand we caught a few hours sleep in the 
van.</span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">Next 
day was a hard push, I wanted to make Dublin Texas - when a retired Warrant 
Officer and friend would put us up overnight.  But about Shreveport we got 
hungry.  </span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">Somewhere on the west side of town, on the north side of I-20, we found a 
place to eat.  I wish I could remember the name.  We selected cheap 
things from the menu and placed our order.</span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">Soon 
the food started to arrive.  But it was not what we ordered.  I said 
so to the waitress.  She called the manager.  He explained to us that 
he noticed the military sticker and gear in the van, and the waitress told him 
we were very price conscious.  So he re-placed our order.  On 
him.  I am still speechless today.</span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">My 
friends tell me I was home for two weeks before leaving again.  I remember 
about two days of it.  All to soon I was in it.  Although assigned to 
an Ordinance Corps unit, I ended up seeing combat with 24th ID (mech) of the 
18th Airborne Corp.  I guess I was good enough - I made it 
home.</span></div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="890052611-06092007">Anyway - welcome to the group.  Come visit El Paso - 8 Letterboxes 
served.</span></div>

Of course we explained to Cassie why they were all dressed alike. When the soldiers got up to leave, they asked for their check and the waitress said that the couple had already got it.

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007">It was a tough trip.  How do you act normal when you 
know what you are headed for is not normal.  On top of that - my wife knows 
me.  I never said "Go do that".  I always said "Follow me, we are 
going to do that".  You lead from the front.  She knew what was going 
to happen, just as I some nights sit and cry (yes - some men do cry) for my son 
James.  Ya gotta know that I know every detail of what he does, because I 
did it myself.  We talk about the same things now that I thought about when 
I was taking my turn.  Only he gets newer and neater toys 
now.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007">The worst of it on the home front was the SCUD that hit the 
barracks in Saudi.  My wife saw the reports on TV, and saw them dragging 
out a body that looked like me.  I was far north by that time, but I had 
been living there weeks earlier.  It was a few days before she got word 
that I was safe.  God bless whoever called her, I still don't know who it 
was.  I cannot imagine what she went through.  She never talks about 
it, my son told me.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007">I understand your Papa.  I feel it 
too.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007">If you get the chance, read Into the Storm by Tom Clancy 
and Fred Franks.  I was with the 18th Airborne Corps, 24th Infantry 
division - mechanized.  My vehicle was destroyed just outside the city 
limits in the fight with the republican guard at As Salman.  I would have 
lost my legs if it wasn't for the extra sand bags we packed in.  That is a 
story in itself.  &lt;grin&gt;</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="765413611-07092007">Well - y-all have a great day.  And whenever you get 
the chance, THANK A SOLDIER.  Today's soldiers join KNOWING they will 
fight.  And the hardships never get easier.</span></div>

<div>A couple of weeks ago, my DM, DD#3 and I were out for our usual Sat 
  morning breakfast. The restaurant we chose was packed as usual. A table of 
  four soldiers was next to us and on the other side was a couple, he had a 
  military ballcap on (you know the kind you get with your group name on it). It 
  didn't even register with me. Of course we explained to Cassie why they were 
  all dressed alike. When the soldiers got up to leave, they asked for their 
  check and the waitress said that the couple had already got it. They, of 
  course protested for a second. The retired military man told them to just keep 
  on keeping us safe. I had tears then too. </div>

<div>Is it my age? I cry during the National Athem now too. I remember my Papa 
  used to cry during parades. It was such a sweet thing.</div>

<div>You mean some people DON'T cry during the National Anthem?  Listen to the words and imagine being Francis Scott Keye, if nothing else.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of years ago I was teaching Webelos Scouts their Citizenship pin and one of the requirements was to discuss the National Anthem.  We have a local Junior College with an outstanding drama department, so I asked the head of the drama department to help me find a student who would be willing to come in period costume and perform from memory a monologue I wrote from the perspective of FSK.  When he showed up, the student confided that he wasn't sure he could get through it and maintain control of his own emotions.  He did a beautiful job of conveying the intensity and uncertainty of that fateful night and the boys were dumbstruck when they heard the story straight from FSK.

&gt; Hi, Jana Banana and welcome. You have found several of my boxes so I <br/>
&gt; know the JBanana sign. Are you going to get to come to the gathering <br/>
at <br/>
&gt; Purtis Creek? I believe it is Sept. 22. I would love to put a face <br/>
with <br/>

 I'd love to, but unfortunately I will be working that entire weekend. <br/>
Here's hoping there'll be another gathering soon! <br/>
