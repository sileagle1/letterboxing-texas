I'd like to point out a new feature on letterboxing.org - if you've been<br/>
following the big list and newboxers, you've seen that boxes owned by boxers<br/>
who haven't logged on in over four years have been set to be automatically<br/>
adoptable.  One of the problems that arose from this is that boxers like the<br/>
Vermont Viking and Celtic Lions have passed away and they are obviously not<br/>
logging on, although their boxes are being tended.  The webmasters agreed<br/>
that those boxes should not be eligible for automatic adoption, so Choi has<br/>
done some great trickery to exempt those boxes, AND he's added an icon to<br/>
indicate that the boxes belong to a deceased boxer.<br/>

<p>That's great! Wow, what wonderful, amazingly fun memories those clues bring back! My brain never got such a workout. Lucy, there were nights I'd SEND &amp; RECEIVE emails to/from you and Viewfinder at two or three o'clock in the morning because we'd be working on those clues and just couldn't sleep! I remember we'd CC Ruby Tuesday and the next day we'd get some encouraging (often cryptic) message back from her. If I remember correctly, it took us two or three months to finally solve it completely and Dewberry solved it a few days before we did (as usual)! Definitely my ALL-TIME most difficult box, and most rewarding. Thanks for sharing the memory.</p>

&gt; &gt; Vermont Viking's boxes (for those who don't know, VV was one of the original<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxers in North America and placed the Prayer Rock box, credited with<br/>
&gt; &gt; being the first letterbox in the US).  By having their boxes set as they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are, those boxes can preserve the names of their original planters so we<br/>
&gt; &gt; will never forget them.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here's an example of the new look:<br/>

&gt; &gt; As an aside, I would like to give kudos to Choi, who does amazing things on<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing.org as the web programmer for the website.  As a webmaster on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the site, I am constantly surprised and amazed at the things he "just does"<br/>
&gt; &gt; - things no one knows until something comes up and he says "Oh yeah, I saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; that too and I just fixed it..." or, "This is how you can get that<br/>
&gt; &gt; information..."  If you are inclined to drop him a quick note to say thank<br/>
&gt; &gt; you, I think it'd be a nice gesture:  his email is john@...<br/>

<div>Lucy, Boots, PuddleSplasher, and all....</div>
<div>I generally just read the digests and try to remain quiet on the list (maybe I'm trying to emulate the Great Enigma, GG, to develop some personal mytery?), but I'm moved to respond to the posts about Ruby Tuesday and the Celtic Lions -- my favorite boxers of all time and a beautiful, clever, kind and gracious lady and wonderful family.  Just yesterday I happened to find myself passing some of those parks up in Richardson where I found some of her earlier boxes and had adventures along the way and of course, I started thinking again about how fun those searches were -- and how rewarding the boxes were once found, too, the locations and the surprises. Her UFO series (again, about certain Enigmatic persons/events, such clever references and tricky clues).   And boy do I remember the months-long efforts to solve that SP box -- I think PuddleSplasher was possessed!  Crazed!  Demented!  --  until that one clicked suddenly.  We had met RT for lunch during that time and she obliquely and cleverly kept giving us subtle hints in the right direction of the solution, but we were both so fixated on what we DIDN'T see that those comments just whooshed by both of us.  Later, we were slapping our brains, saying, well, duh. Mon dieu!  Eureka!  Mais oui!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't know if the actual box remains in place or not, but I'll say this, Boots:  The satisfaction you'll feel just for solving that one is all you need; putting your hands on the physical box will almost be a secondary consideration, nice if you can but not too disappointing if you can't.  You'll be slapping your brains, too -- just don't hit yourself too hard!   Kind of like GG's first box at that same lake:  the box isn't really the point of that one, either, at least for me; the solution is all!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterboxers like the Celtic Lions -- boy, do I miss them.  Always fun, always unique and smart and a totally satisfying experience.  Thanks for the reminders.  Now maybe I need to give Dewberry's <em>Surrender Dorothy!</em> mystery clues another look.  Hmm....</div>

I ventured that way once after solving, but didn't have the solved clues so I could only try from memory to find it - to no avail. The bad part for anyone solving the box now is that Ruby isn't around to cajole hints from. She didn't particularly like folks to say "Give me a hint" - she preferred someone to tell her where they were at with the box and she would come up with just the right hint on the fly. She had a supreme confidence in the rest of us, that we could - with time - catch up with her and solve the mystery.</div>
<div><br/></div><div>By the same token, I will never retire my Spring Hope box because it gave a lot of pleasure to Ruby and most especially, Stillwater, when they spent a weekend in my town. Stillwater solved it before Ruby, which is saying something because she was wickedly clever and had a mind of lightning speed. He gloated somewhat quietly, but he was quite pleased with himself. Aside from their huge compliments on that box, I always think of them when I check it. That particular weekend I knew they were in town and we were planning to get together in the evening, but I stumbled upon them in a park near my home as Stillwater was replacing a box. I slipped up on him and asked him some particular question - can't remember what - to let on that I knew what he was doing. He was a little surprised at being caught in the act, but I walked back to the car with him to greet Ruby. That was toward the beginning of her battle with cancer and she tired easily and felt badly because of the treatments, and she was plagued that weekend by feeling yukky. Turns out - that whole trip Ruby would stay in the car and Stillwater would go out and find the boxes and bring them back to her, then return them to their hiding spots - two round trips on every box! This is especially special because Stillwater was an LSS - not a letterboxer per se. He was doing this out of pure love for Ruby and because it pleased him to see her happy.</div>

<div>Lucy,</div>
<div>Your Spring Hope box was another one that frustrated me for a time, and then made me slap my brain when I found it.  I remember every detail of my first search for that one when I had just flat completely misinterpreted the clues and couldn't find it, and on the drive home going over and over the clues in my head and coming up with another (wrong) interpretation that I intended to come back and try sometime.  Then, on a later trip with Puddle Splasher along, I suddenly saw what I'd missed before and realized where I'd gone wrong -- and felt absolutely elated when we were successful in finding it.  I'm happy to hear that it's still there and loved the story of Stillwater figuring it out.  Thanks.</div>
