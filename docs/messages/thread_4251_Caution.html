<br>
It looks like another great day for letterboxing!  Yesterday was lovely, too, so we took advantage of the weather and found a few boxes and placed a couple.  We were in Washington, Lee and Fayette Counties.  We were in Fayette County at the Power Plant Lake near Fayetteville to find a couple of boxes that had been there for a few months and never found.  Great boxes by Baileys Bunch, clever, humorous and well done.  Anyway, it was our last box of the day, and I was stamping in, when LSQ said, "Look at that snake wrapped around that tree..is it real?  It looks like a toy, it's so pretty."  It was about head high and very close to where we were standing, same tree hiding the box.  So, I picked up a stick and poked it and it was real, all right, a juvenile Broad Banded Copperhead. It was the right color, but the bands confused me, and I didn't know Copperheads would climb trees.  Now, a Texas Rat Snake can climb most anything, including my garage door, but Copperheads are a different matter.  In about the last 3 months, there had been two other reports of baby Copperheads guarding boxes, but coming face to face with one makes you realize that you need to be aware of your surroundings.  I have a tendency to charge through the brush, head down, on a mission to get the letterbox.  Copperheads are probably the most common venomous snake in the woods, so you need to study up on what they look like and where they are likely to be so you can be cautious.  I would have thought that they might tend to be found under a log or a large chunk of bark, but that's where some letterboxes reside, too, so be careful out there.  Luckily, Copperheads are not aggressive and will try to get away or play dead, but if provoked can strike very quickly.  I don't want to scare you, just make you aware that they are out there.<br>

                    <html><body><p>Oh please - let me second this!!!<br/><br/>Fearless Fox, Lightning, and I JUST got home from a brief foray to Palestine for a few boxes. Because of our limited timeframe and a desire to do a little hiking, we opted to do chancelier_de_lbu's Jamboree on the Trail series before we ran out to Gus Engeling to replace my logbook out there.<br/>
<br/>The first box in JOTT had a note in it about a copperhead found protecting the box, so Fearless Fox very cautiously dug the box out with a hiking stick - it was most definitely a great hidey hole for a box AND a snake! There was no snake there while we were there, but as FF was putting it back, he saw a copperhead skin - proof (to us, at least) that it was a location freqented by copperheads! As we proceeded along the trail, we repeatedly found lots of snakey places, and I actually saw a copperhead at one point along the trail. <br/>
<br/>After the note in the clues and our find at the first box, we were very much aware of our slithery friends' common affection for places letterboxers like too. When it came time to retrieve boxes, only one of us went in (so that if we had to scramble, we weren't running each other over), and we used both a leather glove and a long hiking pole to retrieve boxes. AND - don't assume that once you have the box out, it's all smooth sailing. You still have to put it back, and that comes after the snake is perturbed by the box's removal. These fall days are great days for snakes to sun and be more active, so we are more likely to run into them and the babies are maturing and they are still a little more unpredictable than adults.<br/>
<br/>That said, I think we fear snakes too much. I have to say I haven't ever had a terror of snakes, but I have always had a health respect and a secret dread of being bitten. I thought I knew snakes pretty well until I attend an outstanding snake lecture at Fairfield State Park. If you ever have a chance to catch their talk, it will really help you understand snake behavior, why they bite, and why dying of a snake bite is not nearly as likely as one might think. I left it feeling a lot better equipped for dealing with a snake encounter on the trail. I'm pretty sure I did a write-up of the talk on this list, if you are interested and want to search the archives for it.<br/>
<br/>Still and all, the best way to deal with a snake bite is to not get bit in the first place and the best way to not get bit is to use caution as Boots said. They like autumn as much as we do!<br/><br/><br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>
