                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back from a quick day trip to east Texas - the first time <br/>
in quite a while that we've had a chance to hunt for boxes.   What a <br/>
day!!  We had planned on making a round trip between Tatum, Henderson, <br/>
and Kilgore, but loved the Martin Creek State Park so much that we ran <br/>
out of daylight.  By the way -- a word of warning to others venturing <br/>
to Martin Creek - beware of the attacking ducks!!  LOL  My daughter got <br/>
chased all over the picnic area - I guess the little guys were hungry <br/>
and expected to be fed.   <br/>
<br/>
We found all that we searched for, except the daffodil stamp in the <br/>
Spring Flower Trail series.  According to the log book at the last <br/>
stamp, the daffodil stamp had eluded several people.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all of you who placed those boxes -- my family had a great <br/>
day searching!<br/>
