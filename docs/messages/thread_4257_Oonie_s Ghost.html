                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's a very nice cemetery, but there are some secrets buried out behind the fence.  If Oonie Andrews is buried there (after all, it is Andrews Cemetery), then that's where she must be. She isn't in the front part, but I know she's near because she told me so herself, and she haunts the big house across the road. Being a well-known Spirit Seeker, maybe you can find out.<br>

The front part of it is clean and well-kept, even pleasant, in a cemetery sort of way, but at the back is a chain-link fence and you can see many old neglected headstones in the woods behind the fence, dark and foreboding, but there is no way to get back there, no gate, no way around the fence.

&gt; &gt; My theory is that the bolt of lightning that struck poor Oonie gave her<br/>
&gt; &gt; super powers to communicate "electronically". Just sayin...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I perhaps need to read my post a little more carefully. Sometimes, trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to stay in the "spirit" of my character, I sound more creepy than cute, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; apologize to the Spirit Seekers if I came across that way. It really is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; neat cemetery and the big house across the road really is said to be haunted<br/>
&gt; &gt; by Oonie's Ghost. And, I really did get a notification from Oonie that she<br/>
&gt; &gt; did visit the letterbox. There lies the mystery: why would Oonie have access<br/>
&gt; &gt; to email?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's a very nice cemetery, but there are some secrets buried out behind<br/>
&gt; &gt; the fence. If Oonie Andrews is buried there (after all, it is Andrews<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cemetery), then that's where she must be. She isn't in the front part, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; know she's near because she told me so herself, and she haunts the big house<br/>
&gt; &gt; across the road. Being a well-known Spirit Seeker, maybe you can find out.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can see that happening. This is a strange little cemetery. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; front part of it is clean and well-kept, even pleasant, in a cemetery sort<br/>
&gt; &gt; of way, but at the back is a chain-link fence and you can see many old<br/>
&gt; &gt; neglected headstones in the woods behind the fence, dark and foreboding, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is no way to get back there, no gate, no way around the fence. That's<br/>
