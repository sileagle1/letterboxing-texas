                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well Celticlions was right, 2 of my boxes, Butterfly Falls and <br>
Bringin' Home The Bacon,  are missing.  I braved the extreme heat <br>
today to go and check.  The only good news is that Life is a Picnic <br>
that is in the same park is still there and not missing as earlier <br>
believed.  <br>
<br>
I know this has happened to so many of you out there but it really <br>
makes you feel violated when someone takes something that you put so <br>
much of yourself into.  This is the first time I have had a box come <br>
up missing but it wasn't just one but two of my boxes.  I planted <br>
them on July 7, 2005 and they were pretty much off the beaten path.  <br>
In both locations I did find 2 of the bags from the inside of my <br>
boxes.  I even checked several of the trash cans in the area to be <br>
sure the boxes were not thrown away. No such luck. <br>
<br>
I am really sad but I saved the images and I will recarve and rehide <br>
in the next week or so.  I just hope we don't have some nut case who <br>
is going around removing boxes for the heck of it in good ole' East <br>
Texas.  We don't have just an abundance of letterboxes in our area <br>
so every single one really matters and to have 2 come up missing at <br>
the same time is just plain uncalled for.  I hope this doesn't <br>
happen to anyone else but odds are that it will.  <br>
