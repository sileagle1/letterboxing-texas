                    <div class="plaintext-content">The whole CelticLions crew had a wonderful time Saturday, beginning with<br>
coffee and beignets at Boxdn's site, where we finally could place faces with<br>
all the names we've been reading for almost a year! Hawk and Krohm, Barefoot<br>
Lucy, DrooP, Corazon & Navigator, HummerLAdy, CalicoRose, BusyBee...the list<br>
goes on... It's funny how you conjure up an image of a personality and it's<br>
great fun to finally have a physical entity to attach it to!<br>
After coffee, we hurried back to our campsite to catch a little family time<br>
- despite all of us living within 45 minutes of each other, we don't always<br>
have a chance to just unwind together. <br>
We finally packed up the cornbread & CLUE and headed over to the gathering.<br>
It was chaos! We were a little late and the frenzy of exchanges was in full<br>
swing. CactusLicker & I kept pointing out to each other the faces which<br>
matched names we'd seen in logbooks or on the Texas list- Silver Eagle &<br>
Baby Bear, Kissin'Fishies, DrooP, Catpawz, HapyHomeschoolers, BusyBeeFamily,<br>
and then we found out that Wanda had arrived! <br>
We rushed over to meet her - CactusLicker & I have just loved her posts to<br>
the main list forever - they were our first introduction to real<br>
letterboxing stories and we learned a great deal and were totally<br>
entertained by them! As CL says, she is the "Goddess of Letterboxing"!<br>
I went back to getting the CLUE stuff ready, and trying to make sure we<br>
could begin at 2:00 as posted. After the envelopes were finally all handed<br>
out, I was momentarily distracted by thinking we had lost the three solution<br>
envelopes that Stillwater had just pulled from the box - okay, more than<br>
distracted - I was hyperventilating at the thought we might have passed out<br>
ALL the stamps!<br>
It was fascinating to watch the various ways folks went about playing the<br>
game! Krohm was our Grand winner, coming in first, followed by Hawk,<br>
Clueless Collector, Silver Eagle and Wanda! (The list is missing, so I know<br>
there are two more winners, but don't have the names - please let me know!)<br>
<br>
Back at the campground later that night we played some serious "Monday<br>
Morning Quarterback" trying to jot down ideas & suggestions for whoever<br>
organizes the NEXT Clue game!!! (If you have ideas, please write to us off<br>
list at celticlions@comcast.net and we'll include them).<br>
<br>
That night we all settled down, with family members divided between the<br>
Winnebago we have just inherited from my in-laws and a tent. Sometime around<br>
midnight, I woke up to what sounded like a house ( shades of OZ)had fallen<br>
on the camper...not a tree, because it wasn't in just one area but ALL OVER<br>
the roof of the Winnebago. I opened the door to the bathroom, and the<br>
plastic cover to the skylight was raining down in huge chunks, followed by<br>
gushing rainwater.<br>
<br>
We looked out the side door and suddenly realized that the awning - which<br>
had been attached to aluminum poles staked into the ground in four places -<br>
had been torn up out of the ground and flipped backwards, hardware and all,<br>
over the roof of the Winnebago.<br>
<br>
Now, as I mentioned, this is a vehicle we were given by my in-laws - it's<br>
been around a long time - and we discovered that it has leaks in a few<br>
places...we spent most of the rest of Saturday night placing bowls & buckets<br>
and towels to catch the drips...and making room for the tenters who were<br>
soaking wet. Please picture the 6 of us plus two dogs in the Winnebago<br>
bumping into each other...<br>
<br>
One funny note - one of the things The Gentleman grabbed from the tent to<br>
"save" was the "Boxing on the Brazos" shirts from BoxDN!  <br>
