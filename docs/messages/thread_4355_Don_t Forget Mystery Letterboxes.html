                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's a good tip, even for experienced boxers.  I don't know how many times we've gathered clues for boxes and never thought to check the mystery list.  We've missed some opportunities that way.  There may even be some bonus boxes out there disguising themselves as mystery boxes.<br>

<div>Could you please give me information on how to locate clues to mystery boxes on both the AQ and LBNA?  I am assuming that a search for the city the box would be in would not be sufficient.  Thanks!<br/> </div>
