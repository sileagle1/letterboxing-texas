                    <html><body><div>Well I thought I would let y'all know that Fearless Fox successfully identified the hoolie-hoolie monster he originally heard on the 4C's Trail a few weeks ago and that we kept an eye for when we went together to the 4C.  He was able to do this because he heard them again - last night - in South Shores!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Are you curious?  Well - it was a wild turkey - and not the bottled variety, I might add!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The "experts" we asked all had thought that it sounded like turkeys, but they were puzzled because turkeys roost at night.  The best we can figure is that they were disturbed and on the move when they came upon Lightning's and Fearless Fox's camp and started the hoolie-hoolying!<br clear="all"/>
</div>
<div>He heard it distinctly again this weekend and we saw the proof for ourselves as we were leaving today - a turkey walking about in one of the empty campsites.  The odd little noise he was making was a much quieter hoolie-hoolie, but if there were several of them and they were disturbed, I can imagine it would be loud and daunting. They ARE odd creatures!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think that Fearless Fox would have felt much more comfortable camping by himself after learning what a hoolie-hoolie is, except that Silver Eagle told us quite a story about having a bear to dinner last night...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad that mystery is solved. You're right, Silver Eagle's story about <br>
the bear visiting his campsite and eating all his food did make me <br>
think twice about what could be joining me in my sleeping bag. <br>
However, for the last few nights, I listened to the trill of the <br>
Houston Toad in the small lake behind our cabin at the State Park. <br>
That sound, combined with the breeze blowing through those <br>
magnificent pines and looking up at the incredibly bright stars <br>
(something we can't see so intensely in the DFW area) was almost too <br>
powerful! I miss it already. Like my husband told the ranger this <br>
morning, we WILL be back!<br>
