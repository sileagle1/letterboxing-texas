page and you can see them along with a list of attendees at:<br>

<br>
Judging from some of the comments it looks like the Event<br>
was enjoyed by all, and I want to thank everyone for helping <br>
make it such a success.  I really enjoyed meeting all of you<br>
and sharing good food and conversation.  As far as my chili <br>
(the one in the big Crock Pot), it was just Wick Fowlers.<br>
As for letterboxes, it looks like at least 4 new ones were<br>
placed in Bastrop SP and 2 just outside the park.  A funny<br>
thing happened to Baby Bear and I when we went for the TCM<br>
box.  As we were stamping in a truck pulled into the parking<br>
lot and a guy got out and asked what we were doing.  We<br>
thought quickly and said we were admiring the old gas station.<br>
He brightened up and proceded to tell us all about it.  It<br>
turns out he is the owner and he ended up unlocking the door<br>
and giving us a tour of the place!<br>
Thanks again for making my weekend memorable and keep boxing!<br>
