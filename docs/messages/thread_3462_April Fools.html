There has been some talk on AQ about the McBoxer and another one. I love to read the flame posts, and sometimes I can't believe that some people appear to truly incensed. If I ever start to get like that, someone hose me down, seriously.<br/><br/>So, this morning when I finally had time to relog into AQ the posts had already started. I couldn't stay on the site for long, the colors were hurting me, but I didn't want to take the time to change the theme. It was very entertaining. Even after someone posted that it was probably a joke, they still flamed. <br/><br/>Thank the Lord and all that's Holy that this list isn't like that. <br/><br/>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Silver Eagle &lt;sileagle@alltel.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>The McBoxing on AQ is well planned and executed, and the reverse trail <br/> names on LBNA is cute, but the best Letterboxing April Fools I ever saw <br/> was back in 2004.

VF and I got home from our DDDL/Bastrop/Austin adventure last night. <br/>
Didn't have too much time in Austin for LBing, but did find your <br/>
Mellow Velo box! Very cool. However, I've confirmed that the slogan <br/>
which Austin is always trying to live up to, "Keep Austin Wierd", is <br/>
accurate. Just after replaceing your box and walking back to our car <br/>
in that VERY PUBLIC and busy parking lot, a woman walking with two <br/>
friends down the middle of the street from the Wildflower Center to <br/>
the Velo lot, pulled her pants down to her knees, stepped over to the <br/>
curb and did her business. The most puzzling part was that the porta-<br/>
potty mentioned in your clues were no further than 30 feet away. Now <br/>
that was NO April Fools joke. For once I was rendered speechless.<br/>
