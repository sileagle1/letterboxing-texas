<br/>
I am so glad that while you were alive (and a nice guy at that time), your first letterbox was one of mine. I had to pick up that box a few months ago and I still have the logbook, noting your first find.  I even remember communicating with you when you logged that find online and saying that you should certainly take the time to find some boxes in the same area by Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter because they are always, always, always, top notch. <br/>
<br/>
My dear IRA, I am not trying to discredit you in any way.  I just think that we should not be allowed to hunt down poor innocent Baby Bears, chop them up, and eat them for dinner.  Baby Bears should be allowed to roam about letterboxing land, finding and planting boxes, as was nature's true intent.  <br/>

Hunters hunt to thin out an over-population of pests, like bears, who pose a threat to the human population.  It doesn't matter if the varmint is cute and cuddly like a snake or slithery and sneaky like a bear.  If they happen to make good stew, that's just a bonus.<br/>

I even remember communicating with you when you logged that find online and saying that you should certainly take the time to find some boxes in the same area by Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter because they are always, always, always, top notch. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My dear IRA, I am not trying to discredit you in any way.  I just think that we should not be allowed to hunt down poor innocent Baby Bears, chop them up, and eat them for dinner.  Baby Bears should be allowed to roam about letterboxing land, finding and planting boxes, as was nature's true intent.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Sincerely, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My first find was a box called "Hank Hill" on July 7, 2007, only a few months before my unfortunate demise.  Ironically, that box was placed by Lucy Locket, who is now leading an effort to discredit me and protect dangerous bears.  Shame on you, LL.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think it would be interesting, as a matter of a roll call, for us all to<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you thank you!  I just went and checked my very first logbook, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually found my first 2 letterboxes on November 11th, 2003...Brazos Bend<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and Star Gazer by SE and BB.  Had I known then how mean BB would be to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; future IRA, I may have reconsidered looking for his box :)  MO5<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;            Today is Mother of Five's 5 year AQ anniversary!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Just on a whim I looked down there again on Aq anniversary's today and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; another of our boxers was having an anniversary! Coincidence? Anyway...<br/>
