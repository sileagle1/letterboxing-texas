<br>
I am so glad that while you were alive (and a nice guy at that time), your first letterbox was one of mine. I had to pick up that box a few months ago and I still have the logbook, noting your first find.  I even remember communicating with you when you logged that find online and saying that you should certainly take the time to find some boxes in the same area by Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter because they are always, always, always, top notch. <br>
<br>
My dear IRA, I am not trying to discredit you in any way.  I just think that we should not be allowed to hunt down poor innocent Baby Bears, chop them up, and eat them for dinner.  Baby Bears should be allowed to roam about letterboxing land, finding and planting boxes, as was nature's true intent.  <br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
<br>

Yes, we all know what bears do in the woods.  Watch your step out there.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can see that you just don't understand.  Hunters don't hunt because they like the thrill of the kill.  Bears do that.  Hunters hunt to thin out an over-population of pests, like bears, who pose a threat to the human population.  It doesn't matter if the varmint is cute and cuddly like a snake or slithery and sneaky like a bear.  If they happen to make good stew, that's just a bonus.<br>
