What a great weekend! Beautiful weather, gorgeous pine woods and<br/>
terrific letterboxes placed in interesting locations! <br/>
We found "My Heart Belongs in Texas" with a lovely HH - "Swans". Both<br/>
were in good condition and we enjoyed the easy hike and clever<br/>
placement. (Meanwhile, Cactus Licker enjoyed catching a bass well over a<br/>
foot long in the clear water of Tyler State Park - made his day!)<br/>
<br/>
In Lufkin we had fun wandering around the Texas Forestry Museum nature<br/>
trail, and found "Lufkin Lookout" &amp; "Road Runner". "Roadrunner" was a<br/>
little damp, but we dried it out &amp; the logbook looks fine. We had looked<br/>
forward to the Stone Celt - Caddo Burial Mound box, but we arrived at<br/>
one minute past 4:00, and the barrier was down- a good reminder to us to<br/>
double-check opening &amp; closing times for museums and historic sites!<br/>
<br/>
We made our way up to Rusk where Cactus Licker had a blast casting into<br/>
giant lily pads on the lake while we found Texas RR box - in great shape<br/>
and containing a HH (Kokopelli) which must have been placed there just<br/>
before us. Our pathetic acting skills were called into play, because we<br/>
could not outwait a family nearby. I pretended to spill my pack and then<br/>
scrambled around, blocking the view, as Stillwater retrieved the<br/>
letterbox. The family didn't even turn around to admire our performance!<br/>
<br/>
Our entrance into Mission Tejas Park was enlivened by the Park Ranger<br/>
who is quite a trickster, and snared CL as a likely audience - it's<br/>
worth going, so I won't spoil it for you all! We loved the mission, and<br/>
the box - cleverly hidden. Had to outwait a family of sightseers, but it<br/>
was worth it. Unfortunately, the Tejas box at another location in the<br/>
park was waterlogged. I'll write to the owner with more details.<br/>
<br/>
Wish we'd had more time at the Hogg Home site - we zipped thru the<br/>
nature trail (Cactus Licker surprised a snake) stamped in &amp; out and had<br/>
to leave.<br/>
<br/>
Tried to get into the Tiger Creek preserve twice - both times the<br/>
barrier was across the road - we'll have to go back for that one!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you so much to all the creators of the boxes mentioned - you gave<br/>
us a delightful and educational weekend! <br/>

You have no idea how exciting it is for me to know you<br/>
found my box - My Heart Belongs in Texas - that's the<br/>
first time that I know of that anyone has found one of<br/>
my boxes!!!  Were there any other stamps in the log???<br/>
