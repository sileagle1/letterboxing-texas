Bryan was out of buns and chicken tenders.  You could order chicken<br/>
nuggest or chicken nuggets - ha ha!!<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at Cameron Park Zoo in Waco and I wanted to let you  all<br/>
know that I was so impressed with it.  It is gorgeous.  They just<br/>
added a new section in the back that really made the trip worthwhile.<br/>
   Plus their water fountains actually had COLD water in it - now when<br/>
the temp is 100+ outside that is a really good thing :)<br/>
<br/>
I was so disappoint that the lbna site was still down when we left as<br/>
there are several boxes in the waco area.  maybe next time.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - if you get in that area, the stop is a good one!!<br/>
