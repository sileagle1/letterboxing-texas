<div>I just posted clues to 
a new box  ART IS ALL AROUND US:  The Concrete Jungle (LBNA and 
AQ).  It is the first in what I hope will be a long series of boxes 
dedicated to art in public spaces.  So many times we whiz by these pretty 
little spaces in our cars and never even see them, but they are put there for us 
to enjoy!  I hope if you know of a special piece of public art you will 
join me in adding to this series.  -Mother of 5</div></body></html>
