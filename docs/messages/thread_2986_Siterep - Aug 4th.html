                    <div class="plaintext-content">We left Wag Time's house at 6 am after going to bed around 12:30.  I <br/>
do have to give credit to Wag Time for being up before me this <br/>
morning.  She is normally the late night, late morning person, and I <br/>
normally am in bed early and get up early, but she beat me this <br/>
time.  The first find was I See the Moon in Arlington. Wag Time had <br/>
already found this box, but she took me to it so that I could locate <br/>
it as well.  Our next stop was at Wag Time's Garden of Angels in <br/>
Arlington.  This is a really neat site that is dedicated to people <br/>
who have been murdered.  It has a lot of white crosses with victims' <br/>
names on them.  The original cross was for a girl who was murdered <br/>
at the site of the garden.  There are also crosses with the names of <br/>
the Yates kids from Houston.  We attempted Red Eared Slider at the <br/>
UTA campus in Arlington for the second time and we still were not <br/>
able to find this box.  We attempted the 22 Hour Day box in <br/>
Arlington and it was also missing.  We then went to the Prairie <br/>
Springs Cemetery in Burleson (which by the way is the Crepe Myrtle<br/>
Capital of the World) and attempted the Wild Cherry LB, but it was <br/>
also missing.  Our next stop was Joshua to the First Baptist Church <br/>
and we found The LUV Box, which was right near a rail road and a <br/>
train came by right after we stamped in and blew its horn, which <br/>
caused our hearing to go away for a few minutes.  Went to Joshua <br/>
Cemetery in Joshua to find Jewel in Joshua.  We found the right tree <br/>
but no box.  We looked around and finally located the box a couple <br/>
of trees down from where it should have been.  We replaced the box <br/>
after we stamped in.  Looked for A Walk Down Old Main in Joshua, but <br/>
could not locate the right street nor the bank with a fountain <br/>
nearby.  We then went to Cleburne to the Rose Hill Cemetery<br/>
and found the Where Have All the Flowers Gone lb at the Veterans <br/>
Memorial.  A side note about this area of the cemetery is that there <br/>
is a plaque there that lists members of the confederate army from <br/>
Johnson County who were held as POW's and who are buried in Illinois <br/>
in unmarked graves.  They all have the date of their death as 1863.  <br/>
We then went to Splash Station in Cleburne and found the Spirit of <br/>
Cleburne box. This was kind of neat because the train engine is <br/>
fenced in with a chain link fence about 10 feet high and a<br/>
sign that tells you to not touch because this is part of a feral cat <br/>
community where the cats are wild.  The city maintains them.  We did <br/>
see about 4-5 cats in the enclosure.  We then made it to Dinosaur <br/>
Valley State Park and found the Howlin at the Moon box.  We did see <br/>
a couple of dinosaur tracks.  The view from this box is beautiful.  <br/>
We then went and found the Dinosaur Tracks box and left the <br/>
Microsoft Office:Access HH in this box.  We then went to Granbury to <br/>
the boat ramp to find the Afloat in a Boat Box.  We<br/>
found the right location and the rock it was supposed to be under, <br/>
but the box was gone.  Our next stop was Houston Street Park and <br/>
found the Legends of Granbury Series #3 - John Wilkes Booth box and<br/>
picked up a HH.  We then went to Shandlin Park which connects with <br/>
Houston Street Park and found the Flutterbies box, but did not find <br/>
the Let's Bug Out box.  We then went to Granbury Cemetery and saw the<br/>
grave of Jesse James (at least that is what folks in Granbury say).  <br/>
We did look for the Legends of Granbury Series #1 - Jesse James box, <br/>
which had already been reported as missing, and we did not find it. <br/>
While we were in this cemetery we decided to look into a mausoleum <br/>
that was unlocked.  Upon entering we noticed there was a large hole <br/>
where a body should be laying (the mausoleum holds about 6-8 people <br/>
in it).  There was no body, but it definitely had an eerie feeling <br/>
to it.  We also saw the grave of Davy Crockett's grandson in this <br/>
cemetery.  We then went to look for the Hear Ye Hear Ye box at the <br/>
courtyard square and it was missing.  We then looked for You Scream, <br/>
I Scream box off the square in Granbury and did find this<br/>
box.  We then stopped at Rinky Tink's Ice Cream shop and got ice <br/>
cream to finish off our time in Granbury.  (yes, even JR got ice <br/>
cream).  We then traveled to Weatherford so that Wag Time could pick <br/>
up the Badge of Friendship box at the Greenwood Cemetery.  JB found <br/>
this box on her way to Arizona back in June.  While we were here we <br/>
came across the historical marker for Bose Ikard who was a black man <br/>
who worked as a scout for Goodnight and Loving on their trail drives <br/>
and was the inspiration for the Deets character in the book/movie <br/>
Lonesome Dove.  We then went to Caddo so that Wag Time could pick up <br/>
the Tejas Caddo box in Caddo Cemetery that JB again had found on her <br/>
way to Arizona.  The box was in good shape.  It is 8:17 pm and we <br/>
still have to travel back to Grand Prairie...so our day is done.  <br/>
One side note about today, during our journey we managed to see <br/>
several of those big blow ups that car dealerships have on their<br/>
buildings.  We saw three rather unique ones today that I think are <br/>
worth mentioning...a Frankenstein, an Elvis (who was as white as a <br/>
ghost) and a pot of money in bills and coins at a bank.  Just <br/>
thought I would share this with everyone.  <br/>

 house at 6 am after going to bed around 12:30. <br/>I <br/>&gt; do have to give credit to Wag Time for being up before me this <br/>&gt; morning. She is normally the late night, late morning person, and <br/>I <br/>&gt; normally am in bed early and get up early, but she beat me this <br/>&gt; time. The first find was I See the Moon in Arlington. Wag Time had <br/>&gt; already found this box, but she took me to it so that I could <br/>locate <br/>&gt; it as well. Our next stop was at Wag Time's Garden of Angels in <br/>&gt; Arlington. This is a really neat site that is dedicated to people <br/>&gt; who have been murdered. It has a lot of white crosses with <br/>victims' <br/>&gt; names on them. The original cross was for a girl who was murdered <br/>&gt; at the site of the garden. There are also crosses with the names <br/>of <br/>&gt; the Yates kids from Houston. We attempted Red Eared Slider at the <br/>&gt; UTA campus in Arlington for the second time and we still were not <br/>&gt; able
 to find this box. We attempted the 22 Hour Day box in <br/>&gt; Arlington and it was also missing. We then went to the Prairie <br/>&gt; Springs Cemetery in Burleson (which by the way is the Crepe Myrtle<br/>&gt; Capital of the World) and attempted the Wild Cherry LB, but it was <br/>&gt; also missing. Our next stop was Joshua to the First Baptist Church <br/>&gt; and we found The LUV Box, which was right near a rail road and a <br/>&gt; train came by right after we stamped in and blew its horn, which <br/>&gt; caused our hearing to go away for a few minutes. Went to Joshua <br/>&gt; Cemetery in Joshua to find Jewel in Joshua. We found the right <br/>tree <br/>&gt; but no box. We looked around and finally located the box a couple <br/>&gt; of trees down from where it should have been. We replaced the box <br/>&gt; after we stamped in. Looked for A Walk Down Old Main in Joshua, <br/>but <br/>&gt; could not locate the right street nor the bank with a fountain <br/>&gt; nearby. We then went
 to Cleburne to the Rose Hill Cemetery<br/>&gt; and found the Where Have All the Flowers Gone lb at the Veterans <br/>&gt; Memorial. A side note about this area of the cemetery is that <br/>there <br/>&gt; is a plaque there that lists members of the confederate army from <br/>&gt; Johnson County who were held as POW's and who are buried in <br/>Illinois <br/>&gt; in unmarked graves. They all have the date of their death as <br/>1863. <br/>&gt; We then went to Splash Station in Cleburne and found the Spirit of <br/>&gt; Cleburne box. This was kind of neat because the train engine is <br/>&gt; fenced in with a chain link fence about 10 feet high and a <br/>&gt; sign that tells you to not touch because this is part of a feral <br/>cat <br/>&gt; community where the cats are wild. The city maintains them. We <br/>did <br/>&gt; see about 4-5 cats in the enclosure. We then made it to Dinosaur <br/>&gt; Valley State Park and found the Howlin at the Moon box. We did see <br/>&gt; a couple of dinosaur
 tracks. The view from this box is beautiful. <br/>&gt; We then went and found the Dinosaur Tracks box and left the <br/>&gt; Microsoft Office:Access HH in this box. We then went to Granbury <br/>to <br/>&gt; the boat ramp to find the Afloat in a Boat Box. We<br/>&gt; found the right location and the rock it was supposed to be under, <br/>&gt; but the box was gone. Our next stop was Houston Street Park and <br/>&gt; found the Legends of Granbury Series #3 - John Wilkes Booth box and<br/>&gt; picked up a HH. We then went to Shandlin Park which connects with <br/>&gt; Houston Street Park and found the Flutterbies box, but did not find <br/>&gt; the Let's Bug Out box. We then went to Granbury Cemetery and saw <br/>the<br/>&gt; grave of Jesse James (at least that is what folks in Granbury <br/>say). <br/>&gt; We did look for the Legends of Granbury Series #1 - Jesse James <br/>box, <br/>&gt; which had already been reported as missing, and we did not find it. <br/>&gt; While we were in this
 cemetery we decided to look into a mausoleum <br/>&gt; that was unlocked. Upon entering we noticed there was a large hole <br/>&gt; where a body should be laying (the mausoleum holds about 6-8 people <br/>&gt; in it). There was no body, but it definitely had an eerie feeling <br/>&gt; to it. We also saw the grave of Davy Crockett's grandson in this <br/>&gt; cemetery. We then went to look for the Hear Ye Hear Ye box at the <br/>&gt; courtyard square and it was missing. We then looked for You <br/>Scream, <br/>&gt; I Scream box off the square in Granbury and did find this <br/>&gt; box. We then stopped at Rinky Tink's Ice Cream shop and got ice <br/>&gt; cream to finish off our time in Granbury. (yes, even JR got ice <br/>&gt; cream). We then traveled to Weatherford so that Wag Time could <br/>pick <br/>&gt; up the Badge of Friendship box at the Greenwood Cemetery. JB found <br/>&gt; this box on her way to Arizona back in June. While we were here we <br/>&gt; came across the historical
 marker for Bose Ikard who was a black <br/>man <br/>&gt; who worked as a scout for Goodnight and Loving on their trail <br/>drives <br/>&gt; and was the inspiration for the Deets character in the book/movie <br/>&gt; Lonesome Dove. We then went to Caddo so that Wag Time could pick <br/>up <br/>&gt; the Tejas Caddo box in Caddo Cemetery that JB again had found on <br/>her <br/>&gt; way to Arizona. The box was in good shape. It is 8:17 pm and we <br/>&gt; still have to travel back to Grand Prairie...so our day is done. <br/>&gt; One side note about today, during our journey we managed to see <br/>&gt; several of those big blow ups that car dealerships have on their<br/>&gt; buildings. We saw three rather unique ones today that I think are <br/>&gt; worth mentioning..<wbr/>.a Frankenstein, an Elvis (who was as white as a <br/>&gt; ghost) and a pot of money in bills and coins at a bank. Just <br/>&gt; thought I would share this with everyone. <br/>&gt; JB Kokopelli<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></span></div>

Especially old, historical ones. My family and I just got back from our beach vacation in Alabama. (Yes, I was surprised to find out that AL has a beach...a very nice beach!) We opted to do a couple of geocaching runs. One was at an old cemetary in Mobile. Lots of history! I would have done lots more but two out of three of my stepkids have absolutely no interest and put up a big stink.<br/>
