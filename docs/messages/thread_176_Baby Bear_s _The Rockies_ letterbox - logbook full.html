Hello!  We went camping near Estes Park this past weekend and <br>
decided to find "The Rockies" letterbox - a 2nd time!  We have <br>
family visiting from Texas and introduced her to letterboxing - her <br>
first box to find and it was an awesome day to be in the mountains!<br>
<br>
ANYWAY!  The micro mini logbook is FULL!  Well, on one side at <br>
least - folks will need to flip it over and stamp in from the back <br>
and move forward.  We didn't have any logbooks with us otherwise we <br>
would have replaced it for you.  Considering we live close enough, <br>
we "may" try to get a new one in there for you.  Just wanted you to <br>
know ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Especially for your boxes, I think I'll start to carry mini logbooks <br>
to replace them for you just in case.  You can send me your home <br>
address off list and I'll be more than happy to mail the logbooks if <br>
I replace one?  Unless of course your travels from Texas will bring <br>
you back to Colorado for box maintenance.  The weather is excellent <br>
right now!  Road trip!!??  <br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
