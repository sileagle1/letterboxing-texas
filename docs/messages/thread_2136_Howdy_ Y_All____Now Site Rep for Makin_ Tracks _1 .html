<div> </div>
<div>I found letterboxing three years ago (to the weekend as a matter of fact!), and only began geocaching around the first of the year, with thanks, by the way, to Mike who helped me figure out what kind of GPS and helped me navigate the different style of website that 
<a href="http://geocaching.com">geocaching.com</a> is.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have to say, I'm a much better letterboxer than I am geocacher.  I like both, but I come up empty-handed too much for my own taste in GC'ing.  I'm sure I'll get better at it as time goes by...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I must say one of the coolest finds I've had on that front involved looking at a tree from a different angle to find the cache, then practically hanging out of it to reach the cache (and anyone who knows me will HAVE to laugh at the vision of that sight!).  Another had a hide so natural-looking, I all but banged my head against it repeatedly in frustration over not being able to find it.

<p>Oh, yeah.... and hubby really gets into the creative aspect of the <br/>geocache hide... we just hid one this weekend, and the comments of <br/>the first finder lauded us for another cool camo job, although he <br/>still likes one of our other ones as the best camo yet. We will be 
<br/>adding more camo-creative containers to our letterboxes in the <br/>future.. we just wanted to get a couple out this weekend and test the <br/>waters, as such. We also found that people do hide micro-<br/>letterboxes, too.. you just have to carve a small stamp! We 
<br/>found "Pocket Wocket" this weekend.. that was a cute stamp! The <br/>creativity of it, both in the stamp and the hide is what attracts us <br/>to the sports... letterboxing is just a different (and earlier) <br/>
version of geocaching... and both have very distinct patterns to them.<br/><br/>Malia<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">

&gt; &gt; Well, we have 3 more in the works... I don't know how long <br/>until we<br/>&gt; &gt; can get them set, but hopefully by next weekend. Jim is the one <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; the creative streak.. he likes making them intriguing. We've had
<br/>&gt; &gt; lots of practice with geocaching on making neat containers, etc.<br/>&gt; &gt; We had the same problem with #1, but I liked the location of<br/>&gt; &gt; the "den" ... I walk that trail frequently, and will keep an eye 
<br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; it. Thanks for the comments... we are always open to some<br/>&gt; &gt; constructive criticism... that is how we learn!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; We've found most of the boxes in Georgetown, but there are still a
<br/>&gt; &gt; few more to get (Berry Springs Park, mostly). Georgetown could use<br/>&gt; &gt; more boxes, though. That's ok... we can have fun planting more for<br/>&gt; &gt; other folks to find.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In

<br/>&gt; &gt; I've seen several of your caches that I thought looked<br/>&gt; &gt; interesting...like the one having to do with "measurement". Other<br/>&gt; &gt; than those type of "themed" caches, the whole Geocaching thing 
<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; didn't stick with me. But...I'm really glad to see you begin<br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxing! YIPPEE! Now we can look for great letterboxes by<br/>&gt; &gt; someone who is so obviously creative and thoughtful. :-)
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; My son and I went today and found both boxes. We are so<br/>&gt; &gt; impressed with your first carvings! And what a beautiful park...I<br/>&gt; &gt; live in Georgetown and never even knew that park was there! We
<br/>&gt; &gt; especially liked the trail signs...like the one that points to GT<br/>&gt; &gt; Country Club with the golf balls in the path! LOL! My son really<br/>&gt; &gt; wanted to see if one of those balls would come out, but I was 
<br/>able to<br/>&gt; &gt; convince him to leave them for the next person to find them.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Makin' Tracks #1 was very easy to find. The only problem was<br/>&gt; &gt; that we had a hard time wedging the rocks back...they wanted to 
<br/>keep<br/>&gt; &gt; sliding down the hill. I finally got them in place and wedged dirt<br/>&gt; &gt; up under them and then covered the dirt area with leaves so it <br/>looked<br/>&gt; &gt; more undisturbed. Still, you may want to keep your eye on that 
<br/>one.<br/>&gt; &gt; Hopefully the rains won't dislodge it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Makin' Tracks #2 was a bit harder. Still not too hard, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; kept thinking it had to be in that big animal burrow. Walked right
<br/>&gt; &gt; past the box several times before I thought...well, might as well<br/>&gt; &gt; check here. Voila! Nice hiding spot. ;-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I like what you did to the containers. Makes them very difficult
<br/>&gt; &gt; to spot. I use camo tape, but it's probably much more labor<br/>&gt; &gt; intensive than your method and your way works, too. As I said...I<br/>&gt; &gt; walked right past Makin' Tracks #2 SEVERAL times! LOL!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome again to letterboxing and glad to see you found our<br/>&gt; &gt; little group!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks, Batty B of the BusyBeesFamily :-)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;
