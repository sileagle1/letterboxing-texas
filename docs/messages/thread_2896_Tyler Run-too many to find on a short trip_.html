                    <html><body><div>I've never understood why Tyler doesn't have more boxes than it does, so it's nice to see that it has gained enough that I'm going to have to make a whole trip of it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had to make an impromptu run to Tyler and be back in Jacksonville by Noon, but for once, I had a little extra time AND the opportunity to grab some clues before I headed up there.  Now I grabbed all the clues I haven't yet found, but a quick glance made me realize there was NO WAY I could find them all this morning!  I've been wanting to find Silver Eagle's Tyler Rose box for quite a long time, so I opted to find the Rose Garden boxes, and maybe the East Texas Fair Grounds box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to the Rose Garden and it was surprisingly very quiet.  Between weddings and reunions and family events and dates and all the other really cool things that happen at the Rose Garden, it's a rare thing to find it empty, but empty it was and pleasant - on one of our first bright mornings in quite a long time it seems!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the countless time since I started letterboxing, I found myself having a sort of a de ja vu/alternate universe sort of experience.  I have been to many, many events at the Rose Garden and gone there quite a few times for pleasure, but I've never gone there on a mission.  Never thought of it in terms of proximities and distances.  I grabbed my clues and read them over one more time, putting the boxes in order in my head and figuring out the logical place to start and headed off.  I quickly found my way to the first box, Silver Eagle's Tyler Rose, and after scratching my head for a few minutes over "which white rock", I suddenly realized I had left one key element of the clue, and when I added it back in, it all fell together!  Isn't that how it goes???
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was such a beautiful morning and it was so unbelievably quiet in the gardens, I couldn't resist hanging out for a few minutes and enjoying a sunny morning.  Finally, though I moved on and went for Atoy Adventurers' Butterflies are Free.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While I was by Silve Eagle's box, I thought I had heard a bullfrog, but it only happened once so I wasn't positive.  But as I approached Butterflies are Free, I heard it again!  And again!  I haven't heard a bullfrog in ages - even at my in-laws, who live at the quiet end of a lake where all the cool critters collect.  I got to the location of the box and began surveying how to approach the box and the first thing I figured out was that it was a blind reach.  And right after that I concluded I would need my gloves, which I didn't have.  I took stock of the situation and realized that the very manicured garden was stickless, not that a stick would've helped anyway.  Being right on the edge of a pond amongs some big elephant ears and up under a bridge, on a sunny and not yet too hot day, I imagined that if I were a snake, I would find that box to be the perfect pillow upon which to lay my head while I enjoyed the morning!  I SURE didn't want to leave that box though!  I decided to go on and find the other box, Atoy Adventurers' East Texas Rose, and think about it for a bit.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I easily found the location for East Texas Rose and proceeded to look.  Unfortunately, I'm fairly certain I found its hiding spot, but it wasn't there.  The pine straw had been recently disturbed and there was that familiar indentation of a small square object nestled among cover material.  I've emailed the AA's and given them specifics, so hopefully they will tell me I wasn't looking in the right spot.  I guess the best course of action for anyone considering this box is to watch the clues for an update about the status!  So....back to the Butterfly box...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I was going back to the box, I noticed an angle that might allow me a backside view.  I looked around to see if anyone was anywhere around, because I was going to have to lay down on the sidewalk and I didn't want to attract attention or paramedics or anything.  Still - I couldn't see a thing!  This box is truly unseeable!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now let me digress - I'm not scared of snakes, but I DO have a healthy respect for them.  And in light of She Who Reads' phone call last night from summer camp, I had to stop and give this box a little thought.  She is getting to stay out at Scout Camp and work as the camp nurse this summer, but she calls me every day or two just to catch up with what's going on in the civilized world.   Three weeks into camp she learned that she has been sharing her nice clean, air conditioned nurse's hut with - a snake!  She had no idea until she called a couple of the staff members to get something off a high shelf for her, and when one of them reached up onto the shelf he didn't feel what he thought he should have felt, he felt - a snake!  Well of course, the snake bailed out without introducing himself (can you imagine a snake bailing out from a couple of feet OVER your head???), and so did the staff guys, and SWR was close on everyone's feet (or tail, as the case may be).  Now it probably helps to know the parties involved, which I do (well all but the snake), but I find the whole scenario insanely funny and sobering all at the same time.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway - back to the box.  In the final analysis, I didn't want SWR to be sitting around the campfire tonight telling them about good ol' BarefootLucy, sticking her hand down where she couldn't see without gloves and getting bitten by THE snake (because we all know there is only one snake in all of East Texas, so certainly her snake made it to Tyler to the Rose Garden to relax after his traumatic experience in his cozy little home with her).  I opted to leave that particular box for another much colder day.  The bad thing about it?  That bullfrog just kept croakin' - I know he was laughing at me for being a chicken!  He'd better watch out though - because frog legs TASTE like chicken!

<div><b>Subject:</b> [letterboxingtexas] Tyler Run-too many to find on a short trip!</div>
<div><br/> </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>I've never understood why Tyler doesn't have more boxes than it does, so it's nice to see that it has gained enough that I'm going to have to make a whole trip of it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had to make an impromptu run to Tyler and be back in Jacksonville by Noon, but for once, I had a little extra time AND the opportunity to grab some clues before I headed up there.  Now I grabbed all the clues I haven't yet found, but a quick glance made me realize there was NO WAY I could find them all this morning!  I've been wanting to find Silver Eagle's Tyler Rose box for quite a long time, so I opted to find the Rose Garden boxes, and maybe the East Texas Fair Grounds box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to the Rose Garden and it was surprisingly very quiet.  Between weddings and reunions and family events and dates and all the other really cool things that happen at the Rose Garden, it's a rare thing to find it empty, but empty it was and pleasant - on one of our first bright mornings in quite a long time it seems! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the countless time since I started letterboxing, I found myself having a sort of a de ja vu/alternate universe sort of experience.  I have been to many, many events at the Rose Garden and gone there quite a few times for pleasure, but I've never gone there on a mission.  Never thought of it in terms of proximities and distances.  I grabbed my clues and read them over one more time, putting the boxes in order in my head and figuring out the logical place to start and headed off.  I quickly found my way to the first box, Silver Eagle's Tyler Rose, and after scratching my head for a few minutes over "which white rock", I suddenly realized I had left one key element of the clue, and when I added it back in, it all fell together!  Isn't that how it goes??? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was such a beautiful morning and it was so unbelievably quiet in the gardens, I couldn't resist hanging out for a few minutes and enjoying a sunny morning.  Finally, though I moved on and went for Atoy Adventurers' Butterflies are Free.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>While I was by Silve Eagle's box, I thought I had heard a bullfrog, but it only happened once so I wasn't positive.  But as I approached Butterflies are Free, I heard it again!  And again!  I haven't heard a bullfrog in ages - even at my in-laws, who live at the quiet end of a lake where all the cool critters collect.  I got to the location of the box and began surveying how to approach the box and the first thing I figured out was that it was a blind reach.  And right after that I concluded I would need my gloves, which I didn't have.  I took stock of the situation and realized that the very manicured garden was stickless, not that a stick would've helped anyway.  Being right on the edge of a pond amongs some big elephant ears and up under a bridge, on a sunny and not yet too hot day, I imagined that if I were a snake, I would find that box to be the perfect pillow upon which to lay my head while I enjoyed the morning!  I SURE didn't want to leave that box though!  I decided to go on and find the other box, Atoy Adventurers' East Texas Rose, and think about it for a bit.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I easily found the location for East Texas Rose and proceeded to look.  Unfortunately, I'm fairly certain I found its hiding spot, but it wasn't there.  The pine straw had been recently disturbed and there was that familiar indentation of a small square object nestled among cover material.  I've emailed the AA's and given them specifics, so hopefully they will tell me I wasn't looking in the right spot.  I guess the best course of action for anyone considering this box is to watch the clues for an update about the status!  So....back to the Butterfly box... </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I was going back to the box, I noticed an angle that might allow me a backside view.  I looked around to see if anyone was anywhere around, because I was going to have to lay down on the sidewalk and I didn't want to attract attention or paramedics or anything.  Still - I couldn't see a thing!  This box is truly unseeable!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now let me digress - I'm not scared of snakes, but I DO have a healthy respect for them.  And in light of She Who Reads' phone call last night from summer camp, I had to stop and give this box a little thought.  She is getting to stay out at Scout Camp and work as the camp nurse this summer, but she calls me every day or two just to catch up with what's going on in the civilized world.   Three weeks into camp she learned that she has been sharing her nice clean, air conditioned nurse's hut with - a snake!  She had no idea until she called a couple of the staff members to get something off a high shelf for her, and when one of them reached up onto the shelf he didn't feel what he thought he should have felt, he felt - a snake!  Well of course, the snake bailed out without introducing himself (can you imagine a snake bailing out from a couple of feet OVER your head???), and so did the staff guys, and SWR was close on everyone's feet (or tail, as the case may be).  Now it probably helps to know the parties involved, which I do (well all but the snake), but I find the whole scenario insanely funny and sobering all at the same time. </div>

<div>Of course, I'm sure he was trying to make it to Tyler to Gander Mountain for their close-out hiking boots and shoes.  That was why I went to Tyler.  50% off last markdown!  I got one pair of hiking boots and one pair of hiking shoes, and a roll of camo duct tape for $51.00!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, he probably needed some good shoes to further improve his speed...  <br/><br/> </div>

July 2006. It has nothing to do with letterboxing but snakes. I am <br/>
very respectfull (scared) of snakes. I went to Ohio to visit my <br/>
daughter and we went to the Stan Hywet Hall &amp; Gardens. The grounds <br/>
are manacured but kinda rustic. I was concerned about snakes and my <br/>
daughter assured me that there are no snakes in Ohio. She was told <br/>
that when she moved there 2 years ago. She was convinced but not me. <br/>
It was a warm day and the grounds had been watered so it was a little <br/>
steamy. We started walking around a lovey rock wall when there he <br/>
was... a snake. I just froze and pointed. She looked and I said I <br/>
told you there was a snake around here. Oh, by the way, I can smell <br/>
snakes before I see them. She just laughed and said that I brought it <br/>
with me on the plane.<br/>

Butterflies<br/>

in ages<br/>
&gt; - even at my in-laws, who live at the quiet end of a lake where all <br/>
the cool<br/>
&gt; critters collect.  I got to the location of the box and began <br/>
surveying how<br/>
&gt; to approach the box and the first thing I figured out was that it <br/>
was a<br/>
&gt; blind reach.  And right after that I concluded I would need my <br/>
gloves, which<br/>
&gt; I didn't have.  I took stock of the situation and realized that the <br/>
very<br/>
&gt; manicured garden was stickless, not that a stick would've helped <br/>
anyway.<br/>
&gt; Being right on the edge of a pond amongs some big elephant ears and <br/>
up under<br/>
&gt; a bridge, on a sunny and not yet too hot day, I imagined that if I <br/>
were a<br/>
&gt; snake, I would find that box to be the perfect pillow upon which to <br/>
lay my<br/>
&gt; head while I enjoyed the morning!  I SURE didn't want to leave that <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; though!  I decided to go on and find the other box, Atoy <br/>
Adventurers' East<br/>
&gt; Texas Rose, and think about it for a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I easily found the location for East Texas Rose and proceeded to <br/>
look.<br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, I'm fairly certain I found its hiding spot, but it <br/>
wasn't<br/>
&gt; there.  The pine straw had been recently disturbed and there was <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; familiar indentation of a small square object nestled among cover <br/>
material.<br/>
&gt; I've emailed the AA's and given them specifics, so hopefully they <br/>
will tell<br/>
&gt; me I wasn't looking in the right spot.  I guess the best course of <br/>
action<br/>
&gt; for anyone considering this box is to watch the clues for an update <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; the status!  So....back to the Butterfly box...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I was going back to the box, I noticed an angle that might allow <br/>
me a<br/>
&gt; backside view.  I looked around to see if anyone was anywhere <br/>
around,<br/>
&gt; because I was going to have to lay down on the sidewalk and I <br/>
didn't want to<br/>
&gt; attract attention or paramedics or anything.  Still - I couldn't <br/>
see a<br/>
&gt; thing!  This box is truly unseeable!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now let me digress - I'm not scared of snakes, but I DO have a <br/>
healthy<br/>
&gt; respect for them.  And in light of She Who Reads' phone call last <br/>
night from<br/>
&gt; summer camp, I had to stop and give this box a little thought.  She <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; getting to stay out at Scout Camp and work as the camp nurse this <br/>
summer,<br/>
&gt; but she calls me every day or two just to catch up with what's <br/>
going on in<br/>
&gt; the civilized world.   Three weeks into camp she learned that she <br/>
has been<br/>
&gt; sharing her nice clean, air conditioned nurse's hut with - a <br/>
snake!  She had<br/>
&gt; no idea until she called a couple of the staff members to get <br/>
something off<br/>
&gt; a high shelf for her, and when one of them reached up onto the <br/>
shelf he<br/>
&gt; didn't feel what he thought he should have felt, he felt - a <br/>
snake!  Well of<br/>
&gt; course, the snake bailed out without introducing himself (can you <br/>
imagine a<br/>
&gt; snake bailing out from a couple of feet OVER your head???), and so <br/>
did the<br/>
&gt; staff guys, and SWR was close on everyone's feet (or tail, as the <br/>
case may<br/>
&gt; be).  Now it probably helps to know the parties involved, which I <br/>
do (well<br/>
&gt; all but the snake), but I find the whole scenario insanely funny and<br/>
&gt; sobering all at the same time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So anyway - back to the box.  In the final analysis, I didn't want <br/>
SWR to be<br/>
&gt; sitting around the campfire tonight telling them about good ol'<br/>
&gt; BarefootLucy, sticking her hand down where she couldn't see without <br/>
gloves<br/>
&gt; and getting bitten by THE snake (because we all know there is only <br/>

<p>I needed to jump in here to tell you a story that happened to me in <br/>July 2006. It has nothing to do with letterboxing but snakes. I am <br/>very respectfull (scared) of snakes. I went to Ohio to visit my <br/>daughter and we went to the Stan Hywet Hall &amp; Gardens. The grounds 
<br/>are manacured but kinda rustic. I was concerned about snakes and my <br/>daughter assured me that there are no snakes in Ohio. She was told <br/>that when she moved there 2 years ago. She was convinced but not me. <br/>It was a warm day and the grounds had been watered so it was a little 
<br/>steamy. We started walking around a lovey rock wall when there he <br/>was... a snake. I just froze and pointed. She looked and I said I <br/>told you there was a snake around here. Oh, by the way, I can smell <br/>snakes before I see them. She just laughed and said that I brought it 
<br/>with me on the plane.<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Barefoot Lucy"

<br/>to make a<br/>&gt; whole trip of it!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I had to make an impromptu run to Tyler and be back in Jacksonville <br/>by<br/>&gt; Noon, but for once, I had a little extra time AND the opportunity <br/>to grab<br/>
&gt; some clues before I headed up there. Now I grabbed all the clues I <br/>haven't<br/>&gt; yet found, but a quick glance made me realize there was NO WAY I <br/>could find<br/>&gt; them all this morning! I've been wanting to find Silver Eagle's 
<br/>Tyler Rose<br/>&gt; box for quite a long time, so I opted to find the Rose Garden <br/>boxes, and<br/>&gt; maybe the East Texas Fair Grounds box.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I got to the Rose Garden and it was surprisingly very quiet. 
<br/>Between<br/>&gt; weddings and reunions and family events and dates and all the other <br/>really<br/>&gt; cool things that happen at the Rose Garden, it's a rare thing to <br/>find it<br/>&gt; empty, but empty it was and pleasant - on one of our first bright 
<br/>mornings<br/>&gt; in quite a long time it seems!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; For the countless time since I started letterboxing, I found myself <br/>having<br/>&gt; a sort of a de ja vu/alternate universe sort of experience. I have 
<br/>been to<br/>&gt; many, many events at the Rose Garden and gone there quite a few <br/>times for<br/>&gt; pleasure, but I've never gone there on a mission. Never thought of <br/>it in<br/>&gt; terms of proximities and distances. I grabbed my clues and read 
<br/>them over<br/>&gt; one more time, putting the boxes in order in my head and figuring <br/>out the<br/>&gt; logical place to start and headed off. I quickly found my way to <br/>the first<br/>&gt; box, Silver Eagle's Tyler Rose, and after scratching my head for a 
<br/>few<br/>&gt; minutes over "which white rock", I suddenly realized I had left one <br/>key<br/>&gt; element of the clue, and when I added it back in, it all fell <br/>together!<br/>&gt; Isn't that how it goes???
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It was such a beautiful morning and it was so unbelievably quiet in <br/>the<br/>&gt; gardens, I couldn't resist hanging out for a few minutes and <br/>enjoying a<br/>&gt; sunny morning. Finally, though I moved on and went for Atoy 
<br/>Adventurers'<br/>&gt; Butterflies are Free.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; While I was by Silve Eagle's box, I thought I had heard a bullfrog, <br/>but it<br/>&gt; only happened once so I wasn't positive. But as I approached 
<br/>Butterflies<br/>&gt; are Free, I heard it again! And again! I haven't heard a bullfrog <br/>in ages<br/>&gt; - even at my in-laws, who live at the quiet end of a lake where all <br/>the cool<br/>&gt; critters collect. I got to the location of the box and began 
<br/>surveying how<br/>&gt; to approach the box and the first thing I figured out was that it <br/>was a<br/>&gt; blind reach. And right after that I concluded I would need my <br/>gloves, which<br/>&gt; I didn't have. I took stock of the situation and realized that the 
<br/>very<br/>&gt; manicured garden was stickless, not that a stick would've helped <br/>anyway.<br/>&gt; Being right on the edge of a pond amongs some big elephant ears and <br/>up under<br/>&gt; a bridge, on a sunny and not yet too hot day, I imagined that if I 
<br/>were a<br/>&gt; snake, I would find that box to be the perfect pillow upon which to <br/>lay my<br/>&gt; head while I enjoyed the morning! I SURE didn't want to leave that <br/>box<br/>&gt; though! I decided to go on and find the other box, Atoy 
<br/>Adventurers' East<br/>&gt; Texas Rose, and think about it for a bit.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I easily found the location for East Texas Rose and proceeded to <br/>look.<br/>&gt; Unfortunately, I'm fairly certain I found its hiding spot, but it 
<br/>wasn't<br/>&gt; there. The pine straw had been recently disturbed and there was <br/>that<br/>&gt; familiar indentation of a small square object nestled among cover <br/>material.<br/>&gt; I've emailed the AA's and given them specifics, so hopefully they 
<br/>will tell<br/>&gt; me I wasn't looking in the right spot. I guess the best course of <br/>action<br/>&gt; for anyone considering this box is to watch the clues for an update <br/>about<br/>&gt; the status! So....back to the Butterfly box...
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As I was going back to the box, I noticed an angle that might allow <br/>me a<br/>&gt; backside view. I looked around to see if anyone was anywhere <br/>around,<br/>&gt; because I was going to have to lay down on the sidewalk and I 
<br/>didn't want to<br/>&gt; attract attention or paramedics or anything. Still - I couldn't <br/>see a<br/>&gt; thing! This box is truly unseeable!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now let me digress - I'm not scared of snakes, but I DO have a 
<br/>healthy<br/>&gt; respect for them. And in light of She Who Reads' phone call last <br/>night from<br/>&gt; summer camp, I had to stop and give this box a little thought. She <br/>is<br/>&gt; getting to stay out at Scout Camp and work as the camp nurse this 
<br/>summer,<br/>&gt; but she calls me every day or two just to catch up with what's <br/>going on in<br/>&gt; the civilized world. Three weeks into camp she learned that she <br/>has been<br/>&gt; sharing her nice clean, air conditioned nurse's hut with - a 
<br/>snake! She had<br/>&gt; no idea until she called a couple of the staff members to get <br/>something off<br/>&gt; a high shelf for her, and when one of them reached up onto the <br/>shelf he<br/>&gt; didn't feel what he thought he should have felt, he felt - a 
<br/>snake! Well of<br/>&gt; course, the snake bailed out without introducing himself (can you <br/>imagine a<br/>&gt; snake bailing out from a couple of feet OVER your head???), and so <br/>did the<br/>&gt; staff guys, and SWR was close on everyone's feet (or tail, as the 
<br/>case may<br/>&gt; be). Now it probably helps to know the parties involved, which I <br/>do (well<br/>&gt; all but the snake), but I find the whole scenario insanely funny and<br/>&gt; sobering all at the same time.<br/>&gt; 
<br/>&gt; So anyway - back to the box. In the final analysis, I didn't want <br/>SWR to be<br/>&gt; sitting around the campfire tonight telling them about good ol'<br/>&gt; BarefootLucy, sticking her hand down where she couldn't see without 
<br/>gloves<br/>&gt; and getting bitten by THE snake (because we all know there is only <br/>one snake<br/>&gt; in all of East Texas, so certainly her snake made it to Tyler to <br/>the Rose<br/>&gt; Garden to relax after his traumatic experience in his cozy little 
<br/>home with<br/>&gt; her). I opted to leave that particular box for another much colder <br/>day.<br/>&gt; The bad thing about it? That bullfrog just kept croakin' - I know <br/>he was<br/>&gt; laughing at me for being a chicken! He'd better watch out though -
