                    <html><body><p>Another TALE has come and gone and it was fun seeing
everyone again, plus meeting some new folks from out of state.<span>  </span>From Alabama we had ST-Ranger (not a stranger
anymore) and Knotty Lady (if she was naughty I didn’t see it), from California
there was Dark Zen (proud owner of a buffalo plaque) and Evil Cow Pie (loved
the apron), and from Ohio there was Acorns4U (too bad you had to leave so
soon).<span>  </span>I hope y’all had fun and come
back again, especially for Live &amp; Breathe XX in 2018.<span>  </span>We also had a birthday girl, Narnian, and I
hope she enjoyed the party we put on just for her.</p>
<p>I was really pleased with how well the park had recovered from
hurricane damage and we really lucked out on the weather, surviving a storm the
night before the event.<span>  </span>I was a little
worried when I saw all the trails closed the next morning, but by the time we
starting boxing most were open again.<span> 
</span>There were some reports of snake sightings but thankfully no bites.<span>  </span>The raffle went well, mainly because I didn’t
get any “surprise” gifts this year, and I hope everyone had a good time even if
they were embarrassed like Pink Cookie.<span> 
</span>I have uploaded pictures for TALE 14 and the pre-TALE dinner event on
AQ, so please add any you have.</p><p><br/></p>
<p>Special thanks to Echo &amp; Stiches for organizing the
dinner at Catfish Cabin and the night boxing.<span> 
</span>Thanks also to everyone for continuing to come and for helping out.<span>  </span>We really are like a big family and I look
forward to these “annual reunions”.<span>  </span>See
you next year, if not sooner!</p><p><br/></p>
