the opportunity to replace two letterboxes that had gone missing:
"Unbroken Promises" in Fredericksburg and "Waylon and
Willie" in Luckenbach. Thinking the original locations of the two boxes
were part of the reason that they disappeared, I placed the new boxes in
slightly different spots. Since that time, the two boxes have presented sort of
a mystery to me. I would get reports that the boxes were found, then I would
get reports that they were missing or at least couldn't be found. Then, someone
would find them. I couldn't figure out why some people seemingly had no problem
finding them and others couldn't find them at all. A couple of weeks ago when
two respected and experienced letterboxers, Mosaic Butterfly and Corazon
reported that they couldn't find either box, I decided to see if there was a
problem in the clues. I first went into LbNA and read the clues. They seemed
correct and straight-forward. Then, I went into Atlas Quest and the clues for
both boxes were for the original locations! I can't believe that when I posted
the new clues for both boxes, I didn't update them on AQ! If you recently tried
to find these boxes using AQ clues, I sincerely apologize for leading you
astray. On the other hand, you can't revisit Fredericksburg or Luckenbach too
many times, can you? <br/>
