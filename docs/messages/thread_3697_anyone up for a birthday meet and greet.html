then I thought if I invited all of y'all maybe some of you could teach <br/>

the one thing he carves over and over.  I swear to you he has 8 of the <br/>
same stamp, I guess he's trying for perfection.  He could also use <br/>
help on making logbooks and other stuff.  <br/>
So is anyone up for this and how do I go about putting this together.  <br/>
Anyone want to help?<br/>
Thanks<br/>

We are going to be out of town the last week of Sept. though Oct. We <br/>
will be spending time in OH with our daughter who also has a BD the <br/>
21st of Oct. We will be letterboxing in Stark County OH. She does not <br/>
letterbox but we will try to get her interested. Hope you all have <br/>
fun.<br/>
