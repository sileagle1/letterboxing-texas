                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Duck Ducks were thinking of having a camping birthday party for my <br>
dear husband who is turning 40 in October at Tawakoni State Park.  And <br>
then I thought if I invited all of y'all maybe some of you could teach <br>
him some tricks of the trade....like how to carve something more than <br>
the one thing he carves over and over.  I swear to you he has 8 of the <br>
same stamp, I guess he's trying for perfection.  He could also use <br>
help on making logbooks and other stuff.  <br>
So is anyone up for this and how do I go about putting this together.  <br>
Anyone want to help?<br>
Thanks<br>

We are going to be out of town the last week of Sept. though Oct. We <br>
will be spending time in OH with our daughter who also has a BD the <br>
21st of Oct. We will be letterboxing in Stark County OH. She does not <br>
letterbox but we will try to get her interested. Hope you all have <br>
fun.<br>
