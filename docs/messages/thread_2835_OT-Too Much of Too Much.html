                    <html><body><div>In light of Puddle Splasher's recent moving woes, I feel I can share my own woes here.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have too much stuff.  Too much.  And I have too many interests.  Too many.  And the interests that I have, well, I get too interested.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox, normally mild-mannered and kind (especially for a fox), issued an ultimatum last weekend.  Clean my study.  (Actually an ultimatum has an "or" on the end - I guess he issued an edict, didn't he?)  I've been working on it for a week, and I've come to the conclusion it cannot be cleaned.  The more I work on it, the worse it gets.  For you FlyBabies, my study is a study in CHAOS.  When FlyLady wrote about CHAOS, she was sitting in my study!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I've mentioned, our pack has recently had to move from the church's old building to their new building, and because they've given us less space, much of the stuff we have has wound up at my house until I can sort through it and reduce it.  At this point, I'm up to about 5000 fuzzy colorful pipe cleaners.  No kidding.  I'm thinking somewhere around 8 shoeboxes of old crayons, not to mention quite a few boxes of crayons in crayola boxes.  And markers?  I now have enough markers for every boy in the pack to have 
2.5 boxes of markers - EACH.  Any size of dowel rod you can imagine.  Four American flags fly proudly around my computer - I feel like the President.  Paints enough to paint a whole VW van - in true hippy style. 4 little tiny flashlight bulbs - now how on earth do I keep up with THOSE and ever be able to find them again? Plastic tablecloths (some for that once a year banquet, and others for the annual picnic).  Sandwich baggies.  Index cards - a dozen packages of those!  I have handbooks for every rank, a dozen cub scout caps, how many neckerchiefs - who can even count?  And this is all in my study.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now then, as you also recall, I recently did letterboxing at Cub Scout camp and after that was over I pulled all the boxes, so I have 13 boxes (one has now been planted) sitting in my study, along with numerous empty containers, notebooks of clues for various areas, Y'all all know how letterboxing stuff swells as it's been left alone awhile.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And then there is the old homeschool curriculum.  I KNOW I could get rid of some of this - but where to start? No one I know uses the same method we used (anybody here use Charlotte Mason and want some good books?).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And maps, because I love maps.  And computer equipment because Fearless Fox knows that I will eventually have a computer crisis and he wants to have the hardware on hand to fix my every problem (mmmhmmm).  And notebooks for every rabbit trail I've ever chased (because I want to be organized while I'm chasing wild hares!).  And music of course, bunches of CD's along with written music and my guitars.  Don't forget the telescope.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I knew I was in trouble when She Who Reads (who is currently She Who Is Working on Day Camp) called me and asked me if I had a woodburner - "Why yes, I have six".  And what about leatherworking mallets?  "Eight of those, and the stampy thingies too".  Can I borrow some paint?  "Of course, I'll just give you all the partial bottles and then you don't have to worry about giving them back."  What about Boys' Life magazines?  "No problem, I get four issues of that every month.  How many copies do you need?"  And her next call - Do you have any cardstock paper?  "Why of course.  What color do you need?  White?  Would that be pure white or off-white, or maybe cream?"
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Thankfully, I belong to FreeCycle and was able to get rid of the extra printer I've had hooked up to my computer for ages, fifteen books we had all read, bunches of posters I took down after I started this project last weekend.  Between those items and the Fun Machine and the refrigerator I got rid of two weekends ago, there is now one little man who says he will take anything I give away - and now I worry that much like I open the back door to the dog begging for scraps, I'm going to begin opening the front door to this little guy waiting to see what I'm going to be giving away next.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I ever manage to get rid of all this stuff, I'm never gonna let things get this out of control again.  And just out of curiosity, what DO we do with 5000 fuzzy colorful pipe cleaners???</div>
