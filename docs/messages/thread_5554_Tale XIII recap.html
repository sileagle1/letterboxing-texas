                    <html><body><p><span>Once again, thanks to all that made this another fun filled weekend.   Starting on Friday, with a lunch gathering in Sealy organized by Mosaic Butterfly, where we met new boxers and saw old friends, while enjoying a "healthy" lunch.   Then on to Stephen F. Austin State Park and opening the screened hall for the weekend.  Boxers trickled in over the next hours, doing exchanges and hiding boxes.  Though the park was flooded a few weeks earlier by the Brazos River, we made due with the few trails that were open, and some still found a way onto the closed trails.  Dinner was everyone for themselves.  Some left, some ate there.  Then we had a campfire in the group camping area for all to enjoy.</span></p><p><span><br/>Saturday morning we opened the hall at 6am, and it did not take long for the coffee lovers to show up.   The main part of group arrived about 9am, and started exchanging with the new boxers and boxers from other states, while others hit the trails to find boxes.   Lunch started about noon, and WOW what a layout of food (really enjoyed the Brown E's).   After lunch we took the required Group Photo, then everyone was off to have fun in the park on a beautiful day.   Although many snakes were seen, no one got bit this year!!!!!   Blue Butterfly did have a run in with a mud pit, but came back with some help from friends, sock and all.   At 6:30ish we started the raffle (did I mention Valuable Prizes).   Silver Eagle god a special gift which he modeled for the group - keep an eye out on YouTube for the video.   Once the normal raffle items were gone we put out the special prizes, but since it was April Fools weekend, all of them were not so special.   After those (bras, boxers, bears in places they should not be), we gave away the real special prizes, with GG taking the big prize at the end.  Later we lit the fire and shared stories until about 11pm.   </span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Sunday - we began cleaning up about 9am (THANK you to all that helped!!!!) and closed down the hall at 11am.  Quite a few boxers were still in the park finding boxes, some deciding to stay another night to finish.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>All in all, another fun way to meet old friends and new ones.   Thanks again to everyone that could come, and we hope to see you and others next year!!!!</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>PS - Okay, I have say the only downfall was multiple insults from Ira Boxer.  My Hero box was in poor taste, as was your shorts hanging in the hall, and the pickled bear in the jar topped it off.   I guess I will need to find new way to rid Texas of you........</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>I would agree if it weren't for certain personal comments made by the bear.  Most of the folks, I believe, are sympathetic to my plight, knowing that I was heartlessly murdered by said bear when I was just enjoying a little boxing at the Arboretum.  I do watch the event from a higher plane, so I know who does and who doesn't.  Of course there are a few that persist in being just mean-spirited, like Mud Bug (the Cobalt Insect), who maintains a society in East Texas whose sole purpose is to deal me misery.  And the one who placed the image of the Ultimate Fool.  I understand how that hideous offspring of the bear and the clown could be seen as foolish, but to clothe it in my signature Boxer shorts was just rude.  What was her name?  Litter Box, I believe, or something like that.  It's something I won't forget.</p><div><br/></div><div>The Ghost of IRA Boxer</div></body></html>
