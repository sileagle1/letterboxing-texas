of the least expensive state schools in Texas, and b) it's the <br/>
closest University to Big Bend. I figured if I was gonna sell my car, <br/>
quit my job, move across the state to where I don't know anyone, and <br/>
go into debt for my education, I might as well do it somewhere I'm <br/>
gonna enjoy. My girlfriend on the other hand works 2 jobs part-time <br/>

to Houston, where I'm from). off to class <br/>

<p>Hang in there a few more hours! A cold front came through Amarillo<br/>last night, and is, I'm sure, on its way to you! It's not COLD now,<br/>but it's definitely drier and in the 70s. <br/><br/>Or you could just move to Amarillo, where the summer heat is balanced
<br/>out by winter blizzards... ;-)<br/><br/>Lore<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>
