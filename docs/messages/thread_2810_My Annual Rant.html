thing"... I'm not working right now, I'm just doing the school thing, <br>
and part of the reason I'm going to Sul Ross is because a) It's one <br>
of the least expensive state schools in Texas, and b) it's the <br>
closest University to Big Bend. I figured if I was gonna sell my car, <br>
quit my job, move across the state to where I don't know anyone, and <br>
go into debt for my education, I might as well do it somewhere I'm <br>
gonna enjoy. My girlfriend on the other hand works 2 jobs part-time <br>
jobs... it's a good thing the cost of living is so low here (compared <br>
to Houston, where I'm from). off to class <br>

Current weather at 7:30am...clear and 61 degrees, with a projected <br>
high of 84 degrees and thunderstorms.<br>
