                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
We are going to be camping in Bastrop State Park next<br>
week and I have found links to a few clues. Does<br>
anyone know if these are all in working order and if<br>
there are any more out there:<br>
Houston Toad<br>
Lost Loblolly<br>
Poison Ivy<br>
Trail rider<br>
O-knot<br>
<br>
We will be adding a box and hopefully leaving an HH<br>
somewhere.<br>
Cheers and happy hunting! And thanks for the warm<br>
welcome from so many,<br>
Cheers<br>

checked out Lost Loblolly and Poison Ivy and they are both alive and <br>
well.  Trail Rider was wet and, although the logbook and stamp were <br>
there, in bags full of water, the box was missing.  We tried to <br>
clean it up, put in a new logbook, put everything in new heavy duty <br>
ziplock freezer bags, but unfortunately didn't have a new box with <br>
us.  You might take a box when you go if you can.  Also, look for <br>
Cool Cat.  It's on the same trail and in good condition.  We didn't <br>
make it by Houston Toad or o-knot.  McKinney Roughs Nature Park is <br>
about 8 miles west of Bastrop and it's a very cool place with 4 <br>
letterboxes (nearest town listed as Cedar Creek).  There is a fee, <br>
so you might want to check it out online.<br>
