<p>You've brought up a really good point! I think we've all fallen victim to planting a box in one season, only to find it under water in the spring (too close to a dried creek bed or wash area that wasn't noticeable during the winter), or as often happens in my case, a thorny bramble vine or poison ivy sprouts up around the base of a tree where I have a box planted. You're wise to scout out your locations in different seasons when possible! I had someone angry with me once because there were fire ants around my box. Obviously they weren't there when I planted it, but it's going to happen from time to time when we plant boxes in nature. I think it's smart to really check out an area where you plan to plant, but sometimes the spot undergoes changes beyond your control, so it also smart for the finders to use caution. One of the most important factors in boxes lasting a long time (besides finding a really good hiding place) is for those finding the box to exercise extreme stealth and to make sure the box is well hidden after they replace it (sometimes just throwing on a fresh pile of twigs and leaves is all it takes).

I've been thinking about this for some time so decided to start figuring out the exact spots. Last summer and fall, before leaves fell, I had some great spots in mind. But now I've seen these spots in winter, I realized they were kind of naked and boxes would be easily seen. That's something that I, being relatively new to boxing, had never thought about. Just glad I hadn't placed them or they might be gone by now. <br/></letterboxingtexas></got2tri></p></body>

<div>Re Fake Rocks:</div>
<div>One of Celtic Lions' letterboxes in Dallas was hidden in a fake rock in a really great location near the longhorn cattle sculpture near Dallas City Hall, one of the first letterboxes in the Dallas area, by Ruby Tuesday.  Her husband, Stillwater, made the rock and the letterbox fit into a cavity under the back of the fake rock.  It was really cool!  But it disappeared fairly quickly, within the first six months it was out there, so apparently it wasn't as good a hiding place after all.  Landscapers?  Homeless people sleeping in the bushes?  All potential issues for planting a letterbox in an urban area, maybe not so much in the real woods.  Although, the two letterboxes I had planted in Waxahachie both fell prey to park maintenance in the nature preserve: one in a log that got removed, the other in a dead tree that also was removed.  Whatever happened to allowing nature to take its course and letting dead trees return slowly to nature!  Anyway, it's always tricky trying to anticipate all the possible hazards to a letterbox, even a carefully-planned location and good hide.  Worse problem:  accidental finding by a geocacher who doesn't know the difference, or finding by a group of kids who haven't yet realized the need for stealth and careful re-hiding (Recover Well is the letterbox mantra!)</div>
<div>Happy hiding!  </div>

<div>Thought about making a fake rock or tree stump to hide your letterbox in? It's something that as a geocacher/letterboxer, I would consider doing for a letterbox if the area could not support it (provide cover) for it and if that is an area that needs letterboxes you want to place.Just a thought...<br clear="none"/>
