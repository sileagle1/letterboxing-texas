our letterboxes last week and for their kind words.  And thanks for <br/>
the new ones you planted as well.  We've been in Austin all week <br/>
staying at McKinney Falls SP and have had only limited Internet <br/>
access (had to go to Denny's to find a Wi-Fi hot spot), so have been <br/>
out of touch mostly. We met El Lobo and Star Seeker there and we <br/>
letterboxed together all week.  I'll write more when we get home. I <br/>
enjoyed Silver Eagle's story about going down the dirt road to the <br/>
cemetery to find Sarah's Flag letterbox.  Gryzzled Gryphon not only <br/>
negotiated that road in his Cranberry Cruiser, but he did it in the <br/>
dark.  He parked the CC at the cattle guard in Madison County and <br/>
walked to the cemetery in Grimes County.  I also wanted everyone to <br/>
know that we found the Lost Pines letterbox by Eoghan yesterday <br/>
morning.  It's in perfect condition.  I found the clues on the <br/>
Wayback Machine as suggested by Silver Eagle at the Wildflower Event, <br/>
and it was the highlight of our week.  We found 29 letterboxes in 5 <br/>
days, or about the daily average for Silver Eagle and Baby Bear.  We <br/>
also planted 12 new boxes in the area, including 2 each at McKinney <br/>
Falls State Park and McKinney Roughs Nature Area, both great parks.  <br/>
I hope Dewberry made it to McKinney Roughs to find our boxes (we hid <br/>
some clues for her) and the two that were already there.  I'll be <br/>
posting the clues this weekend when we get home.  Y'all have a Happy <br/>
Easter.<br/>
