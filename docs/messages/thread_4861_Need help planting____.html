</p><div>Hi Melissa, and welcome to letterboxing.</div>
<div>I'm sure there are plenty of helpful people out there who will help you plant, but I would strongly suggest that you plant at least your first box yourself. It's such a wonderful feeling of accomplishment to find a cool place and write the clues - especially for your first box. I'd hate for you to miss out on that! I still remember planting my first box and how nervous I was. I was so thrilled when people started emailing me that they had found my box and liked the stamp, or the hike or clues... whatever. Obviously, some people enjoy carving more than hiding, or hiding more than writing clues, etc, but I think you'll really experience the whole thrill if you plant your boxes yourself. I think I may be the opposite - I usually find a place that just "screams letterbox" before I actually carve the stamp. I have several of those locations right now, and as soon as the weather breaks a little, I plan to carve the stamps and plant them.</div>
<div>Have fun!</div>
