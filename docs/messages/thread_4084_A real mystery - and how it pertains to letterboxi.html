Quite a few thoughts passed through our minds before Jay Drew and the detective finally connected. We had the unfortunate thought that perhaps someone had been injured near a box in that area. It occurred to us that perhaps they found contraband in a box. We had no idea...<br/>
<br/>Turns out, the detective was investigating the above fire and as they were scouring the area, they discovered what appeared to be a letterbox. As he described it, it sounded more like a geocache or perhaps a hybrid (there was a trinket and a stick of gum), but it had a logbook. He hopes that maybe he can locate folks who had been to the island recently and might have seen or noticed something that will help in the investigation. Jay has offered to go to Hanover to take a look at the logbook and see if he can figure out who the finders are and Jay should be able to figure out what it really is and get the detective pointed in the right direction.<br/>
<br/>Anyway, thought it was interesting how stashing games have woven their way into real life yet again...<br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>
