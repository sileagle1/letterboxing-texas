Even though the criteria search (e.g. specifying Region, State, County, City, etc.) works, it would be better to get the Location search to work since it returns not just specified boxes but ones nearby.  In the case of sugar land, even though it currently doesn't show 2 of my recently placed boxes, it does show one by Baby Bear (Texas Sprint Champion) that does not show up on the City search because he misspelled the city as one word (sugarland).<br/>
