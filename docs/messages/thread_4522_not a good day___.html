Well we found the geo on the way down but did not find the first 4 of the 6 boxes in the series we went to get in El Paso. So sad. Didn't even try for the last 2 letterboxes. Went to a park to find a different geo and probably walked right past another LB but who knows if it was even there. <br>

SIGH.<br>

well 1 of something is better than nothing and saw some neat places so all is not lost. <br>

<div>Have you gotten any word back from the placer or placers? Maybe they can shed some light on the missing boxes. </div>
