                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning.<br/>
<br/>
Still recovering from jet-lag - but settling in at home now.  We had a GREAT<br/>
time.  In many ways, Germany has not changed.  In other ways - it has<br/>
changed completely.  Progress?<br/>
<br/>
I never even thought of a letterbox over there.  We got up at 0600 every<br/>
day, and pretty much stayed awake and moving until we couldn't keep our eyes<br/>
open every night.  And we were busy nearly every minute.  On the family<br/>
front, it was perfect.  My wife's mom and dad are getting old - mid-70s.<br/>
But they are in good health and are doing just fine.  Her sister Gerda is<br/>
just as I remember her, except her English is much improved (as is my German<br/>
again - now).  Gerda is the manager of a supermarket across the street from<br/>
a U.S. Army housing complex, she has plenty of time to use her English<br/>
daily.  We had not met her husband Helmut ever (27 years) but we hit it<br/>
right off perfectly.  Gerda and Helmut are both ham radio operators, so a<br/>
lot of our activities centered around radio (as it was 27 years ago when I<br/>
was there).<br/>
<br/>
The base I was assigned to is still there.  The building I was assigned to<br/>
is now the post office.  That is about the sum total of the time I spent<br/>
looking over the military side of my life over there.<br/>
<br/>
About half the days the weather sucked.  Some days it was so hot and humid<br/>
we were uncomfortable (from the humidity, not heat).  Other days it was so<br/>
cold-windy-foggy-raining that we had rain coats over winter jackets.  We did<br/>
not let that stop us.  Helmut has a bad leg, motorcycle accident when he was<br/>
young.  That doesn't stop him.  I and Helmut climbed 7 summits to operate<br/>
ham radio.  3 of them the ladies accompanied us.  I have operated with rain<br/>
dripping off my nose, and with sweat dripping off my nose.  4 of the summits<br/>
had a restaurant at the top.  3 summits were in formerly enemy occupied<br/>
territory, East Germany.  This was behind the Iron Curtain, it was the<br/>
reason I was there for 7-1/2 years.  We never approached the border with<br/>
under a squad of riflemen, fully armed - locked and loaded.  This time there<br/>
was nothing to stop us.<br/>
<br/>
The first time we crossed the border I was very anxious.  Old feelings are<br/>
hard to let go of.  I didn't know what to expect.  Well - we spent a total<br/>
of 4 days in the formerly occupied area.  At least half a dozen times men<br/>
stopped me on the streets and shook my hand and thanked me for standing on<br/>
the border and eventually forcing the fall of the curtain and causing them<br/>
to be free.  I got to tour the border check-point in the Meiningen Gap,<br/>
where I was stationed.  It is abandoned now, and somewhat vandalized.  I<br/>
only wanted to spend a few moments reflecting.  We spent over two hours and<br/>
it was pretty emotional for me.  You need to understand that border was more<br/>
meant to keep them in than to keep us out.  It was obvious by the placement<br/>
of the (now disconnected) electric fence.  <br/>
<br/>
In one restaurant in the city of Meiningen we were not allowed to pay for<br/>
our dinner.  The restaurant owner had tears in his eyes as he shook my hand<br/>
and told me of how he was forced to work the border as a Young Pioneer" of<br/>
the state, forced to learn and speak Russian and guard the border.  By the<br/>
time he had finished, I too had tears in my eyes.  We slept one night in a<br/>
motel - this was too cool.  It is owned by a widow lady named Angelina.  She<br/>
is your typical East-European/Russian, well-built with short cropped blond<br/>
hair and muscular arms.  She and her son are slowly converting a former<br/>
Russian Army Barracks into a hotel, room by room.  The rooms are nice, but<br/>
it is fully obvious what the building was.  We paid about $15 per person.<br/>
These people are converting from Communism to Capitalism.  Every place we<br/>
could get away with it we left a huge tip and a big thank-you.  That wasn't<br/>
often.<br/>
<br/>
I used to belong to a radio club in Schweinfurt, B-14 for Bavarian Club #14.<br/>
Sadly, they are all old men now and very inactive.  I only talked to one<br/>
member, and he said about half the friends I asked about are dead now or so<br/>
old they are inactive.  Helmut belongs to B-10 in Bad Neustadt.  I made lots<br/>
of new friends there.  I also made many friends in X-34, the city of<br/>
Meiningen in the state of Turinga.  They were extremely interested in my<br/>
radio equipment and my portable antenna.<br/>
<br/>
So we are back.  Next summer we are sending my son and his new bride (as of<br/>
30 July) to visit Germany for a wedding present.  When they come back they<br/>
will escort cousin Andrias to El Paso for a vacation.  Two years from now<br/>
Gerda and Helmut hope to visit us.  When will we go back?  Not sure, but I<br/>
won't wait another 27 years this time.<br/>
<br/>
I will be posting stories of our mountain outings on the web - I will let<br/>
you-all know here so you can read it if you like.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - when I got home - poor River nearly pee'd on himself for joy.  I missed<br/>
him too.<br/>

Too bad, since it might have lead you to some new places.  Even if you didn't have time to find any boxes you could have placed at least one for others to find and enjoy.  Not sure why you consider yourself a letterboxer when you act like it is such a chore.  I think you are just a Ham at heart.<br/>

The family over there never heard of Letterboxing - or Geocaching.  But they<br/>
are all ham radio operators.  My life over there 27 years ago had a lot to<br/>
do with radio.<br/>

What else can I say?<br/>
