                    <html><body><div>Thanks again to everyone who gave me ideas for boxing while on Houston this past weekend. I desperately wanted to go after the Holiday Lights series in Memorial Park but just didn't have the time. So I managed to squeeze in "I Spy Houston" which was a lot of fun, even though we didn't find the box. I'm not sure if it's gone, or just buried under vegitation. As there were people hanging around enjoying the day, we didn't look to hard so as not to draw their attention. But a very enjoyable hunt for some visiting from out of town who wants to get to see your beautiful city.</div> <div> </div> <div>We did find SilverEagle's Houston Hummer. Nice plant in a nice little park not far from my sons apartment.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks again and I'll give a shout out next time I am heading down. Would love to meet up with some boxers for exchanges.</div> <div> </div> <div>H&amp;H</div><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You
