I love the hill country!!   For those who make it to Lost Maples, you will find the story has been set straight, and no Turkey is safe with IRA around.  I hope you all had a great holiday, and wish you all a safe and wonderful Christmas.......well almost everyone.<br>

Can't wait until you become The Ghost of LB Bozo, and you and IRA can haunt each other.  I've seen that trained bear you have in your circus tent. PS - Mable said to quit leaving bear treat on our porch.<br>
