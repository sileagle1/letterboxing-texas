                    <div class="plaintext-content">Excellent reminders!  I've had at least 3 boxes "self bury" themselves - two in deteriorating trees (which generate a LOT more wood mulch than you would think!) and one in the ground.  We've managed to unearth them by persistent hunting/digging after getting "can't find" email messages from hunters.  Freezer baggies are a must in our state, but they are still no match for the clever raccoons and opossums who manage to open the boxes and gnaw/rip through the contents to try to find something tasty.<br>
