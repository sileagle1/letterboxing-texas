<div>No one can say things 
quite like Lucy, and I won't even try.  I hope I didn't make it seem like I 
don't want new letterboxers with my post about re hiding, we were all new boxers 
once, and all had to learn as we went along.  I think that if I would have 
seen the pictures of the two letterboxes when I first started letterboxing it 
would have made it very clear to me how important it is to take the time to 
cover a box well.  It is one thing to read when people write about re 
hiding, and quite another to see it in a photo.  Welcome to all new 
members, as dear Lucy said we are all glad that you are here!

<div>ditto again (sorry, that's redundant) Lucy and MO5.  I wouldn't keep 
putting those boxes out there if I didn't want them to be found, and I'm really 
happy about all the new activity in our area - I expect to be able to find many 
more boxes planted by new boxers in the coming months!  --

<div>You surely didn't sound like you were trying to run off newbies, but I am hoping we can really get a good discussion going about how to get them up and running, so I wanted to make sure they know they are welcome before we get into a big discussion.

<div>And that would be up and running TO boxes and not running AWAY from us!</div>
