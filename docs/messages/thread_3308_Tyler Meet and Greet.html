You were missed tonight.  I hope you and your family are doing as <br>

eat a piece of pizza for you.  With all the stamps and logbooks <br>
flying, I hardly a chance to eat myself.  I love olives and pepperoni <br>
on my pizza and knew that was out of the question.  I did try for the <br>
bourbon balls, but couldn't find them.  Maybe at Bastrop Lake?<br>
<br>
Hope to see you soon, <br>

<div>OK, folks, here's the word on the bourbon balls:  they are my recipe, 
which I've made at Christmas every year for the past 5 or 6 years, share with 
neighbors and my family, and pig out on myself.   I make them with 
Maker's Mark, top-of-the-line Kentucky bourbon, and they aren't cooked so all 
that delicious bourbon flavor is there -- along with the alcohol content, so 
they are <em><u>not</u></em> for the kiddies or anyone who avoids alcohol.  
Since I won't be coming to the Bastrop meeting (a conflict of dates for me), I 
think PuddleSplasher has offered to make them and bring them to the gatherng in 
my absence.  Enjoy, and if you can still think at all after having a couple 
of the tasty little chocolate-cherry-bourbon treats, think of me!</div>
