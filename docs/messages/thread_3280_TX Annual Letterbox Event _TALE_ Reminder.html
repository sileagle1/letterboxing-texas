Last year we had 2 demonstrations of letterboxing techniques and I <br/>
was wondering if there was any interest this year, and for what?  If <br/>
you want to see a demo on something, mention it here and hopefully <br/>
someone will volunteer to give it.  If there is no interest in demos, <br/>
maybe some of you could just do a "Show &amp; Tell" of your letterbox <br/>
supplies that you really like (e.g. markers, carving tools, logbooks, <br/>
etc.).<br/>
<br/>
Also last year, we played a letterbox trivia game with prizes for the <br/>
winners.  This year we will be playing a TX Letterbox Match game, <br/>
where you match a TX letterbox with its placer.  So start looking at <br/>
the almost 2000 boxes listed on LBNA, because no cheat sheets will be <br/>
allowed!<br/>

This event would be GREAT for anyone new to letterboxing!  You will <br/>
have a chance to make new friends, find LOTS of letterboxes, eat some <br/>
wonderful food, and learn from more experienced people.<br/>

I hope to see you there!<br/>

<div>I'd also like to suggest a discussion about what makes a good letterboxing 
plant location, and why.  Recently, I've walked away from a few boxes 
because something about the location made me uncomfortable, and sometimes I've 
wondered why anyone would choose to put a box in a particular place for 
others to come to.   I've found boxes that I know won't last long 
because the location is in an obvious flood area or sitting in the middle of a 
well-groomed garden where it's sure to be discovered and probably trashed 
as the landscape is maintained.  I've found boxes covered only in a handful 
of leaves or grass, which is sure to blow away and leave the box 
exposed.   But mostly, I've wondered what there is about 
some locations that would possibly attract a finder's interest, why someone 
planted a box to invite finders to discover and explore this spot, or why a 
planter would put others at possible risk -- and wondered if they were they just 
looking for a place to throw a box!  </div>
<div>    As the number of letterboxers -- and letterboxes -- 
increases exponentially in Texas, I think we all have a responsibility to choose 
carefully where to plant:  a safe area (and I don't necessarily mean 
"easy," but a place where a letterboxer would not feel threatened), a unique or 
scenic or historic or just plain interesting place that you'd like to lead 
others to discover through letterboxing, and a well-camouflaged, well-placed, 
well-hidden box that isn't likely to be considered road litter.   I 
think, along with how to carve good stamps and make good logbooks and write 
clever clues, maybe a little more attention to this important aspect of 
letterboxing is due.  After all, putting yourself or your kids at risk to 
find a piece of rubber in a plastic box isn't what the game is all about. </div>
<div>Well, that's my 2 cents worth.</div>

<div>    As the number of letterboxers -- and letterboxes -- increases exponentially in Texas, I think we all have a responsibility to choose carefully where to plant:  a safe area (and I don't necessarily mean "easy," but a place where a letterboxer would not feel threatened), a unique or scenic or historic or just plain interesting place that you'd like to lead others to discover through letterboxing, and a well-camouflaged, well-placed, well-hidden box that isn't likely to be considered road litter.   I think, along with how to carve good stamps and make good logbooks and write clever clues, maybe a little more attention to this important aspect of letterboxing is due.  After all, putting yourself or your kids at risk to find a piece of rubber in a plastic box isn't what the game is all about.

created a database.  Anyone can add a line with their name and <br/>

<h3>Trail death disturbs local hikers 
  </h3>
<p><b>By AMY RILEY </b>- 
  <b>01/12/08</b><br/><a href="http://content.times-herald.com/367576700025810.bsp">http://content.times-herald.com/367576700025810.bsp</a><br/></p>
<p></p>
<p>News this week that 24-year-old hiker 
  Meredith Emerson was found <br/>dead in the north Georgia mountains hit the 
  Newnan Hiking Club part-<br/>icularly hard. </p>
<p>A group of 18 from the club, which is 
  based out of Robbie and Mary <br/>Hinely's Hit the Trail shop in downtown 
  Newnan, just hiked Blood <br/>Mountain, where Emerson was last seen alive, in 
  November. </p>
<p>"I'm deeply disturbed by individuals that 
  choose a trailhead to target <br/>people, especially women," said Craig Fowler, 
  Newnan Hiking Club <br/>organizer. "The state and national trails are some of 
  the last refuges <br/>for people who just want to enjoy nature and don't want 
  to have to <br/>worry about crime." </p>
<p>Fowler's first recommendation is always to 
  hike in pairs or in small groups. </p>
<p>"That why I joined the [Newnan Hiking] 
  club," said Tricia Mahoney, a P<br/>eachtree City resident who first met Craig 
  and Lisa Fowler through the <br/>Hinelys at Hit the Trail, where she was 
  shopping for some new hiking <br/>gear. </p>
<p>"I just feel like there's safety in 
  numbers," said Mahoney. "I'm hoping <br/>that the Emerson case is an isolated 
  thing," she added. "You should be <br/>able to go out and take your dog for a 
  walk without having to worry about <br/>going missing." </p>
<p>Gary Michael Hilton, 61, has been charged 
  in the case and is currently <br/>being investigated in connection with other 
  missing and murdered hiker <br/>cases. </p>
<p>"I think the man they arrested was an 
  opportunist," said Craig Fowler. It <br/>is likely that Hilton targeted Emerson 
  because she was hiking alone, he <br/>said. </p>
<p>"People who are willing to make a climb 
  like Blood Mountain aren't out <br/>there to cause trouble," said Fowler. "You 
  strike up conversations with <br/>people, and the overwhelming assumption is 
  that they're out there doing <br/>the same thing you are," added Fowler, which 
  may be exactly what <br/>happened to Emerson. </p>
<p>Having to worry about people on the trail 
  "really dampens the spirits of <br/>people who want to hike," said Fowler. 
  </p>
<p>Fowler recommends that hikers take along a 
  whistle, something to <br/>make some noise. He also recommends that hikers 
  carry along a cell <br/>phone, though battery life and signals are not 
  necessarily sustainable <br/>on hikes that span several days. </p>
<p>Fowler occasionally carries along a 
  hand-held Global Positioning System <br/>(GPS) device, which triangulates with 
  satellites to identify a smaller <br/>search region in the event that a hiker 
  does not return on schedule. </p>
<p>"These cases are still very rare," said 
  Fowler. "They tend to be sens-<br/>ational in nature because of the brutality 
  of the crime and the heartache <br/>of someone disappearing. It's still 
  relatively very safe to be on the trails. </p>
<p>"About the biggest threat on the trail is 
  running across a bear," he added, <br/>but even that can be prevented in most 
  cases. </p>
<p>"You're supposed to take normal 
  precautions, such as not cooking <br/>where you plan to sleep," said Fowler. 
  "Animals are generally more <br/>afraid of you than you are of them. 
</p>
<p>"If you see cubs, stop, back away if 
  possible — because if you come <br/>between a bear and her cubs, she's likely 
  to be more aggressive. In most <br/>cases you can make a little noise, and 
  they're generally going to try to get <br/>away from you," said Fowler. 
  </p>
<p>"I'm 52, and I've been hiking on and off 
  since I was 17," said Fowler, <br/>"and I've encountered a bear twice, and that 
  includes hiking out west. </p>
<p>"I try to stay away from gaps that are 
  accessible by road," added Fowler, <br/>"because there is more of an 
  opportunity for someone who intends to <br/>do harm in those locations. I try 
  to stay at least a quarter to a half mile <br/>away from places like that." 
  </p>
<p>Lt. Col. Charlie Raines, who retired after 
  20 years of Army service — <br/>much of that in Special Forces or Infantry 
  assignments — currently <br/>teaches science at East Coweta High School and is 
  one of the adult <br/>advisers to Venture Crew 46, a coed Boy Scouts of 
  American program <br/>that specializes in teaching young people outdoor skills 
  and outdoor <br/>safety. </p>
<p>"You should always hike with someone you 
  know and trust, never <br/>alone," added Raines, "and buy or borrow the best 
  equipment you can <br/>afford and make sure it is in good shape. If a crisis 
  does arise, it will <br/>only be made worse if your gear is not in proper 
  condition." </p>
<p>"Tell people where you are going and how 
  long you expect to be gone,"<br/>said Raines. "Carry enough emergency food, 
  clothes and shelter to <br/>handle the weather and the terrain conditions you 
  might encounter." </p>
<p>"Be in shape for the trip, and know your 
  limitations," said Raines. <br/>"Watch the current weather," and check 
  predictions for several days<br/>out. </p>
<p>"If you are new to the sport," said 
  Raines, "join a club or group," to <br/>benefit from the experience of those 
  who can teach you the ins and <br/>outs of hiking. </p>
<p>Venture Crew is open to all young people 
  between the ages of 14 and <br/>20. Interested individuals must have completed 
  the eighth grade. For <br/>more information about Venture Crew, contact Peggy 
  Murphy, the <br/>Coweta County Boy Scouts of America Commissioner, at 
  <br/>678-603-8445 or by e-mail, <a href="mailto:pmurphy@bsamail.org">pmurphy@bsamail.org</a>. 
  </p>
<p>The Newnan Hiking Club welcomes new 
  members. For those interested, <br/>Craig Fowler can be reached by e-mail at 
  <a href="mailto:cfowler@numail.org">cfowler@numail.org</a>. 
  </p>
<p>"People who are new often want to go with 
  people who know what <br/>they're doing," said Fowler. "They are usually 
  interested in the day <br/>hikes," he added. "We also offer more strenuous and 
  demanding <br/>trips for more experienced hikers." </p>
<p>"In proportion to other hobbies, I don't 
  think it's any more dangerous <br/>than anything else," said Mahoney, who has 
  been hiking with the Newnan <br/>Hiking Club for three years but first began 
  hiking with her sister back in <br/>college. </p>&lt;&gt;"Self-reliance, rather than 911, is usually one's 
  primary resource in remote<br/>areas," said King. "The most important tip is, 
  'Trust your gut. Always.'&gt; <br/> </span><!--End group email --></div></blockquote></body></html>
