The foliage color change is just beginning, so even though it was beautiful, in a couple of weeks it should be spectacular.  The only baby bear I saw was at the top of a 5 mile hike with a 400 foot climb, but a few times I felt like I was being watched.  It was sort of a creepy feeling and now I understand why.<br/>

<br/>
I saw your "Fairy" tale today on the list of new boxes, then this lovely strand of fokelore.  Once again IRA you seem to have your facts out of order.   Just because you lost your doll named Mable in Lost Maples when you were a living child, and you made up this story to keep your mommy from beating you, does not mean anyone is going to believe this ghost story.   Just so happens I am going to Lost Maples over thanksgiving, and I'm sure I will not find any bear prints near your box.  In fact I'm guessing there will be no physical markings at all, since we all know a GHOST is resposible for poor Mable's fate.    Great story though.   PS - I want my royalties.  <br/>
