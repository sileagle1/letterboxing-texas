<title>Good price on 2 cup Rubbermaid Servin' Savers</title>
</head>
<body>
If you are near a Kroger’s Supermarket, they are discounting the price of the Rubbermaid 2 cup container if you have a Kroger Plus card, at least in the North Texas area.  (I don’t know if that would apply to other parts of Texas, but I’m guessing it’s at least a 50/50 chance.)  The usual price is $2.49, and they are now $1.69 for at least a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
Hawk and I have been talking about good containers for letterboxes.  We are a little concerned about the durability of some of the “disposable but reusable” containers.  The price is great but Hawk told me she’s seen a couple that didn’t seem to be weathering that well.  (It may well be that some brands will be better than others.) We decided we liked the sealing and durability of the Rubbermaid non-disposables, like the Servin Savers, but the price was a bit too high, at least normally.  I did a little research and also found the Sterilite containers seemed to be durable and sealed almost as good as long as you made sure they were completely closed properly.  I checked out Big Lots to find out what their pricing was... they have a 4 cup container for like $1.99, but unfortunately it’s really bigger than you normally need.  (See Kantexan’s “Crazy Christmas” for really great LARGE letterbox.)  Sterilite, according to their website, makes a 2 cup (approx.) container but I can’t find them anywhere to price them.  I’m guessing they would normally run $1 to $1.50.  They may be the best everyday deal for letterboxes.<br/>
<br/>
Of course this excludes microboxes, but to be honest, I’m enjoying the fun of carving stamps that are just a little too big for microboxes.<br/>
<br/>
So, I was hoping to get some other opinions... have you found a disposable container that has a good seal that you think will be durable enough for Texas weather for a few years? Have you got a source for non-disposables for a good price?<br/>

ps. Yes, I know I haven’t actually placed any boxes yet.  I’ve been plagued by “placus interruptus!”  The first location keeps getting closed due to high water, and another was interrupted by a death in the family.  However, I have carved a couple and have a large list of ideas that I hope to get to soon... my first box will now probably be placed next Wednesday or Thursday in the Houston area (Sorry Kantexan... Village Creek is presenting some problems that I didn’t anticipate.)

<p><span>Thanks for the info, Krohm – I’ll

<p><span>I agree with you &amp; Hawk – I don’t
think the reusable disposables are very long-lasting…even if reinforced
with duct tape. A couple of New England LBers told us that they do not survive
freezes at all. The Rubbermaid 24 ounce with cream-colored lid is extremely
durable, and continues to seal perfectly no matter how many folks open &amp;
close it – that was the container CactusLicker &amp; I used for the
Sphinx we sent to Monster Mash and it received more handling in a month than
our other local Texas boxes will see in 5 years! Now that I’m totally
addicted to this sport, I think I’ll probably invest in better containers
than disposables, because I’m already learning what a hassle it is to
replace your own leaking boxes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
