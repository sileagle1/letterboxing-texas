I want to welcome our new listers!<br/>
<br/>
I managed to get in some letterboxing over the past few weeks and<br/>
found the following: <br/>
Harry Potter #2<br/>
Drifter<br/>
Texas Ranger microbox<br/>
Cameron Park Zoo #1 &amp; #2<br/>
Mexican Bat<br/>
Zilker Hike &amp; Bike<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Some updates on my own boxes:<br/>
I had to remove Dog &amp; Duck Pub because it was in a wretched spot and<br/>
the last few who looked couldn't find it.  I'll have to do some<br/>
intensive research to find a new spot to plant it.  Too bad it's at a<br/>
pub...<br/>
<br/>
I had gotten a report that someone couldn't find my Moonlight Towers<br/>
box, so I went to check on it.  It had been hidden under a loose rock<br/>
in a wall.  To my shock, I found the wall collapsed and the complete<br/>
box sitting placidly atop the rubble. I looked all around that area<br/>
for a new spot to plant it but nothing would really work.  I've<br/>
retired it for awhile until I can decided what to do with it. <br/>
<br/>
I hope everyone is enjoying the lovely weather!  <br/>
Later,<br/>
