                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a quick update on Texas Tour Bus 2:  When the bus left Spring, it <br>
headed up 59, but somewhere made a detour to central Texas and was <br>
delivered to a place called Prairie Chapel Ranch, where it stayed for <br>
a few days.  I tracked it down and saw it leave the ranch today, <br>
heading east toward Waco.  The funny thing is, there is no bus <br>
driver.  This must be a rental, because the rancher is driving and the <br>
only other person aboard is an attractive lady that I assume is his <br>
wife.  But, something is odd here, the bus is escorted by a convoy of <br>
black Suburbans, sort of like a motorcade.  These must be Very <br>
Important People.  Wait, the bus just turned south on Highway 6.  I'll <br>
have to keep my distance but I'll keep following and keep you informed <br>
of its progress.<br>
