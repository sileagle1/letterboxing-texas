                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, your hostesses were out in Tomball again this morning, and one<br/>
thing to report is that our recent rains have brought the mosquitos<br/>
out in force!  Bring spray.<br/>
<br/>
The Pavilion is in the very back of the park, if you keep driving,<br/>
you'll find it easily.  There are volleyball nets and an area for<br/>
recreation.  If someone wants to bring balls and get a game going,<br/>
they are welcome to.  There is also a catch and release small lake<br/>
(pond really) stocked with rainbow trout, we always see lots of kids<br/>
fishing out there.  You are required to follow the TPWD fishing regs<br/>
if you want to fish.  <br/>

<br/>
To be honest, the trails are NOT very well marked, meaning that they<br/>
do not have individual names or colors.  There are lots of signs that<br/>
direct you back to the parking area, so that if you were to become a<br/>
bit disoriented, you can easily make your way back.  <br/>
<br/>
Most of the trails are stroller friendly, there is one that you have<br/>
to go uphill through sand where a stroller would be tough.  Good shoes<br/>
are a smart idea, as is an adequate amount of water.  <br/>
<br/>
So far, they're forecasting pretty good weather for next weekend.  The<br/>
pavilion is rather large, so it will provide great shelter in the<br/>
event of a passing shower.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to grill, there are barbecue pits.<br/>
<br/>
I think that's all.  They are hosting a big event out there this<br/>
weekend, Sunday in the Park, so we are crossing our fingers that the<br/>
boxes already hidden will be okay.  <br/>
<br/>
We can't wait to see you all!  The stamps are truly amazing and I<br/>
think it's going to be great fun for all ages and abilities!<br/>
