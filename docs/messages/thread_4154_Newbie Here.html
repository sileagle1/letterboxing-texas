                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello to all. I was introduced to letterboxing yesterday by my daughter in an email. I was so intrigued and didn't realize there were all these boxes among us! I got my son and husband involved and we are all now addicted. I have had more fun in the last two days and I see our summer being much more interesting than previous summers. <br/>
<br/>
I must share our experience on our first search for a letterbox. I found the clue and the box name of: BWP Series: Guadalupe Bass-Out of Commission. It was right up the road from our home so how perfect for our first letterbox search. Well, we went out with our clue yesterday and to our dismay half the cliff had been washed away by the storms last week. Trees laying over all in the lake and there the tree (known by the clue) lay there in the water. Our hearts sank thinking that this persons box floated away on the lake. When we got home I notified the placer, Barefoot Lucy and recieved my email today telling me she had retrieved the box prior to the storm and the reason it had "Out of Commission" at the end of the box name. OMG! I couldn't believe we looked for a box that wasn't there and that I thought well these people use some odd names for boxes and that was just part of the box name. I am still laughing at myself and relieved that the box is safe and sound. <br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to getting to know you all. This is just the sort of new interest that myself and family really needed and it isn't just temporary as we are already very hooked. <br/>
<br/>
I am also a pyrography artist. I love to alter wood. No fallen tree limb in my yard is safe from me and my tools. Our first stamps are just throw togethers cause we couldn't wait to get started but I plan to carve my stamps from fallen branches and various wood. I can't wait to carve my first stamp! If you are interested in seeing my art you can see a brief video at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LNhdFcmVaIY<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for reading and I can't wait to meet y'all.<br/>
OH my Trail name is TiaZaa not Rosebudtia as yahoo wouldn't let me do it differently that I could see. <br/>

<div>Welcome. Sounds like you have a good sense of humor. That's a good thing. Don't forget to take plenty of water on your hikes. Even if  it says 20 minutes in and 20 minutes out. Even though the planter may be older than you, they may surprise you. It took up over an hour in and an hour and a half out (it got  dark) and it was August and I thought I was going to die in the middle of the trail. Or was it, I wanted to lay down in the middle of the trail and die so I could be cooler. Hmmm, don't remember, long time ago. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But, when we made it back to the car with 3 out of 4 stamps, I was on cloud nine. It was the best of my life up till then. I've had much better days since then. </div>
