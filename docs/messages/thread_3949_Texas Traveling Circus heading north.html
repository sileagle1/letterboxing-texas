more:  the whole group showed up on our doorstep this morning.  That <br>
clown, LB Bozo, is apparently the ringleader, at least until the <br>
ringmaster shows up.  He said they decided that the woods wasn't a good <br>
place to set up the bigtop, so they pulled up stakes and were heading <br>
up north when he smelled cinnamon rolls.  He asked if they might bunk <br>
here at the Red Barn for a spell, so we said that would be okay, as <br>
long as they behaved themselves.  At least there aren't many of them, <br>
just the Bozo, a bear, a monkey, a dog, a bearded lady and the <br>
Juggler.  I was afraid when they showed up it might be that bus of <br>
hooligans that have been terrorizing the countryside recently, <br>
masquerading as pirates.  Thankfully, that bunch is someone else's <br>
problem now.  Anyway, don't go looking for the circus; they're bunked <br>
out in the Red Barn (except for the bear, who's hibernating in the <br>
woods).  So LB Bozo can stop griping now; he'll be bundled up in <br>
handmade quilts every night and eating cinnamon rolls every morning, at <br>
least for the next month or so when they are scheduled to perform up in <br>
Houston County.  He said y'all were all invited to the show.  <br>
