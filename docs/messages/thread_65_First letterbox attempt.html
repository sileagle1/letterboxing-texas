down to Magnolia Beach to find Silver Eagle's "French Flag" <br>
letterbox.  Exellent hiding place Mr. Eagle, but alas no box was in <br>
it.  I looked around for a while and thought I'd retrace my steps.  <br>
This time when I approached the cement block named in your clue, I <br>
noticed the biggest rattlesnake I've ever seen.  If I had put my <br>
hand on top of the block when I firstI looked under it, I would have <br>
felt snakeskin.  This rattled (pun intended) me all the way home... <br>
empty handed.<br>
<br>
I'm writing this to inform Silver Eagle of the unfound box and to <br>
remind everyone else of the dangers involved in our little hobby <br>
here.  I've been outdoorsee all my life and know about snakes.  For <br>
some reason I didn't think of them being at the shore.  Never let <br>
your guard down.  I shudder to think what would have happened if the <br>
snake would have been in the whole i stuck my face in.<br>

did not find the box.  I will try to scan the image of the<br>
stamp and send it to you so your attempt won't be totally<br>
in vain.  It is a shame your first letterboxing attempt<br>
was unpleasant, but please don't make it your last attempt.<br>
It really is a fun hobby.<br>
