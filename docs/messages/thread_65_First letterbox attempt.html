down to Magnolia Beach to find Silver Eagle's "French Flag" <br/>

it.  I looked around for a while and thought I'd retrace my steps.  <br/>
This time when I approached the cement block named in your clue, I <br/>
noticed the biggest rattlesnake I've ever seen.  If I had put my <br/>
hand on top of the block when I firstI looked under it, I would have <br/>
felt snakeskin.  This rattled (pun intended) me all the way home... <br/>
empty handed.<br/>

I'm writing this to inform Silver Eagle of the unfound box and to <br/>
remind everyone else of the dangers involved in our little hobby <br/>
here.  I've been outdoorsee all my life and know about snakes.  For <br/>
some reason I didn't think of them being at the shore.  Never let <br/>
your guard down.  I shudder to think what would have happened if the <br/>
snake would have been in the whole i stuck my face in.<br/>

did not find the box.  I will try to scan the image of the<br/>
stamp and send it to you so your attempt won't be totally<br/>
in vain.  It is a shame your first letterboxing attempt<br/>
was unpleasant, but please don't make it your last attempt.<br/>
It really is a fun hobby.<br/>
