<div>My first boxing trip was a lot of fun but HOT. We 
found 4 out of 5 boxes on our list and had a great time.</div>
<div>The box we couldn't find was at Washington on the 
Brazos, placed by Gramatrick. The area was so overgrown with thorny vines you 
needed a machete to get in there. My husband got in there but could not find the 
box so it's either missing or we missed it.</div>
<div>Can't wait to go out again (maybe in 
December!)</div>

the possible<br/> is by going beyond them to the impossible.</div>

Congrats on your first box!  <br/>
<br/>
I always get a kick out of the northern boxers who<br/>
lament snow and ice in the winter time and long for<br/>
summer every year so they can start looking for boxes<br/>
again - for us, our summers consist of jungle<br/>
conditions and wretched heat and we (or I at least)<br/>
long for fall when boxing becomes reasonable again.<br/>
