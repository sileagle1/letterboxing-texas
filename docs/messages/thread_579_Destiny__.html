LOL  I just thought we needed to clean out our cars more....=)  Her grandmother used to own a secretary service, and when she closed, gave us all her gear, which included stamp pads.  The books we had picked up at a dollar store because they were pretty...had no idea what to do with them!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Thank you all for the kind welcome.  I have got a couple of ideas for planting boxes, as a matter of fact...and since I teach belly dance throught the local Parks &amp; Recreation, I bet I can convince them to give me permission to plant at Lucy Park.  =)  It is a nice large park where all of our major outdoor events take place, like the Hotter n' Hell Hundred Bick ride and Falls Fest.  why, there would be two stamps right there!  LOL<br/>
<br/>
I did note all the boxes in Tarrent County, matter of fact!  I got a friend in Ft Worth I figure I will crash with and go a huntin' with me.  When I explained the idea of letter boxing, she was also interested.  Any any excuse to go out hiking and lookin' at new stuff is a good one!  <br/>
