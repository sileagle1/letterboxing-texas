                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is one of those gut instinct situations: 99% of all boxes are placed<br/>
without asking anyone's permission.<br/>
The exceptions probably fall mostly into a few categories:<br/>
1. Libraries<br/>
2. Museums<br/>
3. Historical Sites<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
However, I know of boxes covertly hidden in each of the above situations,<br/>
too!<br/>
I have been trying for a few months to get permission to place a box in our<br/>
public library - they haven't turned me down, but I haven't been given the<br/>
go-ahead. I'll keep trying to get their blessing, because I think my goals<br/>
might align very nicely with theirs!<br/>
<br/>
A letterboxing buddy secretly planted a box in Old City Park, a Dallas park<br/>
which houses historical buildings and artifacts. The box was found during<br/>
some repairs, and to our surprise the powers-that-be are very excited about<br/>
replacing it with an official Old City Park letterbox! The original owner of<br/>
the box has carved a new stamp that symbolizes the park logo, another boxer<br/>
has created a magnificent wooden treasure cask to hold it &amp; I'm making the<br/>
logbook. My Metroboxing buddy Kantexan is also helping to plan possible<br/>
future additions to the project.<br/>
<br/>
Last year, our family planted a box in the Perry Homestead, which is a<br/>
museum/farmhouse - it is now missing, and I think if we recarve it, we'll<br/>
try to get permission to place it inside the home.<br/>
<br/>
I used to volunteer as a docent for Old City Park, and the SMU Meadows<br/>
Museum and I think most docents would be more than happy to help maintain a<br/>
letterbox, given enough communication and opportunity for input.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Question<br/>
<br/>
I am fairly new to letterboxing and especially the planting part, but I <br/>
have read the last couple of post about asking to put a letterbox on <br/>
property.  Please explain why it would be good to ask -- I would think <br/>
if it is a public place why ask??  I want to plant a new box and I am <br/>
trying to figure out if I should ask or not, just place it there??  Any <br/>
advice would be great.  THANKS  ANITA<br/>

<div>Ruby Tuesday, I'm excited to learn that the Old City Park letterbox is 
going to be replaced by what sounds like a very exciting LB - I never got to the 
first one before it was listed as missing, so I've mourned the missed 
opportunity.  I did find your Perry Homestead and have that stamp in my 
logbook but wanted to return with grandchildren, so I look forward to another 
opportunity to revisit that one, too.  AND, I've wondered about the 
possibility of putting a LB near the Meadows Museum - I love that new 
contemporary wooden Wave sculpture on the SMU campus and think it needs to be 
honored with a LB.  Didn't know you had been a docent there (maybe I've run 
into you and didn't even know it, when I might have visited one of those 
places).  -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
