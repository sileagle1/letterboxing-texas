                    <div class="plaintext-content">Monday I had the opportunity to do a bit of Lb'ing while in Marble <br>
Falls.  I found Sweet Berry and Lost Marbles.  Both are alive and <br>
well; well Lost Marbles was a little under the weather.  The lid <br>
wasn't on tight and the journal was a bit damp. I hope I got the lid <br>
on there tighter.  Both were hidden well before leaving. <br>
<br>
Today, Wed., while visiting with my dad in Calliham, we went down <br>
the road to Choke Canyon State Park and I have the honor of being <br>
the FTF on both Aly's Letterbox and Southern Magnolia.  Aly's is <br>
alive and well.  Southern Magnolia's canister had been chewed on by <br>
what looked like mice and the lid was in shreds, but the stamp and <br>
journal were still there.  The journal is damp.  I'll be back over <br>
there next week to take my dad to the doctor and will try to find <br>
another box to put the journal and stamp in if Baby Bear would like <br>
for me to.  Baby Bear, please advise privately. Both journal and <br>
stamp were placed inside the ziplock and well hidden. <br>
<br>
My 88 yr old father, went with me to find these 2 boxes today.  He <br>
kept shaking his head and giving me funny looks.  Then he <br>
said, "Why"?  I explained it all to him and he gave me another funny <br>
look, and said, "Don't ya'll have anything better to do?"  So, I <br>
likened it to hunting for deer and arrowheads and his response to <br>
that, "If you say so."  By the time we left the park, he was looking <br>
for places to hide more boxes...lol.<br>

will be very happy.<br>
