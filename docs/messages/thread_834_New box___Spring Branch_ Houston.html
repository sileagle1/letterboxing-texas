<div>I just posted the clues to a new Houston box...Spring Branch 
Secret.  It is located at the Science center that is part of SBISD.  
This is an especially great place to go with kids...one of my all time favorite 
places.  I found out about it when I taught in Spring Branch.  
Teamking and Dewberry (and any other Houston boxers with little ones) don't miss 
this!  And you better hurry, because you know my boxes all seem to be 
doomed to short lives.  If it actually lasts long enough to be found please 
feel free to give any suggestions on what I could do to help it live a long, 
happy life.  Since it has been raining all afternoon I spent part of my 
Mother's Day re carving stamps for 3 boxes that have gone missing.  How 
sad.  Anyway, I hope you all like this spot as much as I do.  Happy 
Mothers Day to all!  - Mother of Five</div></body></html>

My boys like the humongous bullfrogs in the pond in the back.  In <br/>
fact, I was going to put a frog box here, but hadn't gotten around <br/>
to it yet.  Can't wait to find your box.<br/>
