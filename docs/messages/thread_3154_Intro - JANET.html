<div>That's good to hear that I could make the trip before "buffing up". I went on a hike the other day and only had to break once for a couple breaths. This Spring, I made the same hike and had to break even when there was no bench. I'm getting there. I'm almost ready to go back out and find the 3rd box in the Moose Series out at Grapevine Lake. That's a bit more than I could handle last Spring.

<div>You know, I have heard bits and pieces of that story, but never really knew the whole story. I am so glad you shared that with us again. <span> </span></div>
<div><span>Well - now you got the whole story.  It was quite an adventure.</span></div>
<div><span>Speaking of adventures - we had quite a surprise this evening.  I was on the upper floor of the garage cleaning up, and someone came up the stairs.  The footsteps were not Dane Lady's.  Then my son James comes around the corner.  Home from Ft. Hood for the weekend.
</span></div>
<div><span>We are going to have a GREAT weekend!</span></div>
<div><span>On a sadder note, he will be on a plane to his 3rd combat tour at 4pm Monday.  And for the first time in my life I will admit I am now too old to want to go along.  I have said it before, he is the guy I want with me when everything else is falling apart and I need help... any kind of help!
</span></div>
<div><span>Anyway......</span></div>
<div><span> </span>I  came into l'boxing about the time you were publishing the photo journal. So, I saw the pics, but didn't even knew what a Hueco Tank was. I think it was a few months before I became comfortable to know why anyone would hike to see a tank. A tank to me then was a water tank or an army tank. Tanks that were manmade. After a year, I am still learning about your tanks. 
<span> </span></div>
<div><span>Tanks out here can also be natural basins where water collects.</span></div>
<div><span> </span>Now I really want to go there. But, I think I will need a bit more training before I can tackle that adventure. I would absolutely love to see the paintings. That kind of stuff would make that trip astounding. 
<span> </span></div>
<div><span>Naaa.... you don't need to be in any kind of super-shape for that park.  There is lots to see and do for everyone.  I hope to soon have two letterboxes in that area too.  Just to make it worth the trip.  Heck, soon I will have 10 boxes out in a place where I am the only boxer.
 </span><br/><br/>What a great story. Thanks again.<span> </span></div>
<div><span>I had as much fun living it as you had reading it.  Only wish my son could stay longer.  But its OK, we have a 36 mile hike on the Gila River planned for when he returns in the spring of 2009.
   If you want to see that area, go to the photoshow site <a href="http://www.photoshow.net/KD9KC/adventure" target="_blank">http://www.photoshow.net/KD9KC/adventure</a> and click on the Gila wilderness Hike.

<br/>
Well, Janet, I'm right there with ya.  I've "quit" 5 times since we moved here 6 years ago.  I'm <br/>
currently "on the wagon".  (I never understood that phrase.)  I found Wellbutrin and the Patch <br/>
very helpful.  But mostly it amounts to staying away from my smoking buddies. ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing is sure a lot easier when I'm not huffing and puffing for every breath down the <br/>
trail!<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Quitting three times is better than quitting none...and any little thing you do for yourself is better than none at all, so we'll chalk one up for the strength training and won't mention the cigs again, okay?

My brother smoked for 50 someodd years. He had a major heart attack <br/>
and the Dr. told him to quit. My brother to this day says he is still <br/>
a smoker. He has not had a cig. for 6 or 7 years but he says that he <br/>
just will not smoke a cig now. I will wait till later. I have to <br/>
finish this first or I really don't think I want one now or maybe <br/>
later but not now. He said it was a mental chalenge for him. He said <br/>
he had to do it that way. He even still has a pack of cigaretes in <br/>
his house. But he "I just won't open them yet".  <br/>

I think when we work together, we do the most damage. So, when she gets back to work next week, I'll tell her. That could be one of the stamps she carves.

 photo journal. So, I saw the pics, but didn't even knew what a Hueco Tank was. I think it was a few months before I became comfortable to know why anyone would hike to see a tank. A tank to me then was a water tank or an army tank. Tanks that were manmade. After a year, I am still learning about your tanks.   <span> </span></div> <div><span>Tanks out here can also be natural basins where water collects.</span></div> <div><span> </span>Now I really want to go there.

That kind of stuff would make that trip astounding.   <span> </span></div> <div><span>Naaa.... you don't need to be in any kind of super-shape for that park.  There is lots to see and do for
 everyone.  I hope to soon have two letterboxes in that area too.  Just to make it worth the trip.  Heck, soon I will have 10 boxes out in a place where I am the only boxer.   </span><br/><br/>What a great story.
