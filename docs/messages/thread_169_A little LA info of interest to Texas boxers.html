                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi All,<br>
I have some bad news for Busy Bee and Silver Eagle. I was boxing <br>
vicariously through a friend who made a trip to LA last weekend ( <br>
Basically, I told her to go check a box). Wanda, we had placed your <br>
newbie flower HH in a yet to be published box in Acadiana Park in <br>
Lafayette LA. The good news is your HH made it to LA, the bad news <br>
is the box is now gone. :( The box was right on the bayou which had <br>
its 10 year flood this year. The rains flooded the whole campground <br>
area which looks like a huge bowl. <br>
Silver Eagle, I understand you placed a box out by the boardwalk in <br>
the bayou, we didn't check it, but unless it was tied in place, it <br>
may be gone. <br>
That's as close to letterboxing I have got in a long time, and all I <br>
have is bad news. Sorry<br>
<br>
Caire<br>
WOWMOM<br>

My Acadian Flag microbox may have survived since I hid it up a hill <br>
above the bayou.  I hope somebody visits it soon to let me know.<br>
