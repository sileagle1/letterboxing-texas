                    <html><body><div>Our family has been moving at the speed of sound lately, so that I've managed to catch a box here and there, but I haven't had a chance to write up a sitrep or anything!  With SJZ in Denton and the rest of us down here in Cherokee County, and trying to spend a little time with her helping her get ready for the baby, we've spent a LOT of time on the road this summer!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last weekend, we ventured up to Denton in hopes SJZ would go in to labor while we were there, but at least to give her some swim time in the pool at our hotel (if you've never been pregnant in the summer, you can't imagine how wonderful swimming really is!).  I, of course, have put together a book of clues in Denton County in hopes of getting a little time here and there to go looking, but I ran out of time to get my clues up to date for the boxes between here and Denton!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox, being the great LSS that he is, asked me as we were leaving town if I had any boxes I wanted to find along the way.  Now, I've learned from patient letterboxers like Silver Eagle and Puddle Splasher and Viewfinder that it really is best not to torture your LSS with thoughts of letterboxing, and this was the first trip that it became apparent the no-torture approach really is best!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, I told him I had no clues for boxes along the way and he kindly offered up his cell phone for me to use for internet access to get clues as we went.  At first I was all thumbs and I missed the first two boxes we passed because I wasn't quick enough at the mobile access thing, but by Athens I was up on my game and had the good fortune to see that not only were there unfound boxes there, but there were some NEW boxes by a NEW planter, Athens Dicer, someone I didn't even know!  Having only been planted a few days prior, I thought there was half a chance I could be FF and that fact wasn't lost on Lightning either.  We quickly found the location and the box and I opened it hoping against hope that I would not see that GG and Adams Trails (they're pretty quick on the draw these days too) had already been there - when in fact, there were six log entries in a box less than a week old!  It still blows me away when I find something like that and I remember waiting months and months for the first entry in my first box.  The one of theirs I found was The Old Fiddler - and yet again, I learned a little something and I added something to my agenda for next year - Old Fiddlers' Reunion in Athens in May!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Off we went, on toward Denton, and even though there were some other boxes I could've found in Athens, I wanted to be considerate of Fearless Fox and his courtesy, not to mention his desire to get on to Denton and hug his daughter.  I kept searching ahead though and evaluating boxes close to Highway 175 and finally settled on Kemp and the Kemp Calaboose by Holmes Trekkers.  Yet another educational experience and worth the trip for anyone traveling that way - it's a fast box, interesting site, and a cool little box not at all like most of the ones we find.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We finally hit Denton, checked into our hotel and went over to SJZ's and Rxkaffee's with loads of baby stuff.  We went through every little stitch of clothing, FINALLY got to meet Marley, our Grandtoad, and headed back to the hotel to swim the rest of the day.  SJZ was over there in a heartbeat and in the water before we could offer her a towel.  They stayed until the pool closed, getting out only long enough to eat poolside Chinese, then went to our room and watched a movie with us until Fearless Fox, Lightning, and I all fell asleep on the same bed.  SJZ and Rxkaffee slipped out sometime before the credits rolled and we all woke back up - a LONG day of swimming!
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I got up very early and went to South Lakes Park in hopes of finding the three boxes there.  I got a little turned around, but eventually found one of them before I had to head back to the hotel to swim some more.  I also managed to scope out a location for a box or two when we return there soon.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Regrettably, we had to leave Sunday afternoon and left SJZ still pregnant.  Our return trip netted us Adams' Trails The Blue Daisy.  We also managed to plant a GWP box in Seagoville next to the prison.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ's due date is tomorrow and she is showing signs of early labor, so hopefully we will be returning to Denton in the next day or two, but if she insists on holding off a bit, I plan to get myself back to the Athens area this weekend some time to find some other new boxes!
