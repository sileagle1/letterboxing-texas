                    <div class="plaintext-content">well i just got through replacing my "Beware: Mystery of the Picnic <br>
Area" box in Jacksonville, and then I went to Frankston to check on <br>
one of my October Holiday Series boxes at Dabbs Cemetery which had <br>
been reported as missing, and there it was in the exact place, in fact <br>
it was out in the open inside the tree with nothing covering it.  so i <br>
did cover it back up and left it there.  so both of these boxes are <br>
back alive and well.  there is also a new one in frankston, and i also <br>
planted a new one in maydelle today.  enjoy<br>
