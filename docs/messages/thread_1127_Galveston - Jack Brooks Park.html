got home to find out that 2 new ones were placed in areas that we were at- <br/>
bummer)<br/>
<br/>
All I have to say though is to bring bottles and bottles of bug spray.  I <br/>
have never seen so many mosquitoes in all of my life and I grew up in <br/>
Texas.  The birding parks were really bad but at A&amp;M they were the biggest, <br/>
baddest bugs I have ever seen.   They were flying thru the bug spray to <br/>
bite us - some even made it thru the spray.  Once we had the box, we ran <br/>
back to the car with a swarm behind us.  We dove into the car and slammed <br/>
the door - it looked like thousands of them were trying to get in our car <br/>
window.  It was amazing BUT of course we would do it again for all the cool <br/>
boxes we found - ha ha!!<br/>
<br/>
Has anyone been to Jack Brooks park lately?  We tried to find 2 there with <br/>
no luck but I was also thinking that my brain may have had too much sun <br/>
already this week.<br/>
