<br/>
"I'm always happy to help!  I'm just glad the letterbox wasn't destroyed when they cut down that tree!  Of course no disrespect was meant--I'm grateful for interesting things like this that a) teach a little history, something that is desperately missing nowadays and b) bring people into the cemetery for more than just to visit one grave and overlook the beauty and history that is here!  If anyone visits and looks around to see what/who they can see, I'm all for it.  If you'd like me to rehide it, I'm certainly willing to go out and try to find a suitable place for the letterbox, or I'm able to hold onto it until you or someone else can come get it--whatever you'd like to do is just fine with me.  Coldspring...I was just down in your neck of the woods a few weeks ago on my way to the Gulf Coast/Galveston--you're sure in a beautiful part of Texas.  Of course, I've been here since I was born, so I may be a little biased."  <br/>

You just let me know what you'd like me to do--whatever you'd like, I'm happy to help.  <br/>

<div>Boots, that is the nicest letter!  That particular cemetery is just full of fascinating famous gravesites and memorials, in addition to being a beautiful place (I, too, have a letterbox there, but it's a mystery box, so no more info on that one), and it's nice to know that the people in charge are amenable to encouraging visitors.  It's also a very busy place -- everytime I've been there, several funerals are also taking place, which makes it a little tricky sometimes to search for a box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Personally, I like boxes in interesting cemeteries, discovering and reading about historical places, especially in pretty and interesting locations.  One of my favorite fairly recent ones is in an old cemetery in Louisiana, where I placed a box last year.  I have another one in the works for another cemetery closer to home, when I can just get it out there.  I think as long as we treat the locations with respect and avoid creating any problems for groundskeepers and families who come to visit graves, it's good to bring people to cemeteries to discover our past, and that's what you always do with your boxes.  </div>

Some of our most memorable adventures have occurred in cemeteries, including ghostly encounters.  A ghost confiscated one of LSQ's boxes in Oakwood Cemetery in Austin and sent an email warning against replacing it, signed "The Ghost of Oakwood".  In Waco's Holy Cross Cemetery, the caretaker was weeding and found LSQ'a Angel box.  He signed into the logbook and wrote a note saying that he was Eddy, the caretaker, and that when he trimmed around the monument, he would make sure the box remained hidden.  Also, when we placed the "Pass the Biscuits" box in Sparkman-Hillcrest, we had trouble finding the governor's grave, so I went to the office to get directions.  A man in a black suit came out and chauffeured us in a black cadillac limousine to the grave, then got out of the car and escorted us to it and told us all about the man, our own personal tour guide! I didn't tell anyone that there were other letterboxes there, but I guess, since they found the LbNA website to contact me, they could find them if they wanted to do so.  I'm glad they are okay with it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is great news and what a pleasant surprise for you.  It seems that most emails I get about boxes these days are bad news, so this is welcome indeed.<br/>
<br/>
I found this box (and Viewfinder's) about 3 years ago but I didn't get a chance to explore the cemetery as much as I wanted to.  My daughter was playing in a soccer tournament several miles away and I had about 1 hour to drive to the cemetery, find the boxes, and drive back.  Well, the place was so beautiful and interesting that of course I got back late and the other parents started asking where I had been.  I started telling them about this great cemetery, but I noticed the strange looks they were giving me so I just said I was paying my respects to a relative there.  Imagine what they would have thought if I told them a couple of boxes lured me there!<br/>

I've had a few different incidents while out letterboxing that have added to the fun of letterboxing that I could tell you.  They involve a snake; a dog; a steep incline and a tree; and a second steep incline. There pretty funny now looking back at them but not so much at the time.  It all justs adds to the fun of letterboxes. :)  Mother's Love.<br/>

&gt; That's awesome Boots.  This letterbox was one of my favorite boxes that I found, as well as my first embarrassing moment while out letterboxing.  A good friend and I were out hunting some of the letterboxes in the area when we stumbled upon this gorgeous cemetery and "Pappy" by Boots and "Mick" by Puddle Splasher.  After stamping and signing in the logbooks we attempted to find our way out of the cemetery only to find ourselves driving down a single, one-way road which led to a dead end and very little space to turn around so I decided to attempt a 3 point turn in hopes of getting us turned around and heading in the opposite direction and, hopefully, to the exit.  Unfortunately, I didn't see the sprinkler head behind my truck that was protruding out of the ground about 8 inches before I backed over it.  Needless to say, the sprinkler head was wedged under my rear bumper.  After surveying our predicament my friend and I proceeded to empty the back end of my truck in hopes of raising the back-end up enough to clear the sprinkler head.  i.e. suitcases, spare tire, etc.  Unfortunately, that wasn't enough to clear the sprinkler head.  Soooo...........I left my friend to guard the truck and it's cargo to search for someone to assist us.  I wandered up to the chapel where a "viewing" was in progress.  (This was awkward)  I found a very nice lady who appeared to work there and I explained our predicament.  She was more than happy to assist us and as we walked to my truck she asked a male employee to join us.  After working feverishly to clear the sprinkler from underneath my trucks rear bumper we finally got loose.<br/>

&gt; Here's the reply, even cooler than the first:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "I'm always happy to help!  I'm just glad the letterbox wasn't destroyed when they cut down that tree!  Of course no disrespect was meant--I'm grateful for interesting things like this that a) teach a little history, something that is desperately missing nowadays and b) bring people into the cemetery for more than just to visit one grave and overlook the beauty and history that is here!  If anyone visits and looks around to see what/who they can see, I'm all for it.  If you'd like me to rehide it, I'm certainly willing to go out and try to find a suitable place for the letterbox, or I'm able to hold onto it until you or someone else can come get it--whatever you'd like to do is just fine with me.  Coldspring...I was just down in your neck of the woods a few weeks ago on my way to the Gulf Coast/Galveston--you're sure in a beautiful part of Texas.  Of course, I've been here since I was born, so I may be a little biased."  <br/>
