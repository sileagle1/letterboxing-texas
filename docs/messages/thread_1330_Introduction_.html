Good evening everyone,<br/>
<br/>
	Name is Mike.  I am in El Paso, Texas.  I am probably the farthest<br/>
west Letterboxer in Texas, being 5 blocks from the NM border, and 3 miles<br/>
away from the Mexican border.  Before I get too far, your knowing more about<br/>
me will help you understand what I do.<br/>
<br/>
	I just turned 50.  I am a retired soldier and combat veteran.  My<br/>
current employment is as an electronics specialist at the local power<br/>
generation plant.  I am married to a German named Monika, Moni for short.<br/>
Two kids.  My son James (24) is a Cavalry Scout, Sniper, Paramedic and<br/>
Arabic Linguist on his second combat tour.  My daughter Heidi (20) just got<br/>
married and moved out.  Yes, the nest is empty... And we are enjoying it!<br/>
<br/>
	My hobbies are High-Power (service) rifle competition (near Master<br/>
Class), USPSA (combat) Pistol competition (C-Class), Ham Radio (extra<br/>
class), Hiking, Dog Training, Geocaching, restoring a 1976 Postal Jeep, and<br/>
now Letterboxing.  I am the hike reporter for Localhikes.com.  Some links at<br/>
the bottom.<br/>
<br/>
	I have been a Geocacher for nearly 4 years.  Most of my caching is<br/>
done while hiking, or while traveling to dog shows.  Moni has been caching<br/>
for about a year with me, has a ham license, IS the dog show coordinator of<br/>
the family, does the driving (her van), and hikes with me as her knees will<br/>
allow.  She won't touch the jeep, and won't shoot against me - says she<br/>
doesn't want to embarrass me.  Bless her heart!  OH - we both have the Texas<br/>
Concealed Handgun License, and do carry.  I prefer a semi-auto.  But in<br/>
deference to Moni, we have matching titanium .357 magnums.  Hers is purple,<br/>
mine is gray.<br/>
<br/>
	I discovered Geocaching while researching some land navigation<br/>
information to train ROTC cadets with.  I discovered Letterboxing because<br/>
Geocaching is now allowing something called a Letterbox Hybrid.  It is a<br/>
Geocache AND a Letterbox in one location.  It looked neat, and so it<br/>
started.  I will be converting a few of my Geocaches to Letterbox Hybrids,<br/>
and even adding a few more new ones in the future.<br/>
<br/>
	I am very much looking forward to learning more about letterboxing.<br/>
So far it looks simple enough.  And there are not many in my area.  Only<br/>
two, or three if you count the one I just put out.  I am hoping to get more<br/>
local Geocachers interested in Letterboxing too.<br/>
<br/>
	ANYONE NEAR MY AREA - LIKE TO HIKE????<br/>
<br/>
	Thanks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mike.  KD9KC<br/>

<div>Nice to meet you Mike!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately the last time I was out in West Texas 
there weren't many boxes out there...  We wanted to take my BIL and SIL out 
and show them the sport (they live in Midland) and there wasn't anything close 
to show them! :(  So hopefully you will continue on and feel compelled to 
plant near Midland?  LOL!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, BTW..  My name is Semalee, and I go by 
MAGS which is an acronym for Michael, Auston, Gregory and Semalee (my little 
family).  We live in Katy, TX which is just near Houston.  My husband 
is a police officer and I work from home as a Marketing Executive for 
Melaleuca.  I was in the Army for a short jaunt, though!  I was last 
stationed at Ft. Bragg, NC.  When I joined I picked 42E which is Optical 
Lab Specialist thinking I would be in a hospital somewhere, but never thought 
that soldiers might need glasses out in the field!  LOL!!  So I ended 
up in a front line airborne unit, but I myself was not airborne.  Just 
couldn't get the guts up...  Anyway, I have been letterboxing for a little 
more than a year and it is one of my favorite pasttimes.  You will find all 
of the members of this group to be very friendly. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Talk to you soon!</div>

You might try to connect with TxHiPowr - he's also a<br/>
competitive shooter.  I met him at the first gathering<br/>
we had and he's a very interesting fellow!<br/>
<br/>
Am I misremembering, or did he change his trail name<br/>
recently?  Not working at my own computer right now,<br/>
so I can't flip back very easily!<br/>

<div>Lucy is correct. TxHiPowr did change his trail name to PI Joe.  He lives in the Austin area. <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/message/3589">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/message/3589</a></div>

<div>Welcome Mike. My trail name is Puddle Splasher - has something to do with my love of canoeing, hiking and driving my Jeep through puddles. My husband is retired Air Force, retired from Lockheed and is presently working at Sikorsky (Blackhawk Helicopters) in Connecticut, but I've recently moved back to Texas (our home) in anticipation of his retiring in 13 months from Sikorsky - so I travel back and forth. I'm presently in CT for a couple of weeks which is "letterbox rich" so I brought my letterboxing backpack and am enjoying some very cool, beautiful weather right now. I live in Bedford, TX, between Dallas and Ft Worth and have two grandsons in Frisco, TX. Welcome to the Texas Letterboxing group and I hope to see you on the trail or at a gathering soon!

As far as boxes in your area, you may not be aware of <br/>
another one in Franklin Mountains that was placed by<br/>
someone no longer participating, so the clues have been<br/>
moved to the Letterboxing Basement:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/<br/>
<br/>
Just go there and search for Franklin Mountains.<br/>
There are also 2 boxes at Hueco Tanks in the basement, so<br/>
you might try for those, too.  I would love to hear if<br/>
they still exist.  When I was in El Paso I saw the Elephant<br/>
trunk described in the original Franklin Mt. clues, but<br/>
was not sure if there was a trail up to it or if you<br/>
just had to climb the ridge with no trail.  I did not<br/>
have time to explore since my family was with me, but<br/>
I would love to hear if you go for it.<br/>
I hope you enjoy letterboxing and this group!<br/>

<div>Welcome Mike. My trail name is Puddle Splasher - has something to do with 
  my love of canoeing, hiking and driving my Jeep through puddles. My husband is 
  retired Air Force, retired from Lockheed and is presently working at Sikorsky 
  (Blackhawk Helicopters) in Connecticut, but I've recently moved back to Texas 
  (our home) in anticipation of his retiring in 13 months from Sikorsky - so I 
  travel back and forth. I'm presently in CT for a couple of weeks which is 
  "letterbox rich" so I brought my letterboxing backpack and am enjoying some 
  very cool, beautiful weather right now. I live in Bedford, TX, between Dallas 
  and Ft Worth and have two grandsons in Frisco, TX. Welcome to the Texas 
  Letterboxing group and I hope to see you on the trail or at a gathering soon!

<div><span class="877305102-27092005">Wow.  Can you pass on a question to your husband for 
  me?  This has been eating at me for YEARS, and I have never heard a good 
  explanation.  No, the toilet flush stuff isn't 
  believable!</span></div>

<div><span class="877305102-27092005">In

  fact, there are only two things keeping me from joining my son in 
  Baghdad.  My wife and my dog.  Please do not ask in which 
  order!  &lt;grin&gt;</span></div>

  been<br/>moved to the Letterboxing Basement:<br/><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/</a><span class="736475702-27092005"> </span></tt></div>

<div><tt><span class="736475702-27092005">&gt; I was not aware.  And thank you.  I was afraid that I 
  would soon run out of boxes to hunt. </span></tt></div>

<div><tt><span class="736475702-27092005">NOTE:  Geocaching has started a new type of Geocache called a 
  Letterbox-Hybrid.  It is a Letterbox AND a Geocache in the same 
  container.  There are 7 within 35 miles of my home in El Paso, with more 
  planned.  There may be many near some of you too.  I fear that they 
  may not be of great quality - at first.  But it can (I hope) improve with 
  time and experience. </span><br/><br/>Just go there and search for 
  Franklin Mountains.<br/>There are also 2 boxes at Hueco Tanks in the basement, 
  so<br/>you might try for those, too.  I would love to hear if<br/>they 
  still exist.  When I was in El Paso I saw the Elephant<br/>trunk described 
  in the original Franklin Mt. clues, but<br/>was not sure if there was a trail 
  up to it or if you<br/>just had to climb the ridge with no 
  trail.  <span class="736475702-27092005"> </span></tt></div>

<div><tt><span class="736475702-27092005"> Thank you sir.  I will try to bring quality to the list.  If 
  I am doing something wrong, teach me please.  With experience, the 
  Geocache-Letterboxes will hopefully be as good as any letterbox 
  anywhere.  But only if we work at it.</span></tt></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="194393301-28092005">Hmmmm.....  I see your point, gyroscopic precession 
and translating tendency being factors.  Although the flight controls 
should make up for one, and could be configured to correct both (reverse 
the tail rotor control/trim etc).</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="194393301-28092005">Now I will need to go back and look in my manuals.  
Yes, I even still have the -10 Huey manual.  &lt;grin&gt;  But I am 
almost certain it mentioned efficiency in northern hemisphere.  Then again, 
I may die with this never being totally answered!

keep a cat for a pet?  I have NO idea what that is about.  So I 
answered it truthfully.  At that time, we had a cat.  Now we have 5 
Great Danes and no cat.</span></div>
