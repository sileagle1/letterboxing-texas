<div>OK, I have replaced my 
Spring Branch Secret box for the third time today.  Why not just let it 
go?  Because this is one of my all time favorite spots in Houston.  If 
you decide to go find the box, take the time to go through the museum.  I 
guarantee you won't be sorry.  And for those of you who have already found 
the box, it is a brand new image, and a brand new location.  I have been 
going to this museum on rainy or hot days for 10 years (actually 16, if you 
count the time I went there on field trips with my classes) and I never tire of 
it.  I hope you like it as much as I do.
