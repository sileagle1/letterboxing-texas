                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry this is a little off topic, but I guess you could be in <br/>
training for a letterboxing marathon and benefit from it :)<br/>
Though I have no military background, I have trained for many things <br/>
over the years and I agree with Mike's suggestions.  For long-term <br/>
hydration, I prefer a CamelBak that can be worn as a pack instead of <br/>
a fanny pack.  This allows hands-free and instantaneous drinking.  <br/>
Most are easy to refill and you can get any size you want with as <br/>
many pockets as desired.  If you got one big enough you could <br/>
probably put all your letterboxing stuff in it and use it for that, <br/>
too, but I use a fanny pack for letterboxing since it is usually of <br/>
short duration.<br/>
<br/>
For me, the hardest part of training is keeping my mind occupied so <br/>
it doesn't get bored or convince me to stop the discomfort.  For <br/>
short sessions (running 5 miles or less) I like to just daydream or <br/>
think about stuff that is bothering me.  I am convinced we do our <br/>
best thinking while being physically active.  At work, I used to run <br/>
at lunch (yes it was tough in the summer) and if I had a problem <br/>
driving me nuts I usually solved it during that run.  For longer <br/>
sessions, music is ok but I prefer audio books.  I love to read, so <br/>
what better way to do 2 things at once than have a narrator read  <br/>
while you train.  If the book is good, your training session will fly <br/>
by and you might even want to keep going until the end of the chapter.<br/>
Your local library has many audio books in all kinds of formats: CDs, <br/>
Cassettes, and possibly digital that can be downloaded to non-IPOD <br/>
devices.  I listen to them while driving, too, and am very <br/>
disappointed that new cars no longer offer cassette decks (many older <br/>
audio books only come that way).  The dealer always looks at me funny <br/>
when I ask! <br/>
<br/>
Good luck,<br/>

&gt;   It's 60 mi in 3 days. They don't really do 20 miles a day. It's <br/>
more like 22, 22, 16. That way they can have a 'closing ceremony' on <br/>
Sunday. It's walking. They won't let you to run or bike. They have <br/>
pit stops every 3 miles and they relay the pit stops so they don't <br/>
have to have so many. We camp in tents on Fri and Sat nights. I <br/>
thought of the CamelBak (didn't know the name though) and wondered if <br/>
that would be easier on my back. They recommend the two bottle fanny <br/>
pack. But, if you use a tall bottle, your arms hit it. It was <br/>
uncomfortable today. It made me walk funny. I already have mole skin, <br/>
in my pack. It helped to have music in my ears, but we're <br/>
not 'supposed' to on training walks. I have thick socks but need to <br/>
be fitted for shoes again. I am 43 and have not missed a meal in a <br/>
few years. This summer my cross training will be water aerobics. I <br/>
love the idea of Sun-Tue-Thu. Then, on Mon and Fri I can take D.O.G. <br/>
for shorter walks (DH walks him other days). I tried to<br/>
&gt;  take him this morning. He was so excited and wanted to mark <br/>
everything we passed. He didn't even try to eat the guy mowing the <br/>
lawn he was so excited. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Does the water in the CamelBak taste okay? Are they easy to fill <br/>
at a pit stop? I think they are ingenious. And to have the pockets on <br/>
the bag, makes it that much more feasible. <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   I just looked at the CamelBak site and they have a fanny one that <br/>
will hold enough water for an hour of running. That's probably <br/>
perfect and it has some pockets. I think I'll go look at the bicycle <br/>
store down the street for me and see about getting one.<br/>

<div>By the way, there is an REI on the north side of 635 between I-35 and Inwood (can't remember exactly where) and one in Plano. Their staff is really great at helping you find a pack that is comfortable for you and perfect for your hike as well as future uses. When I start out, my straps are loose to accommodate all the water, but as I empty the reservoir, I just give the straps a tug, tightening them and keeping the back in a comfortable position on my back.</div>

<div>There is a great article in Runners World Magazine this month ( July 2007) 
that talks about how running/training helps you work through issues/problems 
that are going on in your life.  It is on page 49 and is titled "Clearing 
Ahead".  One psychotherapist even gives his clients a discount if they will 
see him on the road instead of in his office!  From personal experience, I 
can't tell you how many times I have gone out on a run with all sorts of things 
going on in my head and when I make it back to the car afterwards, they have 
either been worked through, solved, or completely disappear!  Some of my 
most favorite lesson plans/activities for my students have come during a 
run.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>An iPod really helps, too, and we have downloaded all sorts of music to 
it.  Sometimes it is a Green Day sort of run, other times it is a George 
Strait sort of run!</div>

When we went out on our first 'hike' letterboxing, if we didn't have water, they'd have found us on the trail looking like the raisinettes the next morning. You just never know what's going to happen.

 [letterboxingtexas] Re: Training</div> <div><br/></div> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Sorry this is a little off topic, but I guess you could be in <br/>training for a letterboxing marathon and benefit from it :)<br/>Though I have no military background, I have trained for many things <br/>over the years and I agree with Mike's suggestions. For long-term <br/>hydration, I prefer a CamelBak that can be worn as a pack instead of <br/>a fanny pack. This allows hands-free and instantaneous drinking. <br/>Most are easy to refill and you can get any size you want with as <br/>many pockets as desired. If you got one big enough you could <br/>probably put all your letterboxing stuff in it and use it for that, <br/>too, but I use a fanny pack for letterboxing since it is usually of <br/>short duration.<br/><br/>For me, the hardest part of training is keeping my mind occupied so <br/>it doesn't get bored or convince me to stop the discomfort. For <br/>short sessions (running 5 miles or
 less) I like to just daydream or <br/>think about stuff that is bothering me. I am convinced we do our <br/>best thinking while being physically active. At work, I used to run <br/>at lunch (yes it was tough in the summer) and if I had a problem <br/>driving me nuts I usually solved it during that run. For longer <br/>sessions, music is ok but I prefer audio books. I love to read, so <br/>what better way to do 2 things at once than have a narrator read <br/>while you train. If the book is good, your training session will fly <br/>by and you might even want to keep going until the end of the chapter.<br/>Your local library has many audio books in all kinds of formats: CDs, <br/>Cassettes, and possibly digital that can be downloaded to non-IPOD <br/>devices.

<div>I hear you, Barefoot Lucy! The first time I hiked one of the Lake Grapevine trails (about twelve years ago) I wasn't planning to hike - I just discovered the trail and got "sucked" down it, totally unprepared (no water). I just kept going... wondering what's around the next bend and what's over the next hill until I had hiked a fairly long distance from my car. The hike back was grueling. I finally found an old log and laid down on it for awhile, but by the time I got back to the car, I was shaking and totally dehydrated. I had a headache that lasted for two days. It was so scary that now I'm probably overly prepared for "whatever may come up" on the trail. I mean... do I really need to carry a credit card on the trail?</div>

<div>I hear you, Barefoot Lucy! The first time I hiked one of the Lake Grapevine trails (about twelve years ago) I wasn't planning to hike - I just discovered the trail and got "sucked" down it, totally unprepared (no water). I just kept going... wondering what's around the next bend and what's over the next hill until I had hiked a fairly long distance from my car. The hike back was grueling. I finally found an old log and laid down on it for awhile, but by the time I got back to the car, I was shaking and totally dehydrated. I had a headache that lasted for two days. It was so scary that now I'm probably overly prepared for "whatever may come up" on the trail. I mean... do I really need to carry a credit card on the trail?

                    <html><body><div>Since Lightning crossed to Boy Scouts I've been ravenously reading all their material trying to get up to speed on his new program.   Scouting's founder, Robert Baden Powell, is one of my new heroes and I suck down whatever of his writings I can find.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One part of the Boy Scout promise says ...to keep myself physically strong, mentally awake and morally straight."  Being overweight, I've always struggled with the fitness aspect of scouts, but I have found it interesting that BP chose to phrase it as physically strong rather than physically fit.  So I was reading just today in the BS Field Book, and it elaborates considerably on what is meant by physically strong.  Fearless Fox has the book with him or I would quote directly, but it says something to the effect that to be physically strong you must be physically able to do all the things you need to do each day, with enoug reserve remaining to do things you WANT to do, and still enough physical reserve to react to and address any emergency needs that may arise.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What that meant to me was that I needed to be able to do my work and family duties for the day, and then be able to head out and go letterboxing or hiking for a couple of hours after work - safely.  However, if my physical reserve is such that I am using up all my energy just doing a good hike, and I don't have the energy to deal with a wild hog in the woods or a compadre who passes out on me, then I'm not physically strong enough for my own standards.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And carrying that further, you have to maintain your strength by doing maintenance WHILE you are exerting yourself - snacking as needed and hydrating and resting periodically, as well as wearing proper wear and carrying proper equipment.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Reading that really helped me evaluate where I am in the scope of physical ability and where my goals need to be!<br/><br/> </div>

I finally found an old log and laid down on it for awhile, but by the time I got back to the car, I was shaking and totally dehydrated. I had a headache that lasted for two days.

<div>I hear you, Barefoot Lucy! The first time I hiked one of the Lake Grapevine trails (about twelve years ago) I wasn't planning to hike - I just discovered the trail and got "sucked" down it, totally unprepared (no water). I just kept going... wondering what's around the next bend and what's over the next hill until I had hiked a fairly long distance from my car. The hike back was grueling. I finally found an old log and laid down on it for awhile, but by the time I got back to the car, I was shaking and totally dehydrated. I had a headache that lasted for two days. It was so scary that now I'm probably overly prepared for "whatever may come up" on the trail. I mean... do I really need to carry a credit card on the trail?

                    <html><head><style type="text/css"><!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --></style></head><body><div><div>On Saturday I attended a training for Girl Scout leaders. This is the same training I took a year ago that got me started on finding letterboxes. I had already been intregued by the Austin American Statesman article I had read earlier that year but this training knocked it into place for me. </div>
<div>The trainer we had last year couldn't make it this year and they replaced her with a nice woman who had never boxed or seen a box. She had geocached a few times and had read about letterboxing but nothing more. So guess who got to step in and fill the gaps and answer the questions? Me! There was another boxer who had been in the class last year with me and had started then as well. She warned people of choosing a trail name that was already taken. Evedently at our training a year ago she had choosen Boots Tex and later found it was taken. So she has renamed herself Boots Jim. She was with two of her friends who also box but mainly geocache. I answered a slew of questions about the websites and what was needed to letterbox. Lucky for me I brought along my letterboxing bag full of goodies so they could get a look at a Hitch Hiker and cootie. Boots Jim keeps her letterboxing supplies in a letterbox so we showed them a veriation of what may be
 found. I passed around my familys signiture stamps and demonstrated carving (I was making a cootie) Boots Jim got my cootie at the end. I wonder if she even realizes it now. We went over the ends and outs of letterboxing and events. There were quite a few leaders who seemed very intrested in letterboxing. </div>
<div>So maybe we will snag a few new letterboxers soon. </div></div><br/>

                    <html><body><p>I'm really glad you were there to fill in the gaps and flesh it all out. As I'm sure you would attest, it makes a HUGE difference when an actual letterboxer teaches letterboxing! I had the opportunity to talk to a troop of girls about letterboxing several years ago and it was such a pleasure to pass on to them the ins and outs that you don't know unless you've actually boxed for awhile, to teach them a little about carving, and now to see some of them still at it. So much the better that we've got real letterboxers training leaders who will teach the girls.<br/>
<br/>When High Tech Hide and Seek first rolled out, it was often (not always) being taught to leaders by instructors who had no clue what either geocaching or letterboxing were really all about, didn't bother trying them out before they tried to teach them, AND didn't at least get in touch with someone who knew anything about it - i.e. with placers through the clue websites. It was very frustrating for many letterboxers to get sappy emails from troop leaders excited about telling the placer they had just stormed through a park with a dozen girls searching for as many boxes as they could find in a couple of hours - too many times it had turned out to be a "search and destroy" mission. It was hard to respond with any sort of enthusiasm about their afternoon of entertainment.. I always sort of thought the interactive nature of the game wasn't getting conveyed to the girls - every placer and every finder has an impact on every box. Instead, they were treating it more like an afternoon at the movie - soak up the entertainment and move on to the next thing and if you happened to leave your popcorn and soda behind, someone was there getting paid to clean it up. I found it particularly frustrating because I've always maintained that scouting and letterboxing could both benefit by having responsible scouts involved in letterboxing - letterboxing teaches outdoor skills to scouts and scouts should make good letterboxers because of the conservation mindset they should have..<br/>
<br/>I really think you should make it official and volunteer with your council to teach High Tech Hide and Seek (and you are also a gc'er, aren't you?) rather than leave it to chance that someone will be there to take up the slack! I think you'd be good at it!<br/>
