for being so patient with me and helping me to relax.<br>
I'm so embarressed how my hands were shaking b/c I was<br>
so nervous at the beginning. LOL By the end I was<br>
totally relaxed though. Ya'll are a great group of<br>
people! <br>
<br>
I'm kind of bummed b/c besides the series that JB<br>
planted around us. We were only able to find one box<br>
which was The Legend of the Dogwood. My kids had<br>
reached their limit so I had to take them home. <br>
JB, I hope your dog was able to recover from my little<br>
one's. I'm sorry they were bothering him so much. He<br>
is such a good dog to handle that.<br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing everyone again in a few weeks<br>
at TA-DA. Hopefully for this next one I can skip the<br>
nervousness part since I won't be the newbie anymore.<br>

together.  I had a great time too.  It was nice to see old friends and <br>
to make some new friends.  I didn't get home until 7:30 because I <br>
stopped on the way home to find some of those fine letterboxes in the <br>
surrounding area of Palestine with pretty good success.  There are <br>
other boxes that I'll have to look for another day.<br>

JBK: The Angel on the Wind is absolutely beautiful.  What a talent Sean <br>
Guerrero has. I've never seen anything like it before.  I am so glad <br>
that I had my camera with me so I could take a picture.<br>
<br>
Between the 15 letterboxes that JBK hide for the gathering and the <br>
other boxes in the general area of Palestine that I found I reached <br>
300+ letterboxes found today. Thank you all for planting these boxes.<br>
<br>
I look forward to seeing everyone again soon.<br>

<div>Thank you Barefoot Lucy and JBK for putting this wonderful gathering <br/>together. I had a great time too. It was nice to see old friends and <br/>to make some new friends. I didn't get home until 7:30 because I <br/>stopped on the way home to find some of those fine letterboxes in the <br/>surrounding area of Palestine with pretty good success. There are <br/>other boxes that I'll have to look for another day.<br/><br/>JBK: The Angel on the Wind is absolutely beautiful. What a talent Sean <br/>Guerrero has. I've never seen anything like it before. I am so glad <br/>that I had my camera with me so I could take a picture.<br/><br/>Between the 15 letterboxes that JBK hide for the gathering and the <br/>other boxes in the general area of Palestine that I found I reached <br/>300+ letterboxes found today.

<div>No need to be embarassed - I will never forget going to the first gathering in Bastrop in 2004 - I had a grand total of about 5 finds over 6 months' time, so I felt like an impostor letterboxer being at that gathering where "real" letterboxers were.  Turns out, I think nearly everyone sort of felt that way because we were all in about the same boat since boxes were so scarce.  I'll bet I tried to walk up to the pavilion four times before I finally made it, and only because my husband said "We didn't drive all this way for you NOT to go".   He, by the way, bailed right after we signed in!  By the end of the day (or much sooner) I felt like old friends with Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, Corazon and Navigator, and Birds of a Feather and the others who were already there.  <br/>

                    <html><body><div>My first box was Tejas by Baby Bear on September 7, 2003.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My daughter was born on August 21, 1987, and my dad passed away on September 7, 1987.  Those two weeks between the anniversaries of one of the happiest days of my life and the saddest day of my life were always an emotional rollercoaster.  For a long time I didn't deal with it very well, but I eventually learned that the best way to cope was to stay busy doing positive things.  I was having an especially tough time of it in 2003 and my husband was determined to get me out of the house and doing something, anything.  I had been reading a lot about letterboxing, so I suggested we give it a try and while he didn't "get it", he was game for anything.  We printed off five of the seven clues in the Northeast Texas region, loaded the kids (then 16 and 7) in the car, and headed down to Alto and Weches.  We had a few storebought stamps we used and had to stop along the way and buy an index card book for a logbook and a black ink pad (we found in Office Supplies, not Crafts!).  We went first to Mission Tejas, a park we had spent lots of time in, and were startled to discover that someone had been hiding things along the very trail we had walked so many times!  We also found Silver Eagle's Spanish Flag and Baby Bear's Stone Celt on that day.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My dad was a forester by education and an outdoorsman for the love of it.  He was also creative and witty and would have been an excellent carver and a superb clue writer and a crafty location finder.  Had letterboxing come along before he died, he would have been in the thick of it and left us all a fistful of memorable boxes. However, I had no idea when we left that morning that letterboxing would prove to be a very positive way for me to honor his memory and feel close to him by being in places he would have (and had) enjoyed, doing something that came too late for him to enjoy as I know he would have!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My first day of letterboxing was a very good day.</div>

Perhaps there needs to be a spot for the newbies at<br>

I was on my way home thinking about all the exchanges<br>
