<p>The elevation changes (sometimes 3000' in 3.5 miles) were so tough! I actually lost 8 pounds in six days, because you just can't consume enough calories to offset what you burn. However, after two days off the trail, I really missed it and wished I could go again, so I'm going to say yes, I do hope to do another section. It was definitely one of the coolest things I've ever done. If you haven't already, you definitely need to hike to the top of Mt. Rogers, the highest mountain in Virginia at 5500'. There are actually roads that gets you within 1000 feet of the summit in Grayson Highland State Park where the wild ponies roam. It's just the most incredible thing ever. There are also trails that aren't as demanding as the A.T. all around that area. For some reason, the "powers that be" that laid out the A.T. thought it was necessary for the A.T. to summit every possible mountain and every difficult landscape as steeply as possible, whereas other trails seemed to more gently circle around and end up quite often in the same area. I was extremely fortunate with perfect weather; I even enjoyed hiking in the rain one day.</p>

<p>Right??? At the last minute, I decided that those few extra ounces in my pack (stamps, LB, ink, clues) was not do-able. In fact, more than the weight, it was the space available in my pack. What adds the most bulk and weight is the water. My water bladder inside my pack holds about 70 ounces, plus I had to carry extra outside my pack. I would go through all that plus refills from streams along the way. That's about 8 to 10 pounds. EVERY ounce in your pack makes a difference. When I climbed Whitetop Mt. (2nd day), I had an elevation gain of 3000' in about 3 1/2 miles. That's equivalent to climbing a staircase in a 300 story building. That was my most difficult day. Mt Rogers, on the 2nd and 3rd days, is actually the highest point on the A.T. in Va. at 5500', but I was already up a few thousand feet at Elk Garden, and the trail up was a few miles longer.

<body id="compText">Thanks, Elwood Fan! I'm starting to train again for a second hike on the A.T. late this Spring. You're right. It's not easy to get on the trail from Texas, but it's possible! Don't give up on it!! Puddle Splasher<br/><br/>
