<div>Now that I have had the 
chance to wash the ink off my hands (and my kids!) I wanted to say what a great 
time I had playing Candy Land today!  I remember the first time I met any 
other letterboxers at the Terrors on Telge mini gathering, how nervous and 
intimidated I was to meet strangers that I knew only through little boxes 
hidden in the woods.  Today as people arrived the kids were saying, "Look, 
Silver Eagle and Baby Bear are here!  Hey, it's Runs for 
Chocolate!  Hi Blue Butterfly!" and I thought how much fun it was to see 
these strangers that have now become familiar faces.  I don't know what I 
enjoyed more; seeing how much fun the kids were having, the kind compliment 
dewberry and I received from the infamous GG, or hearing a newer 
letterboxer say, "Oh, Silver Eagle, the Father of Texas letterboxing.  
And I guess Baby Bear must be the Mother of Texas letterboxing!"  Thanks to 
everyone who came, we missed those that weren't there, and I can't wait until 
the next time we all get together!  Mother of 
Five</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone! <br/>
     We had a great time at the Candyland gathering also. The boys <br/>
were thrilled with the stamps! We logged in the Pinata Box and even <br/>
had time for the boys to spend a little time on the playground. <br/>
     Due to a late arrival back home, I left the backpacks in the van. <br/>
When I loaded the boys up to go to church this morning, they both <br/>
wanted to look at their logbooks. They compared stamps and one of <br/>
thier favorites in Runsforchocolate's Sweet Carolina stamp. They just <br/>
had to show Daddy! Thanks to all who worked so hard so we could have a <br/>
fun day. What a way to end the year!<br/>
     It was great to see everyone and hope you all have a safe and <br/>
Happy New Year!<br/>

I just posted a few pictures in the Photos section under Kiss From <br/>
The Sugarplum Fairy album.  If you have any, go ahead and put them <br/>
here.  Thanks to MO5 &amp; Dewberry for another great Event!<br/>
