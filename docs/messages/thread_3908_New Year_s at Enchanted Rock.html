                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I told y'all we were going, but I never got around to telling you we<br/>
went!<br/>
<br/>
I was worried to death our trip to Enchanted Rock would fall through at the<br/>
last minute.  That seemed to be the watch phrase of our year last year - "We<br/>
ALMOST got to go!"  Well - it didn't fall through, despite<br/>
circumstances conspiring against us.<br/>
<br/>
Fearless Fox works in life and health insurance, and anyone who knows much<br/>
about that, or who is old enough to have medicare benefits, knows that the<br/>
last two months of each calendar year is time for medicare recipients to<br/>
change their drug card coverage.  It gets CRAZY!  He and the women in his<br/>
office worked the last two weeks of the year from 8 am to 8 pm, and only<br/>
took Christmas Day off.  I had the whole week before Christmas off, which<br/>
was good since he was out for the count as far as shopping went.  Still<br/>
though, it was a bummer because we couldn't do anything fun that<br/>
week!   Anyway, Christmas came and went (well, for the most part, we still<br/>
haven't celebrated Christmas with two parts of our family!), and I had to go<br/>
back to work the next week.  Fearless Fox had to work right up to New Year's<br/>
Eve, as I did, but we both managed to take off January 2nd for a long<br/>
weekend to Enchanted Rock.<br/>
<br/>
Now - for Christmas I had asked for a 2-3 day trip to do nothing but<br/>
letterbox.  Well - my original thought had been for Lightning and I to go<br/>
and leave Fearless Fox at home since he doesn' t much care for boxing, but<br/>
Fearless Fox got enthusiastic about going too.  And he assumed I meant that<br/>
we should camp.  That was not what I meant at all.  I wanted to go lazy and<br/>
stay in a hotel and let someone else fix my meals and make my bed, and know<br/>
that I had a warm dry room at night with internet access in the evenings so<br/>
I could log finds and look up boxes and with a television to watch until I<br/>
fell asleep.  I wanted to go to Austin.  He wanted to go to Enchanted Rock.<br/>
I started swelling up about him changing my idea of what I wanted for<br/>
Christmas, but then  realized I didn't actually get this as a Christmas gift<br/>
- it was being planned as a family getaway.  So I quit puffing up quite as<br/>
much and took a look at where he wanted to go.  I figured I could live with<br/>
it, and we had gotten a lot of new camping equipment so it would be fun to<br/>
try it all out too.  So that's how the Enchanted Rock trip was born, and our<br/>
work schedules nearly killed it on more than one occasion.<br/>
<br/>
We managed to get ourselves all packed into our own backpacks in the few<br/>
days before New Year's Eve.  We debated when to leave and decided it would<br/>
be best to go New Year's Eve and leave early enough to avoid the drunks on<br/>
the road.  We actually managed to leave town at 5:30, for what should be<br/>
about a 5.5 hour drive.  Well - that would be 5.5 hours if I were driving!<br/>
I'm like my mother, NacTrailCat, in that once I get on the road, I want to<br/>
GOOOOO!  I don't want to stop until I absolutely have to.  Fearless Fox is<br/>
NOT that way.  We go for an hour, then stop to get a drink. Drive another<br/>
hour and stop to go to the bathroom.  Another hour and we have to eat.  You<br/>
see the pattern...  It used to drive me crazy, but I've learned to accept it<br/>
and use it to my own benefit.  Rather than packing all the perishables and<br/>
food and buying all the incidentals before we leave, we use one of our stops<br/>
along the way to grocery shop, then we get back on the road and think of all<br/>
the things we forgot to get, and one of our later stops are to do Walmart<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
And it was thus that we happened upon the stroke of midnight on New Year's<br/>
Even.  SIX and a HALF hours after leaving home for a 5.5 hour trip, we found<br/>
ourselves in a convenience store in Llano at the magic hour.  I found it odd<br/>
that we, who usually spend New Year's Eve happily snoozing the hour by, were<br/>
in a convenience store in the middle of nowhere with ourselves, two clerks,<br/>
and two strangers who were also in the store.  I tried to get Lightning to<br/>
get one of them to take our picture with all the others, but he thought it<br/>
was a stupid idea.  I think he will regret that in later life - he missed<br/>
out on documenting yet another of his mom's weirdo encounters, and on a<br/>
special moment too.  One of the clerks was half asleep (or not too bright -<br/>
couldn't tell which, so I'll give him the benefit of the doubt) and the<br/>
other seemed to think she was slumming amongst the rest of us at that time.<br/>
She kept saying she ALWAYS spends New Year's in New York.  I was sorely<br/>
tempted to say "Well - not ALWAYS...", but thought that would be rude.  The<br/>
two strangers wandered out and Fearless Fox and Lightning paid and went back<br/>
to the truck while I went to the bathroom.  Apparently the New York refugee<br/>
forgot that I was in the bathroom, because as I emerged I was treated to a<br/>
weird sort of shrieking jig that was apparently intended to be some sort of<br/>
welcome ritual for the New Year.   Apparently the New Year missed what I<br/>
saw, or it would have been scared back to wherever it came from.<br/>
We were really not that far from Enchanted Rock when we were in Llano, but<br/>
we had figured out that we had absolutely no concept of space in the dark in<br/>
the mountains, so we refrained from trying to predict how far out we were.<br/>
We didn't want to be depressed if it was longer than we estimated.  We<br/>
rolled in to Enchanted Rock SNA at 12:30 and had to set about to find<br/>
ourselves a camping spot without waking up the other campers.  Our<br/>
headlights and flashlights just didn't do the area justice, so we did the<br/>
best we could.  We finally conceded that we were not there to camp, but to<br/>
stay while we letterboxed - we would have been a whole lot more particular<br/>
about getting away from other campers and finding the perfectly perfect<br/>
site, complete with view and privacy, but it WAS after midnight and we<br/>
didn't plan to spend much time in our site anyway.  With that in mind, we<br/>
opted for a site that would be easy to load and unload from (no pull-ins at<br/>
ER) and close to the bathrooms - convenient.  We set up camp by the lights<br/>
of our headlamps (we got new headlamps for Christmas - as we do every year -<br/>
and these newest ones are really GOOD!), and Lightning turned in to his<br/>
hammock around 1 a.m. and Fearless Fox and I retired to our tent.<br/>
<br/>
Daylight rolled in somewhere around 7:30 am and I managed to keep my eyes<br/>
tightly closed until 8:30.  Finally, I rolled out of my sleeping bag and<br/>
climbed out of the tent to find Lightning roaming about getting camp<br/>
organized (otherwise known as waiting for mom to get up and declare what<br/>
breakfast would be).  We explored a little and looked up at The Rock to see<br/>
a light trickle of hikers heading up already, then I set water to boiling in<br/>
my Jetboil, a Christmas present I had been wanting for three years (<br/>
http://www.jetboil.com/products/cookingsystems/personalcookingsystem).  I<br/>
had coffee and hot chocolate whipped up for all in no time and got oatmeal<br/>
under way too.  Breakfast was done and I was ready to hit the ground, but<br/>
Fearless Fox had slept in later than Lightning and I, so we had to wait for<br/>
him to get social niceties like toothbrushing out of the way.<br/>
<br/>
Now - we knew climbing Enchanted Rock would be tough since we hadn't done<br/>
much in the last couple of months, so our plan had been to letterbox on New<br/>
Year's Day and save The Rock for Friday after we had toned up a bit on<br/>
Thursday.   We were getting a really late start though, and the later it<br/>
got, the more we waffled  We were still tired from the trip, so we decided<br/>
we should just stay in camp and do The Rock later in the day on New Year's<br/>
Day.  Fearless Fox and I put our hammocks up and we almost managed to talk<br/>
ourselves out of doing anything at all that day, and just lay around in our<br/>
hammocks and read, but then I realized it would be a real bummer not to go<br/>
up ER on New Year's Day.  It seems to always hold true that what we do on<br/>
New Year's, we do more off the rest of the year, and we would really like to<br/>
do a whole lot more hiking this year.  Well that thought hit a chord and we<br/>
stuck with the idea of going up the rock later in the afternoon.  After a<br/>
little more laying around, I couldn't stand it anymore and I rallied them<br/>
out of their hammocks and insisted we get up and go - I didn't want to think<br/>
about it anymore.  I wanted to do it.  I was motivated, inspired, and ready<br/>
- right up until we hit the first hard incline.  Then I was ready to go back<br/>
and lay in my hammock.  I knew better than to even mention that though,<br/>
since Fearless Fox was perfectly happy in his hammock and wouldn't<br/>
appreciate me calling it off.  So up I went - stop and go fashion - rest a<br/>
bit, go a bit.  Check my phone signal to see if 9-1-1 was an option.  And<br/>
grumbled the whole stinking way up.  To myself mind you.  Meanwhile<br/>
surrounded by throngs of people making the same trek.  And some kids RUNNING<br/>
up the hill.  Some of them ran close by me.  I wanted to stick my foot out<br/>
and trip them - teach them to run UP the hill near ME!  And finally,<br/>
finally, we got close enough to the top that it was senseless really to turn<br/>
around, and then it was easy to go.  And I kept thinking about MO5 making<br/>
the trek with all her kids - and youngest one in a kangaroo pouch.  I KNEW<br/>
she was nuts anyway - I am CERTAIN of it now!<br/>
<br/>
But - I made it to the top.  I really did.  I even have pictures to prove<br/>
it.  Lightning took pics with his phone the whole way up and kept texting<br/>
them to NacTrailCat and SJZ.  SJZ says she finally texted him back to put<br/>
his phone down and enjoy the scenery!  Now - SJZ - that's another ER story.<br/>
She and Fearless Fox went to ER on a lark when she was about 13.  She had<br/>
never really been hiking, but he declared her to be his hiking partner about<br/>
that time.  They got to ER sometime around 8 pm and he determined that they<br/>
would camp in the primitive camping on the other side of the rock.  Somehow<br/>
or another they got off on the wrong trail and wound up going down the side<br/>
of Little Rock and going back into the main camping area.  They set out<br/>
again and this time came upon a hiker who had hiked across the mountain to<br/>
go to the bathroom (that's another story I wish I knew!) and he agreed to<br/>
show them to the top since he was going that way anyway.  Now this was about<br/>
11 pm.  They got to the top, and parted company with the hiker dude, and<br/>
they stopped to look around.  My poor girl, he tells about her little voice<br/>
asking him "Please Daddy - please, can't we stop?  I'm really tired!"  She<br/>
has always had him wrapped around her little finger, and who could resist a<br/>
cry for help like that anyway?  He found a recessed area in the rock and<br/>
laid down a tarp for them and they slept until the morning, waking right<br/>
before the first visitors of the day.  For the record - you aren't supposed<br/>
to camp on ER.  Oh well.  When you're 13 and you're tired, you stop.  She's<br/>
a trooper these days and would outdo anyone who challenged her.<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY - the top of the rock.  As soon as I reached the top and could look<br/>
out and around, I couldn't remember why I grumbled so much getting up<br/>
there.  The view is astounding and the natural world atop it is<br/>
breathtaking.  Enchanted Rock is a living example of geology in flux.  You<br/>
can literally see how changes are happening. It was positively beautiful.<br/>
Before we left home, we had researched the eco-vironment of the rock and<br/>
learned that the vernal pools represent whole ecosystems in themselves.<br/>
Unfortunately, Lightning forgot and crushed an ecosystem or two before he<br/>
got used to walking around them instead of through them.  We spent an hour<br/>
or so on top before we decided to venture back down.  The way down is much<br/>
easier than the way up, except that I have a bad knee that I had thwacked<br/>
real good on the bumper hitch on the way to Enchanted Rock the night<br/>
before.  I had hit it hard enough that I knocked it out of place (a cool<br/>
trick it does at inappropriate moments).  The down trek was much harder on<br/>
my knee than the up trek had been, but even so, we made it down relatively<br/>
easily, except that my knee really hurt for the whole rest of the trip.<br/>
<br/>
We got back into camp and fell into our hammocks, watching the climbers<br/>
going up and down the Rock like ants.  I expected I would take a nap, but I<br/>
found it was hard to get still and rest after the initial recovery time, and<br/>
so did Fearless Fox and Lightning.  We decided that rather than the camp<br/>
rations we had brought with us, we would go in to Fredericksburg and get a<br/>
hot meal.  We hit town and realized precious few restaurants were open on<br/>
New Years' Day.  We finally spotted a German restaurant and Fearless Fox put<br/>
me out to find out what the wait time was while he circled the block.  The<br/>
hostess told me we would have to wait a half hour if we wanted to sit inside<br/>
or we could sit outdoors right away.  I stepped aside and called Fearless<br/>
Fox with the information and he decided he could live with eating outside.<br/>
Just as they got parked and I was about to step up to the hostess podium to<br/>
tell her we wanted to sit outside, the owner of the restaurant came and<br/>
turned their sign to Closed - they were running out of food because they had<br/>
been so busy.  He told her she could seat those whose names were on the<br/>
list, but to take no more.  ARGH!  I went up to her and begged her to seat<br/>
us, reminding her that I HAD just asked her about seating.  She agreed that<br/>
"technically" I could have been on the waiting list, so she seated us.<br/>
YES!  It was going to be McD's otherwise, and camp rations sounded pretty<br/>
good compared to that!  I have never been much on German food, but I decided<br/>
that if I was going to like it, it would be at this place.  I ordered a<br/>
Reuben because I had seen NacTrailCat eat them and figured it was safe.  Had<br/>
I considered that she talked me into gulping down some mineral water in<br/>
Manitou Springs CO and a raw oyster in some restaurant somewhere - all for<br/>
the entertainment value - I woulda reconsidered the Reuben, but it turned<br/>
out to be GOOD - sauerkraut and all.  We wound up going back to that<br/>
restaurant another couple times!<br/>
<br/>
Now - let me stop here to answer the question you are almost certainly<br/>
asking.  What's all this got to do with letterboxing?  Well - not much so<br/>
far.  And it won't have much to do with it in the next while either.  It<br/>
seems the ER area and Fredericksburg are very hard on boxes.  BootsTex and<br/>
Silver Eagle and Can Can had all told me in private messages that quite a<br/>
few in the area were missing, so I was expecting to have a high miss rate,<br/>
but what I expected was low even compared to what I had been told by them -<br/>
I don't think I've ever taken a trip with more misses than finds.  The theme<br/>
of our weekend was "maybe it'll be there, maybe it won't".  And hopefully<br/>
this will be a lesson to new boxers who struggle with not being able to find<br/>
boxes.  Sometimes they just aren't where they are supposed to be, or maybe<br/>
they are, but we can't find them.  BUT - we can still have fun!  And make no<br/>
mistake, it WAS a fun trip, even if we didn't find all that we went for.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, the ER boxes are - for the most part - not there.  Or we didn't find<br/>
them.  We looked for some and were unable to find them, didn't get a chance<br/>
to look for others.  I don't want to leave the idea that they are definitely<br/>
not there, so I won't mention the ones we looked for and couldn't find.  We<br/>
didn't find any at all in the Enchanted Rock SNA.  I will say, though, that<br/>
we didn't get a chance to look for Cancan's Extreme Turkey Trot or Silver<br/>
Eagle's Turkey Peak and those were two I think I specifically said we would<br/>
try for.<br/>
<br/>
We swapped out our intended Thursday for Friday, so Friday was Luckenbach,<br/>
Grapetown, and the Old Tunnel WMA.  Off we set after breakfast in<br/>
Fredericksburg to go to Luckenbach first.  Somehow or another, I managed to<br/>
get us way off course, so we corrected by going first to Grapetown.  I<br/>
somehow missed seeing Can Can's Raisins in the Sun box listing, so we didn't<br/>
even look for it, but we DID find The Golden Throne!  What a cute box and a<br/>
neat location.  Wouldn't you know - we were stamping in on the front steps<br/>
when another family came poking through, exploring the school.  We were well<br/>
away from the hiding spot, so we made no attempt to cover up or explain what<br/>
we were doing, but they certainly gave us several odd looks.  We offered to<br/>
move so they could peak in behind where we were, but they declined.  It then<br/>
became a waiting game, but we outlasted them and hid the box back after they<br/>
drove off.  I thought it was interesting the amount of traffic that came and<br/>
went through the big closed gate beyond the school.  It was like grand<br/>
central station.  I wanted to drive up to the gate to see if they would let<br/>
us in, but Fearless Fox wouldn't do it.<br/>
<br/>
On we went to Old Tunnel WMA and since I had messed us up on Luckenbach,<br/>
Fearless Fox had lost confidence in my navigational skills (which were, I<br/>
must say, on the whole pretty darned good through the whole trip!).  He<br/>
simply did not believe that Old Tunnel could be as far down the road as it<br/>
was and nearly turned around several times.  We finally came upon it, and as<br/>
I read the clues for the box there, I doubted myself briefly , thinking we<br/>
might have found a different entrance to it.  After reading more and<br/>
exploring it a bit, I got my groove back and knew we were cool.  We ventured<br/>
down the trail a distance, checked out the tunnel, smelled the evidence of<br/>
the bat and finally went after the box.  Nice box, cool hiding spot.  Neat<br/>
place all the way around.  I'd love to go back when the bats are flying.<br/>
I'll bet they really smell then!<br/>
<br/>
By then, we realized we really weren't too far from Comfort, a town we had<br/>
ruled out because we thought it was a little far out of range for this<br/>
trip.  Feeling like we had forever, we ventured on down there to see what we<br/>
could find or not find.  As was the case, we had some misses, but we had<br/>
some very cool finds too!  Another difference between Fearless Fox's and my<br/>
travel styles is that I go strictly by instructions and by the map.  He gets<br/>
a feel for what direction to go and finds his way to where we are going.  I<br/>
don't understand it, but it works.  We decided we would go out to Singing<br/>
Waters Vineyard for a glass of wine and Baby Bear's letterbox.  I gave very<br/>
explicit directions based on Baby Bear's clues and he half listened and took<br/>
off.  I rolled my eyes, trying to keep track of where we were so I could<br/>
tell him where he messed up.  Somehow or another we wound up at the Vineyard<br/>
and drove in.  We were the only visitors, and there were some men working<br/>
outside, so we nonchalantly ventured about and looked at the tree in<br/>
question.  We found the box, sneaked it back to the car, then went in and<br/>
sampled.  The ladies were very nice there and we bought a bottle of a<br/>
semi-sweet Merlot named Sweet Lupe after the dog.  We managed to stamp in<br/>
and get the box back to its hiding place, but interestingly, the box was<br/>
planted in April and except for Silver Eagle who found it a few weeks after<br/>
it was planted, there had been no visitors to the box before us.<br/>
<br/>
We had in mind visiting Corazon's Where's Hermann? box next, so I carefully<br/>
backtracked directions to the point we had to go to get on track to find<br/>
it.  And Fearless Fox again barreled off cross-country, knowing how to<br/>
connect without backtracking so far.  I tried to direct him, but he knew<br/>
what he was doing, and once again we found ourselves exactly where we needed<br/>
to be.  Corazon's box brought back memories for me - reading what she wrote<br/>
about her years of summer camp there at Hermann Sons reminded me of my own<br/>
several years of camp at Pine Cove near Tyler.  And - because the box is<br/>
hidden at the site of a memorial to campers from a nearby camp who perished<br/>
in floodwaters - it reminded me of that fateful day in 1987 when that camp<br/>
bus washed off the road.  Fearless Fox, Nac Trail Cat, my dad and I were<br/>
rafting on the Guadalupe River that same day just a few miles downriver.<br/>
The torrential rains were overwhelming and we were forced to take cover off<br/>
the river ourselves that day.  I was 8 months pregnant with SJZ and it was a<br/>
dicey situation for awhile, although I don't think any of us really realized<br/>
that until later.  It was sobering later that day after our outfitter had<br/>
picked us up, to hear the news of those kids on that bus.  Fearless Fox and<br/>
I appreciated the opportunity to stand and remember them.<br/>
