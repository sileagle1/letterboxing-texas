                    <div class="plaintext-content">The weather was chilly but sunny for our 4th Annual TX LB Event at <br/>
Lake Somerville SP, and we had about 30 letterboxers and a few LSS <br/>
attend.  Baby Bear and Clueless Collector got a roaring fire started <br/>
in the fireplace and kept it going all day, and that, along with all <br/>
the chili, kept most people warm.  And warm is the word I would use <br/>
to describe the feel of this Event.  Everyone was friendly, excited <br/>
and just plain glad to be there as we talked with boxers from the <br/>
past and met new ones, too.<br/>
<br/>
After eating, the LB Trivia game was played with Barefoot Lucy edging <br/>
out Gryzzled Gryphon for first place with 26 out of 35 answers <br/>
correct.  Most found it fun to hear the stories behind the answers <br/>
even if they did not win.  <br/>
<br/>
Next it was time for Sandibox to give her demo on creative logbook <br/>
making, followed by Barfoot Lucy showing how to carve with a dremel.  <br/>
Both demos were well received and highly appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the afternoon was spent looking for boxes in the park <br/>
until darkness forced us back to the pavilion for cleanup and more <br/>
talk.  Many people were not camping and had to go home, but a few <br/>
stayed until after 9:00 telling stories and getting to know each <br/>
other better.  This is one of my favorite things about Events, and I <br/>
am always grateful when some boxers stick around for it.  Each time I <br/>
learn a little more about my fellow boxers (even GG) and it is fun, <br/>
too.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to thank Baby Bear for helping me plan the Event, <br/>
getting the prizes for the Trivia contest, and everything else that <br/>
made it successful.  I would also like to thank everyone who came <br/>
with food, boxes, or just a fun attitude.  You are the best!<br/>

P.S.  I have posted pictures from the Event in the Photos section  <br/>
