I was on the Ohio boxers forum and saw that you are participating in  <br>
their Box of the Month.  How cool!  We are heading up there on  <br>
December 7th for my husband's Strong Man Competition.  It looks like  <br>
it'll be too soon for me to get your box. :-(<br>
<br>
I was asking them about boxing in the snow.  I assume that it is  <br>
impossible, because even if you manage to find a box, its hiding spot  <br>
would then be obvious because of the disturbance to the snow covered  <br>
ground around it.  Talk about leaving tracks!  I don't know what I'm  <br>
going to do for an entire day in Columbus if there is snow on the  <br>
ground!  If I have to sit and watch that contest I'll be bored to tears.<br>
<br>
I'm so glad we don't have to worry about snow around here!<br>

I was on the New Boxers thread and they suggested to take along some <br>
yellow gateraid to sprinkle on the snow around the tree where the box <br>
is and other people would think that a man had relieved himself there <br>
and not go near it but other boxers would know what's up. <br>

<div><font size="2">Oh that's funny. I used to get cabin fever when I lived in CT, so on sunny winter days, I'd do a little letterboxing (hiking) in the snow... even had to wear my snowshoes a couple of times. Truthfully the snow has so many places where it is disturbed from ice and snow falling from tree branches, deer and animals rooting around and other hikers, I never actually considered disturbed snow to be an issue. I had a small fold-up shovel in my backpack (used in the summer for burying my Lab's gift back to nature). It was a necessary tool for digging out a letterbox in the winter. The big problem is the depth of snow. If it's too deep, you may not be able to find the landmarks listed in the clues. I remember one hike in deep snow, uphill for nearly two miles. By the time I got up to the location where the letterbox was supposed to be (a firetower on the top of a mountain), I couldn't find the rocks under the snow where the box was hidden. The strangest thing though... I enjoyed that challenging hike so much that even though I couldn't find the box, it was one of my favorites! Guess you don't need that stamp to validate the box every time!</font></div>

<div>My memorable snow experience was a letterbox on the Fremont Pass in 
Colorado in January two years ago.  We found the place, with the 
landmarks just visible in a real blizzard, and stopped at the side of the road 
trying to figure out if it was even possible to get through those deep drifts to 
find the box in the snow - I really really wanted to try it, but good sense 
prevailed - that, and the big snowplow that was bearing down on me while I stood 
there  weighing the possibility of climbing through drifts over my 
head to get to it.   But luckily, we were back there again in 
September this year, and, even without the clues, we recognized the exact spot, 
found the box, and it was all the sweeter for having been a deferred 
gratification!  It really is the journey, not always the stamp, that 
counts.  </div>
