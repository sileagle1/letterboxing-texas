                    <html><body><div>Under a different subject line, I mentioned that we could house clues on this list's homepage.  Read the following options carefully, and read the caveat at the bottom at least three times - please!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For easy reference, the homepage is <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/letterboxingtexas">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/letterboxingtexas</a> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have three options:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) Clues can be actually posted under the files section of the group.  I'm working on cleaning up this section, but we presently have 18MB available.  If you don't have a site of your own and you aren't interested in creating one, you can post them in the files section.   HOWEVER, if you choose to do this, keep the clues very simple, no graphics, no frills.  That way we can house as many as possible.  This is the LEAST preferable way to house clues.  Once the file section is full, it's full.  If it fills up with clues, we'll have to eventually figure out some way to decide what stays and what goes.  It would be, however, a fine place to house clues temporarily.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Links to personal pages with clues listed can be posted in the Links section of the group.  There is a folder there for Texas Letterboxing Clues and for Clues outside of Texas.  I would say you should post your site wherever it would fit primarily; however, if you can't decide post it in both places.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) Clues can be posted directly to the list as a message, where it will be archived.  HOWEVER, before anyone does that, we need to agree on a format for it.  My suggestion is:  CLUE: County, City, Box Name, Placer, Placed Date.  Future finders could search archives for boxes fairly easily using any of those fields.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>CAVEAT:  Bear in mind that in no circumstance should anyone rely on this list as the sole location of their clues.  Yahoo changes how things are done and what they allow, and who knows what the future brings.  If you are counting on this list as the sole listing of your clues, be sure to keep a backup copy on your hard drive!  If something happens and Yahoo decides, for example, to begin taking away archives over "XXX" years old, Silver Eagle and I will feel terribly that you lost your clues, but we can't help you and we can't be responsible.
