<div>We found 2 of the 3 boxes and

*blush*  I'm no artist, I just have patience. It take it my clues <br/>
were okay.<br/>
<br/>
 I'm sorry you didn't get the Box Kite.  The city doesn't maintain <br/>
that part of the park as well as they should.  You probably would <br/>
have liked that one too, it has letters. Maybe on your next visit?<br/>
<br/>
I didn't mount the Pond stamp upside down did I? I was afraid <br/>
something like that would happen.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, you've made me very happy. My first plants were a success! <br/>
My clues didn't suck!  My stamps are acceptable!<br/>
<br/>
This makes me want to plant more.<br/>

 Oh, and that Maoi statue in the park was really something...and <br/>
then when Calico Rose and I were driving from Riverside Park to the <br/>
other park, we saw a whole bunch of them at an industrial site! <br/>
Strange! LOL! <br/>

Did you notice the yellow jacket nest "booger" in the Moai? There's <br/>
also some sparrows living in his left eye. The other Moai you saw <br/>
were all made by the same man.  I'm pretty sure that he owns the <br/>
busines you drove past. There is also a big one standing in front of <br/>
some storage building in Seadrift. I thought they were pretty neat <br/>
too.<br/>
