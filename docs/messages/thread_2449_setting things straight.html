<div>Enough of the PI 
conspiracy, I confess!  If you read me post you will remember that I met DB 
on the trail, she was on her way out while we were on our way in.  I was 
going to "oil up" the box, but since she was right there I just smeared it on my 
hand and rubbed it on her neck while patting her on the back in congratulations 
for beating me.  You all may not know this about me, but I am a fierce 
competitor.  I'll stop at nothing to win.  (Even though you already 
know I was beaten by RFC)</div></body></html>
