You have to be willing to depend on others to provide maintenance for your box and when it goes missing, you must be willing to let it go.  I don't generally place boxes without a logbook because I think that's an important part of the game.  Many people will stamp into a logbook when they won't log a find online.  So, if you ever do get to see your logbook, it's really fun to see who has been there that you never knew about.  That being said, some people do place boxes with stamp only and no logbook.  Since there are no rules about that, you are free to do whatever you want to do.  What area do you plan to visit?  There are places in Texas where boxes are very scarce.<br>

> Most people hide boxes wherever they go, even knowing they won't be back that way.  You have to be willing to depend on others to provide maintenance for your box and when it goes missing, you must be willing to let it go.  I don't generally place boxes without a logbook because I think that's an important part of the game.  Many people will stamp into a logbook when they won't log a find online.  So, if you ever do get to see your logbook, it's really fun to see who has been there that you never knew about.  That being said, some people do place boxes with stamp only and no logbook.  Since there are no rules about that, you are free to do whatever you want to do.  What area do you plan to visit?  There are places in Texas where boxes are very scarce.<br>

<body style="background-color: #fff;">Can't say I always know what kind of letterbox container I'm going to find...not everyone uses l&amp;l boxes all the time.  I often use a camo pouch or camo covered box &amp; have found many micro boxes in a variety of small containers, film canisters or pill containers, whatever.  Depends on the planter, location, size, all kinds of things.  Part of the fun is not knowing exactly what to expect.  And of the multitude of accidental geocaches I've come across, I've seen film canisters, ammo boxes (chained to trees!), plastic shoeboxes the size of a breadbox, even a huge honking 25 gallon paint bucket with a lid, sticking halfway out of a big hole, so apparently they also vary considerably.  Just sayin.<br/>Viewfinder<br/><br/>Sent from my HTC Inspire™ 4G on AT&amp;T<br/><br/><div id="htc_header" style="">----- Reply message -----<br/>From: "Boots Tex" &lt;redbarn@eastex.net&gt;<br/>To: &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Question about hiding a box<br/>Date: Tue, Aug 13, 2013 11:00 am<br/><br/></div><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">They could, and some do, but it's more of a geocache thing.  When the clue takes you directly to the box, as in letterboxing, knowing the type of container isn't as important.  When you are taken to a general location, as in geocaching, it sometimes helps to know what kind or size of container you're looking for since you're searching a much larger area.<br>

the planter, help with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; maintenance if they can, and be 
cautious about logging attempts (since this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; can discourage 
future boxers). The differences are subtle, and if you move<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we need a letterboxing

They are by far two different groups with separate rules and should stay that way. Btw baseball over football any day, though now I will juggle my single mom life in both sports.

Please take a look at these Game of Letterboxer Life boxes he has planted on both the east coast and the west coast.  I found one of them last week and will be looking for the other at the end of this month.  The clues are so clever, even if you won’t get to look for the box.  <br>

I love hearing from finders, vicariously experience being there again myself! Of course I always think I WILL return, but have had wonderful experiences from others who'be taken care of those boxes for me. But I would not just leave a bunch of random boxes anywhere just to have a lot of boxes out there.  <br>

<div>I don't know why anyone would be looking for letterboxes with geocaching rules.  I've never understood the need for hybrids.  These are two separate and different activities.  You can do either or both, but why try to combine them?  You can play baseball or you can play football, but why would you want to play baseball using the rules of football?  That doesn't make sense to me.<br/>

<div>I don't know why anyone would be looking for letterboxes with geocaching rules.  I've never understood the need for hybrids.  These are two separate and different activities.  You can do either or both, but why try to combine them?  You can play baseball or you can play football, but why would you want to play baseball using the rules of football?  That doesn't make sense to me.<wbr>

&gt; If you're looking for letterboxes with geocaching rules, geocaching.com has letterbox hybrids; we've also seen letterboxes that list coordinates like a geocache. <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe it's about expectations. If you start in one hobby you get used to<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; things being a certain way and then when you start in the other it doesn't<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; seem right. Those starting in letterboxing and moving to geocaching would<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; probably find the rules too restrictive - someone has to review and approve<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; your plant before it's listed, and you have either live close to the cache<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; or prove you visit a location often enough to maintain it. That would<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; probably give letterboxers fits, but geocachers start out that way and don't<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; think twice about it. <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; The attitudes of the communities are also different which causes some<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; friction. In geocaching, the planter is expected to follow the rules and<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; keep their boxes in good shape, and cachers are expected to provide lots of<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; feedback on box condition to help the planter and others. In letterboxing<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; the boxer is expected to respect the wishes of the planter, help with<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; maintenance if they can, and be cautious about logging attempts (since this<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; can discourage future boxers). The differences are subtle, and if you move<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; from geocaching to letterboxing it's likely you won't catch on before you<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; offend someone - I know I did!<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe we need a letterboxing guide for geocachers that we post every few<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; months for people just discovering letterboxing?<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; And a disadvantage to geocaching is that you wouldn't have known to look<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; under the flagstone, you would have been beating the bushes in a 25 ft.<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; radius. I'm not sure why we've been getting these posts concerning the rules<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; of geocaching vs. the no rules of letterboxing. Letterboxing is a different<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; game and you can't and shouldn't apply geocaching rules to letterboxing. If<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; you want to play both games, you should play each game as it was intended to<wbr>

&gt; &gt; &gt; be played, at least in my humble opinion.<wbr>
