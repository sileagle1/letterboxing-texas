Looks like our Texas group is growing by leaps and bounds! This is<br/>
really exciting - we're looking forward to lots more boxes to find!<br/>
<br/>
We have started up another order for the Lone Star Letterboxing<br/>
T-shirts, and only need a total of 12 shirts to submit it to the<br/>
silk-screening company. <br/>
<br/>
The current shirt is desert-washed pigment dyed denim blue with the<br/>
Texas Letterboxing logo on the left chest. Above and below the logo in a<br/>
coordinating bright green is: "Lone Star Letterboxing".<br/>
<br/>
The shirts range in size from Youth Small to Adult XXXL, $9.00 per shirt<br/>
up to Adult L. Bigger sizes are a dollar extra per additional size. The<br/>
packing &amp; shipping for padded mailers, postage &amp; delivery confirmation<br/>
came to $3.50 for one shirt and a dollar extra per additional shirt.<br/>
<br/>
These shirts are also available in other "desert-washed" colors and I<br/>
plan to order a couple in dusty forest-green for my family. The logo<br/>
would also look good on a dusty royal blue or peach color. It would not<br/>
show up on lime green because of the outlining. Other colors would<br/>
probably clash a bit with the orange, green and royal blue logo!<br/>
<br/>
Please email me off-list if you would like to place an order:<br/>
celticlions@comcast.net<br/>
<br/>
And please bear in mind that these shirts may take a month or more to be<br/>
delivered - we need to reach an order of 12, then it should be 10<br/>
business days for turnaround on the printing and a few days for me to<br/>
package &amp; mail them!<br/>
<br/>
Take care-<br/>
