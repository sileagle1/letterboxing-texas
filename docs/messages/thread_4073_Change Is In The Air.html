                    <div class="plaintext-content">Due to circumstances beyond my control, several things are changing for me in the cyberworld of letterboxing.  First of all, starting in a few weeks, my email domain is changing from alltel.net to windstream.net, and I have been trying to make the changes in all the right places before that happens.  However, I have it written on most of my logbooks out in the wild, so there is nothing I can do about that.  I am tempted in the future to not include my email in logbooks, since most people that want to contact me can do so through LBNA, but this would exclude the few people that discover my boxes accidentally and want to let me know about them.  <br>
<br>
Second, and even more drastic, Yahoo recently announced they were discontinuing their free Geocities web hosting service, which I have been using to host my clues ever since I started letterboxing back in 2002.  My alternatives are to pay a monthly fee for the service, move everything to a new free service, or host my clues on LBNA.  My current website consists of more than just clues (pictures, information, links, etc.), and I hate to give it up.  I'm thinking about moving my clues to LBNA since I don't want to do this again in the future if the next web hosting service I choose pulls the plug.  Also, I have often wondered what would happen to my clues after I'm gone, so putting them on LBNA seems the best long-term solution.  I probably will still create a new website for all the other non-critical stuff, so I have a lot of work ahead of me.<br>
<br>
Bottom line, be aware that my email is changing soon, and my clues will be later this year.<br>
