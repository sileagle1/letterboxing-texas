<div>I would really think letterboxing would go right down Austin's alley, but for some reason it hasn't caught on heavily there.  There are quite a few boxes there, but very few dedicated boxers.  It's a shame too, because the boxers that ARE there could really incubate a pocket of boxers.

<div>I'd be interested to see your logbook on that one, but I think it's great the cacher's offered to watch your box.  That's how the games should both be played - with respect for the other.</div>
