<div>  I have been 
thinking about Lucy's question about logbooks.  I think what I like best is 
to find a DRY logbook :)  When I make mine I try to make them with an 
imprint of the stamp on the cover, especially my boxes that have several parts 
that need to be put together, so the finder realizes, just for example, that the 
skeleton should have 2 arms, or that the hotel has guests to find.  It is 
always fun to find a logbook that has something "extra" to it; a cool cover, 
extra information, a box dedication, interesting binding, something along those 
lines.  Of course, the grand champion of all logbooks is the one in the 
Happy Birthday Texas PLB, but I wouldn't expect to find something that 
spectacular out in the wild!  I have done several postal rings now, and the 
logbooks that some people make are totally amazing.

<div>I think making logs can 
be a really creative part of putting a box together, and it is a lot of fun to 
look at all the paper options out there!  Even more fun, for me at least, 
is looking at all the stuff (read junk, or even trash)I have around the house 
and thinking of ways to use it to make a log.  I always cut apart the backs 
of the countless notebooks the kids bring home at the end of the school year, I 
have used a TIDE box, old silk flower leaves, instructions for a lego set long 
ago dismantled....my logs aren't ever anything very fancy or spectacular, but it 
is fun to see what you can put together from what you have lying around.  
Of course, you must understand that I am the one who actually had 25 empty 
coffee cans in the house to turn into drums when armadillo girl was in 
kindergarten, and I know that there are at least 40 empty toilet paper rolls in 
the drawer in my bathroom.  Maybe I need a 12 step program for learning to 
throw away potential craft materials.  MO5</div></body></html>

<p>Just thought I'd chime in here...If you are really looking for <br/>something to help you organize the clutter, then I recommend a <br/>website called Flylady. The URL is: <a href="http://www.flylady.net">www.flylady.net
</a>. To join is <br/>free and she has quite a take on organizing quite a lot of stuff. <br/>It's a whole other addiction, I mean hobby.<br/><br/>Sun Colors<br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">

<br/>there! Even more fun, for me at least, is looking at all the stuff <br/>(read junk, or even trash)I have around the house and thinking of <br/>ways to use it to make a log. I always cut apart the backs of the <br/>countless notebooks the kids bring home at the end of the school 
<br/>year, I have used a TIDE box, old silk flower leaves, instructions <br/>for a lego set long ago dismantled....my logs aren't ever anything <br/>very fancy or spectacular, but it is fun to see what you can put <br/>together from what you have lying around. Of course, you must 
<br/>understand that I am the one who actually had 25 empty coffee cans in <br/>the house to turn into drums when armadillo girl was in kindergarten, <br/>and I know that there are at least 40 empty toilet paper rolls in the 
<br/>drawer in my bathroom. Maybe I need a 12 step program for learning <br/>to throw away potential craft materials. MO5<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></span></p></div><span width="1"></span> </div></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>
