<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">  I have been 
thinking about Lucy's question about logbooks.  I think what I like best is 
to find a DRY logbook :)  When I make mine I try to make them with an 
imprint of the stamp on the cover, especially my boxes that have several parts 
that need to be put together, so the finder realizes, just for example, that the 
skeleton should have 2 arms, or that the hotel has guests to find.  It is 
always fun to find a logbook that has something "extra" to it; a cool cover, 
extra information, a box dedication, interesting binding, something along those 
lines.  Of course, the grand champion of all logbooks is the one in the 
Happy Birthday Texas PLB, but I wouldn't expect to find something that 
spectacular out in the wild!  I have done several postal rings now, and the 
logbooks that some people make are totally amazing.

be a really creative part of putting a box together, and it is a lot of fun to 
look at all the paper options out there!  Even more fun, for me at least,

have used a TIDE box, old silk flower leaves, instructions for a lego set long

is fun to see what you can put together from what you have lying around.  
Of course, you must understand that I am the one who actually had 25 empty 
coffee cans in the house to turn into drums when armadillo girl was in 
kindergarten, and I know that there are at least 40 empty toilet paper rolls in
