<div>are any of you ladies by any chance attending
                        the daisy-themed convention in The Woodlands
                        this weekend?  If yes, bring along your stamp
                        and let's have a meetup and do a little exchange
                        while we are there.  I'll still be getting email
                        on my phone, so I can check later on, to see if
                        I've heard back from anyone.  I'll toss my
                        letterboxing bag in the trunk, just in case!</div>

<br>
This particular event that I mentioned is not actually a letterboxing event at all, it's a completely different conference, but it occurred to me that with hundreds of people attending, perhaps at least one of them would be a letterboxer!<br>
<br>
hopefully we can meet up another time!<br>

take care,<br>
