                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have some boxes that went missing. I have replaced them but not <br>
exactly in the same location. One I gave another name and just <br>
presented it as a new box but another box was not really missing but <br>
damaged so I cleaned it up and then decided to put it in another place <br>
that was safer and corrected the clues. Now for the question. Is this <br>
the correct way to do this? I also have removed another for mantaince <br>
and shall replace it as soon as posible but it also maybe in a slightly <br>
different location. How should I handle these. I thought I might need <br>
to just rename them and make new clues and totally retire the missing <br>
ones and not replace them. Please give me some clues as to how to <br>
handle this. Thanks<br>

<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just modify the clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the clues somewhere as to the date the box was moved so that later you can track the history of your box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally place, before it was moved.  A few months later, she then goes to find the box with a different name in a different place and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note an explanation for the duplicate entries.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and she basks in the attention of her great-great-grandkids, who are sitting at her knee saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were young, Grandmother!".  She cracks open her logbook and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With innocent eyes, her great-great-granddaughter peers up at her and asks, "But Great-great-grandma, why are these two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no denying that those two images in the logbook are identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile at a much younger age than previously thought, because in her silly state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with two different box names and counted it twice.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad reality that she never really hit that mark, but stands at F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony of it is that she lived out her final days believing a lie, when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you are using the same stamp and only slightly changing the location, call it an adjustment and keep everything else the same.  If you don't want to use the same stamp, but you want to leave a box there but not in exactly the same place, you can call that a new box and you can take the old stamp and launch it as a hitchhiker or a postal or something.

silver in his feathers is probably already there.<br>
<br>
When my early boxes went missing, I used to recarve the same stamp and <br>
replace the box in a better location within the same park.  I called <br>
it the same name and did not count it as a new plant, but changed the <br>
clues appropriately and noted the replace date.  After recarving many <br>
stamps that had already been found by quite a few letterboxers, I <br>
decided to start carving different stamps and renaming the box, <br>
usually by adding a 2 on the end (e.g. Corpus Porpoise 2).  I <br>
considered these to be new boxes so letterboxers who had already <br>
found the original could find a new one.  The theme is usually the <br>
same, especially if it was specific to the location, but the image is <br>
a little different.  I then retire the old box but don't delete the <br>
clues, just for history's sake.<br>

        stamp in a different location, the clues would be different but the 
        stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry young letterboxer found the 
        box shortly after it was originally place, before it was 
        moved.  A few months later, she then goes to find the box with 
        a different name in a different place and she gets the SAME stamp 
        image.  It made perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no 
        reason to note an explanation for the duplicate entries.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and 
        she basks in the attention of her great-great-<wbr>grandkids, 
        who are sitting at her knee saying "Tell us about how 
        letterboxing was when YOU were young, Grandmother!".  She cracks 
        open her logbook and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  
        With innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter peers up at 
        her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why are these two the 
        same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no denying that 
        those two images in the logbook are identical.  Different color ink 
        maybe, but yes, they ARE the same.  As she struggles to remember 
        why such a thing would happen, she finally decides she must have become 
        senile at a much younger age than previously thought, because in her 
        silly state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with 
        two different box names and counted it twice.  </wbr></wbr></wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 and 
        refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that landmark.  
        But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST have found one twice, 
        and now, when her legs have failed her, her eyesight is dimming, and her 
        wits are often absent, and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to 
        face the sad reality that she never really hit that mark, but stands at 
        F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her days 
        pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony of it is that 
        she lived out her final days believing a lie, when in truth she HAD 
        reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason for duplicate 
        entries in her logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! 
        </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you are

<div>Will you be using the same stamp on the two you are doing maintenance and repair on?  It sounds like it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just modify the clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the clues somewhere as to the date the box was moved so that later you can track the history of your box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally place, before it was moved.  A few months later, she then goes to find the box with a different name in a different place and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note an explanation for the duplicate entries.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and she basks in the attention of her great-great-grandkids, who are sitting at her knee saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were young, Grandmother!".  She cracks open her logbook and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With innocent eyes, her great-great-granddaughter peers up at her and asks, "But Great-great-grandma, why are these two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no denying that those two images in the logbook are identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile at a much younger age than previously thought, because in her silly state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with two different box names and counted it twice.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad reality that she never really hit that mark, but stands at F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony of it is that she lived out her final days believing a lie, when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you are using the same stamp and only slightly changing the location, call it an adjustment and keep everything else the same.  If you don't want to use the same stamp, but you want to leave a box there but not in exactly the same place, you can call that a new box and you can take the old stamp and launch it as a hitchhiker or a postal or something.

<p><span>
<div>Will you be using the same stamp on the two you are doing 
              maintenance and repair on?  It sounds like it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box 
              slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just modify the 
              clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the clues somewhere 
              as to the date the box was moved so that later you can track the 
              history of your box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted the 
              same stamp in a different location, the clues would be different 
              but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry young 
              letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally place, 
              before it was moved.  A few months later, she then goes 
              to find the box with a different name in a different place 
              and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made perfect 
              sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note an 
              explanation for the duplicate entries.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and 
              she basks in the attention of her 
              great-great-<wbr>grandkids, who are sitting at her knee 
              saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were 
              young, Grandmother!<wbr>".  She cracks open her logbook and 
              proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With 
              innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter peers up at 
              her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why are these two the 
              same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no denying 
              that those two images in the logbook are identical.  
              Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE the same.  As 
              she struggles to remember why such a thing would happen, she 
              finally decides she must have become senile at a much younger age 
              than previously thought, because in her silly state she had gone 
              and found the same box twice, labeled it with two different box 
              names and counted it twice.  </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 and 
              refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that 
              landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST 
              have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, her 
              eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she CAN no 
              longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad reality that she 
              never really hit that mark, but stands at F99,999.  
              Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her days pondering over 
              that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony of it is that she 
              lived out her final days believing a lie, when in truth she 
              HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason for 
              duplicate entries in her logbook.  And we all know - the 
              logbook never lies! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you 
              are using the same stamp and only slightly changing the 
              location, call it an adjustment and keep everything else the 
              same.  If you don't want to use the same stamp, but you want 
              to leave a box there but not in exactly the same place, you can 
              call that a new box and you can take the old stamp and launch it 
              as a hitchhiker or a postal or something. </div>
<div> </div></span>
</p><div><span>
<div>Think of those of us who will eventually reach senility and 
              all we will have to show for our lives are our volumes of 
              logbooks!</div>

<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally place, before it was moved.  A few months later, she then goes to find the box with a different name in a different place and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note an explanation for the duplicate entries.

<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and she basks in the attention of her great-great-grandkids, who are sitting at her knee saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were young, Grandmother!".  She cracks open her logbook and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With innocent eyes, her great-great-granddaughter peers up at her and asks, "But Great-great-grandma, why are these two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no denying that those two images in the logbook are identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile at a much younger age than previously thought, because in her silly state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with two different box names and counted it twice.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad reality that she never really hit that mark, but stands at F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony of it is that she lived out her final days believing a lie, when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you are using the same stamp and only slightly changing the location, call it an adjustment and keep everything else the same.  If you don't want to use the same stamp, but you want to leave a box there but not in exactly the same place, you can call that a new box and you can take the old stamp and launch it as a hitchhiker or a postal or something.

<p><span>
<div>Will you be using the same stamp on the two you are doing 
                maintenance and repair on?  It sounds like it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box 
                slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just modify 
                the clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the clues 
                somewhere as to the date the box was moved so that later you can 
                track the history of your box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted 
                the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be 
                different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry 
                young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally 
                place, before it was moved.  A few months later, she 
                then goes to find the box with a different name in a different 
                place and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made 
                perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note 
                an explanation for the duplicate entries.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and 
                she basks in the attention of her 
                great-great-<wbr>grandkids, who are sitting at her knee 
                saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were 
                young, Grandmother!".  She cracks open her logbook and 
                proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With 
                innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter peers up 
                at her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why are these 
                two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no 
                denying that those two images in the logbook are 
                identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE 
                the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing 
                would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile at 
                a much younger age than previously thought, because in her silly 
                state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with 
                two different box names and counted it twice.  </wbr></wbr></wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 
                and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that 
                landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST 
                have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, 
                her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she 
                CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad reality 
                that she never really hit that mark, but stands at 
                F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her 
                days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony 
                of it is that she lived out her final days believing a lie, 
                when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't 
                remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her 
                logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you 
                are using the same stamp and only slightly changing

<div>
<p><span>
<div>Will you be using the same stamp on the two you are doing 
                maintenance and repair on?  It sounds like it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box 
                slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just modify 
                the clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the clues 
                somewhere as to the date the box was moved so that later you can 
                track the history of your box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted 
                the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be 
                different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry 
                young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally 
                place, before it was moved.  A few months later, she 
                then goes to find the box with a different name in a different 
                place and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made 
                perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note 
                an explanation for the duplicate entries.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and 
                she basks in the attention of her 
                great-great-<wbr>grandkids, who are sitting at her knee 
                saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were 
                young, Grandmother!<wbr>".  She cracks open her logbook and 
                proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With 
                innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter peers up 
                at her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why are these 
                two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no 
                denying that those two images in the logbook are 
                identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE 
                the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing 
                would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile at 
                a much younger age than previously thought, because in her silly 
                state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with 
                two different box names and counted it twice.  </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 
                and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that 
                landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST 
                have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, 
                her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she 
                CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad reality 
                that she never really hit that mark, but stands at 
                F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her 
                days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony 
                of it is that she lived out her final days believing a lie, 
                when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't 
                remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her 
                logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you 
                are using the same stamp and only slightly changing 
                the location, call it an adjustment and keep everything else the 
                same.  If you don't want to use the same stamp, but you 
                want to leave a box there but not in exactly the same place, you 
                can call that a new box and you can take the old stamp and 
                launch it as a hitchhiker or a postal or something. </div>
<div> </div></span>
</p><div><span>
<div>Think of those of us who will eventually reach senility and 
                all we will have to show for our lives are our volumes of 
                logbooks!</div>

<div>Will you be using the same stamp on the two you are doing 
                  maintenance and repair on?  It sounds like it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box 
                  slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just modify 
                  the clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the clues 
                  somewhere as to the date the box was moved so that later you 
                  can track the history of your box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted 
                  the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be 
                  different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry 
                  young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was 
                  originally place, before it was moved.  A few months 
                  later, she then goes to find the box with a different name in 
                  a different place and she gets the SAME stamp 
                  image.  It made perfect sense to her at the time, so she 
                  saw no reason to note an explanation for the duplicate 
                  entries.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray 
                  and she basks in the attention of her 
                  great-great-<wbr>grandkids, who are sitting at her knee 
                  saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were 
                  young, Grandmother!<wbr>".  She cracks open her logbook 
                  and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With 
                  innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter peers 
                  up at her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why are 
                  these two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but 
                  there is no denying that those two images in the logbook are 
                  identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE 
                  the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing 
                  would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile 
                  at a much younger age than previously thought, because in her 
                  silly state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled 
                  it with two different box names and counted it twice.  
                  </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 
                  and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that 
                  landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she 
                  MUST have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed 
                  her, her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, 
                  and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she has to face the sad 
                  reality that she never really hit that mark, but stands at 
                  F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her 
                  days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The 
                  irony of it is that she lived out her final days believing a 
                  lie, when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she 
                  couldn't remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her 
                  logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If 
                  you are using the same stamp and only slightly 
                  changing the location, call it an adjustment and keep 
                  everything else the same.  If you don't want to use the 
                  same stamp, but you want to leave a box there but not in 
                  exactly the same place, you can call that a new box and you 
                  can take the old stamp and launch it as a hitchhiker or a 
                  postal or something. </div>
<div> </div></span>

<div>Think of those of us who will eventually reach senility 
                  and all we will have to show for our lives are our volumes of 
                  logbooks!</div>

 track the history of your box.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you planted the same stamp in a different location, the clues would be different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our heroine, the spry young letterboxer found the box shortly after it was originally place, before it was moved.  A few months later, she then goes to find the box with a different name in a different place and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to note an explanation for the duplicate entries.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray and she basks in the attention of her great-great-<wbr>grandkids, who are sitting at her knee saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU were young, Grandmother!<wbr>".  She cracks open her logbook and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  With
 innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter peers up at her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why are these two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, but there is no denying that those two images in the logbook are identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, they ARE the same.  As she struggles to remember why such a thing would happen, she finally decides she must have become senile at a much younger age than previously thought, because in her silly state she had gone and found the same box twice, labeled it with two different box names and counted it twice.  </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div> <div> </div> <div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit F100,000 and refused to give up letterboxing until she reached that landmark.  But her logbook must speak the truth - she MUST have found one twice, and now, when her legs have failed her, her eyesight is dimming, and her wits are often absent, and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she has
 to face the sad reality that she never really hit that mark, but stands at F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must live the rest of her days pondering over that lost dream of 100,000.  The irony of it is that she lived out her final days believing a lie, when in truth she HAD reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason for duplicate entries in her logbook.  And we all know - the logbook never lies! </div> <div> </div> <div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If you are using the same stamp and only slightly changing the location, call it an adjustment and keep everything else the same.  If you don't want to use the same stamp, but you want to leave a box there but not in exactly the same place, you can call that a new box and you can take the old stamp and launch it as a hitchhiker or a postal or something. </div> <div> </div></span> <div><span> <div>Think of those of us who will eventually reach
 senility and all we will have to show for our lives are our volumes of logbooks!</div> <div> </div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"   <div></div></span></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></blockquote> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div> <div><span><span style="COLOR: white" width="1"></span></span></div></div></font></blockquote></div></div></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy <br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"   <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div></div></blockquote> <div></div> <div></div></div> <div><span class="e" id="q_112ac27b66bedbf9_4"><span style="COLOR: white" width="1"></span></span></div></div></div></span></div></blockquote></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy <br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

<div>Will you be using the same stamp on the two you are 
                    doing maintenance and repair on?  It sounds like 
                    it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are using the same stamp and only moving the box 
                    slightly, I would stick with the same box name and just 
                    modify the clues.  HOWEVER, I would make a note in the 
                    clues somewhere as to the date the box was moved so that 
                    later you can track the history of your box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think of it in terms of this story.  If you 
                    planted the same stamp in a different location, the clues 
                    would be different but the stamp wouldn't.  Our 
                    heroine, the spry young letterboxer found the box shortly 
                    after it was originally place, before it was 
                    moved.  A few months later, she then goes to find 
                    the box with a different name in a different place 
                    and she gets the SAME stamp image.  It made 
                    perfect sense to her at the time, so she saw no reason to 
                    note an explanation for the duplicate entries.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many boxes and many years later, she gets old and gray 
                    and she basks in the attention of her 
                    great-great-<wbr>grandkids, who are sitting at her knee 
                    saying "Tell us about how letterboxing was when YOU 
                    were young, Grandmother!<wbr>".  She cracks open her 
                    logbook and proceeds to show her stamp images to them.  
                    With innocent eyes, her great-great-<wbr>granddaughter 
                    peers up at her and asks, "But Great-great-<wbr>grandma, why 
                    are these two the same?"  Her old eyes may be feeble, 
                    but there is no denying that those two images in the logbook 
                    are identical.  Different color ink maybe, but yes, 
                    they ARE the same.  As she struggles to remember why 
                    such a thing would happen, she finally decides she must have 
                    become senile at a much younger age than previously thought, 
                    because in her silly state she had gone and found the same 
                    box twice, labeled it with two different box names and 
                    counted it twice.  </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sadly, she had struggled into her old age to hit 
                    F100,000 and refused to give up letterboxing until she 
                    reached that landmark.  But her logbook must speak the 
                    truth - she MUST have found one twice, and now, when her 
                    legs have failed her, her eyesight is dimming, and her wits 
                    are often absent, and she CAN no longer letterbox, and she 
                    has to face the sad reality that she never really hit that 
                    mark, but stands at F99,999.  Broken-hearted, she must 
                    live the rest of her days pondering over that lost dream of 
                    100,000.  The irony of it is that she lived out her 
                    final days believing a lie, when in truth she HAD 
                    reached 100,000, but she couldn't remember the true reason 
                    for duplicate entries in her logbook.  And we all know 
                    - the logbook never lies! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - don't make that poor old lady suffer.  If 
                    you are using the same stamp and only slightly 
                    changing the location, call it an adjustment and keep 
                    everything else the same.  If you don't want to use the 
                    same stamp, but you want to leave a box there but not in 
                    exactly the same place, you can call that a new box and you 
                    can take the old stamp and launch it as a hitchhiker or a 
                    postal or something. </div>

<div>Think of those of us who will eventually reach senility 
                    and all we will have to show for our lives are our volumes 
                    of logbooks!</div>
