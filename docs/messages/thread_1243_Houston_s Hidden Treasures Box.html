<div>Ok you all, the box is at the first treasure 
of Houston...a purple palace of piggy delights called PIGDOM in downtown 
Houston, just a little north of the Museum district.  I chose to start the 
box here because first of all the story behind the pig that was the inspiration 
for the houses decor is wonderful (you can read it and see pictures of the house 
at <a href="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-10-06/cols_daytrips.html">www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2000-10-06/cols_daytrips.html</a> 
);  but also because for me it represents one of the greatest things about 
Houston, you never know what you might find when you leave home.  There are 
oddities and surprises around every corner.</div>
<div>  Ready for the clues?  Ok, go on and 
park near PIGDOM (located at 4208 Crawford Street, Houston).  Get out, walk 
by, and enjoy.  How many pig puns can you find?  Stand facing the 
house.  To the right of the driveway you will see a small wooden 
"boardwalk" crossing the grass.  The box is right underneath this walkway 
at the end closest to the street.  Bring something to drop...as you may 
have to be awfully sneaky to get this box.  However, when we were there 
this morning we didn't see a soul, and even with all the kids doing pig 
imitations trying to summon the pig's ghost we didn't attract any 
attention.  Remember to let this list know when you find it, and even if 
someone else grabs it before you do I highly recommend you take the time to see 
this house.</div>

<div>Went treasure hunting today and found a little gem in PIGDOM! Scored a brand new city map as FF, too! Mine is literally falling apart, so this is much appreciated.  The purple piggy palace is really cool, and definitely worth a look, even if there is no box- even better than the beer can house, if you can imagine that!  Thanks MOF for a great little diversion on a boring Sunday afternoon.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I will re-plant within a week or so.</div>
