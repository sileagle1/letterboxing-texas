                    <div class="plaintext-content">hey there to all...i just got back from a wonderful trip to <br/>
arizona.  thought i would share some of the highlights with ya'll.  <br/>
<br/>
Day 1<br/>
i left here (cherokee county) at 5:18 am on monday, may 28th and my <br/>
first stop was the dallas area to take a break at my cousin's, wag <br/>
time's, house.  after stretching our legs we were back on the road.  <br/>
i then stopped in weatherford and found the badge of friendship<br/>
lb at the greenwood cemetery.  this was a really neat cemetery where <br/>
oliver loving is buried.  my next stop was caddo to find the tejas <br/>
caddo cemetery lb.  this box had a really great stamp and a great <br/>
location.  from here i made my way to stanton to pick up the a<br/>
few old soreheads lb at the st joseph's catholic cemetery.    i <br/>
loved the stamp, and the cemetery was very interesting.  from <br/>
stanton i traveled to midland and got a little confused looking for <br/>
the homerun that never was lb, but finally got my act together and<br/>
located it.  i then looked for the 5 guardian angels lb..found the <br/>
crosses, but unable to locate the memory box.  i then attempted the <br/>
nodding donkeys lb at the oil museum in midland, but a couple of <br/>
muggles decided to look at the oil equipment as well, and they<br/>
werent leaving anytime soon, so decided to attempt that one on my <br/>
way home.   i then went to the commemorative air force museum and <br/>
located the pliska aeroplane lb.  after leaving there, we went to <br/>
the odessa meteor crater and found the texas celestial series<br/>
#3-meteor box.  this was a really neat location.  my navigator, jr, <br/>
was not exactly happy with the location, because he realized that he <br/>
was allergic to a yellow flower that he was sniffing and started <br/>
sneezing.  i think he must have sneezed about 20 times before he got<br/>
it cleared out.  jr and i then decided to stop off at monahans state <br/>
park and we stopped and played in the sand for a little while before <br/>
we stopped for the day.<br/>
<br/>
Day 2<br/>
We were out of the motel by 5:45 and went to pick up the ro-deo de <br/>
ode-ode cowboy box in pecos before dark.  thank goodness for the <br/>
streetlight.  from here we went to mentone and picked up the <br/>
everybody's got to be somewhere lb right at day break.  this was a <br/>
neat find at a neat little town.  it is the county seat of loving <br/>
county even though it only has a population of 15.  we then went to <br/>
kermit to look for the it's not easy being green lb, but<br/>
no luck with this one.  our next stop was roy orbison's hometown, <br/>
wink, and found the only the lonely lb.  we then went to imperial <br/>
and found the horsehead crossing of the rio pecos.  i loved this <br/>
location and the story behind it.  you could actually picture the<br/>
cowboys taking their cows across the pecos river.  next stop was ft <br/>
stockton and found the displaced donkey and abundant water <br/>
letterboxes.  we then went to marfa (no we didnt get to see the <br/>
lights) and found the marfa lb and the giant in marfa lb, which had<br/>
the box of popcorn hh in it.  we then proceeded to valentine.  on <br/>
the way to valentine, we saw a solid white blimp in the air that was <br/>
attached to the ground by a very long wire. there was a sign that <br/>
said U.S. Air Force TARS.  not sure what it is but if anyone knows<br/>
anything about it, please let me know because i am very curious <br/>
about what it is.  we made it to the prada "store" which is actually <br/>
an art exhibit with actual prada pieces from the 2005 collection, <br/>
outside of valentine, but could not find the prada lb. <br/>
throughout the trip from ft stockton to valentine, we did see a lot <br/>
of antelope in an area called antelope vally.  we then traveled <br/>
through el paso into new mexico and through the white sands missile <br/>
range.  after going through alamogordo, we entered the mescalero<br/>
apache reservation.  we did see an ancient volcano on the way to <br/>
ruidoso, which was really awesome.  we then spent the night at <br/>
ruidoso.<br/>
<br/>
Day 3<br/>
Back on the road about 6 am and went to capitan to pick up the smoky <br/>
the bear lb, but the area was not open yet.  this is a really <br/>
beautiful area.  we drove through lincoln county where the lincoln <br/>
county wars were held.  these wars involved billy the kid.  the<br/>
town of lincoln was extremely interesting and also is the sight of <br/>
billy the kid's last escape.  we then arrived in roswell and placed <br/>
3 boxes for my cousin wag time.  we went downtown and located the <br/>
ufo museum, didnt go in because we were there too early. from here <br/>
we made it to fort sumner and picked up the billy the kid microbox <br/>
at the sight of billy the kid's grave.  this was kind of interesting <br/>
because there is a "jail" built over the grave to protect the <br/>
tombstone from being stolen.  went back to capitan and saw<br/>
the grave of smokey the bear and found the smokey the bear lb.  from <br/>
here went through the valley of fire recreation area which was <br/>
really neat.  lots of volcanic rocks.  spent the night in deming, nm<br/>
<br/>
we made it to phoenix on day 4 and stayed in phoenix for a week but <br/>
only found 3 letterboxes during my stay.  we found the sun city <br/>
microbox and the sunny surprise lb and the surprise stadium lb.  we <br/>
decided that letterboxing in 110 degree weather was not fun.  after <br/>
the first week, we went to tucson and while we were there, picked up <br/>
8 letterboxes.  one of the lbs that we found was at an adopt a <br/>
roadway sign where the roadway had been adopted by the tucson area <br/>
letterboxers, which was really neat.  <br/>
<br/>
we had a great trip and all total<br/>
30 letterboxes<br/>
6 hitchhikers<br/>
cant wait to go again, but for now glad to be home.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">ya'know We just attempted smokey the bear a month ago, and didn't have any luck... I <br/>
swear I looked everywhere but under Smokey's corpse. Now that I know it's there, I might <br/>
have to go back for it. Also, I'm sad to hear that the Prada box might be missing. That was <br/>
the first box we ever found so it's kinda special to us. I might have to go check on that one <br/>
. <br/>
     I have to add (since you're one of the few who've found them) that Mentone is probably <br/>
my favorite stamp even though it's so simple, and Horse Head Crossing has got to be my <br/>
favorite location. It's not the most scenic, but geez, it feels like a time machine or <br/>
something. I kept waiting for Comanches to show up :)<br/>
<br/>
sounds like you had a great trip.<br/>

 attempted smokey the bear a month ago, and didn't have any luck... I <br/>swear I looked everywhere but under Smokey's corpse. Now that I know it's there, I might <br/>have to go back for it. Also, I'm sad to hear that the Prada box might be missing. That was <br/>the first box we ever found so it's kinda special to us. I might have to go check on that one <br/>. <br/>I have to add (since you're one of the few who've found them) that Mentone is probably <br/>my favorite stamp even though it's so simple, and Horse Head Crossing has got to be my <br/>favorite location.

 together and<br/>&gt; located it. i then looked for the 5 guardian angels lb..found the <br/>&gt; crosses, but unable to locate the memory box. i then attempted the <br/>&gt; nodding donkeys lb at the oil museum in midland, but a couple of <br/>&gt; muggles decided to look at the oil equipment as well, and they<br/>&gt; werent leaving anytime soon, so decided to attempt that one on my <br/>&gt; way home. i then went to the commemorative air force museum and <br/>&gt; located the pliska aeroplane lb. after leaving there, we went to <br/>&gt; the odessa meteor crater and found the texas celestial series<br/>&gt; #3-meteor box. this was a really neat location. my navigator, jr, <br/>&gt; was not exactly happy with the location, because he realized that he <br/>&gt; was allergic to a yellow flower that he was sniffing and started <br/>&gt; sneezing. i think he must have sneezed about 20 times before he got<br/>&gt; it cleared out. jr and i then decided to stop off at monahans state

 river. next stop was ft <br/>&gt; stockton and found the displaced donkey and abundant water <br/>&gt; letterboxes. we then went to marfa (no we didnt get to see the <br/>&gt; lights) and found the marfa lb and the giant in marfa lb, which had<br/>&gt; the box of popcorn hh in it. we then proceeded to valentine. on <br/>&gt; the way to valentine, we saw a solid white blimp in the air that was <br/>&gt; attached to the ground by a very long wire. there was a sign that <br/>&gt; said U.S. Air Force TARS. not sure what it is but if anyone knows<br/>&gt; anything about it, please let me know because i am very curious <br/>&gt; about what it is. we made it to the prada "store" which is actually <br/>&gt; an art exhibit with actual prada pieces from the 2005 collection, <br/>&gt; outside of valentine, but could not find the prada lb. <br/>&gt; throughout the trip from ft stockton to valentine, we did see a lot <br/>&gt; of antelope in an area called antelope vally. we then traveled <br/>&gt;
 through el paso into new mexico and through the white sands missile <br/>&gt; range. after going through alamogordo, we entered the mescalero<br/>&gt; apache reservation. we did see an ancient volcano on the way to <br/>&gt; ruidoso, which was really awesome. we then spent the night at <br/>&gt; ruidoso.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Day 3<br/>&gt; Back on the road about 6 am and went to capitan to pick up the smoky <br/>&gt; the bear lb, but the area was not open yet. this is a really <br/>&gt; beautiful area. we drove through lincoln county where the lincoln <br/>&gt; county wars were held. these wars involved billy the kid. the<br/>&gt; town of lincoln was extremely interesting and also is the sight of <br/>&gt; billy the kid's last escape. we then arrived in roswell and placed <br/>&gt; 3 boxes for my cousin wag time. we went downtown and located the <br/>&gt; ufo museum, didnt go in because we were there too early. from here <br/>&gt; we made it to fort sumner and picked up the billy the kid
 microbox <br/>&gt; at the sight of billy the kid's grave. this was kind of interesting <br/>&gt; because there is a "jail" built over the grave to protect the <br/>&gt; tombstone from being stolen. went back to capitan and saw<br/>&gt; the grave of smokey the bear and found the smokey the bear lb. from <br/>&gt; here went through the valley of fire recreation area which was <br/>&gt; really neat. lots of volcanic rocks. spent the night in deming, nm<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; we made it to phoenix on day 4 and stayed in phoenix for a week but <br/>&gt; only found 3 letterboxes during my stay. we found the sun city <br/>&gt; microbox and the sunny surprise lb and the surprise stadium lb. we <br/>&gt; decided that letterboxing in 110 degree weather was not fun. after <br/>&gt; the first week, we went to tucson and while we were there, picked up <br/>&gt; 8 letterboxes. one of the lbs that we found was at an adopt a <br/>&gt; roadway sign where the roadway had been adopted by the tucson area

letterboxers, which was really neat. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; we had a great trip and all total<br/>&gt; 30 letterboxes<br/>&gt; 6 hitchhikers<br/>&gt; cant wait to go again, but for now glad to be home.<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

Thanks for finding a couple of my <br/>boxes in Midland, and I'm glad you found so many of El Lobo's and
 <br/>Star Seeker's boxes. I think they have wonderful boxes and <br/>beautiful stamps that don't get enough visitors.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "tigger32167" <br/>&lt;tigger32167@<wbr/>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; hey there to all...i just got back from a wonderful trip to <br/>&gt; arizona. thought i would share some of the highlights with <br/>ya'll. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Day 1<br/>&gt; i left here (cherokee county) at 5:18 am on monday, may 28th and <br/>my <br/>&gt; first stop was the dallas area to take a break at my cousin's, wag <br/>&gt; time's, house. after stretching our legs we were back on the <br/>road. <br/>&gt; i then stopped in weatherford and found the badge of friendship<br/>&gt; lb at the greenwood cemetery. this was a really neat cemetery <br/>where <br/>&gt; oliver loving is buried. my next stop was caddo to find the tejas <br/>&gt; caddo cemetery lb. this box had
 a really great stamp and a great <br/>&gt; location. from here i made my way to stanton to pick up the a<br/>&gt; few old soreheads lb at the st joseph's catholic cemetery. i <br/>&gt; loved the stamp, and the cemetery was very interesting. from <br/>&gt; stanton i traveled to midland and got a little confused looking <br/>for <br/>&gt; the homerun that never was lb, but finally got my act together and<br/>&gt; located it. i then looked for the 5 guardian angels lb..found the <br/>&gt; crosses, but unable to locate the memory box. i then attempted <br/>the <br/>&gt; nodding donkeys lb at the oil museum in midland, but a couple of <br/>&gt; muggles decided to look at the oil equipment as well, and they<br/>&gt; werent leaving anytime soon, so decided to attempt that one on my <br/>&gt; way home. i then went to the commemorative air force museum and <br/>&gt; located the pliska aeroplane lb. after leaving there, we went to <br/>&gt; the odessa meteor crater and found the texas celestial
 series<br/>&gt; #3-meteor box. this was a really neat location. my navigator, <br/>jr, <br/>&gt; was not exactly happy with the location, because he realized that <br/>he <br/>&gt; was allergic to a yellow flower that he was sniffing and started <br/>&gt; sneezing. i think he must have sneezed about 20 times before he <br/>got<br/>&gt; it cleared out. jr and i then decided to stop off at monahans <br/>state <br/>&gt; park and we stopped and played in the sand for a little while <br/>before <br/>&gt; we stopped for the day.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Day 2<br/>&gt; We were out of the motel by 5:45 and went to pick up the ro-deo de <br/>&gt; ode-ode cowboy box in pecos before dark. thank goodness for the <br/>&gt; streetlight. from here we went to mentone and picked up the <br/>&gt; everybody's got to be somewhere lb right at day break. this was a <br/>&gt; neat find at a neat little town. it is the county seat of loving <br/>&gt; county even though it only has a population of 15. we then went <br/>to
 <br/>&gt; kermit to look for the it's not easy being green lb, but<br/>&gt; no luck with this one. our next stop was roy orbison's hometown, <br/>&gt; wink, and found the only the lonely lb. we then went to imperial <br/>&gt; and found the horsehead crossing of the rio pecos. i loved this <br/>&gt; location and the story behind it. you could actually picture the<br/>&gt; cowboys taking their cows across the pecos river. next stop was <br/>ft <br/>&gt; stockton and found the displaced donkey and abundant water <br/>&gt; letterboxes. we then went to marfa (no we didnt get to see the <br/>&gt; lights) and found the marfa lb and the giant in marfa lb, which had<br/>&gt; the box of popcorn hh in it. we then proceeded to valentine. on <br/>&gt; the way to valentine, we saw a solid white blimp in the air that <br/>was <br/>&gt; attached to the ground by a very long wire. there was a sign that <br/>&gt; said U.S. Air Force TARS. not sure what it is but if anyone knows<br/>&gt; anything about it,
 please let me know because i am very curious <br/>&gt; about what it is. we made it to the prada "store" which is <br/>actually <br/>&gt; an art exhibit with actual prada pieces from the 2005 collection, <br/>&gt; outside of valentine, but could not find the prada lb. <br/>&gt; throughout the trip from ft stockton to valentine, we did see a <br/>lot <br/>&gt; of antelope in an area called antelope vally. we then traveled <br/>&gt; through el paso into new mexico and through the white sands <br/>missile <br/>&gt; range. after going through alamogordo, we entered the mescalero<br/>&gt; apache reservation. we did see an ancient volcano on the way to <br/>&gt; ruidoso, which was really awesome. we then spent the night at <br/>&gt; ruidoso.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Day 3<br/>&gt; Back on the road about 6 am and went to capitan to pick up the <br/>smoky <br/>&gt; the bear lb, but the area was not open yet. this is a really <br/>&gt; beautiful area. we drove through lincoln county where the lincoln
 <br/>&gt; county wars were held. these wars involved billy the kid. the<br/>&gt; town of lincoln was extremely interesting and also is the sight of <br/>&gt; billy the kid's last escape. we then arrived in roswell and <br/>placed <br/>&gt; 3 boxes for my cousin wag time. we went downtown and located the <br/>&gt; ufo museum, didnt go in because we were there too early. from here <br/>&gt; we made it to fort sumner and picked up the billy the kid microbox <br/>&gt; at the sight of billy the kid's grave. this was kind of <br/>interesting <br/>&gt; because there is a "jail" built over the grave to protect the <br/>&gt; tombstone from being stolen. went back to capitan and saw<br/>&gt; the grave of smokey the bear and found the smokey the bear lb. <br/>from <br/>&gt; here went through the valley of fire recreation area which was <br/>&gt; really neat. lots of volcanic rocks. spent the night in deming, <br/>nm<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; we made it to phoenix on day 4 and stayed in phoenix for a week
 <br/>but <br/>&gt; only found 3 letterboxes during my stay. we found the sun city <br/>&gt; microbox and the sunny surprise lb and the surprise stadium lb. <br/>we <br/>&gt; decided that letterboxing in 110 degree weather was not fun. <br/>after <br/>&gt; the first week, we went to tucson and while we were there, picked <br/>up <br/>&gt; 8 letterboxes. one of the lbs that we found was at an adopt a <br/>&gt; roadway sign where the roadway had been adopted by the tucson area <br/>&gt; letterboxers, which was really neat. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; we had a great trip and all total<br/>&gt; 30 letterboxes<br/>&gt; 6 hitchhikers<br/>&gt; cant wait to go again, but for now glad to be home.<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/><p>
