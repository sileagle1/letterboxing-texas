2 new regional LB groups:  Midwest (including Oklahoma &<br>
Arkansas along with many other Heartland states) and<br>
Southwest (including New Mexico & Arizona).  The reason<br>
I mention this is because those TX Letterboxers that<br>
reside near one of the states in these groups might<br>
benefit by joining.  Maybe Mike in El Paso will find<br>
a nearby Letterboxer in New Mexico who will start planting<br>
a few near him.  Or maybe someone in the Panhandle or<br>
North TX will find a kindred spirit in Oklahoma.  If<br>
nothing else it will be fun to watch these Groups grow<br>
as we have.  <br>
I have joined the Midwest Group since I have several boxes <br>
there and have extended an invitation to them for our Event <br>
since it won't be that far from Oklahoma & Arkansas.  You<br>
never know.<br>
For the links to these Groups (and others), go to Silent<br>
Doug's website of LB Links:<br>

Thanks S.D. for setting these up.  You might be Silent, but<br>
your actions speak louder than words!<br>
