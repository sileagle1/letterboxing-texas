I forgot to mention that if anyone has mentioned in their letterbox <br/>
clues to look for the "Iron Ore Exhibit Sign", it no longer exist.  A <br/>
very large tree (50 foot + and 18 to 24 inches in diameter) fell <br/>
between the posts that held up the sign and smashed it smitherins.  <br/>
The tree fell all on its' own from its' base between 2 and 3 months <br/>
ago according to the park caretaker.  It wasn't the fault of the <br/>
city. :)<br/>

&gt; I was at Jim Hogg Park today (for the 3rd time) to find the last <br/>
few <br/>
&gt; letterboxes that I ran out of time looking for on my 1st 2 visits <br/>
and I <br/>
&gt; found out that the City of Rusk is doing some maintenance of the <br/>
park.  <br/>
&gt; They are temporarily closing the trails to cut down the dead trees <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; the area.  Some of the letterboxes are in the part of the park <br/>
that's <br/>
&gt; being excalvated.  See list below:<br/>

&gt; NOVEMBER HOLIDAY SERIES: JB Kokopelli<br/>
&gt; Take a Hike<br/>
&gt; Mickey Mouse Birthday<br/>
&gt; Veterans Day<br/>
&gt; Thanksgiving<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I retrieved "Take a Hike" and "Mickey Mouse Birthday" from imminent <br/>
&gt; destruction and brought them home with me.  I didn't have the clues <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; this series with me so I was going from memory from when I found <br/>
them a <br/>
&gt; couple weeks ago.  I knew where "Veterans Day" was but I couldn't <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; it and they were cutting trees down all around me so I thought it <br/>
best <br/>
&gt; that I get out of there.<br/>

&gt; If anyone else has boxes in this park. you may want to check on <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; and any one hoping to go look for them should probably wait awhile <br/>
&gt; until the city is done cutting down the dead trees and the boxes <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; been replanted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; JB:  If you contact me we can make arrangements to get "Take a <br/>
Hike" <br/>
&gt; and "Mickey Mouse Birthday" back to you.<br/>

<div>I think everyone else who has boxes there has my cell phone number, so if y'all want me to get yours, call me and let me know. I may not be in signal range, so leave a message if I don't answer.</div>-- <br/>
