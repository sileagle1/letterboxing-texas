I had to laugh to myself after we found this stamp, because we had that <br>
discussion about LSS and LBing.   Well here is mine:<br>
<br>
We go to this park all the time - Duessen Park - we get A&W at <br>
Summerwood and then go to this park - during the week.  And when we go <br>
to see the buffalo we go by shelter 11.  Well we did not read the clues <br>
good - saw shelter 11 in your clues parked there and tried to find your <br>
box for 30 minutes, because I won't give up easy when we can't find one.<br>
My husband is the one that will go get the box, as I stay on the <br>
trails.  Well I had him looking everywhere, reading the clues over, and <br>
over and over.  I forgot to mention he really did not want to go <br>
because he does commercial AC work and is out in the heat ALLDAY!!!! <br>
well I said OK - it is lost.<br>
<br>
We got in the car and driving off I was reading the clues again and <br>
noticed we were surpose to park in a different area then we are used <br>
to, when I pulled into the right area he just rolled his eyes and <br>
reluctently got out.  And guess what it took us about 5 minutes to <br>
find, stamp and get back in the car!!!!  That just made me laugh...<br>
<br>
ANYWAY, that is a nice stamp, great detail, good news that is it still <br>
there with all the traffic this park gets on the weekends.   THANKS   <br>
ANITA<br>
