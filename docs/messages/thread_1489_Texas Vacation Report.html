                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy to the Texans!<br>
<br>
Well, we are now back in Wisconsin and none too happy to find SNOW in <br>
the yard!  In contrast, we really enjoyed the pleasant weather over <br>
the past week while we were in Texas  sunny & warm (almost hot) <br>
every day except this morning.  The rain today caused us to skip two <br>
boxes we hoped to try for, but we can't complain about only one <br>
morning of rain.<br>
<br>
During our 8 days, we managed to do most of the things Silver Eagle <br>
and others suggested  many state parks (Enchanted Rock and Lost <br>
Maples were our favorites, as was Hamilton Pool Preserve), a few <br>
wineries, apple ice cream, some Tex-Mex (Old Spanish Trail in Bandera <br>
was our favorite) and 3 different BBQ places (Smitty's in Lockhart <br>
was our favorite).<br>
<br>
Over the course of 8 days we attempted 84 boxes.  However 17 eluded <br>
us either because we suspect they are missing OR because we were <br>
unable to decipher the clues well enough to find the right location.  <br>
Nonetheless, we were very happy to add 67 new stamps to our logbooks, <br>
plus 2 hitchhikers.  We'll be sending reports to the individual <br>
placers to report on the status of each box (we added a few new <br>
logbooks, and even a new box to replace one that was severely <br>
cracked, and also duct-taped a few stamps that were broken).  We <br>
appreciated the hand-carved stamps.  A highlight of the trip was that <br>
my mom (Tabby Tales) reached her F100 milestone and we reached our <br>
P50 and F1100 milestones.<br>
<br>
During our vacation we placed 2 new boxes for those of you that enjoy <br>
a hike.  I'll post the clues in the next few days.<br>
<br>
Thanks again to everyone that gave us some advice and we will proudly <br>
add the Texas LB patch to our pack!<br>

 I am amazed. Thanks for all the maintenance work too, it is a very<br>
important part of our community that we look after each other's little<br>
treasures.<br>
<br>
Please feel free to stay a part of this list--maybe you'll get back<br>
here sometime!<br>

who is back from a fabulous trip to San Diego, but happy to be home!<br>
