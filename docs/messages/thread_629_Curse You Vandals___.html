Hey All,<br>
The Pikachu Ponderer got a taste of the dark side of humanity <br>
today.  We went to check on his first box he had placed last August-<br>
Green Oaks and the box was opened, the book ripped to pieces with <br>
the pages strewn everywhere and the stamp was gone.  Someone had <br>
filled several pages with profanities.  Luckily I got hold of the <br>
pages first and shielded his tender eyes from them.<br>
Our first letterboxing tradgedy.  :(<br>
I tried to assure him that most people weren't losers like that, but <br>
it's hard to see your offspring experience that kind of <br>
disappointment.<br>
Thank God for the wonderful Texas boxers and all those from other <br>
states who stamped his book and wrote really nice things about his <br>
box.  That really offset the bad part.<br>
I guess it just reminds us to always make sure the box is where no <br>
one but LBers will find it.  It looked like a social trail had <br>
formed to the box and beyond it.  <br>
We won't let it stop us, though.  Letterboxing is still our favorite <br>
hobby!  <br>

We were talking about that box yesterday as a matter of fact - we all got<br>
such a kick out of it, and CactusLicker felt very big-brotherly about a<br>
younger boxer hiding his first box.<br>
It was one of our first boxes to find, so it will always hold a special<br>
memory for us. Please tell Pikachu we're really looking forward to his next<br>
box!<br>

PS  We won't tell the boxing terrier in our household that you used his name<br>
to describe a despicable noxer...;-)<br>

                    <html><body><div>This really stinks!  I am in a phase right now where I'm just ticked off at the world.  Why do people have to behave like that?  Putting myself in the vandal's shoes I ask, what do I get out of it?  Is it really fun to destroy things?  It's not like stealing, where I would make a profit.  It's not a crime of passion, where I'm driven by deep emotion.  I've never understood vandalism.  Is it a territorial thing?</div>

<div>Now I'm worried about Emma's Den.  I need to get over there and check it out.  Probably need to re-hide it, too.</div>
