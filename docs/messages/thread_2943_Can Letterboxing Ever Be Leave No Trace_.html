                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree it is a valid question and begs the more general question in <br/>
my subject line, but let's keep it civil since there is bound to be <br/>
disagreement.  I'll go ahead and stick my neck out with my views.<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit I don't like either chaining a box or letting it wash <br/>
away, but if a box can be fastened down in a non-obvious way, then <br/>
that would be preferable to it becoming litter.  The fact that we are <br/>
placing boxes in the wild already violates leave no trace, so the <br/>
chain could be considered an extension of the box, I guess.  However, <br/>
I think it would be best if a location could be found that is secure <br/>
enough from weather to not require a chain if possible.<br/>
<br/>
After a year or so of letterboxing I really struggled with this whole <br/>
Leave No Trace issue and almost gave it up to persue something called <br/>
Ecoscavenging.  It is an activity related to geocaching and <br/>
letterboxing, but with no physical cache to be found at the <br/>
destination. Participants swap electronic trading cards to reward <br/>
successful ecoscavenge quests, so it gets people out to visit places <br/>
without leaving boxes.  It sounds good in theory, but I found it just <br/>
did not offer the same fun as actually finding something physical, so <br/>
I stuck with letterboxing.  However, I started planting more <br/>
microboxes to reduce my footprint in the wild, and now I try to hang <br/>
them from branches so nothing is disturbed and they are safer from <br/>
flooding.<br/>
<br/>
I'm not saying my solution is correct or that everyone else is wrong, <br/>
it just feels right for me.  Each of us will have to do what they <br/>
feel is right and as long as our intentions are good, I think it is <br/>
the best we can do.  Maybe we can think of letterboxes as our <br/>
footprints in the wild like people refer to their carbon footprint.  <br/>
I have heard people are trying to reduce their carbon footprints by <br/>
donating money to planting trees or other indirect measures instead <br/>
of actually reducing their use of resources.  So, maybe we can reduce <br/>
our letterbox footprints by picking up litter on trails.  I know it <br/>
is still not Leave No Trace, but with all the good things associated <br/>
with letterboxing I think it is worth it.<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
&gt;   After that, I think it's a valid question: which is MORE <br/>
environmentally unsound, the chain anchoring Kirbert's cache or the <br/>
box I placed at Duck Creek, which is now trash someplace far far <br/>
downstream? <br/>

<div>I like your ideas, Silver Eagle. That's why you get to be the noble eagle soaring above, and I'm destined to be the puddle splasher (but not to be confused with pond scum)! My solution has always been to place a nice hefty flat rock on top of my traditional boxes to keep them safe from washing away or dragged away by small animals. I actually carry a few such rocks in my jeep, just in case the place I'd like to hide my box doesn't have an ample supply. That sometimes proves to be ineffective against Beignet Eating Aliens however. Often when I've checked on one of my boxes, the rock has been cast aside, and the box sits vulnerably in the open. It has always been an issue with me when hiding the box, just how far off the trail  can I hide it where it won't be noticed by a casual hiker if it has lost it's covering, and yet not so far that it creates a social trail or damages the environment. I struggle with that one every time I hide a box. But as for the rock covering... I just have to, as Blanche said in a "Streetcar Named Desire", <em>depend upon the kindness of strangers</em> to replace the rock after they've found the box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another good reason for using microboxes is that it would certainly be easier to find a good hiding spot! How many of us have struggled with finding a safe place to hide the Tour Bus. Now that requires some work!</div>

                    <html><body><div>Like Silver Eagle, I reached a point where I struggled with letterboxing vs. LNT.  Since I teach LNT, I felt especially strongly that I should practice it consciously.  Just so we're all on the same page, how about taking a look at the actual LNT principles:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Front Country LNT:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) Plan ahead.</div>
<div>2) Stick to trails.</div>
<div>3) Leave what you find</div>
<div>4) Manage your pets.</div>
<div>5) Respect other visitors</div>
<div>6) Tote your trash</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Frontcountry principles apply to most of what we do - parks, developed trails, and day use.  When I teach these priniciples to kiddos, I have them yell them really loud like a cheer, so if you want, you can yell them now if it would help you remember them!  The other thing I do is teach them the mnemonic: Proper Scouts Leave More Respectable Trails.  Maybe someone can think of something applicable to us for the "S" to stand for.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are going to do deeper hikes, wilderness hiking, and through hiking/overnight hiking, Backcountry principles may apply to you:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Backcountry principles are essentially the same as Frontcountry, except that:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>#2 becomes Travel and camp on durable surfaces</div>
<div>#4 becomes Respect wildlife</div>
<div>and add #7 - Minimize campfire impact</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In my mind, the ones that are sticking points for us are: 1) tote your trash, 2) respect wildlife/respect other visitors, 3) stick to trails/travel on durable surfaces.  In the case of letterboxers with pets and some letterboxing families with rowdy kids, you might also throw in Manage your pets!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is how I finally reconciled letterboxing with LNT: </div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) When I place a box, I commit also to going back and checking it periodically, so that while I am leaving plastic in the woods, it IS tended.  Would you go and tend trash that you leave in the woods?  I wouldn't.  A box only becomes trash when it leaves its hiding place and becomes fodder in the woods, creeks, rivers, and lakes.  I can prevent it from leaving its hiding place by a) not planting it in such a way as to draw the attention of animals, b) placing something heavy like a rock on it so that it can't move by itself, c) finding a hiding spot that isn't subject to accidental discovery.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) I respect other visitors by placing my boxes in such a way that they aren't an eyesore to other non-boxers.  Hopefully they are well-hidden and out of sight.  I respect wildlife by not planting boxes in holes that are likely to be someone's home, by not using materials that could cause harm if some form of wildlife comes into contact with them, by avoiding anything that attracts the attention of wildlife to the box.  This is where the chain thing gives me heartburn - for one thing, depending on the chain, it is possible for animals to entangle themselves in the chain and for another, the chain itself could inhibit growth of plant life.  I'm also not too crazy about boxes that are velcro strapped to trees and such - in a year such as this when we have lots of rain, a tree COULD put on a lot of growth and that strap could cut in where it shouldn't.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) I plant on durable surfaces.  I think it's fine to go a little off-trail to plant, IF the area you are going off-trail is hardy ground.  I also think it's important that as a planter I don't put a box somewhere where there is only one way in and one way out, so that a social trail might be created.  I also think a planter needs to consider whether going off trail might cause a problem in inclement weather.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Many of my boxes that are placed in LNT areas - non-urban areas - highlight something specific about the area, like the unusual presence of the red-cockaded woodpecker or the native habitat of the loblolly pine.  I can reconcile my belief in LNT and my enjoyment of letterboxing because I plant my boxes in observance of LNT principles AND because I heighten other people's appreciation and recognition of the outdoors.  In fact, I think that letterboxers can be good ambassadors for LNT usage of wildlife areas if we are aware and knowledgeable about LNT principles.

&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) I plant on durable surfaces.  I think it's fine to go a little <br/>
off-trail<br/>
&gt; to plant, IF the area you are going off-trail is hardy ground.  I <br/>
also think<br/>
&gt; it's important that as a planter I don't put a box somewhere where <br/>
there is<br/>
&gt; only one way in and one way out, so that a social trail might be <br/>
created.  I<br/>
&gt; also think a planter needs to consider whether going off trail <br/>
might cause a<br/>
&gt; problem in inclement weather.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Many of my boxes that are placed in LNT areas - non-urban areas - <br/>
highlight<br/>
&gt; something specific about the area, like the unusual presence of the<br/>
&gt; red-cockaded woodpecker or the native habitat of the loblolly <br/>
pine.  I can<br/>
&gt; reconcile my belief in LNT and my enjoyment of letterboxing <br/>
because I plant<br/>
&gt; my boxes in observance of LNT principles AND because I heighten <br/>
other<br/>
&gt; people's appreciation and recognition of the outdoors.  In fact, I <br/>
think<br/>
&gt; that letterboxers can be good ambassadors for LNT usage of <br/>
wildlife areas if<br/>
&gt; we are aware and knowledgeable about LNT principles.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Beignet Eating Aliens however. Often when I've checked on one of <br/>
my boxes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rock has been cast aside, and the box sits vulnerably in the <br/>
open. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; has always been an issue with me when hiding the box, just how <br/>
far off the<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail  can I hide it where it won't be noticed by a casual hiker <br/>
if it has<br/>
&gt; &gt; lost it's covering, and yet not so far that it creates a social <br/>
trail or<br/>
&gt; &gt; damages the environment. I struggle with that one every time I <br/>
hide a box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; But as for the rock covering... I just have to, as Blanche said <br/>
in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; "Streetcar Named Desire", *depend upon the kindness of <br/>
strangers* to<br/>
&gt; &gt; replace the rock after they've found the box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Another good reason for using microboxes is that it would <br/>
certainly be<br/>
&gt; &gt; easier to find a good hiding spot! How many of us have struggled <br/>
with<br/>

Leave No<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I agree it is a valid question and begs the more general <br/>
question in<br/>
&gt; &gt; my subject line, but let's keep it civil since there is bound to <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; disagreement. I'll go ahead and stick my neck out with my views.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have to admit I don't like either chaining a box or letting it <br/>
wash<br/>
&gt; &gt; away, but if a box can be fastened down in a non-obvious way, <br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; that would be preferable to it becoming litter. The fact that we <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; placing boxes in the wild already violates leave no trace, so the<br/>
&gt; &gt; chain could be considered an extension of the box, I guess. <br/>
However,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I think it would be best if a location could be found that is <br/>
secure<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough from weather to not require a chain if possible.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After a year or so of letterboxing I really struggled with this <br/>
whole<br/>
&gt; &gt; Leave No Trace issue and almost gave it up to persue something <br/>
called<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ecoscavenging. It is an activity related to geocaching and<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing, but with no physical cache to be found at the<br/>
&gt; &gt; destination. Participants swap electronic trading cards to reward<br/>
&gt; &gt; successful ecoscavenge quests, so it gets people out to visit <br/>
places<br/>
&gt; &gt; without leaving boxes. It sounds good in theory, but I found it <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; did not offer the same fun as actually finding something <br/>
physical, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I stuck with letterboxing. However, I started planting more<br/>
&gt; &gt; microboxes to reduce my footprint in the wild, and now I try to <br/>
hang<br/>
&gt; &gt; them from branches so nothing is disturbed and they are safer <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; flooding.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not saying my solution is correct or that everyone else is <br/>
wrong,<br/>
&gt; &gt; it just feels right for me. Each of us will have to do what they<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel is right and as long as our intentions are good, I think it <br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; the best we can do. Maybe we can think of letterboxes as our<br/>
&gt; &gt; footprints in the wild like people refer to their carbon <br/>
footprint.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have heard people are trying to reduce their carbon footprints <br/>
by<br/>
&gt; &gt; donating money to planting trees or other indirect measures <br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; &gt; of actually reducing their use of resources. So, maybe we can <br/>
reduce<br/>
&gt; &gt; our letterbox footprints by picking up litter on trails. I know <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is still not Leave No Trace, but with all the good things <br/>
associated<br/>
&gt; &gt; with letterboxing I think it is worth it.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Silver Eagle<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; After that, I think it's a valid question: which is MORE<br/>
&gt; &gt; environmentally unsound, the chain anchoring Kirbert's cache or <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box I placed at Duck Creek, which is now trash someplace far far<br/>
&gt; &gt; downstream?<br/>

other thing as planters--try to make sure that finders of our boxes <br/>
do minimal damage to the environment when hunting the box.<br/>
<br/>
This first and foremost means making sure that when having the finder <br/>
leave the trail, our directions are clear.   Make use of available <br/>
landmarks, try to find something that makes that departure point very <br/>
certain (not, is it this oak tree?  Or that one?).  <br/>
<br/>
This could help prevent someone from rooting around, disturbing <br/>
things behind every pine tree in a pine forest.  To me, this is <br/>
particularly important for a micro box (harder to find than a larger <br/>
box) and why boxes should NOT BE BURIED.  Rooting around with a <br/>
shovel is a real no-no in my book. <br/>
<br/>
I am very fond of cryptic clues.  But not when you are at that point <br/>
of departure from the trail, wandering around aimlessly trying to <br/>
guess which tree of so many like-looking trees the placer meant.<br/>

&gt; Like Silver Eagle, I reached a point where I struggled with <br/>
letterboxing vs.<br/>
&gt; LNT.  Since I teach LNT, I felt especially strongly that I should <br/>
practice<br/>
&gt; it consciously.  Just so we're all on the same page, how about <br/>
taking a look<br/>
&gt; at the actual LNT principles:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Front Country LNT:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Plan ahead.<br/>
&gt; 2) Stick to trails.<br/>
&gt; 3) Leave what you find<br/>
&gt; 4) Manage your pets.<br/>
&gt; 5) Respect other visitors<br/>
&gt; 6) Tote your trash<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Frontcountry principles apply to most of what we do - parks, <br/>
developed<br/>
&gt; trails, and day use.  When I teach these priniciples to kiddos, I <br/>
have them<br/>
&gt; yell them really loud like a cheer, so if you want, you can yell <br/>
them now if<br/>
&gt; it would help you remember them!  The other thing I do is teach <br/>
them the<br/>
&gt; mnemonic: Proper Scouts Leave More Respectable Trails.  Maybe <br/>
someone can<br/>
&gt; think of something applicable to us for the "S" to stand for.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you are going to do deeper hikes, wilderness hiking, and through<br/>
&gt; hiking/overnight hiking, Backcountry principles may apply to you:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Backcountry principles are essentially the same as Frontcountry, <br/>
except<br/>
&gt; that:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; #2 becomes Travel and camp on durable surfaces<br/>
&gt; #4 becomes Respect wildlife<br/>
&gt; and add #7 - Minimize campfire impact<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my mind, the ones that are sticking points for us are: 1) tote <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; trash, 2) respect wildlife/respect other visitors, 3) stick to <br/>
trails/travel<br/>
&gt; on durable surfaces.  In the case of letterboxers with pets and some<br/>
&gt; letterboxing families with rowdy kids, you might also throw in <br/>
Manage your<br/>
&gt; pets!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here is how I finally reconciled letterboxing with LNT:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) When I place a box, I commit also to going back and checking it<br/>
&gt; periodically, so that while I am leaving plastic in the woods, it IS<br/>
&gt; tended.  Would you go and tend trash that you leave in the woods?  I<br/>
&gt; wouldn't.  A box only becomes trash when it leaves its hiding place <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; becomes fodder in the woods, creeks, rivers, and lakes.  I can <br/>
prevent it<br/>
&gt; from leaving its hiding place by a) not planting it in such a way <br/>
as to draw<br/>
&gt; the attention of animals, b) placing something heavy like a rock on <br/>
it so<br/>
&gt; that it can't move by itself, c) finding a hiding spot that isn't <br/>
subject to<br/>
&gt; accidental discovery.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2) I respect other visitors by placing my boxes in such a way that <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; aren't an eyesore to other non-boxers.  Hopefully they are well-<br/>
hidden and<br/>
&gt; out of sight.  I respect wildlife by not planting boxes in holes <br/>
that are<br/>
&gt; likely to be someone's home, by not using materials that could <br/>
cause harm if<br/>
&gt; some form of wildlife comes into contact with them, by avoiding <br/>
anything<br/>
&gt; that attracts the attention of wildlife to the box.  This is where <br/>
the chain<br/>
&gt; thing gives me heartburn - for one thing, depending on the chain, <br/>
it is<br/>
&gt; possible for animals to entangle themselves in the chain and for <br/>
another,<br/>
&gt; the chain itself could inhibit growth of plant life.  I'm also not <br/>
too crazy<br/>
&gt; about boxes that are velcro strapped to trees and such - in a year <br/>
such as<br/>
&gt; this when we have lots of rain, a tree COULD put on a lot of growth <br/>
and that<br/>
&gt; strap could cut in where it shouldn't.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3) I plant on durable surfaces.  I think it's fine to go a little <br/>
off-trail<br/>
&gt; to plant, IF the area you are going off-trail is hardy ground.  I <br/>
also think<br/>
&gt; it's important that as a planter I don't put a box somewhere where <br/>

created.  I<br/>
&gt; also think a planter needs to consider whether going off trail <br/>

&gt; problem in inclement weather.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; red-cockaded woodpecker or the native habitat of the loblolly <br/>

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Backcountry principles are essentially the same as Frontcountry, <br/>except<br/>&gt; that:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; #2 becomes Travel and camp on durable surfaces<br/>&gt; #4 becomes Respect wildlife<br/>&gt; and add #7 - Minimize campfire impact
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In my mind, the ones that are sticking points for us are: 1) tote <br/>your<br/>&gt; trash, 2) respect wildlife/respect other visitors, 3) stick to <br/>trails/travel<br/>&gt; on durable surfaces. In the case of letterboxers with pets and 
<br/>some<br/>&gt; letterboxing families with rowdy kids, you might also throw in <br/>Manage your<br/>&gt; pets!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Here is how I finally reconciled letterboxing with LNT:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 1) When I place a box, I commit also to going back and checking it
<br/>&gt; periodically, so that while I am leaving plastic in the woods, it <br/>IS<br/>&gt; tended. Would you go and tend trash that you leave in the woods? <br/>I<br/>&gt; wouldn't. A box only becomes trash when it leaves its hiding 
<br/>place and<br/>&gt; becomes fodder in the woods, creeks, rivers, and lakes. I can <br/>prevent it<br/>&gt; from leaving its hiding place by a) not planting it in such a way <br/>as to draw<br/>&gt; the attention of animals, b) placing something heavy like a rock 
<br/>on it so<br/>&gt; that it can't move by itself, c) finding a hiding spot that isn't <br/>subject to<br/>&gt; accidental discovery.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 2) I respect other visitors by placing my boxes in such a way that 
<br/>they<br/>&gt; aren't an eyesore to other non-boxers. Hopefully they are well-<br/>hidden and<br/>&gt; out of sight. I respect wildlife by not planting boxes in holes <br/>that are<br/>&gt; likely to be someone's home, by not using materials that could 
<br/>cause harm if<br/>&gt; some form of wildlife comes into contact with them, by avoiding <br/>anything<br/>&gt; that attracts the attention of wildlife to the box. This is where <br/>the chain<br/>&gt; thing gives me heartburn - for one thing, depending on the chain, 
<br/>it is<br/>&gt; possible for animals to entangle themselves in the chain and for <br/>another,<br/>&gt; the chain itself could inhibit growth of plant life. I'm also not <br/>too crazy<br/>&gt; about boxes that are velcro strapped to trees and such - in a year 
<br/>such as<br/>&gt; this when we have lots of rain, a tree COULD put on a lot of <br/>growth and that<br/>&gt; strap could cut in where it shouldn't.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 3) I plant on durable surfaces. I think it's fine to go a little 
<br/>off-trail<br/>&gt; to plant, IF the area you are going off-trail is hardy ground. I <br/>also think<br/>&gt; it's important that as a planter I don't put a box somewhere where <br/>there is<br/>&gt; only one way in and one way out, so that a social trail might be 
<br/>created. I<br/>&gt; also think a planter needs to consider whether going off trail <br/>might cause a<br/>&gt; problem in inclement weather.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Many of my boxes that are placed in LNT areas - non-urban areas - 
<br/>highlight<br/>&gt; something specific about the area, like the unusual presence of the<br/>&gt; red-cockaded woodpecker or the native habitat of the loblolly <br/>pine. I can<br/>&gt; reconcile my belief in LNT and my enjoyment of letterboxing 
<br/>because I plant<br/>&gt; my boxes in observance of LNT principles AND because I heighten <br/>other<br/>&gt; people's appreciation and recognition of the outdoors. In fact, I <br/>think<br/>&gt; that letterboxers can be good ambassadors for LNT usage of 
<br/>wildlife areas if<br/>&gt; we are aware and knowledgeable about LNT principles.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/></span></div>

<br/>(but not to<br/>&gt; &gt; be confused with pond scum)! My solution has always been to <br/>place a nice<br/>&gt; &gt; hefty flat rock on top of my traditional boxes to keep them safe <br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; washing away or dragged away by small animals. I actually carry 
<br/>a few such<br/>&gt; &gt; rocks in my jeep, just in case the place I'd like to hide my box <br/>doesn't<br/>&gt; &gt; have an ample supply. That sometimes proves to be ineffective <br/>against<br/>&gt; &gt; Beignet Eating Aliens however. Often when I've checked on one of 
<br/>my boxes,<br/>&gt; &gt; the rock has been cast aside, and the box sits vulnerably in the <br/>open. It<br/>&gt; &gt; has always been an issue with me when hiding the box, just how <br/>far off the<br/>&gt; &gt; trail can I hide it where it won't be noticed by a casual hiker 
<br/>if it has<br/>&gt; &gt; lost it's covering, and yet not so far that it creates a social <br/>trail or<br/>&gt; &gt; damages the environment. I struggle with that one every time I <br/>hide a box.<br/>&gt; &gt; But as for the rock covering... I just have to, as Blanche said

<br/>certainly be<br/>&gt; &gt; easier to find a good hiding spot! How many of us have struggled <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; finding a safe place to hide the Tour Bus. Now that requires <br/>some work!<br/>&gt; &gt; Puddle Splasher

<br/>&gt; &gt; I agree it is a valid question and begs the more general <br/>question in<br/>&gt; &gt; my subject line, but let's keep it civil since there is bound to <br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; disagreement. I'll go ahead and stick my neck out with my views.
<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I have to admit I don't like either chaining a box or letting it <br/>wash<br/>&gt; &gt; away, but if a box can be fastened down in a non-obvious way, <br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt; that would be preferable to it becoming litter. The fact that we 
<br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; placing boxes in the wild already violates leave no trace, so the<br/>&gt; &gt; chain could be considered an extension of the box, I guess. <br/>However,<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it would be best if a location could be found that is 
<br/>secure<br/>&gt; &gt; enough from weather to not require a chain if possible.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; After a year or so of letterboxing I really struggled with this <br/>whole<br/>&gt; &gt; Leave No Trace issue and almost gave it up to persue something 
<br/>called<br/>&gt; &gt; Ecoscavenging. It is an activity related to geocaching and<br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxing, but with no physical cache to be found at the<br/>&gt; &gt; destination. Participants swap electronic trading cards to reward
<br/>&gt; &gt; successful ecoscavenge quests, so it gets people out to visit <br/>places<br/>&gt; &gt; without leaving boxes. It sounds good in theory, but I found it <br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; did not offer the same fun as actually finding something 
<br/>physical, so<br/>&gt; &gt; I stuck with letterboxing. However, I started planting more<br/>&gt; &gt; microboxes to reduce my footprint in the wild, and now I try to <br/>hang<br/>&gt; &gt; them from branches so nothing is disturbed and they are safer 
<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; flooding.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I'm not saying my solution is correct or that everyone else is <br/>wrong,<br/>&gt; &gt; it just feels right for me. Each of us will have to do what they<br/>&gt; &gt; feel is right and as long as our intentions are good, I think it 
<br/>is<br/>&gt; &gt; the best we can do. Maybe we can think of letterboxes as our<br/>&gt; &gt; footprints in the wild like people refer to their carbon <br/>footprint.<br/>&gt; &gt; I have heard people are trying to reduce their carbon footprints 
<br/>by<br/>&gt; &gt; donating money to planting trees or other indirect measures <br/>instead<br/>&gt; &gt; of actually reducing their use of resources. So, maybe we can <br/>reduce<br/>&gt; &gt; our letterbox footprints by picking up litter on trails. I know 
<br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; is still not Leave No Trace, but with all the good things <br/>associated<br/>&gt; &gt; with letterboxing I think it is worth it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Silver Eagle<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; After that, I think it's a valid question: which is MORE
<br/>&gt; &gt; environmentally unsound, the chain anchoring Kirbert's cache or <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; box I placed at Duck Creek, which is now trash someplace far far<br/>&gt; &gt; downstream?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Sheba

&gt; Like Silver Eagle, I reached a point where I struggled with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing vs. LNT.  Since I teach LNT, I felt especially strongly<br/>
&gt; that I should practice it consciously.  Just so we're all on the same<br/>
&gt; page, how about taking a look at the actual LNT principles:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Front Country LNT:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) Plan ahead.<br/>
<br/>
Is this to avoid leaving your dead, rotting corpse in the woods?  :-)<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2) Stick to trails.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I violate that one letterboxing, and will continue to.  Perhaps <br/>
I'm the only one, but I feel it's better to hide a box well away from <br/>
a trail so that it's not accidentally found and scattered than right <br/>
next to a trail where it more accurately can be described as <br/>
"litter".<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3) Leave what you find<br/>
<br/>
I often pick up litter, so I violate that one as well.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 4) Manage your pets.<br/>
<br/>
Don't take my cat on letterboxing expeditions, so I guess I'm OK <br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 5) Respect other visitors<br/>
<br/>
Hah!  I'm doing my best to hide from them!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 6) Tote your trash<br/>
<br/>
That's a definite.  I usually tote some other slob's trash, too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Frontcountry principles apply to most of what we do - parks, developed<br/>
&gt; trails, and day use.<br/>
<br/>
True enough.  However, IMHO it's worth considering *why* such <br/>
principles apply rather than just blindly applying them.  For <br/>
example:  Is leaving a carefully hidden, camoflaged container in the <br/>
woods the same thing as leaving a candy wrapper or a soda bottle in <br/>
the woods?  I would argue it is not -- and I understand that courts <br/>
have agreed with me and found that geocaches and letterboxes are <br/>
*not* litter.<br/>
<br/>
Thinking a bit more about it brings more clarity.  Just exactly what <br/>
is so bad about littering?  In some rare cases you may actually be <br/>
leaving something behind that actually does some damage to the <br/>
environment -- toxic chemicals or some such -- but in the vast <br/>
majority of cases the primary problem is that it's unsightly.  Having <br/>
ugly trash all over the place spoils the ambience for others who <br/>
would like to enjoy the trail.<br/>
<br/>
Does a carefully hidden, camoflaged container spoil the ambience for <br/>
others who would like to enjoy the trail?  You'd better hope not!  <br/>
And hiding it well away from the trail only helps in that regard.  <br/>
You do have to be a bit careful that other letterboxers don't beat a <br/>
visible path to your box, but I accomplish that by planting in areas <br/>
where the terrain is such that footprints wouldn't be particularly <br/>
noticeable.<br/>
<br/>
My letterboxes are nearly always camoflaged.  Aside from helping <br/>
protect them from accidental finding, it also helps avoid the concern <br/>
about litter: being unsightly in the woods.  A white Lock&amp;Lock is <br/>
unsightly if you can see it at all.  A camoflaged Lock&amp;Lock is much  <br/>
less unsightly in the woods even if it happens to be visible.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Here is how I finally reconciled letterboxing with LNT:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) When I place a box, I commit also to going back and checking it<br/>
&gt; periodically, so that while I am leaving plastic in the woods, it IS<br/>
&gt; tended.  Would you go and tend trash that you leave in the woods?  I<br/>
&gt; wouldn't.<br/>
<br/>
True enough, but I don't feel that tending is the distinction between <br/>
a letterbox and litter.  I plant on trips in places I never expect to <br/>
visit again.  I don't consider that littering.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  A box only becomes trash when it leaves its hiding place<br/>
&gt; and becomes fodder in the woods, creeks, rivers, and lakes.<br/>
<br/>
Actually, I think there are two ways a box becomes trash.  One is <br/>
when it leaves its hiding place, as you mention.  The other is when <br/>
the clues are lost or otherwise are NLA.  In the latter case it <br/>
functionally becomes litter right where it sits because it's not <br/>
functionally a letterbox any more, the only way someone can find it <br/>
is by stumbling upon it -- the way you find litter.<br/>
<br/>
Planting a letterbox in a remote location and never visiting it again <br/>
does not meet either description.  As long as it's a working <br/>
letterbox and doesn't get washed away, it's not litter.  If someone <br/>
steals it or throws it away, it's not litter.  If someone picks it up <br/>
and throws it somewhere *else* in the woods, it's litter -- but <br/>
whether you live close by or far away or visit it regularly makes no <br/>
difference there.  Hiding it well and far from the trail might help <br/>
prevent it happening, though.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I can<br/>
&gt; prevent it from leaving its hiding place by a) not planting it in such<br/>
&gt; a way as to draw the attention of animals<br/>
<br/>
How do you hide a box from animals?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 2) I respect other visitors by placing my boxes in such a way that<br/>
&gt; they aren't an eyesore to other non-boxers.  Hopefully they are<br/>
&gt; well-hidden and out of sight.<br/>
<br/>
Exactly!<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I respect wildlife by not planting<br/>
&gt; boxes in holes that are likely to be someone's home<br/>
<br/>
Well, yeah, that's a good idea.  I'm not always sure how to tell when <br/>
it's someone's home, though.  One could argue that *every* nook and <br/>
cranny in the wilderness gets used as shelter at one time or another <br/>
by some critter.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; by not using<br/>
&gt; materials that could cause harm if some form of wildlife comes into<br/>
&gt; contact with them<br/>
<br/>
Good plan.  Can you give some examples?  Offhand, I can't think of <br/>
anything I'd consider using that might harm critters.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; This is where the chain thing gives me heartburn<br/>
&gt; - for one thing, depending on the chain, it is possible for animals to<br/>
&gt; entangle themselves in the chain<br/>
<br/>
Wow, that's a stretch.  It's possible for them to choke to death <br/>
trying to swallow a film canister, too.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; and for another, the chain itself<br/>
&gt; could inhibit growth of plant life.<br/>
<br/>
Not the way I use them, it won't.  If the chain is wrapped around <br/>
something, it's very loose, usually at least twice the size of the <br/>
root or tree.  But more often it's screwed down, usually to something <br/>
already dead but sometimes to the inside of a hollow in a tree.  <br/>
Won't hurt a thing.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; 3) I plant on durable surfaces.  I think it's fine to go a little<br/>
&gt; off-trail to plant, IF the area you are going off-trail is hardy<br/>
&gt; ground.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah, those are the places I look for.  For one thing, I don't want <br/>
the finders to have to bring a machete to hack their way to the box.  <br/>
For another, I don't want the finders hacking their way to the box.  <br/>
It needs to be a place where nobody would normally walk close enough <br/>
to find the box accidentally, but where someone could walk without <br/>
trampling down a lot of vegetation.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  I also think it's important that as a planter I don't put a<br/>
&gt; box somewhere where there is only one way in and one way out, so that<br/>
&gt; a social trail might be created.<br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you can help this with the clues.  If you tell people to go <br/>
X steps up the trail and then turn off, everybody's going to turn off <br/>
at exactly the same spot and wear a path there.  OTOH, if you tell <br/>
them to sight some tree in the distance and go to it, people will <br/>
leave the trail at different places trying to choose the best way to <br/>
get there.  Even if a great many boxers go there, you end up with a <br/>
general trampling all over the area rather than a single path.  The <br/>
general trampling is much less noticeable as being unnatural.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I also think a planter needs to<br/>
&gt; consider whether going off trail might cause a problem in inclement<br/>
&gt; weather.<br/>
<br/>
I presume you mean cause a problem to the environment, since I <br/>
couldn't care less if it causes a problem to the boxer!  That's HIS <br/>
problem!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Good point, though.  As I live in Florida and most of you guys are in <br/>
Texas, we don't have to worry as much about things like snow.  <br/>
Sometimes a plant that works just fine in the summer can be a <br/>
disaster when the undergrowth has died back or the place is soaked <br/>
with snowmelt or rains or whatever.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Many of my boxes that are placed in LNT areas - non-urban areas -<br/>
&gt; highlight something specific about the area, like the unusual presence<br/>
&gt; of the red-cockaded woodpecker or the native habitat of the loblolly<br/>
&gt; pine.  I can reconcile my belief in LNT and my enjoyment of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing because I plant my boxes in observance of LNT principles<br/>
&gt; AND because I heighten other people's appreciation and recognition of<br/>
&gt; the outdoors.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed.  In fact, I think letterboxing heightens other people's <br/>
appreciation and recognition of the outdoors regardless of whether <br/>
the listing mentions anything about the local flora and fauna.  Just <br/>
being outdoors and in the wilderness -- as opposed to playing video <br/>
games -- will foster an appreciation for nature.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;  In fact, I think that letterboxers can be good<br/>
&gt; ambassadors for LNT usage of wildlife areas if we are aware and<br/>
&gt; knowledgeable about LNT principles.<br/>
<br/>
Agreed.<br/>
<br/>
If we could only get the fishermen up to speed.  I plant most of my <br/>
boxes in rural areas, including in Wildlife Management Areas and <br/>
other places where hunters and fishermen are likely to be found.  My <br/>
conclusion is that hunters are actually remarkably good in the <br/>
wilderness.  I find the occasional shotgun shell, but you generally <br/>
don't want to pick those up immediately because they come out of the <br/>
gun hot.  One way or another, the hunter might lose track of them by <br/>
the time he has recovered his quarry.  But there's generally very <br/>
little other litter or lasting effects near where hunters hang out.<br/>
<br/>
Fishermen, on the other hand, are slobs.  You know exactly where <br/>
people sit and fish by the semicircle of refuse one toss away, as <br/>
well as the trail of beer bottles between there and where they park <br/>
their cars.  I'd like to drown some of these nitwits.<br/>

That's a definite. I usually tote some other slob's trash, too.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; Frontcountry principles apply to most of what we do - parks, developed<br/>&gt; trails, and day use.<br/><br/></span>True enough. However, IMHO it's worth considering *why* such 
<br/>principles apply rather than just blindly applying them. For <br/>example: Is leaving a carefully hidden, camoflaged container in the <br/>woods the same thing as leaving a candy wrapper or a soda bottle in <br/>the woods? I would argue it is not -- and I understand that courts 
<br/>have agreed with me and found that geocaches and letterboxes are <br/>*not* litter.<br/><br/>Thinking a bit more about it brings more clarity. Just exactly what <br/>is so bad about littering? In some rare cases you may actually be 
<br/>leaving something behind that actually does some damage to the <br/>environment -- toxic chemicals or some such -- but in the vast <br/>majority of cases the primary problem is that it's unsightly. Having <br/>ugly trash all over the place spoils the ambience for others who 
<br/>would like to enjoy the trail.<br/><br/>Does a carefully hidden, camoflaged container spoil the ambience for <br/>others who would like to enjoy the trail? You'd better hope not! <br/>And hiding it well away from the trail only helps in that regard. 
<br/>You do have to be a bit careful that other letterboxers don't beat a <br/>visible path to your box, but I accomplish that by planting in areas <br/>where the terrain is such that footprints wouldn't be particularly 
<br/>noticeable.<br/><br/>My letterboxes are nearly always camoflaged. Aside from helping <br/>protect them from accidental finding, it also helps avoid the concern <br/>about litter: being unsightly in the woods. A white Lock&amp;Lock is 
<br/>unsightly if you can see it at all. A camoflaged Lock&amp;Lock is much <br/>less unsightly in the woods even if it happens to be visible.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; Here is how I finally reconciled letterboxing with LNT:
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 1) When I place a box, I commit also to going back and checking it<br/>&gt; periodically, so that while I am leaving plastic in the woods, it IS<br/>&gt; tended. Would you go and tend trash that you leave in the woods? I
<br/>&gt; wouldn't.<br/><br/></span>True enough, but I don't feel that tending is the distinction between <br/>a letterbox and litter. I plant on trips in places I never expect to <br/>visit again. I don't consider that littering.
<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; A box only becomes trash when it leaves its hiding place<br/>&gt; and becomes fodder in the woods, creeks, rivers, and lakes.<br/><br/></span>Actually, I think there are two ways a box becomes trash. One is 
<br/>when it leaves its hiding place, as you mention. The other is when <br/>the clues are lost or otherwise are NLA. In the latter case it <br/>functionally becomes litter right where it sits because it's not <br/>functionally a letterbox any more, the only way someone can find it 
<br/>is by stumbling upon it -- the way you find litter.<br/><br/>Planting a letterbox in a remote location and never visiting it again <br/>does not meet either description. As long as it's a working <br/>letterbox and doesn't get washed away, it's not litter. If someone 
<br/>steals it or throws it away, it's not litter. If someone picks it up <br/>and throws it somewhere *else* in the woods, it's litter -- but <br/>whether you live close by or far away or visit it regularly makes no 
<br/>difference there. Hiding it well and far from the trail might help <br/>prevent it happening, though.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; I can<br/>&gt; prevent it from leaving its hiding place by a) not planting it in such<br/>
&gt; a way as to draw the attention of animals<br/><br/></span>How do you hide a box from animals?<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; 2) I respect other visitors by placing my boxes in such a way that<br/>&gt; they aren't an eyesore to other non-boxers. Hopefully they are
<br/>&gt; well-hidden and out of sight.<br/><br/></span>Exactly!<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; I respect wildlife by not planting<br/>&gt; boxes in holes that are likely to be someone's home<br/><br/></span>Well, yeah, that's a good idea. I'm not always sure how to tell when 
<br/>it's someone's home, though. One could argue that *every* nook and <br/>cranny in the wilderness gets used as shelter at one time or another <br/>by some critter.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; by not using<br/>&gt; materials that could cause harm if some form of wildlife comes into
<br/>&gt; contact with them<br/><br/></span>Good plan. Can you give some examples? Offhand, I can't think of <br/>anything I'd consider using that might harm critters.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; This is where the chain thing gives me heartburn
<br/>&gt; - for one thing, depending on the chain, it is possible for animals to<br/>&gt; entangle themselves in the chain<br/><br/></span>Wow, that's a stretch. It's possible for them to choke to death <br/>trying to swallow a film canister, too.
<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; and for another, the chain itself<br/>&gt; could inhibit growth of plant life.<br/><br/></span>Not the way I use them, it won't. If the chain is wrapped around <br/>something, it's very loose, usually at least twice the size of the 
<br/>root or tree. But more often it's screwed down, usually to something <br/>already dead but sometimes to the inside of a hollow in a tree. <br/>Won't hurt a thing.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; 3) I plant on durable surfaces. I think it's fine to go a little
<br/>&gt; off-trail to plant, IF the area you are going off-trail is hardy<br/>&gt; ground.<br/><br/></span>Yeah, those are the places I look for. For one thing, I don't want <br/>the finders to have to bring a machete to hack their way to the box. 
<br/>For another, I don't want the finders hacking their way to the box. <br/>It needs to be a place where nobody would normally walk close enough <br/>to find the box accidentally, but where someone could walk without <br/>
trampling down a lot of vegetation.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; I also think it's important that as a planter I don't put a<br/>&gt; box somewhere where there is only one way in and one way out, so that<br/>&gt; a social trail might be created.
<br/><br/></span>Sometimes you can help this with the clues. If you tell people to go <br/>X steps up the trail and then turn off, everybody's going to turn off <br/>at exactly the same spot and wear a path there. OTOH, if you tell 
<br/>them to sight some tree in the distance and go to it, people will <br/>leave the trail at different places trying to choose the best way to <br/>get there. Even if a great many boxers go there, you end up with a <br/>general trampling all over the area rather than a single path. The 
<br/>general trampling is much less noticeable as being unnatural.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; I also think a planter needs to<br/>&gt; consider whether going off trail might cause a problem in inclement<br/>&gt; weather.<br/>
<br/></span>I presume you mean cause a problem to the environment, since I <br/>couldn't care less if it causes a problem to the boxer! That's HIS <br/>problem! :-)<br/><br/>Good point, though. As I live in Florida and most of you guys are in 
<br/>Texas, we don't have to worry as much about things like snow. <br/>Sometimes a plant that works just fine in the summer can be a <br/>disaster when the undergrowth has died back or the place is soaked <br/>with snowmelt or rains or whatever.
<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; Many of my boxes that are placed in LNT areas - non-urban areas -<br/>&gt; highlight something specific about the area, like the unusual presence<br/>&gt; of the red-cockaded woodpecker or the native habitat of the loblolly
<br/>&gt; pine. I can reconcile my belief in LNT and my enjoyment of<br/>&gt; letterboxing because I plant my boxes in observance of LNT principles<br/>&gt; AND because I heighten other people's appreciation and recognition of
<br/>&gt; the outdoors.<br/><br/></span>Agreed. In fact, I think letterboxing heightens other people's <br/>appreciation and recognition of the outdoors regardless of whether <br/>the listing mentions anything about the local flora and fauna. Just 
<br/>being outdoors and in the wilderness -- as opposed to playing video <br/>games -- will foster an appreciation for nature.<span class="q"><br/><br/>&gt; In fact, I think that letterboxers can be good<br/>&gt; ambassadors for LNT usage of wildlife areas if we are aware and
<br/>&gt; knowledgeable about LNT principles.<br/><br/></span>Agreed.<br/><br/>If we could only get the fishermen up to speed. I plant most of my <br/>boxes in rural areas, including in Wildlife Management Areas and <br/>other places where hunters and fishermen are likely to be found. My 
<br/>conclusion is that hunters are actually remarkably good in the <br/>wilderness. I find the occasional shotgun shell, but you generally <br/>don't want to pick those up immediately because they come out of the <br/>gun hot. One way or another, the hunter might lose track of them by 
<br/>the time he has recovered his quarry. But there's generally very <br/>little other litter or lasting effects near where hunters hang out.<br/><br/>Fishermen, on the other hand, are slobs. You know exactly where <br/>people sit and fish by the semicircle of refuse one toss away, as 
<br/>well as the trail of beer bottles between there and where they park <br/>their cars. I'd like to drown some of these nitwits.<br/><br/>-- Kirbert<br/><br/></p></div><span class="q"><span width="1">
