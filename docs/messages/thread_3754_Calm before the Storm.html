                    <html><body><div dir="ltr"><div>I always equate these lulls that happen occasionally to the seven minute lull you see at parties or gatherings or anywhere there are a lot of people.  All of a sudden a room goes quiet or at least gets quieter as though everyone took a collective breath.  If you time it, it happens every seven minutes or so.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - this is probably more likely due to lots of us trying to get our kids back in school and into a routine, and along comes a big ol' hurricane to disrupt what little routine is going - the quiet before the storm.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For myself, I've been frantically working toward our big recruiting night in Cub Scouts slated for Thursday, and just as I felt like I was on the downhill slide of that and had just enough time to get everything done I needed to get done, our local Red Cross shelter got activated and I've got to commit some time there.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The traffic in this area is unbelievable!  She Who Volunteers Me For Everything works in Tyler and said it was nearly gridlocked up there and evacuation buses were coming through every 20 minutes.  They were considering closing one lane of the main thoroughfare through Tyler to allow the buses easy passage  When I ventured down the main street of my town today, all the stores were packed and I could hardly get around like I usually can on a Saturday afternoon.  It brought to mind the evacuation during Rita, except that there isn't the sense of panic that came with that evacuation.  I'll never forget leaving home and going up to the main road, only to discover bumper to bumper traffic - in the northbound lane only - in Podunkville, TX.  I don't think I recall such a massive hurricane evacuation two days before the expected landfall though!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to be working in the shelter starting tonight, so if I don't make it back to the list before the hurricane hits, my family's thoughts and prayers are with y'all on the coast - stay safe, and if you think you will be heading up into East Texas if you evacuate, email me offlist and I'll send you my cell phone number.  Aside from the shelter, I know of a few places you could stay if needed...</div>

  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've been busy packing to deploy for Hurricane Gustav. I 
  belong to <br/>a <br/>&gt; Disaster Medical Assistance Team (DMAT)out of 
  California and we <br/>were <br/>&gt; put on alert yesterday. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  I hope all of you stay safe.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mothers Love<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
