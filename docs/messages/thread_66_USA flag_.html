I'm sorry I missed it, but....<br/>
<br/>
I spent Sunday in Austin at the Zilker Park Kite Festival.  While I <br/>
was there, we (myself, my wife and my sister) swung by the <br/>
playground in search of Silver Eagle's "USA Flag."  I am pleased to <br/>
say that we found it safe and sound and picked up a hitch-hiker that <br/>
was hangin' out inside. I am doubly pleased that there were no <br/>
snakes this time.  My sister was impressed and I think she'll be <br/>
making a stamp pretty soon.  <br/>
<br/>
I'll be hiding a couple of boxes in Victoria this week, so keep your <br/>
eyes peeled.<br/>
