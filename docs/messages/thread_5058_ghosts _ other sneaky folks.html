&gt; &gt; &gt; There are over 200 confederate veterans buried in this cemetery, so as long as the ghost is a nice southern lady, she's harmless. If she's one of those connetty-cut yankee women, though, you better watch out!<br/>

&gt; This is why I tend to ignore "attempts". I got this message today from a letterboxer who has found 3 letterboxes. The letterbox is "Old Leathercoat", the one that Wry Me was hunting when the Maine ghost lady accosted her:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "I'm so disappointed that this was just found on 8/11 and now is missing! It is not in the tree listed in the description, nor is it in any surrounding cedar trees (thinking perhaps someone got turned around before they returned it). The cedars have red tree maintenance tags on them, are those new? Could the tree people have removed it? However, we thoroughly enjoyed our hunt, and I learned things I never knew about McKinney history, so thank you!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know that Wry Me found the box and I know she left it better than she found it, so what do you think is going on? Is the ghost and the boxer one and the same?<br/>
