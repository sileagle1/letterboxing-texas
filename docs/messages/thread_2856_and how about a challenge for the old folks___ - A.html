                    <div class="plaintext-content">For me, I wish I had known how to hide boxes better so they would <br/>
last longer.  When I first started letterboxing there weren't any <br/>
boxes nearby to find, so I had no guide as to what made a good hiding <br/>
place.  Common sense was all I had, but sometimes that is too <br/>
limiting.  I used to think if I hid a box and covered it well, nobody <br/>
would accidentally find it.  What I found out was, the box rarely <br/>
would remain covered as well as I originally placed it, due to <br/>
animals, weather or careless boxers, so I started hiding them in <br/>
places that would keep it hidden even without much cover.  For <br/>
example, if you want to hide a box by a tree, make sure to put it on <br/>
the back side away from the trail.  Ideally, you should find several <br/>
boxes before placing one, since experience is the best teacher.<br/>

you happen<br/>
&gt; to be both...):<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about sharing this with the group:  What is the one single most<br/>
&gt; important piece of advice or information you wish you had had when <br/>
you first<br/>
&gt; got started letterboxing?  (YES!  It can be only one piece of <br/>
advice in the<br/>
&gt; first round, but if you find you still have more advice after <br/>
everyone has<br/>
&gt; taken a shot, you can chime in again).<br/>

<br/>
Camo paint helps.<br/>
<br/>
SOP in letterboxing is "always rehide better than you found it."  <br/>
There's a good reason for that; hides nearly always deteriorate for <br/>
one reason or another, the stuff you put over the box falls away, the <br/>
camo paint starts to peel, the many letterboxers visiting the hide <br/>
beat a path to it, etc., etc.   Asking everyone to rehide better than <br/>
they found it is the only way you can hope that the hide remains <br/>
nearly as good as it started out.<br/>
