last longer.  When I first started letterboxing there weren't any <br>
boxes nearby to find, so I had no guide as to what made a good hiding <br>
place.  Common sense was all I had, but sometimes that is too <br>
limiting.  I used to think if I hid a box and covered it well, nobody <br>
would accidentally find it.  What I found out was, the box rarely <br>
would remain covered as well as I originally placed it, due to <br>
animals, weather or careless boxers, so I started hiding them in <br>
places that would keep it hidden even without much cover.  For <br>
example, if you want to hide a box by a tree, make sure to put it on <br>
the back side away from the trail.  Ideally, you should find several <br>
boxes before placing one, since experience is the best teacher.<br>

Camo paint helps.<br>
<br>
SOP in letterboxing is "always rehide better than you found it."  <br>
There's a good reason for that; hides nearly always deteriorate for <br>
one reason or another, the stuff you put over the box falls away, the <br>
camo paint starts to peel, the many letterboxers visiting the hide <br>
beat a path to it, etc., etc.   Asking everyone to rehide better than <br>
they found it is the only way you can hope that the hide remains <br>
nearly as good as it started out.<br>
