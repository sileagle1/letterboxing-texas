                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back from a day at the Cleburne State Park. We had a lot <br/>
of fun. It was a bit overcast, so it was beee-you-tee-full! <br/>
<br/>
I would post the pictures, but my dog ate the cord that goes from the <br/>
camera to the computer. Bad dog!<br/>
<br/>
I do believe we have to go back to the cemetery in Cleburne though. <br/>
Barefoot Lucy warned me, but I'm a little slow catching on.<br/>
<br/>
Delivery Girl made us work for our stamps, but we perservered and <br/>
found what we were looking for.<br/>
<br/>
I'm ready to start planning tomorrow, but I don't know if my family <br/>
can keep up with me.<br/>
<br/>
If y'all want to have a gathering in Cleburne State Park, I'm ready <br/>
and willing. I didn't know Texas had such beautiful parks like that. <br/>
Without Letterboxing, I still wouldn't know. And, I would've wasted <br/>
this day at the apartment pool or worse, in front of the TV.<br/>
<br/>
Enjoy the rest of the weekend everyone, I'm off again,<br/>

<div>Have you been down to Cedar Hill State Park yet (just south of Dallas off I-20 between Grand Prairie and Dallas). It's a beautiful park also - well worth exploring! Silver Eagle and Baby Bear  have boxes (Texas Star and Campground Bandit) hidden down there. Viewfinder and I have several boxes hidden at Cedar Ridge Nature Preserve not too far from the state park, and the Cummins Clan have Duncanville Dragonfly in a park in the area also! Just another fun day of letterboxing adventures!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know what you mean by having to make a return trip to the cemetery in Cleburne. Viewfinder and I realized we have to go back also...... after we got home!</div>

<div>SJZ and I went last Thanksgiving on a boxing mission to the Dallas area.  We camped one night there in Cedar Hill and were stunned by the beauty when we woke up the next morning.  Unfortunately, we found the two boxes there and hit the trail hard.  Would've liked to have stayed a little longer!
