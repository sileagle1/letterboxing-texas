                    <div class="plaintext-content">My water lilies box in San Angelo went missing after a few years and I recently replaced it - made a new and improved stamp with a different image, gave the box a new name, but hid it in the same spot since I still thought it was the best hiding spot in the park. I debated making it a "new" box too but decided to since it had a new image. I think normally, I just recarve the old image and replace the original box. But in your case, since someone who had the old image might want the new one as well, I'd probably rename it and make a new box.<br/>

<div>You could NEVER be rude! I would have responded to your prior post quicker, but I couldn't think of a clever come-back... still working on it! It'll be really funny when I come up with it. But the news about you planting a new box in Collin County in the future is very exciting. I've visited your Great Grandfathers' grave outside Farmersville. You know, just to help you make your plans for a future visit to the area, there are two of the most wonderful, productive pecan trees in that cemetery where your great grandfather is buried. While Viewfinder paid her respects to his grave, I gather two large bags of pecans a couple of autumns ago. You might want to come back during pecan season.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now that I'm officially retired from the dance studio, I've been planning and plotting some new letterboxes for the McKinney area, so hopefully I'll get some planted before your next trip this way.</div>

You'll have to make me a pecan pie!  At this time, we are shooting for late August to make a trip up that way, then on to Alabama to visit relatives.  We'll definitely be looking for your boxes.  I also have a new governor box ready to place that needs to go in Terrell, but I don't know anything about the town.  Do you think there's any good place for a box there?  The governor is buried in Austin, but the cemetery is named Oakwood, so I would prefer Terrell if possible, since that's where he lived.<br/>

But the news about you planting a new box in Collin County in the future is very exciting. I've visited your Great Grandfathers' grave outside Farmersville. You know, just to help you make your plans for a future visit to the area, there are two of the most wonderful, productive pecan trees in that cemetery where your great grandfather is buried. While Viewfinder paid her respects to his grave, I gather two large bags of pecans a couple of autumns ago. You might want to come back during pecan season.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now that I'm officially retired from the dance studio, I've been planning and plotting some new letterboxes for the McKinney area, so hopefully I'll get some planted before your next trip this way.<br/>

&gt; I meant that to sound funny, but it just sounds rude, sorry. I am actually planning a Collin McKinney letterbox. My great great grandfather lived in Collin County in the latter half of the 19th century, so he was a contemporary of Mr. McKinney, maybe even an aquaintence.<br/>

&gt; &gt; That's an idea! So, when did Sam Houston live in McKinney? Too bad Collin McKinney was never elected governor.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I would hide it in McKinney, Tx and call it a new box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the weekend, I received an "attempt" on my Texas Governor box in Huntsville called Raven, so Monday I went over to check on it and it was indeed missing after 4 1/2 years in the same spot. I try to keep the governors going, so I have carved a new stamp and will replace the box this week. I didn't look up the old image before carving the stamp, but when I finished the new stamp, I compared the two and found that my carving skills have improved considerably over that time. This brings up a question: Since many, if not most, active letterboxers have already found this box and probably won't go back just to stamp the new image, should I rename the box "Raven 2" and re-list it as a new box? If I do that, must I hide it in a different place? I have only renamed one of my replaced governor boxes, but that was because I moved it about 150 miles in the process. I'd like your opinion. What would you do?<br/>

<div>Those two pecan trees are so large, it's possible he planted them. We have some trees around McKinney that are a couple hundred years old or more. Have you read the book, "Empire of the Summer Moon"? Viewfinder recommended it to me when we were down at Ft Parker, so I read it and it's wonderful. It gives me a great respect for anyone brave enough to settle in Texas during the mid 1800's. </div>
<div>Recently, I've only stopped in Terrell on my way to Canton, but I used to have a friend who lived there and it was a nice little town. I think it would be a wonderful place for one of your series!</div>

<p>The land on which the cemetery and church are located was once my gggrandfather's farm and he established the church in his home in 1853. You'll have to make me a pecan pie! At this time, we are shooting for late August to make a trip up that way, then on to Alabama to visit relatives. We'll definitely be looking for your boxes. I also have a new governor box ready to place that needs to go in Terrell, but I don't know anything about the town. Do you think there's any good place for a box there? The governor is buried in Austin, but the cemetery is named Oakwood, so I would prefer Terrell if possible, since that's where he lived.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Maribeth Jagger" &lt;cjagger405@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You could NEVER be rude!
