                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I stand in the park and look around:  what is slightly out of <br/>
the way? What doesn't get mowed?  What area won't children be <br/>
climbing around?  Try to imagine it with a birthday party of 30 kids <br/>
or a busload of Japanese tourists snapping photos and think, what <br/>
might survive that onslaught?<br/>
<br/>
So, for that reason, ours are often on the perimeter of parks, <br/>
between a tree and a fence, for instance.  Every boxer sort of has <br/>
their favorite ways to hide--I often look for a gap between the tree <br/>
roots.  Others use flowerbeds and this can work, but not if the <br/>
place is regularly landscaped and/or mulched.  I can never find <br/>
boxes once they get buried in mulch, and have reported a couple <br/>
missing that weren't actually.  Crepe myrtles are favorites, because <br/>
they provide a natural cup for the microbox, but sometimes they are <br/>
agressively trimmed--depends on the park.  <br/>
<br/>
That said, we have a couple that are smack dab in the middle of a <br/>
park, just with a little nook that we thought might work.  And, we <br/>
have the record of probably picking the worst possible letterbox <br/>
location--inside a plant in a little garden near Buffalo Bayou.  The <br/>
letterbox didn't last a day and I am not sure how in the world I <br/>
missed the liquor bottles and drug paraphenalia when we placed the <br/>
box.  I still feel like I owe another apology to the two <br/>
letterboxers who tried to find it--it was a yucky spot to say the <br/>
least.  Oh well, you learn as you go. . .<br/>
<br/>
All questions are welcome, don't worry about it!  I would suggest <br/>
trying to find a few more before you plant one; experience does <br/>
help.  Then, everywhere you go, you'll see great hiding spots!<br/>

&gt; So, let me ask those of you that have placed boxes in urban <br/>
&gt; areas...how do you hide them so that non-boxers can't see them.  I <br/>
&gt; found a lone tree in a public place, but my sister says it won't <br/>
last <br/>
&gt; because of the men that mow the lawn. Sorry if this is a silly <br/>
&gt; question, but remember I have only found one box, so cut me some <br/>
&gt; slack.  please.  ;-)<br/>
