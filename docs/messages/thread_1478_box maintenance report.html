too busy, so have been trying to do some much-needed box maintenance.<br>
<br>
I replaced Orange you Glad? this morning.  This is the original stamp <br>
& log book--the container had just gotten gnawed.<br>
<br>
Penguin is carved and ready to be replaced.  Hopefully the kids and I <br>
can do that after school.  This is a new image, but will use the same <br>
hiding spot, at least for one more go-around.<br>
<br>
The park where Pop the Top is is still being refurbished.  They were <br>
laying sod today.  Hopefully, will be able to get this one back out in <br>
a few weeks (It'll be a new stamp image, new hiding spot).<br>
<br>
And, a few weeks ago, they tore down the Temporary Inversion art <br>
installation, so that one I'll pick up this afternoon when I go to <br>
Texas Art for supplies. <br>
<br>
Finally, I do have some new ones to hide--including one that I have <br>
been carrying around for 10 months--so hopefully there may be some new <br>
Gramatrick boxes to find in the near future.<br>
<br>
My new stamps are in the Orange PZCut.  I miss the old White version!  <br>
I was so used to the technique for carving it that it'll take me a <br>
while to get used to this orange stuff.  <br>
