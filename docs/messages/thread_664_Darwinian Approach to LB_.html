Ok, after finding a third box of ours either missing or vandalized <br/>
in the last month today I have decided to become philosophical and <br/>
realize that Darwin applies to letterboxes as well as living <br/>
species!  The Sunny Day Mystery Box was discovered vandalized today <br/>
(no offense to the Celtic Lions four footed Vandal!).  Green Oaks <br/>
was vandalized two weeks ago and Maneki Neko was missing 4 weeks <br/>
ago!  AAAAARGH!  <br/>
I guess "Survival of the Best Concealed" should have been a chapter <br/>
in The Origin of The Species or whatever Chuck's book was officially <br/>
titled!<br/>
I am on a giant LB learning curve when it comes to making sure my <br/>
boxes are not obvious to Noxers.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, I am thrilled that there are so many new Boxers in <br/>
the Metroplex area!  Please feel free to Plant At Will!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun everyone at Brazos Bend!  We will not be able to attend so <br/>
eat a beignet and toast the Samurai Stampers with an Irish Coffee!<br/>
