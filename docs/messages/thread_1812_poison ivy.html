                    <div class="plaintext-content">For 38 years I never got poison ivy.  As kids, we'd go to summer camp<br>
in the Ozarks every year and my sister would get these horrific cases<br>
(one year she had a combination of poison ivy, heat rash, & sunburn<br>
that made her look like a gigantic bloated raspberry when we got off<br>
the bus; you should have seen my mother's face!).  I'd never get<br>
anything and assumed I was immune.  I never worried about it and it<br>
never crossed my mind.<br>
<br>
Then, I started letterboxing.  One day, I found this odd rash on my<br>
hand.  I had no idea what it was.  Turned out to be poison ivy.  Now I<br>
have to be super careful and avoid it at all costs.  It means that<br>
there are times of the year I have to not go after certain boxes, drat<br>
it (there's one of Baby Bears that is tantalizingly out of reach for<br>
me).  So far, I've had fairly mild cases (localized, itchy, but not<br>
too yucky, no need for a steroid pack), but I know with each exposure<br>
the reaction just gets worse.  <br>
<br>
Along the bayou across from my house, it has already sprouted vines<br>
4-5 feet high.  That is really advanced for April.  I am assuming our<br>
mild winter didn't beat the stuff back enough, but who knows!<br>
<br>
Sometimes I get emails from finders complaining about poison ivy near<br>
my boxes.  It's finder-beware of course, but you can rest assured that<br>
when I planted it, the area was PI-free.  That's one<br>
letterboxing-hazard I do my best to avoid.<br>

<div>My doctor also told me that it can be airborne if someone is burning a pile of PI, and also your dog can bring it in on his coat and share it with you! She (my doctor) had a terrible case of it on her arms that she got from her retreiver. My PI reaction has definitely gotten worse with each exposure and I think now that if I look at it, I will get a rash! My present case is almost three weeks old now, so it is on it's final hooray, but is still itching.</div>
