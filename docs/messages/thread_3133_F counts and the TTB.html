                    <html><body><div>I think when TeamKing set the original up on AQ, she entered each of the stamps individually, so that it wound up that every stamp wound up being a find.  When she set up the second one, she set it up as only one box.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I agree with you that I don't want to count every stamp as a find when I only made the effort to find it once.  Once that is, as long as you don't count the once when I managed to convince my LSS Fearless Fox to go out and try to get it because I had to go to work so he took Lightning and recruited his bro-in-law and our nephew and drove all the way to Martin Creek only to be robbed by a certain - ahem - "unnamed" letterboxer who left her house in the middle of the night to come venture into my neck of the woods to steal the bus right out from under Fearless Fox's et al's noses.  Ya know, I'M find with that, I really am, but Fearless Fox?  He's another story.  But I digress...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Yeah, I think it oughta be counted only once.  One effort - one find.  As far as I'm concerned though, the only count that matters is the one in my book, so I have them all logged as finds on AQ so that I can quickly know which ones I haven't stamped in yet, in the event the TTB1 ever resurfaces.  And I have hope for it, just as I have hope for Steve Fossett.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But my personal opinion on counting finds is that you should only count as finds the ones that you really put the effort into.  HH's, Bonus Boxes, Cooties, passengers on buses, those are pleasant little niceties, surprises that make letterboxing that much more fun, but they aren't really finds because I didn't work for them - they came to me.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But being a good accountant, I understand that different people can count the same things and come up with different totals.  And that's why the IRS continues to exist...</div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I never really worry about adding up my finds.  Most of our boxes are <br>
registered as finds on AQ, but that's more for my boys than for me.  <br>
They like to know when they are approaching milestones.  There are <br>
still a lot of boxes we've found missing from our on-line logbook, <br>
but it's good enough.  Unlike Lucy, I am NOT an accountant, and <br>
reaonable proximity is good enough in my book.<br>
<br>
So if I were counting, I would count the TTB 1 as one find (and I <br>
think that's how the TTB2 is set up--somewhere else TeamKing <br>
acknowledged that's how she should have set up TTB1, but she didn't <br>
want to change it at that date).  On AQ, that means I only registered <br>
one of the stamps as a find.  But, I don't get my knickers in a twist <br>
if someone else does it differently.  <br>
<br>
The traditional way to count a find is that you put your image in the <br>
box's log.  There are some people who won't count a box in a series <br>
that doesn't have its own log.  Others are less stringent.<br>
<br>
I count a bonus box where I've followed clues to the bonus box.  To <br>
me that's a second find.  <br>
<br>
On Silent Doug's page, he says to count HHs in your F count, but I <br>
don't.  Like Lucy, that doesn't seem like you did anything to find <br>
the box.  <br>
<br>
I think find a system that you're comfortable with and use that.  <br>
There's probably no one right answer.<br>

<body style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">
<div>
<div><font size="2">I haven't joined this discussion because I really don't have a sense of how people need to do their counts. That's probably because I'm obviously kind of sloppy when it comes to recording my finds. I rarely record a HH as a find, although I definitely email the owner, and I've never recorded a cootie. I think I probably did record each stamp on the TT1 as a find since that's how it was set up on AQ. I use the counts primarily to mark the boxes I've already located. Although I'm a Premium Member of AQ, and have used the function of recording finds that are not boxes listed on AQ, I find that there are many that I have not recorded. My thinking is that my list is basically there for me, and it probably doesn't matter too much to anyone else how many or which finds I have recorded. I was excited when I passed a big milestone (500), but I use my actual count from my logbook instead of LBNA or AQ for that. Some people who list boxes on AQ have used the option of making some of their boxes available only to boxers who have a minimum number of finds, so it is helpful to list my finds on AQ for that reason.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Having said that, I consider myself to be a "traditionalist" when it comes to the "code of conduct" of letterboxing. I hope every new member who becomes interested in letterboxing will check out these two sites, before ever searching for or placing their first box. <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/">http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/rules/</a> and <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html">http://www.letterboxing.org/faq/faq.html</a></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Of course there are gray areas when it comes to certain questions, such as how closely is appropriate to place your box to an existing box (ie: is it really necessary to get permission from someone who has placed a box on the Appalachian Trail if you'd also like to place on there). Common sense is difficult to regulate, so I guess the old "Golden Rule" of treating others (and their boxes) as you would like them to treat you, is a good guide.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I'd just like to say that I really admire Stargazer for asking these questions, because it is a good reminder to each of us that we need to be respectful of each others boxes as well as locations. We're really lucky in Texas right now to have so many boxes and really nice folks participating! My 3 cents worth.</font></div>

I think this is similar.  It's a nicety, I personally wouldn't count <br>

It's probably harder if you are a dot every i, cross every t, type <br>

Anything else is too much work.  But some people are happier when <br>
everything is orderly and accounted for.  They probably have never <br>
carved a stamp too big for its intended container either (measure <br>
twice, carve once)!<br>

This should be a fun hobby, a way to relieve stress not add to it. <br>

Hi, Cancan,<br>
In the past, the only one who actually gets credit for a plant for the <br>
Texas Tour Bus is the box owner (Team King). I would suggest you take <br>
one of the extra stamps you carved for the Tour Bus and make it a <br>
separate box with a logbook and plant it, complete with clues and a <br>
different name. That way, you will get credit for the plant as well as <br>
the benefit of others getting to find your box whenever they are boxing <br>
in your area. I've always been amazed by the wonderful stamps in the <br>
Tour Bus; I haven't had the pleasure of finding the TTB2 as yet, but I <br>
anticipate finding it in the future full of equally wonderful stamps!<br>

<div>Cancan's question seems to take us back to this:  </div>
<div>Ultimately, it's up to each letterboxer to determine how they do 
their own FPX count, even though we have those guidelines.  Do you 
count each stamp as a find? The box as a whole as a find?  What about HH's 
in the box- count as a find?  Stamps you add to the box - a plant?  
What if you find it more than once - another find?  What if you and another 
stamp in the TTB the second time you find it - another plant?  And finally, 
since letterboxing is a game without rules, only etiquette, and it's not a 
competitive sport, does it all really matter except to the individual 
letterboxer?  Unusual boxes like the TTB just make it more 
interesting!  </div>
