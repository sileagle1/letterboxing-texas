<div>I'm local-ish for Ft Worth, in the county, anyway.  Quite of few of 
the DFW-area LBs are mine, but <font face="Perpetua">we've</font> also had a boom 
of new letterboxes in the past year planting some good boxes everywhere, so it's 
almost an embarrasment of riches around here now.  More to enjoy, more to 
explore.   We had a DFW Metroboxers mini-gathering in January on the 
north shore of Lake Grapevine (which is actually in Flower Mound in Denton Co.): 
the Many-Meese-Mini-Meet, and that brought about a plethora of Moose-appearances 
all around that area, most of which are still in place.  Are you making a 
return visit anytime soon? </div>

My DD lives very near there and goes out and gets drive thru breakfast and then sits at the lake (in her car) and watches the people and the sun hit the water. She says that the water is so high, it's over the boat ramps in a lot of places. Weird. I never did find the dinosaur tracks this year.
