Troops,<br>

<br>
        Tonight is the 231st anniversary of the event that began our<br>
country.  It's good to remember how we came to be who we are.  The colonies<br>
were for the most part willing to negotiate.  But when the British came to<br>
DIS-ARM them, it was fight or forever be under British rule.  An armed man<br>
is a citizen.  An unarmed man is a subject.  See attachments.<br>

Paul Revere's Ride<br>
Henry Wadsworth Longfellow<br>
<br>
<br>
Listen my children and you shall hear<br>
Of the midnight ride of Paul Revere,<br>
On the eighteenth of April, in Seventy-five;<br>
Hardly a man is now alive<br>
Who remembers that famous day and year.<br>
<br>
He said to his friend, "If the British march<br>
By land or sea from the town to-night,<br>
Hang a lantern aloft in the belfry arch<br>
Of the North Church tower as a signal light,--<br>
One if by land, and two if by sea;<br>
And I on the opposite shore will be,<br>
Ready to ride and spread the alarm<br>
Through every Middlesex village and farm,<br>
For the country folk to be up and to arm."<br>
<br>
Then he said "Good-night!" and with muffled oar<br>
Silently rowed to the Charlestown shore,<br>
Just as the moon rose over the bay,<br>
Where swinging wide at her moorings lay<br>
The Somerset, British man-of-war;<br>
A phantom ship, with each mast and spar<br>
Across the moon like a prison bar,<br>
And a huge black hulk, that was magnified<br>
By its own reflection in the tide.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, his friend through alley and street<br>
Wanders and watches, with eager ears,<br>
Till in the silence around him he hears<br>
The muster of men at the barrack door,<br>
The sound of arms, and the tramp of feet,<br>
And the measured tread of the grenadiers,<br>
Marching down to their boats on the shore.<br>
<br>
Then he climbed the tower of the Old North Church,<br>
By the wooden stairs, with stealthy tread,<br>
To the belfry chamber overhead,<br>
And startled the pigeons from their perch<br>
On the sombre rafters, that round him made<br>
Masses and moving shapes of shade,--<br>
By the trembling ladder, steep and tall,<br>
To the highest window in the wall,<br>
Where he paused to listen and look down<br>
A moment on the roofs of the town<br>
And the moonlight flowing over all.<br>
<br>
Beneath, in the churchyard, lay the dead,<br>
In their night encampment on the hill,<br>
Wrapped in silence so deep and still<br>
That he could hear, like a sentinel's tread,<br>
The watchful night-wind, as it went<br>
Creeping along from tent to tent,<br>
And seeming to whisper, "All is well!"<br>
A moment only he feels the spell<br>
Of the place and the hour, and the secret dread<br>
Of the lonely belfry and the dead;<br>
For suddenly all his thoughts are bent<br>
On a shadowy something far away,<br>
Where the river widens to meet the bay,--<br>
A line of black that bends and floats<br>
On the rising tide like a bridge of boats.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, impatient to mount and ride,<br>
Booted and spurred, with a heavy stride<br>
On the opposite shore walked Paul Revere.<br>
Now he patted his horse's side,<br>
Now he gazed at the landscape far and near,<br>
Then, impetuous, stamped the earth,<br>
And turned and tightened his saddle girth;<br>
But mostly he watched with eager search<br>
The belfry tower of the Old North Church,<br>
As it rose above the graves on the hill,<br>
Lonely and spectral and sombre and still.<br>
And lo! as he looks, on the belfry's height<br>
A glimmer, and then a gleam of light!<br>
He springs to the saddle, the bridle he turns,<br>
But lingers and gazes, till full on his sight<br>
A second lamp in the belfry burns.<br>
<br>
A hurry of hoofs in a village street,<br>
A shape in the moonlight, a bulk in the dark,<br>
And beneath, from the pebbles, in passing, a spark<br>
Struck out by a steed flying fearless and fleet;<br>
That was all! And yet, through the gloom and the light,<br>
The fate of a nation was riding that night;<br>
And the spark struck out by that steed, in his flight,<br>
Kindled the land into flame with its heat.<br>
He has left the village and mounted the steep,<br>
And beneath him, tranquil and broad and deep,<br>
Is the Mystic, meeting the ocean tides;<br>
And under the alders that skirt its edge,<br>
Now soft on the sand, now loud on the ledge,<br>
Is heard the tramp of his steed as he rides.<br>
<br>
It was twelve by the village clock<br>
When he crossed the bridge into Medford town.<br>
He heard the crowing of the cock,<br>
And the barking of the farmer's dog,<br>
And felt the damp of the river fog,<br>
That rises after the sun goes down.<br>
<br>
It was one by the village clock,<br>
When he galloped into Lexington.<br>
He saw the gilded weathercock<br>
Swim in the moonlight as he passed,<br>
And the meeting-house windows, black and bare,<br>
Gaze at him with a spectral glare,<br>
As if they already stood aghast<br>
At the bloody work they would look upon.<br>
<br>
It was two by the village clock,<br>
When he came to the bridge in Concord town.<br>
He heard the bleating of the flock,<br>
And the twitter of birds among the trees,<br>
And felt the breath of the morning breeze<br>
Blowing over the meadow brown.<br>
And one was safe and asleep in his bed<br>
Who at the bridge would be first to fall,<br>
Who that day would be lying dead,<br>
Pierced by a British musket ball.<br>
<br>
You know the rest. In the books you have read<br>
How the British Regulars fired and fled,---<br>
How the farmers gave them ball for ball,</div>

<br>
My LSS, was mentioning this anniversary to me as we were driving home from a<br>
lovely Easter letterboxing holiday in Galveston. We were recalling a recent<br>
documentary on the History Channel ( we think?) which discussed the fact<br>
that Longfellow somewhat glamorized the importance of Revere's ride, to make<br>
the poem a bit more exciting - truly poetic license, and very<br>
understandable! The intelligence about the English had apparently already<br>
been communicated in a rather more clandestine manner, but the ride made<br>
good press!<br>
<br>
And before anyone raises an eyebrow - I love the stories from the American<br>
Revolution and consider myself a staunch patriot - I'm an active member of<br>
the DAR, direct descendant of John & Abigail Adams ( which makes Sam Adams,<br>
the recipient of Revere's message, a distant cousin!) and my LSS is a native<br>
of Boston's North Shore, steeped in the history of militia.<br>
<br>
But I'm slightly uncomfortable with your posts which advocate a specific<br>
political position, namely that of the National Rifle Association. I respect<br>
your position and am grateful for your family's contribution to our country.<br>
My father was a marine in the South Pacific in WWII, my uncle was AirForce,<br>
shot down over Europe, two of my brothers-in-law served in Vietnam, where<br>
another uncle served in command of two tours on a minesweeper.<br>
<br>
However, I have very strong political opinions, too - which I do not express<br>
on this list. There are other forums for that!<br>
<br>
I love everyone's stories which gleefully run off-topic (and I'm one of the<br>
worst offenders!) but could we keep to personal/family/anecdotal posts and<br>
leave the strong political/religious views for another outlet? <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Very respectfully,<br>

<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">What a coincidence 
  that you posted this reminder, Mike! <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">My LSS, was 
  mentioning this anniversary to me as we were driving home from a lovely Easter 
  letterboxing holiday in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Galveston</st1:place></st1:city>. We were recalling a recent 
  documentary on the History Channel ( we think?) which discussed the fact that 
  Longfellow somewhat glamorized the importance of Revere’s ride, to make the 
  poem a bit more exciting – truly poetic license, and very understandable! The 
  intelligence about the English had apparently already been communicated in a 
  rather more clandestine manner, but the ride made good 
  press!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">And before anyone 
  raises an eyebrow – I love the stories from the American Revolution and 
  consider myself a staunch patriot – I’m an active member of the DAR, direct 
  descendant of John &amp; Abigail Adams ( which makes Sam Adams, the recipient 
  of Revere’s message, a distant cousin!) and my LSS is a native of Boston’s 
  North Shore, steeped in the history of militia.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">But I’m slightly 
  uncomfortable with your posts which advocate a specific political position, 
  namely that of the National Rifle Association. I respect your position and am 
  grateful for your family’s contribution to our country. My father was a marine 
  in the South Pacific in WWII, my uncle was AirForce, shot down over Europe, 
  two of my brothers-in-law served in <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:country-region w:st="on">Vietnam</st1:country-region></st1:place>, where another uncle served 
  in command of two tours on a minesweeper.<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">However, I have very 
  strong political opinions, too – which I do not express on this list. There 
  are other forums for that!<o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I love everyone’s 
  stories which gleefully run off-topic (and I’m one of the worst offenders!) 
  but could we keep to personal/family/anecdotal posts and leave the strong 
  political/religious views for another outlet? <o:p></o:p></span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font color="navy" face="Arial" size="2"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Arial"><o:p> </o:p></span></font></p>
