<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt;background:white"><span class="redbold1"><span lang="EN">I'm lovin' it!</span></span><span lang="EN" style="color:black"> Atlas Quest has inked a deal with McDonalds to promote
letterboxing as a fun and healthy hobby. Read all the details <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/press/2008/">here</a>.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">IMO - This could create a huge influx of people to
letterboxing.   However,  it is not clear to me just how
McDonald’s intends to market this.  Letterboxes aren’t in
every county/location, but McDonald’s restaurants are… I can see
this as opening up a lot of possibilities – lots of new boxers and boxes…
but I am curious – does anyone think they will do things differently
because of this?<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">I am fairly new to the obsession and have only a handful of
plants out there.  I am not trying to start a flame war about whether or
not this was a good idea (I see both sides to this) or the value of large
numbers of newcomers etc.  What I am trying to do is get a feel for what
this realistically means.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">To be honest, my first gut reaction was to put some restriction
on my boxes so the clues won’t be out there for anyone who has a smart
phone and a McDonald’s bag – at least temporarily until it is seen
how this unfolds.  My boxes are all urban plants within minutes of
McDonald’s.  But this also strikes me as not playing fair. 
Just because you are new doesn’t make you a bad or inconsiderate
letterboxer.  I think we all know that.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The lawyer in me is also concerned that once big
corporations start playing, things like “trademark infringement” could
become a topic of the week.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What do y’all think?<br/>

the atlasquest DNS.  The mcletterboxing.com site is<br>
professional-looking enough to be legit, but the whois info leads me<br>

<p>A little digging shows that the mcletterboxing.com domain was<br/>
registered by Ryan Carpenter in December 2007 and it's running off of<br/>
the atlasquest DNS. The mcletterboxing.com site is<br/>
professional-looking enough to be legit, but the whois info leads me<br/>
to believe that it is, in fact, a prank. A very well-executed prank,<br/>
and to be honest I'm second-guessing this even as I write!<br/>

                    <html><body><div>LOL...Despite the fact that I've participated in a couple of different newspaper articles, I feel like the most effective way to spread the word with people who will understand it is by word of mouth.  Letterboxing really isn't something you can explain in print or on a short TV news piece and certainly not on radio - you have to at least use your hands to explain it, if not drag out your logbook and stamps and so forth.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most everybody I know personally knows I letterbox, even if they don't get it.  Most of them even know my trailname.  But virtually everyone I ever told about it thought I was nuts.  My mom got it after I told her about it the second time (she was sick the first time I tried to explain it) and her husband got it after tagging along a few times.  My husband's family is a different story - the first couple of Christmases after we started, someone would ask "Are y'all still doing that stamping thing?" and when I would answer "YES" enthusiastically and then tell them about our latest adventure, they would move cautiously away, making sure to find an easy exit and leave plenty of room to be able to run.  Then my sis-in-law (TX Flutterby) caught on and it blew my mother-in-law's mind when Flutterby would come down and stay with them so she and I could get up early and head out boxing.  Flutterby's husband didn't get it either, but he was happy that she was happy.  Then on that - ahem - fateful trip to Martin Creek when Fearless Fox and Lightning headed out to retrieve TTB1 and stopped to get my bro-in-law and nephew along the way, my b-i-l thought he had allowed himself to be kidnapped by aliens (BEA's, of course).  As it turns out though, they attended the Cub Scout Dad and Lad last year where letterboxing was a focus, and they suddenly got it too.  My husband's cousin is coming around too - last time I saw her she even sat in a chair beside me while we chatted about letterboxing.  My compadre at work gets a kick out of watching out the office window when someone comes to find the box across the street from our office.  Our boss knows I have a box nearby, but his instinct tells him it is better not to ask.  And when I take days off of work to go letterboxing, he just shakes his head.  Kids think it's cool, but they think I'm too old to be doing such a thing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most times these days when I find the need to tell someone about it, or I find that I have to mention it to tell a story about something else, I simply make an off-hand reference to a treasure hunt game I play and move on.  Sometimes that catches their interest and they ask what I mean, sometimes they decide it's best not to ask.  And sometimes they do ask, and then wish they didn't.  Sometimes they get really interested!  In all cases, I don't tell them how to find clues unless they ask serious questions.  And I never, never tell anyone what I'm doing if I'm actually hunting so that I don't accidentally lead them to a box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One funny incident along this line happened a few months ago while I was finding one of JBK's holiday series.  A woman I know through soccer several years ago read the article that was written about letterboxing and my family in our local paper about three years ago.  I saw her in the grocery store some time later and she asked me if I really do that mailbox thing?  Yep, I told her, I sure do.  She asks me about it every time I see her.  As I was finding the holiday boxes, I was climbing up and down an embankment, looking hard for a box.  I saw a group of runners coming my way, so I chilled for a bit and acted like I was resting.  Turns out this woman was among the runners and she said hello as she ran past, and I heard one of her co-runners ask "Who was that?".  She replied "Oh that's a friend of mine - she must be playing that game she does."  I heard conversation continue but they were too far gone for me to hear what was being said.  On their next pass through (I was walking in the opposite direction they were running, so we passed several times), they slowed down and she asked me what it was called that I do.  I told her and they moved along.  On the next pass, they hauled up and she wanted me to explain it to her friends.  By then, I had found the last box, so I proceeded to explain while they jogged in place.  And of course, I got the standard odd looks.  </div>

 #1010ff 2px solid"> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div>LOL...Despite the fact that I've participated in a couple of different newspaper articles, I feel like the most effective way to spread the word with people who will understand it is by word of mouth.  Letterboxing really isn't something you can explain in print or on a short TV news piece and certainly not on radio - you have to at least use your hands to explain it, if not drag out your logbook and stamps and so forth.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Most everybody I know personally knows I letterbox, even if they don't get it.  Most of them even know my trailname.  But virtually everyone I ever told
 about it thought I was nuts.  My mom got it after I told her about it the second time (she was sick the first time I tried to explain it) and her husband got it after tagging along a few times.  My husband's family is a different story - the first couple of Christmases after we started, someone would ask "Are y'all still doing that stamping thing?" and when I would answer "YES" enthusiastically and then tell them about our latest adventure, they would move cautiously away, making sure to find an easy exit and leave plenty of room to be able to run.  Then my sis-in-law (TX Flutterby) caught on and it blew my mother-in-law's mind when Flutterby would come down and stay with them so she and I could get up early and head out boxing.  Flutterby's husband didn't get it either, but he was happy that she was happy.  Then on that - ahem - fateful trip to Martin Creek when Fearless Fox and Lightning headed out to retrieve TTB1
 and stopped to get my bro-in-law and nephew along the way, my b-i-l thought he had allowed himself to be kidnapped by aliens (BEA's, of course).  As it turns out though, they attended the Cub Scout Dad and Lad last year where letterboxing was a focus, and they suddenly got it too.  My husband's cousin is coming around too - last time I saw her she even sat in a chair beside me while we chatted about letterboxing.  My compadre at work gets a kick out of watching out the office window when someone comes to find the box across the street from our office.  Our boss knows I have a box nearby, but his instinct tells him it is better not to ask.  And when I take days off of work to go letterboxing, he just shakes his head.  Kids think it's cool, but they think I'm too old to be doing such a ! thing. div&gt;   <div> </div> <div>Most times these days when I find the need to tell someone about it, or I find that I have to mention it to tell a story
 about something else, I simply make an off-hand reference to a treasure hunt game I play and move on.  Sometimes that catches their interest and they ask what I mean, sometimes they decide it's best not to ask.  And sometimes they do ask, and then wish they didn't.  Sometimes they get really interested!  In all cases, I don't tell them how to find clues unless they ask serious questions.  And I never, never tell anyone what I'm doing if I'm actually hunting so that I don't accidentally lead them to a box.</div> <div> </div> <div>One funny incident along this line happened a few months ago while I was finding one of JBK's holiday series.  A woman I know through soccer several years ago read the article that was written about letterboxing and my family in our local paper about three years ago.  I saw her in the grocery store some time later and she asked me if I really do that mailbox thing?  Yep, I told her, I sure do. 
 She asks me about it every time I see her.  As I was finding the holiday boxes, I was climbing up and down an embankment, looking hard for a box.  I saw a group of runners coming my way, so I chilled for a bit and acted like I was resting.  Turns out this woman was among the runners and she said hello as she ran past, and I heard one of her co-runners ask "Who was that?".  She replied "Oh that's a friend of mine - she must be playing that game she does."  I heard conversation continue but they were too far gone for me to hear what was being said.  On their next pass through (I was walking in the opposite direction they were running, so we passed several times), they slowed down and she asked me what it was called that I do.  I told her and they moved along.  On the next pass, they hauled up and she wanted me to explain it to her friends.  By then, I had found the last box, so I proceeded to explain while they jogged in
 place.  And of course, I got the standard odd looks.  </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><br/> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 4/1/08, <b class="gmail_sendername">Abbie Beck</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:abbiembeck@sbcglobal.net">abbiembeck@sbcgloba<wbr>l.net</wbr></a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid"> <div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div><strong><font color="#00407f">I wondered the same thing!!  </font></strong></div> <div><strong><font color="#00407f"></font></strong> </div> <div><strong><font color="#00407f">How do you choose whom to tell about letterboxing?  We've had so much fun doing this that I want to share it with EVERYONE, but I started feeling a little like I was telling a "secret" to too many people.  Of course, most people looked at me like I was nuts and would never be bothered, but some have gotten really
