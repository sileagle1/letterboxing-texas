                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just returned from vacation with the family to South Texas and <br>
despite the rain we managed to have a good time camping on the beach <br>
and seeing many birds not seen anywhere else in the U.S.  I also placed <br>
7 new boxes, 5 of which are in virgin counties, so I have uploaded a <br>
new TX County map in the Files section.  I hope all of you get a chance <br>
to visit this area of Texas some day!<br>

by boxes when they can be on my way - with alittle bit of a detour!  I <br>
was planning on checking out Pete again (to see what he is wearing) and <br>
now a new stamp makes it even better.  Thanks a bunch from me in <br>
advance and may my daughter have patience while waiting for me to show <br>
up.  lol<br>
