<div> </div>
<div>That won't deter US though - we will simply claim some shady tables and call it a gathering!  I was thinking of picnic tables near the pavilion, but as I think about them, I'm not sure about the shade.  Anyone else have a better idea of what the shade is like there?  I know we can get good shade if we meet by the monument.  I'm hoping to go over there tomorrow for Jambo on the Trail and do a little trail trekking with Jim's pack tomorrow, but I've got a couple of pressing things standing to take care of before I get there.</div>

<div>Tell ya what - I'll bring my big ol' stuffed bear (with any luck he'll have recovered from his multiple broken bones and head injuries he presently has) and if you see him, you'll have found us!  </div>

<div>Good Morning Y'all!</div>

<div>Just wanted to remind everyone that we will be having a casual gathering in Palestine at the Davey Dogwood Park in Palestine on Saturday, May 17th.  Hopefully some of y'all who have been waiting until the last minute to decide about this one will jump in your cars and head our way!</div>

<p> </p>
<p>For shade, I think we might be better off by the concrete tables near the Davey monument.  I'm not certain if there is much shade by the pavillion.  Oh well, we'll make it work anyway.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hey Lucy.  If you decide to join us we will be starting about 1 P.M.  We'll be at the Railroad Park as prior planned.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Well isn't that silly of you not to think of contacting the indigent health care office.  That's the first place I would look for making park pavillion reservations.  You really need to get yourself together:)  Excuse us though - this is Palestine.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Hey Beautiful Butterflies.  How are your girls?  I hope no more brick incidents (that was hillarious.)  Was the box you're referring to The Legend of the Dogwood?  I hope he is going to let the box lie as is.  It was made for the gathering and it would be a shame if it disappeared before we have the event.</p>

<p>
</p><div>Well that's that.  I had called awhile back to reserve the pavilion and left my info with someone, but I realized a day or two ago that no one had ever called me back to confirm.  I started making phone calls today and got quite a run-around and have left messages all over the city and county.  SO - with this latest information, we can rule out the pavilion - thank you very much for finding out about that Georgie.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That won't deter US though - we will simply claim some shady tables and call it a gathering!  I was thinking of picnic tables near the pavilion, but as I think about them, I'm not sure about the shade.  Anyone else have a better idea of what the shade is like there?  I know we can get good shade if we meet by the monument.  I'm hoping to go over there tomorrow for Jambo on the Trail and do a little trail trekking with Jim's pack tomorrow, but I've got a couple of pressing things standing to take care of before I get there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tell ya what - I'll bring my big ol' stuffed bear (with any luck he'll have recovered from his multiple broken bones and head injuries he presently has) and if you see him, you'll have found us!  </div>

</p><div>guys,</div>
<div>   we were just at the park yesterday(thursday) for a homeschool event with the forestry service and i mentioned to my cousin's husband(works for the service) that we were going to snag the latest box that had been planted when we finished with the event and lunch.  he later shows up at our vehicle with the city employee in charge of the park, who was curious about the boxes and wanted to make sure that they weren't something objectionable.  after he finished his work and while my kids and a couple of other families' kids were playing in the creek(we're such rednecks), i let him find the box so he wouldn't be anti-letterboxing.  his question was, is the gathering going to be at the pavilion?  if it was, had we reserved it? he checked the calendar for the pavilion and there is a birthday party there the 17th.  i told him i would contact ya'll and check.  the birthday party is from 2-4p. just thought i'd
 let ya'll know.  contact the indigent health care office through the  city. by the way, that stamp is very beautiful. </div>

<div>I think I can help with the Denton one - Fearless Fox and Lightning are going to be on a canoe trip so I'll be traveling solo.  How flexible would you be on travel time?  We can talk more at Palestine, assuming you catch a ride there!</div>

 lunch.  he later shows up at our vehicle with the city employee in charge of the park, who was curious about the boxes and wanted to make sure that they weren't something objectionable.  after he finished his work and while my kids and a couple of other families' kids were playing in the creek(we're such rednecks), i let him find the box so he wouldn't be anti-letterboxing.  his question was, is the gathering going to be at the pavilion?  if it was, had we reserved it? he checked the calendar for the pavilion and there is a birthday party there the 17th.  i told him i would contact ya'll and check.  the birthday party is from 2-4p. just thought i'd let ya'll know.  contact the indigent health care office through the  city. by the way, that stamp is very beautiful. </div>

<div>Well that's that.  I had called awhile back to reserve the pavilion and left my info with someone, but I realized a day or two ago that no one had ever called me back to confirm.  I started making phone calls today and got quite a run-around and have left messages all over the city and county.  SO - with this latest information, we can rule out the pavilion - thank you very much for finding out about that Georgie.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That won't deter US though - we will simply claim some shady tables and call it a gathering!  I was thinking of picnic tables near the pavilion, but as I think about them, I'm not sure about the shade.  Anyone else have a better idea of what the shade is like there?  I know we can get good shade if we meet by the monument.  I'm hoping to go over there tomorrow for Jambo on the Trail and do a little trail trekking with Jim's pack tomorrow, but I've got a couple of pressing things standing to take care of before I get there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tell ya what - I'll bring my big ol' stuffed bear (with any luck he'll have recovered from his multiple broken bones and head injuries he presently has) and if you see him, you'll have found us!  </div>

<div>guys,</div>
<div>   we were just at the park yesterday(thursday) for a homeschool event with the forestry service and i mentioned to my cousin's husband(works for the service) that we were going to snag the latest box that had been planted when we finished with the event and lunch.  he later shows up at our vehicle with the city employee in charge of the park, who was curious about the boxes and wanted to make sure that they weren't something objectionable.  after he finished his work and while my kids and a couple of other families' kids were playing in the creek(we're such rednecks), i let him find the box so he wouldn't be anti-letterboxing.  his question was, is the gathering going to be at the pavilion?  if it was, had we reserved it? he checked the calendar for the pavilion and there is a birthday party there the 17th.  i told him i would contact ya'll and check.  the birthday party is from 2-4p. just thought i'd
 let ya'll know.  contact the indigent health care office through the  city. by the way, that stamp is very beautiful. </div>

<div>Good Morning Y'all!</div>

<div>Just wanted to remind everyone that we will be having a casual gathering in Palestine at the Davey Dogwood Park in Palestine on Saturday, May 17th.  Hopefully some of y'all who have been waiting until the last minute to decide about this one will jump in your cars and head our way!</div>
