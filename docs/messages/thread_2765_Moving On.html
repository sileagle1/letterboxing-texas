<br/>
Just a note to let you know that we are moving. Yes, we're leaving  <br/>
this big ole state of Texas and moving to England around August. I  <br/>
have quite a few placed boxes - including the two Texas Tour Bus  <br/>
boxes - which I am going to leave in place instead of pulling  <br/>
everything. Any missing boxes will simply be retired, and if a box  <br/>
comes up that needs maintenance (ie new logbook or such), perhaps I  <br/>
will be able to ask for some assistance so we can keep it it  <br/>
circulation. (:p)<br/>
<br/>
I'll still be lurking around the list and getting some area boxes  <br/>
before we leave.  But I just wanted to tell everyone a big THANKS!  <br/>
for placing all your boxes.  There were hardly any boxers in Houston  <br/>
when I started. In fact, I recall going after many FFs against Silver  <br/>
Eagle, Baby Bear, and the missing Hawk. So few boxes popped up, that  <br/>
we all descended like vultures when one did! LOL. I've had a great  <br/>
time getting out and finding all of your boxes. SO many places I  <br/>
never knew existed! And it's been really fun putting faces to the  <br/>
names - especially from the gatherings. We're like this little tribe  <br/>
out wondering around among the masses looking for things in the woods  <br/>
and around buildings.  Also, feel free to put a new box in any place  <br/>
I have a retired box (hint hint Howard Hughes).<br/>
<br/>
I'll try to place some boxes outside of London for you to find on  <br/>
your way to Dartmoor. They'll be listed on AQ when it happens.<br/>
<br/>
Carry on and I'll be in touch now and again!<br/>

<div>You will be missed! It was such a pleasure to meet you at the gathering in Rusk. Good luck in England. It will be a fabulous adventure for your family. Thanks for your legacy - especially the wonderful Texas Tour Bus(es)! </div>
