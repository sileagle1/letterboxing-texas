miles of trails.  Even though the Event will be too soon for <br>

good theme for the Event.  I plan to try booking a pavilion tomorrow so <br>

<div>In addition to letterboxing, the Country Inn Steakhouse/Sommerville 
Steakhouse is a REALLY tasty place for lunch and dinner! They have great chicken 
fried steak, t-bones and if you get them before they run out, the mashed 
potatoes are incredible!!  M-Dot and I used to eat there on our dates when
