for them while I was doing research on JEN.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ghosttowns.com/states/tx/tx.html<br/>
<br/>
I went ahead and pulled information on the ones in JEN<br/>
for reference, and here they are in case they inspire<br/>
anyone to do a stamp and a box for the gathering.  I<br/>
can't vouch for whether any of them would actually<br/>
have anywhere to plant, but some of y'all are pretty<br/>
creative, so have at it!<br/>
<br/>
Ellis County<br/>
Telico-birthplace of Clyde Barrow<br/>
Crisp-birthplace of Ernest Tubb (there is a historical<br/>
marker on the site)<br/>
<br/>
Navarro County<br/>
Cryer Creek-named such because there is a waterfall<br/>
near the town and the townspeople thought the falls<br/>
sounded like a woman who cried out for help after she<br/>
fell in the creek.  <br/>
Curry-this was an oil boomtown in 1923.<br/>
