The best part of placing these was that my 88 year young Grandma went <br/>
along for the ride with me.  She really likes Letterboxing, she is <br/>
always wanting me to tell all her friends about it. I know if she could <br/>
get a long a little better, she be on the trails with me. Also I got 2 <br/>
more planted in more in Schulenburg.  Anyway, back home and need to <br/>
start planning out my Mexico box(s), leaving in to weeks.<br/>
