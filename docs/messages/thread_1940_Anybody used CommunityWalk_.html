                    <html><body><div>I've developed a thing for maps over the last few months, and I've been working toward trying to learn about customizing maps.  I have been enamored with Birds of a Feather's Texas Letterboxing Atlas since it first began, but I wanted to find a way to make my own map with more specific locations and MY statuses of letterboxes.  I've come across a few programs and sites, but they were overwhelmingly complicated.  I needed something online that I can work with easily...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.communitywalk.com">www.communitywalk.com</a> is a customizable map site.  Admittedly, it isn't as flexible as I would like, but it's pretty cool!  I mapped all the letterboxes in Cherokee County and I'm working on other counties now and I've noted them with my status - found, unfound, mine, whatever.  I've loaded their clue link into the marker, and I've marked parks that aren't on the maps.  As I find boxes, I can easily change their status.  I've also added in some geocaches, and I'll note points of interest that may be applicable to letterboxing for me (like historic sites where I might like to place boxes).

<div>I've had a lot of fun playing with it the last few days.  I don't see myself ever abandoning Jeff's atlas, but this has been nice for planning for me.<br clear="all"/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

Unfortunately, I don't have the time to really get<br>
into it right now, but maybe in a few months.  Thanks<br>
for telling us about it.  Isn't it great that TX has<br>
so many boxes now that you need a tool like this just <br>

<div>Yes, it is!  My last few trips out I've had to really get on top of getting organized so I could know as best I could exactly where I was going before I got there to avoid backtracking back and forth across town.  Even still, I can't seem to get nearly as many boxes as I want to get due to time constraints and overabundance.  What a frustrating problem - except not nearly as frustrating as wanting to go boxing for a whole day and not having enough boxes to fill the day!

<div>Fearless Fox and Lightning are due back tomorrow, so my days of free roaming are about over.  I've gone out every evening this week and done "something" box-related, whether it be maintenance or finding or placing or rehiding.  I've not had to worry about meals or bedtimes or commitments.  I've come home well after dark and played with this map thing until the wee hours, then gotten up and gone to work and left from there to go roam again.  It's been a tough life, but I'll be glad to have them home.
