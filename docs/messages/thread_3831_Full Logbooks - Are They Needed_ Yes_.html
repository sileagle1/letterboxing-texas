<p>When I proposed this question, I was playing devil's advocate to get <br/>more responses, but I must say that I agree with everything BL said. <br/>So, for the record, I am for logbooks and will continue providing <br/>
them, if for no other reason than a letterbox should have something <br/>resembling a letter in it. Otherwise it would be a stampbox. Thanks <br/>to everyone voicing their opinion and hope you are having a fun <br/>Halloween!<br/>
<br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>&gt; Anyway, Silver Eagle, I would still go find your boxes if you <br/>decided to<br/>&gt; quit using logbooks, but I wouldn't enjoy them as much, and I would <br/>probably<br/>&gt; not get around to logging online, although I would probably still <br/>
send you<br/>&gt; an email.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; Want to support scouting? Buy popcorn!<br/>&gt; Go to <a href="http://www.orderpopcorn.com/" target="_blank">www.orderpopcorn.com</a> and use Order Key TEQVZB1<br/>
