<p>I learned about this hobby from a friend in Maryland, but no one I've talked to around here seems to know anything about it and there are no boxes in Commerce.  We plan to plant some in the future.  Most in our area were placed by jb kokopelli and we'll be after several more of hers tomorrow.  We've learned to take insect repellant and sun block with us.  We're looking forward to attending a gathering sometime and learning more about this great hobby.</p>

<div>Welcome to the group!</div>

<div>Let me assure you boxes are gradually easing your way!  We had an initiative last year that got more boxes into the northern parts of Northeast Texas, but before that, there wouldn't have been anything even close to you!</div>

<div>I'm in Cherokee County - a good little run from Commerce, but hopefully our paths will cross one of these days!</div>
