Meanwhile, I was considering how to write a disclaimer<br/>
for Texas boxes.  Here's what I came up with so far:<br/>
<br/>
"Letterboxing must be considered a high-risk activity<br/>
and as such, the following warnings are provided in an<br/>
effort to alleviate liability of the placer:<br/>
<br/>
1) Animals, plants, trees, insects, or spiders may be<br/>
found in the general area of the box.  Any of these<br/>
could present possible harm individually or severally<br/>
and are often found in combination with one another.  <br/>
<br/>
2) Tripping hazards include holes, roots, and vines,<br/>
as well as detached limbs and branches cast asides by<br/>
above-mentioned trees.  These hazars are often found<br/>
in and around box areas.<br/>
<br/>
3) While every attempt is made to place a box in an<br/>
area with excellent air quality, the possible risk of<br/>
air pollutants is present.  <br/>
<br/>
4) Water hazards ranging from small puddles to oceans,<br/>
and even water droplets in liquid or frozen form<br/>
falling from the sky may be found unexpectedly and<br/>
without warning.  An additional water hazard is found<br/>
during times of extreme heat and forms within the<br/>
body, forcing it's way out through pourous skin.<br/>
<br/>
5) Beignet-eating aliens can often be found in areas<br/>
with high letterbox concentrations.  Under no<br/>
circumstance should finders attempt to make contact<br/>
with such aliens while in possession of a letterbox;<br/>
however, if approached by BEA's, surrender any and all<br/>
boxes and stamps, as well as all bread products.<br/>
<br/>
6) The placer has made every effort to eradicate<br/>
hazardous micro-organisms in the vicinity of the box,<br/>
but such organisms may have found their way back into<br/>
the area between monthly sweeps, so the potential<br/>
finder must exercise appropriate caution.  <br/>
<br/>
7) In addition to the above mentioned dangers, there<br/>
may be other individuals found on the trail who must<br/>
be misled and/or misguided, so any finder with an<br/>
aversion to executing subterfuge is cautioned and<br/>
should plan to box during off-peak hours.  <br/>
<br/>
8) Intense exposure to sunlight has been known to<br/>
cause cancer, so finders must take proper precautions<br/>
to avoid excessive exposure.<br/>
<br/>
9) While letterboxing after daylight hours may<br/>
alleviate some of the above-mentioned hazards<br/>
(specifically 7 &amp; 8), please be aware that it<br/>
increases some of the other risks (1, 2, &amp; 5).<br/>
<br/>
9) Finally, loss of direction is a constant risk so<br/>
every effort should be made to maintain a means of<br/>
communication and backtracking.  Cell phones and<br/>
compasses are highly recommended, as are homing<br/>
pigeons.  Leaving a trail of bread crumbs, while<br/>
effective, can be hampered by hazards previously<br/>
mentioned, specifically #1, #5, #7, and #8.<br/>
<br/>
Placer shall only be responsible for the failure of<br/>
the finder to secure the stamp image and shall not in<br/>
any way be liable for monetary, emotional, or other<br/>
damages incurred by finders while letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
In the event legal action is required, every effort<br/>
must first be made to resolve differences through<br/>
mediation.  If court action is required, please file<br/>
necessary paperwork no later than January 31st for<br/>
consideration at the annual meeting of the<br/>
letterboxing court, held at a predetermined location,<br/>
usually in the month of March.  At that time, evidence<br/>
will be heard and a determination will be made.  If<br/>
unsuccessful, the placer will be ordered to provide a<br/>
stamp image of the box in question.  If cause is found<br/>
to be unsubstantiated, the finder will be ordered to<br/>
place no less than three boxes of their own.<br/>

I have spent waaaay too much time on the computer the last week or <br/>
so on a frustrating volunteer project and I so needed the laughs.  <br/>
This belongs in the letterboxing hall of fame!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing I would add is in the last section meting out <br/>
punishment that the offending letterboxer has to plant his/her <br/>
penalty boxes in a county with fewer than 5 boxes.  <br/>

<div><b>Subject:</b> RE: [letterboxingtexas] question 
  about lb hazards-attempt at humor</div>
<div><br/></div><tt>Nice new abbreviations Ruby!  <br/><br/>Meanwhile, I was 
  considering how to write a disclaimer<br/>for Texas boxes.  Here's what I 
  came up with so far:<br/><br/>"Letterboxing must be considered a high-risk 
  activity<br/>and as such, the following warnings are provided in an<br/>effort 
  to alleviate liability of the placer:<br/><br/>1) Animals, plants, trees, 
  insects, or spiders may be<br/>found in the general area of the box.  Any 
  of these<br/>could present possible harm individually or severally<br/>and are 
  often found in combination with one another.  <br/><br/>2) Tripping hazards 
  include holes, roots, and vines,<br/>as well as detached limbs and branches 
  cast asides by<br/>above-mentioned trees.  These hazars are often 
  found<br/>in and around box areas.<br/><br/>3) While every attempt is made to 
  place a box in an<br/>area with excellent air quality, the possible risk 
  of<br/>air pollutants is present.  <br/><br/>4) Water hazards ranging from 
  small puddles to oceans,<br/>and even water droplets in liquid or frozen 
  form<br/>falling from the sky may be found unexpectedly and<br/>without 
  warning.  An additional water hazard is found<br/>during times of extreme 
  heat and forms within the<br/>body, forcing it's way out through pourous 
  skin.<br/><br/>5) Beignet-eating aliens can often be found in areas<br/>with high 
  letterbox concentrations.  Under no<br/>circumstance should finders 
  attempt to make contact<br/>with such aliens while in possession of a 
  letterbox;<br/>however, if approached by BEA's, surrender any and all<br/>boxes 
  and stamps, as well as all bread products.<br/><br/>6) The placer has made every 
  effort to eradicate<br/>hazardous micro-organisms in the vicinity of the 
  box,<br/>but such organisms may have found their way back into<br/>the area 
  between monthly sweeps, so the potential<br/>finder must exercise appropriate 
  caution.  <br/><br/>7) In addition to the above mentioned dangers, 
  there<br/>may be other individuals found on the trail who must<br/>be misled 
  and/or misguided, so any finder with an<br/>aversion to executing subterfuge is 
  cautioned and<br/>should plan to box during off-peak hours.  <br/><br/>8) 
  Intense exposure to sunlight has been known to<br/>cause cancer, so finders 
  must take proper precautions<br/>to avoid excessive exposure.<br/><br/>9) While 
  letterboxing after daylight hours may<br/>alleviate some of the above-mentioned 
  hazards<br/>(specifically 7 &amp; 8), please be aware that it<br/>increases some 
  of the other risks (1, 2, &amp; 5).<br/><br/>9) Finally, loss of direction is a 
  constant risk so<br/>every effort should be made to maintain a means 
  of<br/>communication and backtracking.  Cell phones and<br/>compasses are 
  highly recommended, as are homing<br/>pigeons.  Leaving a trail of bread 
  crumbs, while<br/>effective, can be hampered by hazards 
  previously<br/>mentioned, specifically #1, #5, #7, and #8.<br/><br/>Placer shall 
  only be responsible for the failure of<br/>the finder to secure the stamp image 
  and shall not in<br/>any way be liable for monetary, emotional, or 
  other<br/>damages incurred by finders while letterboxing.<br/><br/>In the event 
  legal action is required, every effort<br/>must first be made to resolve 
  differences through<br/>mediation.  If court action is required, please 
  file<br/>necessary paperwork no later than January 31st for<br/>consideration at 
  the annual meeting of the<br/>letterboxing court, held at a predetermined 
  location,<br/>usually in the month of March.  At that time, 
  evidence<br/>will be heard and a determination will be made.  
  If<br/>unsuccessful, the placer will be ordered to provide a<br/>stamp image of 
  the box in question.  If cause is found<br/>to be unsubstantiated, the 
  finder will be ordered to<br/>place no less than three boxes of their 
  own.<br/><br/><br/>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You
