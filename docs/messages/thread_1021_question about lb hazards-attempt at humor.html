<br>
Meanwhile, I was considering how to write a disclaimer<br>
for Texas boxes.  Here's what I came up with so far:<br>
<br>
"Letterboxing must be considered a high-risk activity<br>
and as such, the following warnings are provided in an<br>
effort to alleviate liability of the placer:<br>
<br>
1) Animals, plants, trees, insects, or spiders may be<br>
found in the general area of the box.  Any of these<br>
could present possible harm individually or severally<br>
and are often found in combination with one another.  <br>
<br>
2) Tripping hazards include holes, roots, and vines,<br>
as well as detached limbs and branches cast asides by<br>
above-mentioned trees.  These hazars are often found<br>
in and around box areas.<br>
<br>
3) While every attempt is made to place a box in an<br>
area with excellent air quality, the possible risk of<br>
air pollutants is present.  <br>
<br>
4) Water hazards ranging from small puddles to oceans,<br>
and even water droplets in liquid or frozen form<br>
falling from the sky may be found unexpectedly and<br>
without warning.  An additional water hazard is found<br>
during times of extreme heat and forms within the<br>
body, forcing it's way out through pourous skin.<br>
<br>
5) Beignet-eating aliens can often be found in areas<br>
with high letterbox concentrations.  Under no<br>
circumstance should finders attempt to make contact<br>
with such aliens while in possession of a letterbox;<br>
however, if approached by BEA's, surrender any and all<br>
boxes and stamps, as well as all bread products.<br>
<br>
6) The placer has made every effort to eradicate<br>
hazardous micro-organisms in the vicinity of the box,<br>
but such organisms may have found their way back into<br>
the area between monthly sweeps, so the potential<br>
finder must exercise appropriate caution.  <br>
<br>
7) In addition to the above mentioned dangers, there<br>
may be other individuals found on the trail who must<br>
be misled and/or misguided, so any finder with an<br>
aversion to executing subterfuge is cautioned and<br>
should plan to box during off-peak hours.  <br>
<br>
8) Intense exposure to sunlight has been known to<br>
cause cancer, so finders must take proper precautions<br>
to avoid excessive exposure.<br>
<br>
9) While letterboxing after daylight hours may<br>
alleviate some of the above-mentioned hazards<br>
(specifically 7 & 8), please be aware that it<br>
increases some of the other risks (1, 2, & 5).<br>
<br>
9) Finally, loss of direction is a constant risk so<br>
every effort should be made to maintain a means of<br>
communication and backtracking.  Cell phones and<br>
compasses are highly recommended, as are homing<br>
pigeons.  Leaving a trail of bread crumbs, while<br>
effective, can be hampered by hazards previously<br>
mentioned, specifically #1, #5, #7, and #8.<br>
<br>
Placer shall only be responsible for the failure of<br>
the finder to secure the stamp image and shall not in<br>
any way be liable for monetary, emotional, or other<br>
damages incurred by finders while letterboxing.<br>
<br>
In the event legal action is required, every effort<br>
must first be made to resolve differences through<br>
mediation.  If court action is required, please file<br>
necessary paperwork no later than January 31st for<br>
consideration at the annual meeting of the<br>
letterboxing court, held at a predetermined location,<br>
usually in the month of March.  At that time, evidence<br>
will be heard and a determination will be made.  If<br>
unsuccessful, the placer will be ordered to provide a<br>
stamp image of the box in question.  If cause is found<br>
to be unsubstantiated, the finder will be ordered to<br>
place no less than three boxes of their own.<br>
<br>

I have spent waaaay too much time on the computer the last week or <br>
so on a frustrating volunteer project and I so needed the laughs.  <br>
This belongs in the letterboxing hall of fame!<br>
<br>
The only thing I would add is in the last section meting out <br>
punishment that the offending letterboxer has to plant his/her <br>
penalty boxes in a county with fewer than 5 boxes.  <br>

  cast asides by<br/>above-mentioned trees.  These hazars are often 
  found<br/>in and around box areas.<br/><br/>3) While every attempt is made to 
  place a box in an<br/>area with excellent air quality, the possible risk 
  of<br/>air pollutants is present.  <br/><br/>4) Water hazards ranging from 
  small puddles to oceans,<br/>and even water droplets in liquid or frozen 
  form<br/>falling from the sky may be found unexpectedly and<br/>without 
  warning.  An additional water hazard is found<br/>during times of extreme 
  heat and forms within the<br/>body, forcing it's way out through pourous 
  skin.<br/><br/>5) Beignet-eating aliens can often be found in areas<br/>with high 
  letterbox concentrations.  Under no<br/>circumstance should finders 
  attempt to make contact<br/>with such aliens while in possession of a 
  letterbox;<br/>however, if approached by BEA's, surrender any and all<br/>boxes 
  and stamps, as well as all bread products.<br/><br/>6) The placer has made every 
  effort to eradicate<br/>hazardous micro-organisms in the vicinity of the 
  box,<br/>but such organisms may have found their way back into<br/>the area 
  between monthly sweeps, so the potential<br/>finder must exercise appropriate 
  caution.  <br/><br/>7) In addition to the above mentioned dangers, 
  there<br/>may be other individuals found on the trail who must<br/>be misled 
  and/or misguided, so any finder with an<br/>aversion to executing subterfuge is 
  cautioned and<br/>should plan to box during off-peak hours.  <br/><br/>8) 
  Intense exposure to sunlight has been known to<br/>cause cancer, so finders 
  must take proper precautions<br/>to avoid excessive exposure.<br/><br/>9) While 
  letterboxing after daylight hours may<br/>alleviate some of the above-mentioned 
  hazards<br/>(specifically 7 &amp; 8), please be aware that it<br/>increases some 
  of the other risks (1, 2, &amp; 5).<br/><br/>9) Finally, loss of direction is a 
  constant risk so<br/>every effort should be made to maintain a means 
  of<br/>communication and backtracking.  Cell phones and<br/>compasses are 
  highly recommended, as are homing<br/>pigeons.  Leaving a trail of bread 
  crumbs, while<br/>effective, can be hampered by hazards 
  previously<br/>mentioned, specifically #1, #5, #7, and #8.<br/><br/>Placer shall 
  only be responsible for the failure of<br/>the finder to secure the stamp image 
  and shall not in<br/>any way be liable for monetary, emotional, or 
  other<br/>damages incurred by finders while letterboxing.<br/><br/>In the event 
  legal action is required, every effort<br/>must first be made to resolve 
  differences through<br/>mediation.  If court action is required, please 
  file<br/>necessary paperwork no later than January 31st for<br/>consideration at 
  the annual meeting of the<br/>letterboxing court, held at a predetermined 
  location,<br/>usually in the month of March.  At that time, 
  evidence<br/>will be heard and a determination will be made.  
  If<br/>unsuccessful, the placer will be ordered to provide a<br/>stamp image of 
  the box in question.  If cause is found<br/>to be unsubstantiated, the 
  finder will be ordered to<br/>place no less than three boxes of their 
  own.<br/><br/><br/>__________________________________________________<br/>Do You

<div>Nice new abbreviations Ruby!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Meanwhile, I was considering how to write a disclaimer</div>
<div>for Texas boxes.  Here's what I came up with so far:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Letterboxing must be considered a high-risk activity</div>
<div>and as such, the following warnings are provided in an</div>
<div>effort to alleviate liability of the placer:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) Animals, plants, trees, insects, or spiders may be</div>
<div>found in the general area of the box.  Any of these</div>
<div>could present possible harm individually or severally</div>
<div>and are often found in combination with one another.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Tripping hazards include holes, roots, and vines,</div>
<div>as well as detached limbs and branches cast asides by</div>
<div>above-mentioned trees.  These hazars are often found</div>
<div>in and around box areas.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) While every attempt is made to place a box in an</div>
<div>area with excellent air quality, the possible risk of</div>
<div>air pollutants is present.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4) Water hazards ranging from small puddles to oceans,</div>
<div>and even water droplets in liquid or frozen form</div>
<div>falling from the sky may be found unexpectedly and</div>
<div>without warning.  An additional water hazard is found</div>
<div>during times of extreme heat and forms within the</div>
<div>body, forcing it's way out through pourous skin.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5) Beignet-eating aliens can often be found in areas</div>
<div>with high letterbox concentrations.  Under no</div>
<div>circumstance should finders attempt to make contact</div>
<div>with such aliens while in possession of a letterbox;</div>

<div>boxes and stamps, as well as all bread products.</div>

<div>the area between monthly sweeps, so the potential</div>

<div>may be other individuals found on the trail who must</div>
