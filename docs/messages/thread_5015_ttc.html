Thanks for the notification, I was thinking about making the trip in a day or two, but I couldn't justify the distance.  I would think the train was getting full and with the recent close call (kidnapping), is retirement in the immediate future?<br/>

Since the next TALE is a long way off, I guess the TTC could continue to tour until then with no new players added before being brought to TALE.  Since Baby Bear is the owner of the TTC and currently is keeper of TTB2, he should voice his opinion.<br/>

P.S.  I like the idea of a TX Traveling Rodeo.  The only downside is that rodeos also have clowns :)<br/>

<div>I would be honored to start the tour of the Texas Wild West Show and 
Rodeo.  I’ll wait until we get a final consensus.  And, I’m in the 
camp of one box equals one find, no matter how many stamps are in it.  If 
memory serves, for a while the TTB2 was planted with no extra passengers added, 
but with a separate box planted nearby to commemorate the spot.   And 
on a completely different subject, I recently received my 100-mile Path Tag from

<p>Since I don't count finds or plants, I don't care either way.<br/><br/>BUT - if we wanted to be really hard core, we would stick with "you only had to go and find one box - it just happened to have a lot of stamps" so Traveling Box=1 stamp mindset.  HOWEVER, considering that the Traveling Boxes are not your run of the mill boxes, and they do take forever and a day to stamp all the stamps, I can understand saying each stamp is one find.<br/>
<br/>On the flip side, if the Traveling Box were to only count as one find, then the carvers of all the stamps shouldn't get credit for a plant, but if each stamp equalled one find, then each carver could count their contribution as a plant as well.<br/>
<br/>As one who usually likes to play by the most traditional of rules, I would still lean toward doing the 1 stamp=1 find thing - in the instance of traveling boxes only.<br/><br/>FWIW, my .02,<br/>BarefootLucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>

<p>I guess great minds think alike.  We were just talking this morning about the retirement of the Circus and starting a new traveling box.  My idea, since we have had a bus and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield Overland Mail. But I like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging raging bulls.  Would Bell Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show?  If the circus is making a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no reason that the Rodeo couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is there?  The Circus has been around for over three years so that's not a bad run.  I have a couple of observations about the traveling boxes.  The first is that, in my opinion, there should be a size limit for the stamps.  There are some really large Circus stamps and that just makes the box fill up faster.  I know there were some published rules or guidelines for the first two buses, such as prompt notification when a box is found so that folks won't travel a great distance only to find that the box has already been picked up.  I was considering a trip when Bell Motel reported her find, and I appreciated the notification, but that hasn't always been the case, so maybe we should revisit the rules.  I know the traveling boxes have owners, but I think all of us feel like partial owners and feel the responsibility of ownership.  One other point, and I'd like to hear other opinions on this, is that the first two boxes counted as one find for every stamp, so you could really pad your find stats by finding the box.  I think that generated a lot of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way to grab the box.  For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one find.  That's a lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/>

&gt; If the TTC has grown too big for its ample box, I think we should make it a TALE Event box like the TTB2 for the same reasons BL states.  Since the next TALE is a long way off, I guess the TTC could continue to tour until then with no new players added before being brought to TALE.  Since Baby Bear is the owner of the TTC and currently is keeper of TTB2, he should voice his opinion.<br/>
