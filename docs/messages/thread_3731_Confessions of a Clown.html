with his insults that I planned to take the bus all the way to Mexico.  <br>
However, I only got as far as Sugar Land before I had a change of <br>
heart.  First of all, the bus was so crowded that there just wasn't <br>
room for me or any new passengers.  Also, I realized that I am a clown <br>
first and hijacker second, so I decided to abandon the bus and join <br>
forces with Baby Bear to buy a Big Top and start the Traveling Texas <br>
Circus.  I hope to garner your forgiveness by providing a home for all <br>
things circus and ask that you help fill my Big Top with appropriate <br>
entertainers.  The TTB2 will continue to travel in TX, but will not <br>
take on any new passengers, and when I last saw them Basking On The <br>
Brazos, they seemed happy with that arrangement.  So, if you know <br>
anyone who wants to run away to join the circus, tell them to come join <br>
me and let everyone on the TX Talklist know where to find me.<br>
