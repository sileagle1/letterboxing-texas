home to Dallas from Galveston...we felt a little like kids sneaking into<br/>
their parents' bedroom and peeking in the closet at the Christmas presents<br/>
long before the big event;-)<br/>
<br/>
You Houstonians are in for a real Halloween treat! This is a great park - I<br/>
couldn't believe that we were surrounded by suburbia. Beautiful big pines,<br/>
interesting trails along a creek, and we lucked out - the weather was<br/>
gorgeous...we actually even enjoyed our first encounter with the notorious<br/>
banana spiders! (Sorry, TeamKing - we really did think it was cute!!!)<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at the park around noon and found some great boxes: "WANTED: A<br/>
Few People.."(GREAT CARVING!), "Park Angel"(CAN'T BELIEVE HOW LONG THIS NEAT<br/>
BOX HAS BEEN AROUND), "Puppy Love"( GREAT HIDING SPOT), "True Goblin" ( WOW<br/>
- VERY CREATIVE IDEA AND STAMP), "Mr. Bones"(CLEVER, CLEVER SERIES- AND<br/>
GREAT CARVING)( 3 out of 4 boxes - couldn't find the 3rd), "Ghost of<br/>
John"(LOVED THESE CLUES!), and "I Love Bananas"( VERY COOL &amp; GREAT STAMP -<br/>
TEAMKING SCORES AGAIN!).<br/>
<br/>
Also, we left a ghostly guest for your Halloween activities - hope she won't<br/>
dampen your spirits...<groan>! <br/>
<br/>
Our only frustration was that we ran out of time and had to leave Telge<br/>
without hunting the remaining boxes - but we did meet up with TeamKing and<br/>
enjoyed a delightful visit with her - actually, we so enjoyed her that we<br/>
lost track of time and hit Houston traffic right at rush hour! Oh well - it<br/>
was worth it!<br/>
<br/>
We're driving back through Houston in early December, and really looking<br/>
forward to hitting the Woodlands boxes by RunsForChocolate!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all you Houstonian Haunters for the fun!<br/>
