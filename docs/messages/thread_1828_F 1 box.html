<div>I found it amusing that Ryan stated that the only two people who logged a find on this box did so to push up their numbers of finds. I was one of those two people, and my reason was to log a find on Atlas so I could qualify to receive clues, not to push my numbers up. What's funny is that last time I counted, I had well over 300 finds, and actually care very little about counts, but I didn't realize I had logged any previous finds with Atlas Quest. My bad!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to admit I was a little mad that he deleted the<br>
box without even asking first.  What if it was a real<br>
box with a "Dewberry" twist?<br>
Anyway, I kept my response to him civil and explained<br>
the reason behind the box.  And even though we still<br>
disagree on a few things, he is working on a way for<br>
those coming in from LBNA to be able to see F-1 clues<br>
without a logged find.  Not sure if it can be done, though.<br>
Right now the only way you can use the F-1 feature in AQ<br>
but still have the clue visible to LBNA users without logged<br>
finds in AQ is to post the clue separately in LBNA (don't<br>
use the box in AQ).  This is extra work, but will ensure<br>
everyone can see your clue.  Of course, this kind of <br>
defeats the purpose of using F-1 in the first place since<br>
search engines can now find your clue on LBNA.  But at<br>
least the one on AQ would be safe.  I like to think of<br>
LBNA as the main clue repository and AQ as the backup,<br>
but right now, many are doing it the other way.  Nothing<br>
wrong with that, but you may not be aware of problems<br>
like the F-1 affair in the future.  <br>
I've already spent way more time on this whole thing than<br>
I ever wanted to, but at least most of you know the<br>
situation now and will hopefully be more aware in the future.<br>
As for future boxers ...?<br>
