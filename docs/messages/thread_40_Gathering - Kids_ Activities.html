                    <div class="plaintext-content">My thoughts on kids' activities is to have an<br>
icebreaker or two, then let them do their thing as<br>
they want to do for awhile, then gather up those who<br>
want to do something else.  I'll have a few things<br>
available for those moments when things seem to going<br>
the wrong direction, and I'll bring some coloring<br>
sheets or quiet activities for the kids who need a<br>
little down time.<br>
<br>
I don't much care for gestapo-style activity planning,<br>
more of a laid back approach, but it sure is nice to<br>
have plans and back up plans when it comes to kids,<br>
then use what of them we need.<br>
<br>
Nice to hear there are some other older girls - a crew<br>
of three or four is nice for keeping a group of kids<br>
busy!<br>
