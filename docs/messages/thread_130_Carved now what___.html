chase and i carved a stamp with the intention of placing it in the <br/>
arboreteum in woodway-which is a suburb of waco, there are several <br/>
problems and i was wondering if you have any suggestions? <br/>
<br/>
1st a few weeks ago when we went out to hide the box there was a <br/>
function ie - wedding- going on and we could not get down the <br/>
trail.  yesterday we went and just really could not find a place we <br/>
felt good about the trail ends at a creek/clearing which is pretty  <br/>
nice but it wasn't very clean, cans, bottles, etc. could have been <br/>
from the heavy rain, not sure..<br/>
<br/>
so we consider hiding it elsewhere, BUT   the stamp is called april <br/>
showers bring may flowers no big deal right BUT i put woodway on <br/>
it??? for the life of me i can't find anywhere else to hide it there <br/>
are 2 other parks one with a cemetary but they just are too crowded <br/>
and maintained.. thought about asking the lady in the office at the <br/>
arboreteum about leaving it there in the office lost and found or <br/>
even in one of the maintained areas, should i go with the trail and <br/>
see what happens, i am afraid to try and remove woodway, hate to <br/>
waste good stamp?   <br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate any brilliant ideas..<br/>
<br/>
thanks<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Is the place so busy that it would be difficult for someone to find <br/>
the box unobserved and do the stamping?  If not, and it's a nice <br/>
place you want others to "discover", then go for it.  Can you make a <br/>
microbox or a smaller box in order to better conceal it?  As for the <br/>
trash, visit your box often and take a trashbag with you each time.  <br/>
We find that our favorite hiking trail accumulates trash even way <br/>
away from civilization, so we tuck shopping bags in our backpacks <br/>
and clear the trail on our way out.  Most people are careless slobs, <br/>
just a fact of life.<br/>
