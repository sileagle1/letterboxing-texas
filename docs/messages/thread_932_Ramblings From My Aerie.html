and vacations have put me behind.  I have finally<br>
browsed most of the posts over the last few weeks<br>
and will try to address several things in this one<br>
long post.<br>
<br>
Introduction:  Since there are so many new members<br>
on this list (welcome!), I guess I should introduce<br>
myself to them.  I live in Sugar Land and have been<br>
letterboxing almost 3 years now.  I have a wife and<br>
2 children, but they are nonboxers for the most part<br>
(though they will indulge me occasionally).  I have<br>
a website that includes all my LB clues, along with<br>
my Hitchhikers, Events, Series (groups of LB with<br>
the same theme, like Beer) and other LB links.  It<br>
can be found at:  http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/<br>
<br>
Events & Gatherings:  So far we have had 2 Texas Events,<br>
March, 2004 and March, 2005.  I plan to continue organizing<br>
these annual Texas-wide Events in the Spring of each year,<br>
but I'm starting to see interest in more frequent, smaller<br>
gatherings.  I don't have the time to organize them, but<br>
recommend anyone interested go ahead and do it.  Maybe<br>
each region of Texas could have its own Gathering in the<br>
fall so people would not have to drive as far to meet others.<br>
<br>
State Of TX Letterboxing:  I am very pleased to see how<br>
letterboxing continues to grow in our great state.  Somebody<br>
said in a post that Baby Bear and I must feel amazed how<br>
this hobby has taken off since we started so long ago, and<br>
they are correct.  In fact, I no longer feel like I must<br>
nurture TX Letterboxing to keep it going, it has grown up<br>
and become self-sufficient.  Thanks to all for making this<br>
happen and continue to be supportive of each other!<br>
