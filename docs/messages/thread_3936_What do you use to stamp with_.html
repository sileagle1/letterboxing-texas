<div>This brings up something I've been wondering 
about for a while.  I've had some nasty images in my logbook because 
previous boxers used metallic ink and didn't bother to clean it off 
afterward.  While discussing this with another boxer, I mentioned that 
I rarely carry stamp cleaner with me, and found it frustrating that the images 
were ruined by the metallic residue.  That boxer chastised me because, 
apparently, we are ALL supposed to be cleaning the ink off of the stamps...with 
cleaner....every time we stamp in.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> Now, I've heard that frequent use 
of stamp cleaner can ruin the rubber of a stamp.  I don't know if this 
is true, but I DO know that in order to "prime" the stamps that I carve, I stamp 
and let the ink dry, then repeat several times.  (A couple of stamp carving 
tutorials say the same thing.)  So, I assume that stamping in and leaving 
the ink (regular ol' ink) on the stamp isn't necessarily a bad thing.  I 
do, however, wipe each stamp with a paper towel when I'm done...or if I've 
forgotten a towel, I use my shirt.  (I only wear black, anyway. :-)  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Soooo, should we all be cleaning those 
stamps?  Should metallic users be cleaning them?  </div>

<div>I'm with Chrispy -- I love to see what happens when 
my ink mingles with the ink left behind by the previous stamper.  I 
especially like it when the stamp has metallic ink residue -- it makes a 
wonderful combined effect.  I do not care at all what color ink people use 
on my carves -- I'm thrilled when people find them at all!</div>
