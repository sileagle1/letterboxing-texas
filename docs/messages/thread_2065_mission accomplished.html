<div> </div>
<div>I was doing box maintenance while I planted my Girl Scout Series and sure enough, one of the boxes I checked appeared to be wedged deeply in the tree, if it was even there.  Lightning and I dug around in the V of that tree for half an hour trying to get all the "cover" material out just to figure out if the box was even there, all the while thinking one of those grabby thingies would've been real handy at the moment!  We finally decided it wasn't there - we got deep enough into our tree to figure out that it would've had to have literally swallowed the box if it was still there.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I started wondering - what would happen if a box was left long enough that a tree grew around it?  Can you imagine chopping down a tree 100 years in the future and finding a letterbox trapped inside?</div>
