On the plus side, we launched a new 'series' today. Its called 'Trivial <br>
Box Pursuit'. If you remember the Trivial Pursuit game, there are six <br>
categories you solve to get a piece of pie to win the game. We are <br>
placing six boxes in Memorial Park for each of the categories. Will try <br>
to get the clues into LBNA tonight, tomorrow at the latest. Keep your <br>
eye out for them.<br>

This sounds so cool - I'm a Trivial Pursuit fan, so I especially love this<br>
idea (but very poor at Sports questions, so I may need to bring one of the<br>
guys for outside assistance)! <br>
And I'm so sorry two of your boxes are missing - how disappointing and<br>
frustrating. <br>
