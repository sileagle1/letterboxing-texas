On the plus side, we launched a new 'series' today. Its called 'Trivial <br/>

categories you solve to get a piece of pie to win the game. We are <br/>
placing six boxes in Memorial Park for each of the categories. Will try <br/>
to get the clues into LBNA tonight, tomorrow at the latest. Keep your <br/>

This sounds so cool - I'm a Trivial Pursuit fan, so I especially love this<br/>
idea (but very poor at Sports questions, so I may need to bring one of the<br/>
guys for outside assistance)! <br/>
And I'm so sorry two of your boxes are missing - how disappointing and<br/>
frustrating. <br/>
