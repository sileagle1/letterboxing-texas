But, you can have a mini gathering anytime--it doesn't have be a<br/>
large, elaborate affair--just letterboxers getting together for a<br/>
picnic at a park, in a coffeehouse, or to exchance and greet over<br/>
pizza.  If you host one, you might get 5 local boxers or you might get<br/>
more people coming in from different areas of the state, depending on<br/>
what you set up.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you might get together with the few letterboxers in San Antonio,<br/>
and have one halfway between your cities. . .if it was a good weekend<br/>
for us, we'd definitely come in from Houston for an event in that area.  <br/>

                    <html><body><div>I can't imagine why you couldn't bring them, as long as you RSVP and remind them to bring food if the event is potluck (it has been in the past).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One thing to consider is that while the event is kid-friendly, it isn't kid-oriented.  In other words, kids are welcome, but it isn't centered around them, it's geared more toward adults.  As an example, I'll bring my homemade Bailey's Irish Cream, which has a little alcohol in it.  It isn't openly displayed, it's not made available to the kids, and it is low-key enough that I'm betting there are folks who never even knew it was around the last two years.  However, in Cub Scout world (which is where I live), it would be highly questionable under BSA guidelines whether I should promote attending a gathering as a scout event because alcohol would be there - I don't know how Girl Scout world would feel about that.  The kids always do have a good time though, passing cooties around and hanging out and it seems that they always wind up running together and getting along really well.  I know my son, Lightning, always looks forward to seeing his LB'ing friends like Ant Man and Clueless Collector and, more recently, Pablo,   They also go boxing with their families, or in your case with your troop.
