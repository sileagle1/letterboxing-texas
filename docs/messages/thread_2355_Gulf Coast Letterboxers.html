to be getting through the yahoo system, so I'm going to try again with<br>
a separate header.  If and when my other post comes through, well,<br>
you've heard from me twice.<br>
<br>
I think there's enough demonstrated interest to go ahead and start the<br>
group, so we've done so.  Sandibox has graciously agreed to be a<br>
co-moderator.  I'm still working on setting up the site, but I can<br>
verify that the message boards work!  There are a handful of us in<br>
there discussing the Candyland Gathering.  Feel free to come join us.  <br>

This list is an experiment.  We'll see how much it is used and allow<br>
it to run its natural course, whatever that may be.  Letterboxing has<br>
changed a lot in this area, and we have a whole slew of boxers with<br>
varying levels of activity.  I hope to reach out to some folks who<br>
currently don't participate on this list, but we'll see if there's<br>
interest.  My real hope is that in some way this sublist serves to<br>
strengthen the larger list.  For many, it seems more comfortable to<br>
join a smaller group, and then once you get to it, perhaps join in the<br>
state-wide list.  <br>
<br>
So, we'll see how it goes. . .<br>
