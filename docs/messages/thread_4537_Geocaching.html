keep your head in the sand so to speak for ever.  One day you will be

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Mike, I posted my first response before I read
yours, but let me say this: I agree with what you say, but what has worked for
you in El Paso, has not worked for me in East Texas. I have tried to open up a
dialog with Rangers in four state parks in my area and have been met mostly
with apathy. I have been told that I just need to permit my letterboxes, but
when I try to schedule a meeting, they are always too busy or refer me to an
underling who again brushes me off. It took me 3 months to get a permit for my
boxes at Huntsville State Park. I tried to explain why that wouldn't work for
most people and that if a permit was required, it should be granted (or not) in
a timely manner. I am aware that I don't have your presence and authority and
don't have as much in common with park rangers as you do, but they have not
been cooperative with me. To them, letterboxing is too trivial to be bothered
with. I have come prepared with a new letterbox to show them what a letterbox
looks like and how it can bring people to the park and most of them don't even
give me the courtesy of looking at it. If they won't talk to you, how can you
make them see the difference between a letterbox and a geocache? Would you be
willing, and I'm being serious, to represent letterboxing on a state level as
our liason to Texas Parks and Wildlife? <br/>

&gt; It had to happen - and I am glad to see it. It is up to us all to talk
with the<br/>
&gt; locals. Print out that article and schedule a meeting with the directors
in<br/>
&gt; your area. Meet with the regional director, and with the lead ranger of
each<br/>
&gt; park near you. Teach them the difference between a geocache and a
letterbox.<br/>
&gt; Especially the part about letterboxers being more eco-friendly and
conscious.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is important to open up a good friendly dialog now. If a park
experiences<br/>
&gt; any problems at all, they are less likely to ban these games altogether if
they<br/>
&gt; know some good people are involved in it and it was only one bad apple.
Some<br/>
&gt; people opt for stealth. And while it works for a while, eventually the
hide<br/>
&gt; will be found.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I can only give my own situation as an example. There are over 3 dozen<br/>
&gt; caches/boxes in the Franklin Mountains State Park. One cache was placed on
a<br/>
&gt; cliff. The cache owner was asked to move it and refused. Over several
months<br/>
&gt; it almost got into a court battle. Some of the rangers wanted to ban all<br/>
&gt; hide-games. Cooler heads prevailed because they knew it was only one<br/>
&gt; individual.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the end - it is up to you. That is ALL OF US.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I gotta throw in. And yeah, this is gonna be one of my adversarial sorts of posts - no offense intended - I just think it's time for a little self-examination.<br/><br/>If I remember correctly (Mike, correct me if I'm wrong), Mike worked his way in to the state parks by volunteering for them, first and foremost. He did trail maintenance and whatever other sorts of things Mike is good at that made park rangers like them. He did things for them that they needed to get done but didn't have the time to do, so when they saw him show up, they were glad to see him. <br/>
<br/>SO - FIRST QUESTION. How many of us who feel the state parks aren't responsive enough to letterboxers have actually gone and done non-letterboxing volunteer work for the state parks more than once in the last year? I have to confess - not me.<br/>
<br/>So let's say you are a Park Ranger, and every day you have dozens of demands on your attention - the bathroom near Site 15 doesn't work, someone saw a snake in the road near the fishing pier, Ranger Rick didn't show up for work, the Park Host had to pull out for a family emergency, there are two campers fighting over the last spot, someone just checked out and their campfire hasn't been extinguished, someone reported a tree across the trail on the perimeter trail but they couldn't tell us where, someone said an alligator ate their poodle, there's someone who calls herself BarefootLucy waiting for you needing a permit of some kind, and Mike just showed up and needs something to do. You, the Park Ranger, quickly evaluate all that - and first off, you know you can send Mike off to check the tree on the trail and maybe he can put the fire out at the campsite on the way, and you've instantly solved three pressing issues with one. Which of the remaining are safety-related? Which ones have a monetary impact on the park? Which ones affect staffing? Hmmm....well BarefootLucy is just going to have to wait until I get all these other things under control. And the poodle will have to be digested...<br/>
<br/>If you were a ranger faced with all of that, wouldn't you look first for the friendly face that you recognized as a volunteer and respond to them first? And wouldn't you be more likely to listen to that person's special request when things settled down? <br/>
<br/>We really don't need a state liaison because a policy is now in place. The work has been done at the state level and we were too late for it. Admittedly, the policy doesn't perfectly fit letterboxing, but it doesn't perfectly fit geocaching either. They didn't pass the policy for our (or geocachers) benefit, they passed it because they saw that we were creating an issue for them and they needed to address it. The best place for us to be is side-by-side with state parks, making ourselves personally known to their staff personally because what is now important is how the local park interprets and exercises the policy.<br/>
<br/>One reason geocaching has caught on and letterboxing hasn't, is that geocaching has certain rules in place that make them more responsible. They have the 1/10 rule. We do too I suppose - but where theirs is a 1/10 mile spread, ours is if 1 box is good, 10 is better. They have a stated Cache In Trash Out policy. We talk about it, but we don't as a larger group actively promote it and have special days for it. <br/>
<br/>As much as I hate to bring this up, one thing that always concerns me is the sheer volume of boxes we infuse into a park after a gathering. Is that cool? Is it okay? Are we taking into consideration the bigger picture of how we affect the park, or we only interested in our own entertainment? This is not accusatory - again, I'm looking for some self-examination.<br/>

<p>I gotta throw in.  And yeah, this is gonna be one of my adversarial
sorts of posts - no offense intended - I just think it's time for a little
self-examination.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly (Mike, correct me if I'm wrong), Mike worked his way in
to the state parks by volunteering for them, first and foremost.  He did
trail maintenance and whatever other sorts of things Mike is good at that made
park rangers like them.  He did things for them that they needed to get
done but didn't have the time to do, so when they saw him show up, they were
glad to see him.  <br/>
<br/>
SO - FIRST QUESTION. How many of us who feel the state parks aren't responsive
enough to letterboxers have actually gone and done non-letterboxing volunteer
work for the state parks more than once in the last year?  I have to
confess - not me.<br/>
<br/>
So let's say you are a Park Ranger, and every day you have dozens of demands on
your attention - the bathroom near Site 15 doesn't work, someone saw a snake in
the road near the fishing pier, Ranger Rick didn't show up for work, the Park
Host had to pull out for a family emergency, there are two campers fighting
over the last spot, someone just checked out and their campfire hasn't been
extinguished, someone reported a tree across the trail on the perimeter trail
but they couldn't tell us where, someone said an alligator ate their poodle,
there's someone who calls herself BarefootLucy waiting for you needing a permit
of some kind, and Mike just showed up and needs something to do.  You, the
Park Ranger, quickly evaluate all that - and first off, you know you can send
Mike off to check the tree on the trail and maybe he can put the fire out at the
campsite on the way, and you've instantly solved three pressing issues with
one.  Which of the remaining are safety-related?  Which ones have a
monetary impact on the park?  Which ones affect staffing? 
Hmmm....well BarefootLucy is just going to have to wait until I get all these
other things under control.  And the poodle will have to be digested...<br/>
<br/>
If you were a ranger faced with all of that, wouldn't you look first for the
friendly face that you recognized as a volunteer and respond to them
first?  And wouldn't you be more likely to listen to that person's special
request when things settled down?  <br/>
<br/>
We really don't need a state liaison because a policy is now in place. 
The work has been done at the state level and we were too late for it. 
Admittedly, the policy doesn't perfectly fit letterboxing, but it doesn't
perfectly fit geocaching either.  They didn't pass the policy for our (or
geocachers) benefit, they passed it because they saw that we were creating an
issue for them and they needed to address it.  The best place for us to be
is side-by-side with state parks, making ourselves personally known to their
staff personally because what is now important is how the local park interprets
and exercises the policy.<br/>
<br/>
One reason geocaching has caught on and letterboxing hasn't, is that geocaching
has certain rules in place that make them more responsible.  They have the
1/10 rule.  We  do too I suppose - but where theirs is a 1/10 mile
spread, ours is if 1 box is good, 10 is better.  They have a stated Cache
In Trash Out policy.  We talk about it, but we don't as a larger group
actively promote it and have special days for it.  <br/>
<br/>
As much as I hate to bring this up, one thing that always concerns me is the
sheer volume of boxes we infuse into a park after a gathering.  Is that
cool?  Is it okay?  Are we taking into consideration the bigger
picture of how we affect the park, or we only interested in our own
entertainment?  This is not accusatory - again, I'm looking for some
self-examination.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of a gathering, we should have a Local State Park day where we
all go to our nearest state parks and volunteer.  Maybe we should get in
the habit of volunteering at our state parks.  <br/>
<br/>
Dunno.  I think instead of complaining that they don't respect us, we
should begin respecting ourselves a little more and doing things that make us
better stewards of the facilities where we box.  It's not gonna happen
overnight that they'll embrace us, but maybe once we get ourselves noticed,
they'll take an interest in us, and maybe once that happens, permitting will
get easier and we can have an impact on the policy itself.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I'm done.  I fully expect a range of disagreement, and I'm good
with that.  My purpose in writing is not to get everyone to agree with me,
but to get everyone to think beyond the fact that the rangers won't play with
us.  <br/>

                    <html><body><p>Okay. I just can't stand it. I have to ask...<br/><br/>I have been known to paint my nails, but you wouldn't find them painted on a regular basis. Now what does that have to do with anything?<br/><br/>Speaking of dogs, Dvir had some volunteer hours he has to do for his Citizenship in the Community merit badge. Since no one takes volunteers under 16 without a parent present, and since Fearless Fox is up to his eyeballs in the latest theatre production this weekend, I found myself also doing volunteer hours today. Dvir chose to volunteer at our local no-kill animal shelter and as it happens, they had an animal fair today at the local park. Gotta admit - it wouldn't have hurt my feelings if it had been raining today, but it wasn't, so we got dressed and rolled out to the park to see what we would be doing. <br/>
<br/>Our job turned out to be handing out balloons to litlte kids, which I found ironic since balloons can do so much damage to wild animals that encounter balloons. To make up for it, I tied the balloons extra tight around the kids' wrists. Still though - we saw several floaters. Oh well. People were also allowed to bring their own dogs on leashes so they could get shots or try their legs out at the Agility training demo, or just basically see what was going on. We found that lots of dogs are really good at getting their leashes free from their owners' hands, so we spent more than a little time helping to chase dogs with loose leashes while dragging our balloons along behind - the balloon gig turned out to be a little more complicated than we expected.<br/>
<br/>I saw a French bulldog, which looks like a Pug with long legs. We saw a Mastiff with a thankfully fast master, since the dog led the way most of the time. Thankfully, he was friendly. We saw a Great Dane and Mike, we thought about you. I asked the lady about the dog, and while she claimed he was full blood, he didn't have the sharp clean lines your dogs have. Maybe it was poor diet or old age, I don't know. At any rate, he was a really nice dog, very well-behaved, although he seemed to get a little irritated that his mistress spend most of her time on her cell phone. That'd irritate me too. We got to visit with a girl who had a Great Pyrennes, the same type dog my in-laws have with their goats. They are positively fascinating dogs, and his owner was very proud of him. We had a really hard time getting away from her because she could have talked forever about her dog.<br/>
<br/>They also had a sheep-herding exhibit which was fascinating. It just goes to prove that one very intelligent animal can control a large group of less intelligent animals quite easily. Sort of a political statement, if you ask me, but perhaps we should leave that alone.<br/>
<br/>Finally, someone from a horse rescue was there and they brought several horses out to give rides or be petted or whatever. They also had three goats, an American Pony (I was quickly corrected when I called him a Shetland Pony), a miniature horse, two donkeys, and a sheep with really thick fur - so thick I couldn't reach to the skin. The sheep had been attacked by a llama and had been badly injured (make notes - if you are ever asked to bet on a fight between a llama and a sheep, bet on the llama), so she walked on her first joints in her back legs. I don't think very highly of llamas now. I also don't think very highly of one of the donkeys, who sneaked up on me while I was petting the sheep and was playing with my finger with his lip. Thankfully, I had half a thought on him and was able to save my finger in a split second when I felt teeth closing down on it. By the time I got home it was really swollen, so I asked Fearless Fox to kiss it. He did before he asked what happened. He was less than impress that I had asked him to kiss donkey spit. Oh well. It still hurt after he kissed it anyway!<br/>

<br>
Ok  painting nails.<br>
<br>
Charlie East (KA5SRB) is probably a millionaire  but you wouldnt know it to<br>
see him.  If you just met him you would think he is trailer trash.  But he lives<br>
his life as he wants to and has no worries.  He has a small ranch, and he can<br>
step out his trailer door and test his latest ammo ideas without any trouble.<br>
He was also my partner at work until he retired, and much of my investing<br>
success is due to his teachings.  I dont have 1 million put away  yet.  But it<br>
could still get there in the next 10 years.<br>
<br>
Anyway  Charlie has had a little trouble with women.  One day he told me  If<br>
she paints her nails, it aint going to work.<br>
<br>
Huh???  So he explained  pretty women that paint their nails often are also<br>
usually high-maintenance women.  They mostly need money and attention.  Women<br>
who do not paint their nails except once in a while are usually more<br>
self-sufficient, and can be counted on to hold their own when things get hard.<br>
<br>
Looking back on my experience with various girlfriends, I had to concur.<br>
Generally speaking - there ARE exceptions.  The really pretty ones with painted<br>
nails were not as much fun to be with as the others.<br>
<br>
BTW  one of the first dates with my wife  we got separated in a mud bog in<br>
Germany.  Long story  but she doesnt paint her nails, she is a ham, she<br>
shoots, hikes, and does many of the things I like to do.  And she LOVES dogs.<br>
<br>
Anyway<br>
<br>
Before anyone jumps out of their skin, this is my experience and yours may not<br>
parallel mine.  But I would much rather have a companion that hikes with me<br>
instead of one that sits at home complaining that I went hiking instead of<br>
shopping.   Just in case my wife ever reads this  thank you for being you.<br>

 <br>
Okay. I just can't stand it. I have to ask...<br>
<br>
I have been known to paint my nails, but you wouldn't find them painted on a<br>
regular basis. Now what does that have to do with anything?<br>
<br>
Speaking of dogs, Dvir had some volunteer hours he has to do for his Citizenship<br>
in the Community merit badge. Since no one takes volunteers under 16 without a<br>
parent present, and since Fearless Fox is up to his eyeballs in the latest<br>
theatre production this weekend, I found myself also doing volunteer hours<br>
today. Dvir chose to volunteer at our local no-kill animal shelter and as it<br>
happens, they had an animal fair today at the local park. Gotta admit - it<br>
wouldn't have hurt my feelings if it had been raining today, but it wasn't, so<br>
we got dressed and rolled out to the park to see what we would be doing. <br>
<br>
Our job turned out to be handing out balloons to litlte kids, which I found<br>
ironic since balloons can do so much damage to wild animals that encounter<br>
balloons. To make up for it, I tied the balloons extra tight around the kids'<br>
wrists. Still though - we saw several floaters. Oh well. People were also<br>
allowed to bring their own dogs on leashes so they could get shots or try their<br>
legs out at the Agility training demo, or just basically see what was going on.<br>
We found that lots of dogs are really good at getting their leashes free from<br>
their owners' hands, so we spent more than a little time helping to chase dogs<br>
with loose leashes while dragging our balloons along behind - the balloon gig<br>
turned out to be a little more complicated than we expected.<br>
<br>
I saw a French bulldog, which looks like a Pug with long legs. We saw a Mastiff<br>
with a thankfully fast master, since the dog led the way most of the time.<br>
Thankfully, he was friendly. We saw a Great Dane and Mike, we thought about<br>
you. I asked the lady about the dog, and while she claimed he was full blood,<br>
he didn't have the sharp clean lines your dogs have. Maybe it was poor diet or<br>
old age, I don't know. At any rate, he was a really nice dog, very<br>
well-behaved, although he seemed to get a little irritated that his mistress<br>
spend most of her time on her cell phone. That'd irritate me too. We got to<br>
visit with a girl who had a Great Pyrennes, the same type dog my in-laws have<br>
with their goats. They are positively fascinating dogs, and his owner was very<br>
proud of him. We had a really hard time getting away from her because she could<br>
have talked forever about her dog.<br>
<br>
They also had a sheep-herding exhibit which was fascinating. It just goes to<br>
prove that one very intelligent animal can control a large group of less<br>
intelligent animals quite easily. Sort of a political statement, if you ask me,<br>
but perhaps we should leave that alone.<br>
<br>
Finally, someone from a horse rescue was there and they brought several horses<br>
out to give rides or be petted or whatever. They also had three goats, an<br>
American Pony (I was quickly corrected when I called him a Shetland Pony), a<br>
miniature horse, two donkeys, and a sheep with really thick fur - so thick I<br>
couldn't reach to the skin. The sheep had been attacked by a llama and had been<br>
badly injured (make notes - if you are ever asked to bet on a fight between a<br>
llama and a sheep, bet on the llama), so she walked on her first joints in her<br>
back legs. I don't think very highly of llamas now. I also don't think very<br>
highly of one of the donkeys, who sneaked up on me while I was petting the sheep<br>
and was playing with my finger with his lip. Thankfully, I had half a thought<br>
on him and was able to save my finger in a split second when I felt teeth<br>
closing down on it. By the time I got home it was really swollen, so I asked<br>
Fearless Fox to kiss it. He did before he asked what happened. He was less<br>
than impress that I had asked him to kiss donkey spit. Oh well. It still hurt<br>
after he kissed it anyway!<br>
<br>
If I had had my stamp ready for the Circus, it would have been a great day to<br>
place it at Nichols Green. I don't think the menagerie and its throngs would<br>
have thought twice about the wild and woolly circus creatures. And I think that<br>
donkey would've tried to join the circus....<br>

<div><font size="2">Today was Ker Plunk in Plano. That's the annual (semi-annual since they do it after labor day also) day the city opens the large municipal swimming pool to the dogs before they drain and clean it for the upcoming season. It's the most fun, entertaining event! Picture about 200+ dogs running, swimming, diving, splashing chasing tennis balls and frisbees. There's every kind of dog imaginable from wonderful mutts to mastiffs, purebreds and Heinz 57s - all having the time of their lives! My favorite last fall was an overweight English Bulldog wearing a life jacket. The retrievers are usually the predominate breed in attendance, but there's shepherds and poodles and beagles. It's the liveliest, silliest thing you'd ever hope to see. I usually take about 300 pictures. My lab, Dakota, is still sleeping. She could barely show interest when we cooked out on the grill. She's worn totally out from two hours of swimming!</font></div>

<p><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Okay.  I just can't stand it.  I
have to ask...<br/>
<br/>
I have been known to paint my nails, but you wouldn't find them painted on a
regular basis.  Now what does that have to do with anything?<br/>
<br/>
Speaking of dogs, Dvir had some volunteer hours he has to do for his
Citizenship in the Community merit badge.  Since no one takes volunteers
under 16 without a parent present, and since Fearless Fox is up to his eyeballs
in the latest theatre production this weekend, I found myself also doing
volunteer hours today.  Dvir chose to volunteer at our local no-kill
animal shelter and as it happens, they had an animal fair today at the local
park.  Gotta admit - it wouldn't have hurt my feelings if it had been
raining today, but it wasn't, so we got dressed and rolled out to the park to
see what we would be doing.  <br/>
<br/>
Our job turned out to be handing out balloons to litlte kids, which I found
ironic since balloons can do so much damage to wild animals that encounter
balloons.  To make up for it, I tied the balloons extra tight around the
kids' wrists.  Still though - we saw several floaters.  Oh
well.  People were also allowed to bring their own dogs on leashes so they
could get shots or try their legs out at the Agility training demo, or just
basically see what was going on.  We found that lots of dogs are really
good at getting their leashes free from their owners' hands, so we spent more
than a little time helping to chase dogs with loose leashes while dragging our
balloons along behind - the balloon gig turned out to be a little more
complicated than we expected.<br/>
<br/>
I saw a French bulldog, which looks like a Pug with long legs.  We saw a
Mastiff with a thankfully fast master, since the dog led the way most of the
time.  Thankfully, he was friendly.  We saw a Great Dane and Mike, we
thought about you.  I asked the lady about the dog, and while she claimed
he was full blood, he didn't have the sharp clean lines your dogs have. 
Maybe it was poor diet or old age, I don't know.  At any rate, he was a
really nice dog, very well-behaved,  although he seemed to get a little
irritated that his mistress spend most of her time on her cell phone. 
That'd irritate me too.  We got to visit with a girl who had a Great Pyrennes,
the same type dog my in-laws have with their goats.  They are positively
fascinating dogs, and his owner was very proud of him.  We had a really
hard time getting away from her because she could have talked forever about her
dog.<br/>
<br/>
They also had a sheep-herding exhibit which was fascinating.  It just goes
to prove that one very intelligent animal can control a large group of less
intelligent animals quite easily.  Sort of a political statement, if you
ask me, but perhaps we should leave that alone.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, someone from a horse rescue was there and they brought several horses
out to give rides or be petted or whatever.  They also had three goats, an
American Pony (I was quickly corrected when I called him a Shetland Pony), a
miniature horse, two donkeys, and a sheep with really thick fur - so thick I
couldn't reach to the skin.  The sheep had been attacked by a llama and
had been badly injured (make notes - if you are ever asked to bet on a fight
between a llama and a sheep, bet on the llama), so she walked on her first
joints in her back legs.  I don't think very highly of llamas now.  I
also don't think very highly of one of the donkeys, who sneaked up on me while
I was petting the sheep and was playing with my finger with his lip. 
Thankfully, I had half a thought on him and was able to save my finger in a
split second when I felt teeth closing down on it. By the time I got home it
was really swollen, so I asked Fearless Fox to kiss it.  He did before he
asked what happened.  He was less than impress that I had asked him to
kiss donkey spit.  Oh well.  It still hurt after he kissed it anyway!<br/>
<br/>
If I had had my stamp ready for the Circus, it would have been a great day to
place it at Nichols Green.  I don't think the menagerie and its throngs
would have thought twice about the wild and woolly circus creatures.  And
I think that donkey would've tried to join the circus....<br/>

<div>I gotta throw in.  And yeah, this is gonna be one of my adversarial sorts of posts - no offense intended - I just think it's time for a little self-examination.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly (Mike, correct me if I'm wrong), Mike worked his way in to the state parks by volunteering for them, first and foremost.  He did trail maintenance and whatever other sorts of things Mike is good at that made park rangers like them.  He did things for them that they needed to get done but didn't have the time to do, so when they saw him show up, they were glad to see him.  <br/>
<br/>
SO - FIRST QUESTION. How many of us who feel the state parks aren't responsive enough to letterboxers have actually gone and done non-letterboxing volunteer work for the state parks more than once in the last year?  I have to confess - not me.<br/>
<br/>
So let's say you are a Park Ranger, and every day you have dozens of demands on your attention - the bathroom near Site 15 doesn't work, someone saw a snake in the road near the fishing pier, Ranger Rick didn't show up for work, the Park Host had to pull out for a family emergency, there are two campers fighting over the last spot, someone just checked out and their campfire hasn't been extinguished, someone reported a tree across the trail on the perimeter trail but they couldn't tell us where, someone said an alligator ate their poodle, there's someone who calls herself BarefootLucy waiting for you needing a permit of some kind, and Mike just showed up and needs something to do.  You, the Park Ranger, quickly evaluate all that - and first off, you know you can send Mike off to check the tree on the trail and maybe he can put the fire out at the campsite on the way, and you've instantly solved three pressing issues with one.  Which of the remaining are safety-related?  Which ones have a monetary impact on the park?  Which ones affect staffing?  Hmmm....well BarefootLucy is just going to have to wait until I get all these other things under control.  And the poodle will have to be digested...<br/>
<br/>
If you were a ranger faced with all of that, wouldn't you look first for the friendly face that you recognized as a volunteer and respond to them first?  And wouldn't you be more likely to listen to that person's special request when things settled down?  <br/>
<br/>
We really don't need a state liaison because a policy is now in place.  The work has been done at the state level and we were too late for it.  Admittedly, the policy doesn't perfectly fit letterboxing, but it doesn't perfectly fit geocaching either.  They didn't pass the policy for our (or geocachers) benefit, they passed it because they saw that we were creating an issue for them and they needed to address it.  The best place for us to be is side-by-side with state parks, making ourselves personally known to their staff personally because what is now important is how the local park interprets and exercises the policy.<br/>
<br/>
One reason geocaching has caught on and letterboxing hasn't, is that geocaching has certain rules in place that make them more responsible.  They have the 1/10 rule.  We  do too I suppose - but where theirs is a 1/10 mile spread, ours is if 1 box is good, 10 is better.  They have a stated Cache In Trash Out policy.  We talk about it, but we don't as a larger group actively promote it and have special days for it.  <br/>
<br/>
As much as I hate to bring this up, one thing that always concerns me is the sheer volume of boxes we infuse into a park after a gathering.  Is that cool?  Is it okay?  Are we taking into consideration the bigger picture of how we affect the park, or we only interested in our own entertainment?  This is not accusatory - again, I'm looking for some self-examination.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of a gathering, we should have a Local State Park day where we all go to our nearest state parks and volunteer.  Maybe we should get in the habit of volunteering at our state parks.  <br/>
<br/>
Dunno.  I think instead of complaining that they don't respect us, we should begin respecting ourselves a little more and doing things that make us better stewards of the facilities where we box.  It's not gonna happen overnight that they'll embrace us, but maybe once we get ourselves noticed, they'll take an interest in us, and maybe once that happens, permitting will get easier and we can have an impact on the policy itself.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I'm done.  I fully expect a range of disagreement, and I'm good with that.  My purpose in writing is not to get everyone to agree with me, but to get everyone to think beyond the fact that the rangers won't play with us.  <br/>

wondered what happened to all those boxes when the party was over.  I would
never accuse anyone of littering… but it is possible to have too much of a good
thing.  This is why there is only ONE letterbox in Hueco Tanks State Park.  It
is an eco-sensitive area and sometimes less is more.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

did work for me.  That is all I can say.  But I would be happier to see an
organized effort to clean up a park at the gathering rather than flooding it
with boxes.  And let the staff know who you are and why you are there.  Even
ask them to suggest an area that needs special attention.  Make them happy to

color:black'>I gotta throw in.  And yeah, this is gonna be one of my
adversarial sorts of posts - no offense intended - I just think it's time for a
little self-examination.<br/>
<br/>
If I remember correctly (Mike, correct me if I'm wrong), Mike worked his way in
to the state parks by volunteering for them, first and foremost.  He did
trail maintenance and whatever other sorts of things Mike is good at that made
park rangers like them.  He did things for them that they needed to get
done but didn't have the time to do, so when they saw him show up, they were
glad to see him.  <br/>
<br/>
SO - FIRST QUESTION. How many of us who feel the state parks aren't responsive
enough to letterboxers have actually gone and done non-letterboxing volunteer
work for the state parks more than once in the last year?  I have to
confess - not me.<br/>
<br/>
So let's say you are a Park Ranger, and every day you have dozens of demands on
your attention - the bathroom near Site 15 doesn't work, someone saw a snake in
the road near the fishing pier, Ranger Rick didn't show up for work, the Park
Host had to pull out for a family emergency, there are two campers fighting
over the last spot, someone just checked out and their campfire hasn't been
extinguished, someone reported a tree across the trail on the perimeter trail
but they couldn't tell us where, someone said an alligator ate their poodle,
there's someone who calls herself BarefootLucy waiting for you needing a permit
of some kind, and Mike just showed up and needs something to do.  You, the
Park Ranger, quickly evaluate all that - and first off, you know you can send
Mike off to check the tree on the trail and maybe he can put the fire out at
the campsite on the way, and you've instantly solved three pressing issues with
one.  Which of the remaining are safety-related?  Which ones have a
monetary impact on the park?  Which ones affect staffing? 
Hmmm....well BarefootLucy is just going to have to wait until I get all these
other things under control.  And the poodle will have to be digested...<br/>
<br/>
If you were a ranger faced with all of that, wouldn't you look first for the
friendly face that you recognized as a volunteer and respond to them
first?  And wouldn't you be more likely to listen to that person's special
request when things settled down?  <br/>
<br/>
We really don't need a state liaison because a policy is now in place. 
The work has been done at the state level and we were too late for it. 
Admittedly, the policy doesn't perfectly fit letterboxing, but it doesn't
perfectly fit geocaching either.  They didn't pass the policy for our (or
geocachers) benefit, they passed it because they saw that we were creating an
issue for them and they needed to address it.  The best place for us to be
is side-by-side with state parks, making ourselves personally known to their
staff personally because what is now important is how the local park interprets
and exercises the policy.<br/>
<br/>
One reason geocaching has caught on and letterboxing hasn't, is that geocaching
has certain rules in place that make them more responsible.  They have the
1/10 rule.  We  do too I suppose - but where theirs is a 1/10 mile
spread, ours is if 1 box is good, 10 is better.  They have a stated Cache
In Trash Out policy.  We talk about it, but we don't as a larger group
actively promote it and have special days for it.  <br/>
<br/>
As much as I hate to bring this up, one thing that always concerns me is the
sheer volume of boxes we infuse into a park after a gathering.  Is that
cool?  Is it okay?  Are we taking into consideration the bigger
picture of how we affect the park, or we only interested in our own
entertainment?  This is not accusatory - again, I'm looking for some self-examination.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe instead of a gathering, we should have a Local State Park day where we
all go to our nearest state parks and volunteer.  Maybe we should get in
the habit of volunteering at our state parks.  <br/>
<br/>
Dunno.  I think instead of complaining that they don't respect us, we
should begin respecting ourselves a little more and doing things that make us
better stewards of the facilities where we box.  It's not gonna happen
overnight that they'll embrace us, but maybe once we get ourselves noticed,
they'll take an interest in us, and maybe once that happens, permitting will
get easier and we can have an impact on the policy itself.<br/>
<br/>
So I guess I'm done.  I fully expect a range of disagreement, and I'm good
with that.  My purpose in writing is not to get everyone to agree with me,
but to get everyone to think beyond the fact that the rangers won't play with
us.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I didn't want to intrude on the mutual admiration thing you and Lucy had going :)  However, I can tell you what happens to those letterboxes after an event:  they remain there for the enjoyment of letterboxers and future letterboxers.  There have been 7 Texas Annual Letterboxing Events, six of them in State Parks.  There are still letterboxes at Brazos Bend SP, the site of the first event, six years later, and they are still being found, and the same is true for other parks that have hosted events.  As far as I know, there have been no problems, from the park's perspective, with those letterboxes.  I would say that they are not even aware of them, which speaks well to the placement of the boxes.  I have found letterboxers to be considerate of the parks and most make it a point to pick up trash as they walk the trails, evidenced by the fact that the park is always cleaner when we leave than it was when we arrived.  Silver Eagle and Baby Bear always make sure that the pavilion area is cleaner than they found it, and encourage us to Leave No Trace, while enjoying the game of letterboxing.  What would a letterboxing event be without letterboxing?  I have visited parks on a Monday and found them trashed after a weekend of picnicking, fishing, biking, etc.  I don't think that happens after a letterboxing event.  We appreciate your great life experiences, Mike, and the efforts you make for letterboxing in your area, and we all know and admire the rescue you made of the Hueco Tanks letterbox.  However important and historical that box is, however, I don't believe anyone has ever gone and found it, other than you, because of its inaccessibility.  I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong.  My point is that you are much more experienced than the rest of us when it comes to guns and dogs and geocaching, but I dare say that many of us are more experienced in Texas letterboxing, at least the part of Texas east of El Paso.  What works for you in your area, doesn't necessarily work for us.  Some of are even happy to practice the sport as it was meant to be practiced, with stealth and mystery, and without fanfare.  I'm going to get quiet again and this will be my last word on the subject.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Late to the party on this one, but here is my two cents.   <br>
<br>
I agree with Mike, Boots, Silver Eagle and most of what BFL said below.  But, the fact that I pay taxes (alot of Taxes) which should be used to fund the parks but because the lawmakers decide to waste the money the parks don't get the money, is not my problem.  I vote accordingly, but obviously got out voted in last elections which is now destroying my business and ability to fund charitable organizations such as the parks.  I have had a State Park pass the last 10 years, and National Park passes for the last 15.  I support the parks monetarily via usage of campgrounds and lodges, though the prices have tripled in the last 5 years.  I give to the National Park Foundation and the Nature Conservancy.   Basically what I am saying is some of us may have time to spend volunteering, and some of us provide the money to pay their bills.   End result is the parks are run poorly, like anything the government runs, and this is not going to change anytime soon.    I spent last weekend at Potter's Creek campground on Canyon Lake which is not park of the park system.  The campground was clean, well kept, clean bathrooms, showers that work, policed well, friendly staff, plenty of staff, efficient.   Wow, this sounds negative....sorry.   I love the parks, just very upset with the whole system.   As for letterboxes in the parks, I honestly have started trying to find other places to hide my boxes, which will lead to less visitation from me, and any potential finders of my boxes.  With all that said, maybe the answer for state parks and national parks will be virtual boxes, where you lead someone to a site, get them to email you what they found at that site, then you email them an image of the stamp you would have hidden in that park at that site. I will add that at the 8th Annual Tale we will have a Trash pick up agenda as part of the event, with prizes for the most trash collected (PS - other people's letterboxes are not trash....except IRA's boxes).     Interesting topic, which I'm sure will be an ongoing concern. <br>

<p class="MsoNormal">  Late to the party on this one, but here is my two
cents. <br/>
<br/>
I agree with Mike, Boots, Silver Eagle and most of what BFL said below. But,
the fact that I pay taxes (alot of Taxes) which should be used to fund the
parks but because the lawmakers decide to waste the money the parks don't get
the money, is not my problem. I vote accordingly, but obviously got out voted
in last elections which is now destroying my business and ability to fund
charitable organizations such as the parks. <span style="color:green"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Rgr that!!!  Don’t feel like the lone ranger.  (no
pun intended).<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">I have had a State Park pass the last 10 years,
and National Park passes for the last 15. I support the parks monetarily via
usage of campgrounds and lodges, though the prices have tripled in the last 5
years. I give to the National Park Foundation and the Nature Conservancy.
Basically what I am saying is some of us may have time to spend volunteering,
and some of us provide the money to pay their bills. <span style="color:green"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Both are necessary – and appreciated.  I fear prices
will continue to rise while our pay becomes worth less and less.  But that
is for another time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">End result is the parks are run poorly, like
anything the government runs, and this is not going to change anytime soon. <span style="color:green"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Rgr that!  But it isn’t usually the local
rangers.  They are being forced to do more with less just like all of
us.  The old saying – when you are up to your butt in alligators, it
is hard t find the plug for draining the swamp.  They work on the most pressing
problems and worry about the rest later.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Wow, this sounds negative....sorry. <span style="color:green"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Heh heh heh – join the club……<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">With all that said, maybe the answer for state
parks and national parks will be virtual boxes, where you lead someone to a
site, get them to email you what they found at that site, then you email them

color:green'>Not sure that is the answer either.  But eventually there is
going to be some kind of limit.  Geocachers use 1/10<sup>th</sup> of a
mile.  Letterboxers use????  This was never a problem before, but
letterboxing is growing.  A little thinking ahead now might make things
simpler later.  And it certainly isn’t going to become a national
standard – there is no all-encompassing group like geocaching.com for
letterboxers.  People will just need to police themselves.  Or not –
depending on how they feel about it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">I will add that at the 8th Annual Tale we will
have a Trash pick up agenda as part of the event, with prizes for the most
trash collected (PS - other people's letterboxes are not trash....except IRA's
boxes). <span style="color:green"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>A GREAT idea.  Another thought….  Talk to the lead
ranger of the park ahead of time.  Tell them about the trash event, and
ask them if they have a particular area than needs picking-up, and where you
can safely dump several bags of trash.  That WILL (should) make a good
impression for Letterboxing.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Interesting topic, which I'm sure will be an
ongoing concern. <span style="color:white"><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>The point I think Lucy was trying to get across is that there is a
lot of talk about it becoming more difficult to get hides in state parks –
and maybe it is time to think about what could make it better. 
Self-policing is better than a decree from the state every time.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>I didn't want to intrude on the mutual admiration thing you and Lucy had going :) However, I can tell you what happens to those letterboxes after an event: they remain there for the enjoyment of letterboxers and future letterboxers. There have been 7 Texas Annual Letterboxing Events, six of them in State Parks. There are still letterboxes at Brazos Bend SP, the site of the first event, six years later, and they are still being found, and the same is true for other parks that have hosted events. As far as I know, there have been no problems, from the park's perspective, with those letterboxes. I would say that they are not even aware of them, which speaks well to the placement of the boxes. I have found letterboxers to be considerate of the parks and most make it a point to pick up trash as they walk the trails, evidenced by the fact that the park is always cleaner when we leave than it was when we arrived. Silver Eagle and Baby Bear always make sure that the pavilion area is cleaner than they found it, and encourage us to Leave No Trace, while enjoying the game of letterboxing. What would a letterboxing event be without letterboxing? I have visited parks on a Monday and found them trashed after a weekend of picnicking, fishing, biking, etc. I don't think that happens after a letterboxing event. We appreciate your great life experiences, Mike, and the efforts you make for letterboxing in your area, and we all know and admire the rescue you made of the Hueco Tanks letterbox. However important and historical that box is, however, I don't believe anyone has ever gone and found it, other than you, because of its inaccessibility. I'm sure you'll correct me if I'm wrong. My point is that you are much more experienced than the rest of us when it comes to guns and dogs and geocaching, but I dare say that many of us are more experienced in Texas letterboxing, at least the part of Texas east of El Paso. What works for you in your area, doesn't necessarily work for us. Some of are even happy to practice the sport as it was meant to be practiced, with stealth and mystery, and without fanfare. I'm going to get quiet again and this will be my last word on the subject.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Mike Olbrisch" &lt;mike-2007@.<wbr>..&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Oh " I think the gatherings are wonderful. But I have always wondered what happened to all those boxes when the party was over. I would never accuse anyone of littering… but it is possible to have too much of a good thing. This is why there is only ONE letterbox in Hueco Tanks State Park. It is an eco-sensitive area and sometimes less is more.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Everyone must do what they think it best. It wasn’t easy " but it did work for me. That is all I can say. But I would be happier to see an organized effort to clean up a park at the gathering rather than flooding it with boxes. And let the staff know who you are and why you are there. Even ask them to suggest an area that needs special attention. Make them happy to say there is a group of letterboxers coming to visit.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Well " enough. It got awful quiet out here when Lucy sent her post.

We need to get more involved to keep the parks. As budget cuts are being made the Parks dept is taking a hit. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I am a life-long girl scout, for my troops, we have a rule on hikes. We take a small bag for garbage and pick up any we see along the trail while we hike. It does not take much to do and it helps everyone in the long run. you might be amazed at what you find along the trail. We would always joke that a "wild" coke can could grow and survvive in the "harsh wilderness".<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; NLW<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -----Original Message-----<br/>&gt; From: Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@<wbr>...&gt;<br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a><br/>&gt; Sent: Sat, May 1, 2010 5:04 pm<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Geocaching<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I gotta throw in. And yeah, this is gonna be one of my adversarial sorts of posts - no offense intended - I just think it's time for a little self-examination.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If I remember correctly (Mike, correct me if I'm wrong), Mike worked his way in to the state parks by volunteering for them, first and foremost. He did trail maintenance and whatever other sorts of things Mike is good at that made park rangers like them. He did things for them that they needed to get done but didn't have the time to do, so when they saw him show up, they were glad to see him. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; SO - FIRST QUESTION. How many of us who feel the state parks aren't responsive enough to letterboxers have actually gone and done non-letterboxing volunteer work for the state parks more than once in the last year? I have to confess - not me.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So let's say you are a Park Ranger, and every day you have dozens of demands on your attention - the bathroom near Site 15 doesn't work, someone saw a snake in the road near the fishing pier, Ranger Rick didn't show up for work, the Park Host had to pull out for a family emergency, there are two campers fighting over the last spot, someone just checked out and their campfire hasn't been extinguished, someone reported a tree across the trail on the perimeter trail but they couldn't tell us where, someone said an alligator ate their poodle, there's someone who calls herself BarefootLucy waiting for you needing a permit of some kind, and Mike just showed up and needs something to do. You, the Park Ranger, quickly evaluate all that - and first off, you know you can send Mike off to check the tree on the trail and maybe he can put the fire out at the campsite on the way, and you've instantly solved three pressing issues with one. Which of the remaining are safety-related? Which ones have a monetary impact on the park? Which ones affect staffing? Hmmm....well BarefootLucy is just going to have to wait until I get all these other things under control. And the poodle will have to be digested...<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If you were a ranger faced with all of that, wouldn't you look first for the friendly face that you recognized as a volunteer and respond to them first? And wouldn't you be more likely to listen to that person's special request when things settled down? <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We really don't need a state liaison because a policy is now in place. The work has been done at the state level and we were too late for it. Admittedly, the policy doesn't perfectly fit letterboxing, but it doesn't perfectly fit geocaching either. They didn't pass the policy for our (or geocachers) benefit, they passed it because they saw that we were creating an issue for them and they needed to address it. The best place for us to be is side-by-side with state parks, making ourselves personally known to their staff personally because what is now important is how the local park interprets and exercises the policy.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; One reason geocaching has caught on and letterboxing hasn't, is that geocaching has certain rules in place that make them more responsible. They have the 1/10 rule. We do too I suppose - but where theirs is a 1/10 mile spread, ours is if 1 box is good, 10 is better. They have a stated Cache In Trash Out policy. We talk about it, but we don't as a larger group actively promote it and have special days for it. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; As much as I hate to bring this up, one thing that always concerns me is the sheer volume of boxes we infuse into a park after a gathering. Is that cool? Is it okay? Are we taking into consideration the bigger picture of how we affect the park, or we only interested in our own entertainment? This is not accusatory - again, I'm looking for some self-examination.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Maybe instead of a gathering, we should have a Local State Park day where we all go to our nearest state parks and volunteer. Maybe we should get in the habit of volunteering at our state parks. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Dunno. I think instead of complaining that they don't respect us, we should begin respecting ourselves a little more and doing things that make us better stewards of the facilities where we box. It's not gonna happen overnight that they'll embrace us, but maybe once we get ourselves noticed, they'll take an interest in us, and maybe once that happens, permitting will get easier and we can have an impact on the policy itself.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So I guess I'm done. I fully expect a range of disagreement, and I'm good with that. My purpose in writing is not to get everyone to agree with me, but to get everyone to think beyond the fact that the rangers won't play with us. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></p></div></font><!-- end group email --></blockquote></body></html>
