Park for a bit yesterday, dragging along one kid with strep throat<br/>
(mine) and one kid in a backpack (hers).  My Houston Hills was in the<br/>
wrong spot, so it's been replaced in the proper tree.  I now<br/>
understand why people were finding it by accident.  But, after being<br/>
completely out of its hiding place twice, I'm just glad it's still alive.<br/>
<br/>
I am considering hosting a low-key boxing morning the day after the<br/>
Great Book Adventure.  It's to show off my favorite spot in Houston,<br/>
Memorial Park, simply because I love it so much.  Memorial Park is<br/>
about 40 minutes away from Tomball, much more inside Houston, and is<br/>
really a great urban park.  So, if you're up for some boxing that<br/>
morning, let me know (there's a public golf course there if some of<br/>
your party would rather do that while others golf).  The park is about<br/>
5 minutes from my house, much easier for me than the trek to Tomball<br/>
(but the opposite problem for you if you're staying in Tomball).  I<br/>
will plant about a half-dozen boxes for that day, bring the Kolaches<br/>
and the coffee, plus carve another event stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
This will be VERY low-key.  I will just grab a few tables in the<br/>
picnic area as a place to deposit clue sheets and breakfast. .<br/>
.nothing else planned (well, maybe a few surprises depending on energy<br/>
level).   If you're interested, sign up on Atlasquest.  If there's no<br/>
interest, I'll sleep in!<br/>

<br/>
I will compile a list of Memorial Park boxes if there's interest, so<br/>
that you can print out clues before you come.  TeamKing's Trivial<br/>
Pursuit series is there. . .and that's a really fun one!<br/>
