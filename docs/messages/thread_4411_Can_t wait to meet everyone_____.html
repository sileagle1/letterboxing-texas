Can't wait to meet everyone, it will be great to put some faces with trail names!  This will be my first gathering, so I am a little boggled not only by the bounty of boxes to be found, but also the  Exchanges (still haven't figured that out) and  Personal Travelers (working on those). It promises to be an exciting day.....<br/>
