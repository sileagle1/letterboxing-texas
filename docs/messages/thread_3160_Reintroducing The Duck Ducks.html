                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, now that I've posted a few comments and gotten some feedback <br/>
I'll answer some questions.<br/>
<br/>
We box as husband Jeff, wife Tara and daughter 3.  Yes, for you more <br/>
experienced boxers, we are very careful with the 3 year old.  She <br/>
and I stay in the truck more often than not.  Don't want to spoil <br/>
anyone's box or secret.  Her part is getting to press the stamp into <br/>
our logbook...she thinks that's just the greatest and then we feel <br/>
she can't hurt, damage or lose any part of a box.  So yes, we have a <br/>
great amount of respect for your treasures.<br/>
We live in Quinlan which is southern Hunt county.  Very few boxes in <br/>
the immediate area.  There are a few listed in Greenville, but of <br/>
the 4 we were only able to find one.  We did contact the placer and <br/>
never heard back.  One of very first finds was one placed by <br/>
Stargazer, Nana's Hummingbird...very nice.  I think that was <br/>
probably the one that got my husband hooked or maybe it was Adams <br/>
Trail - Celebrate Our Military Day.<br/>
We chose our trail name because our daughter collects those little <br/>
rubber ducks with different outfits on.  She must have a hundred and <br/>
still collecting.<br/>
My parents have a lakehouse in Tool Texas so we tend to box a lot in <br/>
Henderson County...Thank you Adams Trail for providing so many for <br/>
us.  <br/>
As I said my husband is an experienced Scouter.  He reached the rank <br/>
of Life before quitting as a child.  I started my son at Tiger and <br/>
Dad took over when he crossed over to Boy Scouts.  His son started <br/>
as a Bear.  Both boys made it to Life before teenage wonders took <br/>
over and they gave up.  We belonged to Troop 312 out of Royse City.  <br/>
(Which is debatable as to whether it was the  first troop in Texas <br/>
or not)...this particular troop and my husband made camping a <br/>
priority.  Camping at least once a month was required.  My husband <br/>
filled the role of Assistant Scout Master for 4-5 years.  They went <br/>
to all the local camps and Camp Hale in Oklahoma.  We highly <br/>
recommend Camp Hale.  They also did many weekend camps at various <br/>
places.<br/>
My kids are now daughter 21, son 20, daughter 18 and son 18 plus the <br/>
baby 3.  We only have the 18 year old son and baby at home.  He is <br/>
senior this year and because of his football schedule we haven't had <br/>
a lot of time to box lately.  The only out of town game that had <br/>
boxes was Farmersville and we were almost late getting the blow up <br/>
tunnel to the game because we just had to get Brother Ben and The <br/>
Quilter's Cross before it got dark.<br/>
We also find we like to box in more rural areas...haven't tried any <br/>
in Dallas...we just don't like the city.<br/>
We have not planted any yet.  Maybe that "itch" is what we've been <br/>
waiting for deep down.  I do plan on buying him the Carving Block <br/>
sampler pack and the Speed ball Stamp carving kit for <br/>
Christmas...any recommendations on these or other items.   He has <br/>
been fiddling with little pink erasers so far.<br/>
When we go boxing it seems to be very spur of the moment jump in the <br/>
truck and take off for the weekend.  No preplanning.  We usually <br/>
stay at hotels that have a computer we can access to get more clues <br/>
that we may not have printed yet.  Where do most of y'all <br/>
stay...camping or hotels?<br/>
We missed the meet in Eustace a few weeks back...it taught me to <br/>
check these posts more often.  But we are planning on attending the <br/>
March meet and looking forward to it.<br/>
I think that covers everything but if anyone has any tips or ideas <br/>
they want to throw out there we are open to listening.  <br/>
Thanks...everyone seems to be very friendly and welcoming and thus <br/>
far we have had nothing but wonderful experiences.  Thanks to all!<br/>

<div></div>
<div>You might be surprised to discover just where "in the city" some of those 
boxes are - surprisingly, there are lots of nature centers, nature trails, 
wildlife and bird refuge areas, not to mention some really nice large parks 
in urban areas, many of which have been discovered by letterboxers who 
previously didn't know they existed, and of course, there are lakeshore trails 
all around Lake Grapevine and other lakes that have been swallowed up in recent 
years by urbanization, but still remain woodsy and rural.  Don't overlook 
Collin Co., Dallas Co., Tarrant Co., and Denton Co. - they may be large urban 
now, but they still have some lovely wild places and lots of historical and 
interesting places where letterboxes can be found!   Even most 
suburban areas now have at least a greenbelt and nature trail, if not a larger 
nature center to discover.  That's the beauty of letterboxing -- you never 
know what you'll discover along the way!</div>

<div>Hi, Janet.  </div>
<div>Since I retired that one, I've had thoughts of planting another there just 
because it's such a pretty place and mostly undiscovered, but haven't done so 
yet.  There aren't that many good locations there that aren't susceptible 
to flooding; when it rains, those ponds join into a large flat lake, and the 
creek runs really full.  But I'm still thinking about possibilities and 
have an idea.  However, if you want to plant one there, go ahead!  
Then I can find it.</div>
