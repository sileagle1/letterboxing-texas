                    <div class="plaintext-content">It was about 11:45am and I was just getting my inhome daycare kids ready for some grub and a nap, when my phone beeped at me. I decided to pick it up and read my new email. WHAT??????  The circus is in town today. I love the circus!!!  I quickly called Easterbelle, who like me was at work!!  I told her to grab her keys and go see the circus because there was only going to be one show today. She said, "Dang, I'm not allowed to take comp time the first day of the 9 week period and grades are due today!" We chatting for a few more minutes before hanging up. 1 minute after my phone rang again. It was Easterbelle, she got permission to take an hour off. She told me to throw on my shoes because she was coming over to look after the kids. She knew how much I love going to the circus. We also knew that the circus would be starting soon. Since the show had only one ticket left before it was sold out for the day, and we just knew we weren't the only people in town who wanted that ticket, we thought it would be best if I made the dash for the show. After all I've been known to have a led foot. Not to mention, my black Friday skills of pushing and shoving might come in handy lol.  Easterbelle left work and I knew I only had 10 minutes to diaper the kids after lunch and put them down for nap. I didn't want her to have to do it. Plus I'm a diaper changing queen.  Then I thought, "dang it, I haven't even put on making let alone showered today!!" I sure didn't want to run the risk of being mistaken for a circus clown instead of a Princess. I had five minutes left before Easterbelle arrived. I told the kids a naptime story, while slapping on some makeup and brushing my locks. Here came Easterbelle to watch the kids and the mad dash in the car was on!!  As I ran up the entrance to the center, I caught eye of someone behind me. Thought to myself, "Oh no you don't. I just know I'm faster on my feet then you.". Luckly he didn't want to see the circus thank goodness. I swear I felt like I was a contestant on the amazing race.  To my excitement I rounded the last bend to buy my circus ticket and all the elephants, clowns, bears, lions, sord swallowers, fire breathers, tight rope walkers ECT came running down the trail towards me!!  Thought to myself, "Damn, these guys are gonna plow me over,". There're so many of them!  I guess they were ready to get on with the show. They all jumped in my arms and came home with me, after all, They wanted to give Easterbelle a private show. I'm sure they will be coming to a town you y'all soon:-) <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Remember the Circus box should not to be handed to other poeple, so need to hide and let finder get.   As for bringing to TALE, this box is NOT to be shared at TALE.   Whomever does have the Circus at the time of TALE, and if they are going to attend, needs to email me offline to discuss options for letting persons whom have found before a chance to update with current additions.  Just wanted to make this clear to everyone (though you proabaly already know all this).   FYI.<br>
