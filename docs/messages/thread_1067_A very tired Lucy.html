                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I did it.  I went out and letterboxed all day<br>
long!  In spite of the heat (y'all KNOW I'm not a fan<br>
of Texas summers)!  My LSS finally adopted a trail<br>
name, Fearless Fox, after his Wood Badge patrol<br>
(that's a scout thing).  My son, Lightning, went along<br>
and was quite a trooper!  Only one missing was Elmo,<br>
but I guess I'm going to have to get used to that -<br>
{{sigh}}.<br>
<br>
We planted three new boxes and found four, and dropped<br>
a couple hitchhikers along the way.<br>
<br>
Status:<br>
<br>
Planted: <br>
A Tribute to the Iron Ore Mines in Reklaw<br>
Lost Rose near Mt Enterprise<br>
Go Jacks! in Nacogdoches<br>
<br>
Found, all in Nacogdoches:<br>
My Buddy List<br>
Recycle<br>
Naturally Musical<br>
Sam I Am<br>
<br>
Hitchhikers that are on the loose again are <br>
<br>
Foot Steppin'<br>
Little Boy's Sports Cap<br>
<br>
We had an awesome day even though we really, really<br>
smell bad!  I think I sweated from 8 a.m. until about<br>
a half hour ago!  And I STILL smell like Off.<br>
<br>
For those of you unfamiliar with Nacogdoches, there<br>
are tons of great restaurants there, but I always find<br>
myself drawn back to Yakofritz.  It opened when I was<br>
going to college at SFA and was a favorite restaurant<br>
of mine back then.  I still really like it - it's<br>
right downtown on Highway 21.  You don't get a big<br>
meal there, but it is downright tasty.  And frankly,<br>
who wants a big meal when you're pounding the trails?<br>
<br>
Also, the SFA Experimental Forest is a classy (pun<br>
intended) operation.  To get there follow Silver<br>
Eagle's clues to Sam I Am.  Texas has some of the best<br>
state parks of any state, but this SFA facility tops<br>
our state parks as far as a good solid basic hike<br>
goes.  It is an educational facility for forestry<br>
students at the university, but it is open to the<br>
public - although it isn't widely known by the public.<br>
 Go some time!<br>
