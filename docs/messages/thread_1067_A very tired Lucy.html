                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I did it.  I went out and letterboxed all day<br/>
long!  In spite of the heat (y'all KNOW I'm not a fan<br/>
of Texas summers)!  My LSS finally adopted a trail<br/>
name, Fearless Fox, after his Wood Badge patrol<br/>
(that's a scout thing).  My son, Lightning, went along<br/>
and was quite a trooper!  Only one missing was Elmo,<br/>
but I guess I'm going to have to get used to that -<br/>
{{sigh}}.<br/>
<br/>
We planted three new boxes and found four, and dropped<br/>
a couple hitchhikers along the way.<br/>

Planted: <br/>
A Tribute to the Iron Ore Mines in Reklaw<br/>
Lost Rose near Mt Enterprise<br/>
Go Jacks! in Nacogdoches<br/>
<br/>
Found, all in Nacogdoches:<br/>
My Buddy List<br/>
Recycle<br/>
Naturally Musical<br/>
Sam I Am<br/>
<br/>
Hitchhikers that are on the loose again are <br/>
<br/>
Foot Steppin'<br/>
Little Boy's Sports Cap<br/>
<br/>
We had an awesome day even though we really, really<br/>
smell bad!  I think I sweated from 8 a.m. until about<br/>
a half hour ago!  And I STILL smell like Off.<br/>
<br/>
For those of you unfamiliar with Nacogdoches, there<br/>
are tons of great restaurants there, but I always find<br/>
myself drawn back to Yakofritz.  It opened when I was<br/>
going to college at SFA and was a favorite restaurant<br/>
of mine back then.  I still really like it - it's<br/>
right downtown on Highway 21.  You don't get a big<br/>
meal there, but it is downright tasty.  And frankly,<br/>
who wants a big meal when you're pounding the trails?<br/>
<br/>
Also, the SFA Experimental Forest is a classy (pun<br/>
intended) operation.  To get there follow Silver<br/>
Eagle's clues to Sam I Am.  Texas has some of the best<br/>
state parks of any state, but this SFA facility tops<br/>
our state parks as far as a good solid basic hike<br/>
goes.  It is an educational facility for forestry<br/>
students at the university, but it is open to the<br/>
public - although it isn't widely known by the public.<br/>
 Go some time!<br/>
