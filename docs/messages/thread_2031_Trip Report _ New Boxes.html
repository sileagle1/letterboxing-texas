                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from vacation with the family in Arkansas and it <br/>
turned out nice, especially since I threw it together in less than a <br/>
week.  We were going to Utah on a 2 week trip, but the thought of <br/>
all that driving lost its appeal and I scrambled to find somewhere <br/>
else to go that would be fairly close but new.  I have been to <br/>
Arkansas before, but it has been a long time and thought it would <br/>
fit the bill.<br/>
<br/>
I picked a few places I liked from previous visits (Queen Wilhelmina <br/>
SP, Mt. Magazine, Mt. Nebo SP &amp; Petit Jean SP) and added a few more <br/>
(wine country around Altus, De Gray SP).  I was able to book <br/>
everything except Queen Wilhelmina, so had to look for an <br/>
alternative place to stay in the area.  Well, I planned to drive up <br/>
through eastern Oklahoma so we could go on part of the Talimena <br/>
Scenic Byway, a beautiful drive into Arkansas, and I had looked to <br/>
see if there were any letterboxes in that area.  Sure enough, I <br/>
found 8 boxes hidden in a place called Beavers Bend Resort Park, and <br/>
it sounded so good I booked it.  Another example of letterboxing <br/>
taking me to great places I never heard of before.<br/>
<br/>
We made it as far as Mt. Pleasant, TX the first day and I managed to <br/>
get a few boxes along the way.  I finally had a chance to visit <br/>
Killough Monument, and even though the stamp was missing from the <br/>
box, it was still worth a visit and I thank BL for taking us there.<br/>
Next we went to Kiepersol Winery south of Tyler and enjoyed a little <br/>
of the grape.  It is a nice place with a B&amp;B if you want a romantic <br/>
weekend.  We then visited the Rose Garden in Tyler where we saw more <br/>
types and colors of roses than I had ever seen, so I placed a box.<br/>
I then found the boxes in Tyler SP and was very impressed with that <br/>
park.  In fact, we ended up staying quite a while and swimming in <br/>
the lake at the swim beach.  The only downside to this was I missed <br/>
going to the Tiger Refuge, but maybe next time.  As we rolled into <br/>
Mt. Pleasant and found a motel, I noticed a strange smell.  I asked <br/>
the clerk and she said it was the smell of chickens from the <br/>
Pilgrim's Pride plant in town.  Sounds like a box opportunity to me, <br/>
but boy what a smell!<br/>
<br/>
The next day we stopped in De Kalb, TX to see the grave of Dan <br/>
Blocker (Hoss) and hide another box, then on to Beavers Bend, OK.<br/>
What a neat place with much to do.  We went to the nature center, <br/>
swam in the river, did bumber boats, rode horses and enjoyed the <br/>
view of the lake from the lodge.  I managed to find 7 out of 8 boxes <br/>
and hid one of my own.<br/>
<br/>
The next day we drove the Talimena Scenic Byway from OK to AR, and I <br/>
placed 2 boxes, one in each state.  On one of the trails we saw the <br/>
most amazing thing; walking stick bugs dropping from trees by the <br/>
hundreds!  I have only seen a few walking sticks before so this was <br/>
really cool.  We then stopped at Queen Wilhelmina for lunch and it <br/>
offered a beautiful view.  I had camped there with Baby Bear many <br/>
years ago, but fog had kept me from enjoying the view, so I was glad <br/>
to get another chance.  From there it was north to Mt. Magazine, the <br/>
highest point in AR.  I had been there before, but now there is a <br/>
new SP and Lodge up on top and they have done a great job.  We had a <br/>
third floor balcony room overlooking the valley below where we <br/>
sipped wine while watching the sunset (kids gone to the game room).  <br/>
I only wish I had booked more than 1 night here!<br/>
<br/>
We stayed as late as we could before checking out, vowing to return <br/>
soon, and headed north to Altus and 4 wineries.  Our favorite ones <br/>
ended up being Post Familie, where they offered grape juice tasting <br/>
to our kids while we wine tasted, and Chateua Aux Arc.  After buying <br/>
a few bottles we headed for Mt. Nebo SP.  We had a cabin with a nice <br/>
view, though not quite as nice as Mt. Magazine, but more privacy.  <br/>
We hiked and mountain biked and swam in the pool, so it was another <br/>
hit with us.<br/>
<br/>
Next was Petit Jean SP, which I remembered as a great park.  <br/>
Unfortunately, I have never gone in the summer, so it was less than <br/>
expected, especially after the great places we just came from.  It <br/>
was just too hot to hike and the waterfall was dried up, plus I <br/>
couldn't find the only box left in the park (Baby Bear's) so I <br/>
missed my only chance to find an AR box.  I did hide one of my own <br/>
just outside the park.  I recommend going to this park only in <br/>
spring or fall.<br/>
<br/>
The next day we drove through Hot Springs and spent some time there <br/>
before arriving at De Gray SP.  It is a nice place, but requires a <br/>
boat to fully enjoy it, and they are expensive and hard to rent.  <br/>
They did have some fun activities like an owl prowl one night and a <br/>
hayride followed by square dancing the next night.  You should have <br/>
seen my daughter and I cutting a rug at the dance!<br/>
<br/>
The last day found us driving home with stops in Jefferson, Marshall<br/>
and Lufkin.  My wife and I really liked the town of Jefferson and <br/>
she shopped while I found and placed a box.  I missed the other box <br/>
there because I felt bad looking under rocks in a private yard, but<br/>
enjoyed the other one.  In Marshall we stopped at the big pottery <br/>
store and my wife bought a few, then we stopped in Tatum so I could <br/>
find the 2 boxes there.  I did not have time to go for all the boxes<br/>
in Martin Creek SP, so will have to come back again.  The final stop <br/>
was in Lufkin, where I hid a new box to replace the old Lufkin <br/>
Lookout.  I recently found out about a new set of TX Wildlife Trails <br/>
and this box is the first in my newest series dedicated to them.<br/>
<br/>
I highly recommend this trip, or parts of it, to anyone wanting to <br/>
get away for awhile but not drive too far.  Unfortunately, there is <br/>
a scarcity of boxes in that area, but I added a few to help out.  In <br/>
fact, I almost placed (9) more than I found (16) on this trip.  <br/>
Since LBNA is down, I will include the links to these 9 new boxes <br/>
here in case anyone wants to get started right away.<br/>
