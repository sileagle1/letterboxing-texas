Thanks for the kind words!<br>

I'm glad everyone has their different styles in boxing - whether in  <br>
placing or finding. The more and more boxes I find, the more you  <br>
really get to know everyone from a long distance kind of thing. I  <br>
used to really hate urban boxes that were really public. I was  <br>
convinced that EVERYONE could see me getting it and I would ruin (or  <br>
cause ruin) to someone's box. But as I have gotten more boxes, I have  <br>
found no one is really looking at you. Just be casual and re-hide as  <br>
well or better than you found it. Seems to work for me. I am  <br>
sometimes surprised at the choices for hiding places I come across,  <br>
but then I think about my own boxes and figure someone out there  <br>
probably thinks the same about them.  As time goes on, I think people  <br>
will improve their hiding spots. It may take boxes to come up missing  <br>
for someone before they improve on their hiding places, but to each  <br>
his own.<br>
<br>
I still can't believe that Old Town Spring box is still there! It was  <br>
so urban and barely hid (in my opinion) that I figured it for a short  <br>
timer (but I wanted that location, so I just went with it). Even so,  <br>
it has obviously stuck in your head as one you remember.<br>
<br>
Those are the boxes I like best.<br>
