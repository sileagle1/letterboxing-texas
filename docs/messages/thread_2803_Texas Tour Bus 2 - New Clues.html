street park.<br/>

Location:  11th Street Park--11th &amp; Shelterwood, Houston, TX<br/>
Directions:  From I-10, take the TC Jester exit and head north.  At <br/>
11th street, go left a few blocks to the park.  If you turn onto <br/>
Shelterwood, you can find a nice shady spot.<br/>
<br/>
Note that the signs about the park needing to be saved are being <br/>
taken down.  Yeah!  The park will remain an undeveloped preserve!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the butterfly garden at the corner of 11th and shelterwood, <br/>
walk <br/>
&gt; to the tree line and go left (parallel to 11th street).  At the <br/>
first <br/>
&gt; entrance trail, go right, into the heart of the park.  You will <br/>
&gt; quickly pass a wooden sign post.  At the T, go left.  At the Y, go <br/>
&gt; right.  At the next intersection, take the grassy path left-ish...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 70 steps down this path (to the left) is an ENORMOUS pine tree.  If <br/>
&gt; you're facing it, go to the left side.  Look left to two small <br/>
trees <br/>
&gt; right nearby.  The TTB2 is between these, covered in some forest <br/>
&gt; rubble, trying to look inconspicuous.  It is a BIG box...you'll <br/>
look <br/>
&gt; pregnant if you put it in your shirt trying to leave the park.  <br/>
