Sorry - but I got to share this one too.  I will go away now.<br>
<br>
Mike - El Paso.<br>
<br>
<br>
When memorial day mattered <br>
<br>
Cemetery Escort Duty - I just wanted to get the day over with and go down to<br>
Smokey's for a few cold ones. Sneaking a look at my watch, I saw the time, 1655.<br>
Five minutes to go before the cemetery gates are closed for the day. Full dress<br>
was hot in the sun. Oklahoma summertime was as bad as ever -- the heat and<br>
humidity at the same level -- both too high. I saw the car pull into the drive,<br>
'69 or '70 model Cadillac Deville, looked factory-new. It pulled into the<br>
parking lot at a snail's pace. An old woman got out so slow I thought she was<br>
paralyzed. She had a cane and a sheaf of flowers, about four or five bunches as<br>
best I could tell. I couldn't help myself. The thought came unwanted, and left a<br>
slightly bitter taste: "She's going to spend an hour, and for this old soldier<br>
my hip hurts like hell and I'm ready to get out of here right now!" <br>
<br>
But for this day my duty was to assist anyone coming in. Kevin would lock the<br>
"In" gate and if I could hurry the old biddy along , we might make the last half<br>
of happy hour at Smokey's. <br>
<br>
I broke Post Attention. My hip made gritty noises when I took the first step and<br>
the pain went up a notch. I must have made a real military sight; middle-aged<br>
man with a small pot-gut and half a limp, in Marine Full Dress Uniform, which<br>
had lost its razor crease about 30 minutes after I began the watch at the<br>
cemetery. <br>
<br>
I stopped in front of her, halfway up the walk. She looked up at me with an old<br>
woman's squint. "Ma'am may I assist you in any way?" She took long enough to<br>
answer. "Yes, son. Can you carry these flowers? I seem to be moving a tad s low<br>
these days." "My pleasure Ma'am." Well, it wasn't too much of a lie. She looked<br>
again. "Marine, where were you stationed?" " Vietnam , Ma'am. Ground-pounder.<br>
'69 to '71." She looked at me closer. "Wounded in action, I see. Well done,<br>
Marine I'll be as quick as I can." I lied a little bigger "No hurry, Ma'am." She<br>
smiled, and winked at me. "Son, I'm 85-years old and I can tell a lie from a<br>
long way off. Let's get this done. Might be the last time I can do this. <br>
<br>
My name's Joanne Wieserman, and I've a few Marines I'd like to see one more<br>
time." "Yes, Ma'am. At your service." She headed for the World War I section,<br>
stopping at a stone. She picked one of the bunches out of my arm and laid it on<br>
top of the stone. <br>
<br>
She murmured something I couldn't quite make out. The name on the marble was<br>
Donald S. Davidson, USMC, France 1918. She turned away and made a straight line<br>
for the World War II section, stopping at one stone. I saw a tear slowly<br>
tracking its way down her cheek. She put a bunch on a stone; the name was<br>
Stephen X. Davidson, USMC, 1943. She went up the row a ways and laid another<br>
bunch on a stone, Stanley J. Wieserman USMC , 1944. She paused for a second,<br>
"Two more, son, and we'll be done" I almost didn't say anything, but, "Yes,<br>
Ma'am. Take your time." She looked confused. "Where's the Vietnam section, son?<br>
I seem to have lost my way." I pointed with my chin. "That way, Ma'am." "Oh!"<br>
she chuckled quietly. "Son, me and old age ain't too friendly." She headed down<br>
the walk I'd pointed at. She stopped at a couple of stones before she found the<br>
ones she wanted. She placed a bunch on Larry Wieserman USMC, 1968, and the last<br>
on Darrel Wieserman USMC, 1970. She stood there and murmured a few words I still<br>
couldn't make out. "OK, son , I'm finished. Get me back to my car and you can go<br>
home." "Yes, Ma'am. If I may ask, were those your kinfolk ?" She paused. "Yes,<br>
Donald Davidson was my father; Stephen was my uncle; Stanley was my husband;<br>
Larry and Darrel were our sons. All killed in action, all Marines." <br>
<br>
She stopped, whether she had finished, or couldn't finish, I don't know. She<br>
made her way to her car, slowly, and painfully. I waited for a polite distance<br>
to come between us and then double-timed it over to Kevin waiting by the car.<br>
"Get to the "Out"-gate quick. I have something I've got to do." Kevin started to<br>
say something but saw the look I gave him. He broke the rules to get us there<br>
down the service road. We beat her. She hadn't made it around the rotunda yet.<br>
"Kevin, stand to attention next to the gate post. Follow my lead." I humped it<br>
across the drive to the other post. When the Cadillac came puttering around from<br>
the hedges and began the short straight traverse to the gate, I called in my<br>
best gunny's voice: "TehenHut! Present Haaaarms!" <br>
<br>
I have to hand it to Kevin, he never blinked an eye; full dress attention and a<br>
salute that would make his DI proud. She drove through that gate with two old<br>
worn-out soldiers giving her a send off she deserved, for service rendered to<br>
her country, and for knowing Duty, Honor and Sacrifice <br>
<br>
I am not sure, but I think I saw a salute returned from that Cadillac. Instead<br>
of "The End".... just think of "Taps". As a final thought on my part, let me<br>
share a favorite prayer: "Lord, keep our servicemen and women safe, whether they<br>
serve at home or over seas. Hold them in Your loving hands and protect them as<br>
they protect us." <br>
<br>
Let's all keep those currently serving and those who have gone before, in our<br>
thoughts. They are the reason for the many freedoms we enjoy. <br>
<br>
"In God We Trust" <br>

Sorry about your monitor, it made mine blurry too!<br>

safeguard our freedom.<br>
Recently, Bird Dog and I were in Tyler area for week of l'boxing, the <br>
best way I know to R&R. So happens that Saturday was the grand <br>
opening of the Tyler Aircraft Museum in the old Airport Terminal. We <br>
lay aside the stamps and logbook to partake of our 2nd favorite <br>
sport, looking at old airplanes. It was a beautiful, windy morning, <br>
with WWII spitfires, Vietnam helicopters, jets of every shape and <br>
size. And lots of veterans. It is always an honor to shake their <br>
hands and thank them for their service.<br>
The biggest honor came when we saw a very old veteran surrounded by a <br>
small crowd. As we approached and listened to his gravely voice, and <br>
looked at the pictures he was displaying, we discovered he was a <br>
survivor of the Batan Death March. We stood in rapt awe as he related <br>
his experience, and showed pictures taken both before (wonderful <br>
group shots of young soldiers laughing amongst jungle growth) and <br>
after they had been rescued (gaunt, emaciated...and yet still <br>
laughing with joy at having survived). Tears came as he pointed out <br>
those in the first pictures who didn't survive. Lives lost on our <br>
behalf. <br>
It was a stark moment for me, bringing to reality the sacrifice of <br>
our brave men and women in arms.<br>
I shall never forget the honor I felt and the tears that came as I <br>
shook his hand. <br>
We will fly the flag in your honor, we will remember what you did on <br>
our behalf, we will tell our children's children.<br>
