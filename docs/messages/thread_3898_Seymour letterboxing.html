has yielded a response:<br/>
<br/>
"Message: <br/>
I teach 6, 7, and 8th grade Gifted and Talented students. I am <br/>
interested in more information about letterboxing and looking for <br/>
someone to speak to my students.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!"<br/>
<br/>
I assume she found my letterbox.  I replied, giving some information <br/>
and inviting the responder to join this group.  Is anyone passing <br/>
through Seymour who would volunteer to stop and speak to this group of <br/>
students?<br/>

So what's wrong with sandwiches? I mean they bring happiness to lots of <br/>
people. Why, my grandson's day wouldn't be complete with out his PBJ <br/>
sandwich in his lunch box. Come to think of it, his name is Benjamin, <br/>
so he must be one of those Benjaminites you were referring to. Will the <br/>
insults ever end?<br/>

Benjamin is a very nice little town, the county seat of Knox County, <br/>
the seedless watermelon capitol of the world.  Also, it's home to the <br/>
official photographer of the State of Texas, Wyman Meinzer, who has <br/>
converted the old jail into his home.  Don't y'all ever read your <br/>
letterboxes?  They could be very educational  :)<br/>

<br/>
So what's wrong with sandwiches? I mean they bring happiness to lots of <br/>
people. Why, my grandson's day wouldn't be complete with out his PBJ <br/>
sandwich in his lunch box. Come to think of it, his name is Benjamin, <br/>
so he must be one of those Benjaminites you were referring to. Will the <br/>
insults ever end?<br/>
