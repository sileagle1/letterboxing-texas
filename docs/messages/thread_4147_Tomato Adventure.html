It's located just North of Jacksonville on HWY 69. There are several boxes there you can stamp in , but the location is amazing! You will enjoy the view even if you don't get the boxes.<br/>

Puddle Splasher....glad you made back home. I stopped back by the fest and bought tomatoes too. They are the best!<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I am so glad everyone got to come! I had a lot of fun too. The only thing I wish is that they would move this festival to - say - November, and then it would be a lot MORE fun!<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Frost Maiden, who accompanied Gryzzled Gryphon. However, he has apparently thoroughly indoctrinated her into his secrecy, so that no information was forthcoming from her that would spill the beans about either of them. So while we know the persona, we still know nothing further about the man himself, or about the woman who attended with the man (okay well, I managed to get one little detail about her, but was stumped how to get more...)<br/>
<br/>It was also a pleasure to meet Beach Bum and her daughter, Pink Cookie. They teamed up with Maydelle Queen Bee and PrincessA and hit the ground at full speed. They obviously enjoy each other's company and enjoy letterboxing together. They were great fun.<br/>
<br/>And then there was the formidable team of Blue Butterfly, Lucy Locket, Puddle Splasher, and my mom, NacTrailCat. Oh my!<br/><br/>Got to meet JBK's mother, who makes AWESOME brownies! May I have the recipe? They really were good! She was quite a trooper, but not much on the heat (I sympathize). And JBK learned that she can no longer turn on a dime...(sorry you hurt your knee)!<br/>
<br/>PurpleNic made it after all, with Lady Bug Tree. They were also not fans of the heat, but they persevered and managed to find all the boxes. It was a pleasure to see them again, after the Lindale gathering. <br/><br/>
And finally, Adams Trails opted to stay out of the fray and find other boxes around town. We met up with them at Legends and got to visit with them. <br/><br/>It was quite an experience thinking about planting boxes where there would be lots of traffic, and I was just hoping the boxes would all stay in place through the day - and they did. The only casualty was one set of clues that I had not hidden with a person, but in a place, and they disappeared within an hour of my hiding them. THAT was weird!<br/>
<br/>I told my friend who was at the lake that he was supposed to have been singing, and he only regretted that I hadn't told him that or he would have. That, by the way, was my friend She Who Volunteers Me For Everything's husband. I call him He Who Humors Me When She Who Volunteers Me For Everything Isn't Around (okay, not really, but he does). She and their son are off at Boy Scout camp for six weeks...<br/>
<br/>Hook's was owned by friends of my family who we have known since I was a kid - I went to school with two of Mrs. Hooker's younger siblings, took six of the ten guitar lessons I ever had from Mr. Hooker, coached their daughter in soccer, and then had the pleasure of working with them again when our daughters were on drill team together.<br/>
<br/>John and Madeleine at the Democratic booth are scouting friends as well as both are Fearless Fox's professors from Lon Morris. John is also a patrolmate of Fearless Fox's from Wood Badge. They are positively wonderful folks who I have learned so much from and who give richly to the community. And I LOVE to hear her talk!<br/>
<br/>Michael, the Owl of SR554, is also a scouting friend but we go back further than that even. Fearless Fox and Michael and Lightning and Michael's son are hiking buddies and Michael's wife and daughter do Girl Scouts together and I've worked with them on letterboxing before. <br/>
<br/>And of course, Maydelle Queen Bee's mom held one of the clues. While she has boxed with MQB several times, she actually went boxing on her own this past week! I thought that was a very appropriate Bible verse for letterboxers, didn't y'all? <br/>
<br/>I WISH I knew what happened to the folks that were holding the extra clues - I find it very interesting that that many people can be in that small a space and not find each other. It was an interesting experiment I suppose. Perhaps they are so accustomed to seeing strange folk walking around all the time that y'all just blended in for them - I find that hard to believe with Blue Butterfly and Beach Bum and Pink Cookie all wearing tomatoes on their heads!<br/>
<br/>The tomato fight didn't happen after all - some felt it was a waste of perfectly good tomatoes, others thought it was unjustifiably cruel to the tomatoes, and others thought it was just too hot. <br/><br/>So - what shall we do for next year? <br/>

We would have enjoyed hunting the mystery boxes with you all but I am taking some meds. that prevent me from getting too much sun or heat. Mr. Adams Trails and I went or short hunts in Jacksonville and found almost all we searched for.  Good to meet all of you new ones and the ones we have not met previously. Loved the pictures.

&gt; I am so glad everyone got to come!  I had a lot of fun too.  The only thing<br/>
&gt; I wish is that they would move this festival to - say - November, and then<br/>
&gt; it would be a lot MORE fun!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Frost Maiden, who accompanied Gryzzled<br/>
&gt; Gryphon.  However, he has apparently thoroughly indoctrinated her into his<br/>
&gt; secrecy, so that no information was forthcoming from her that would spill<br/>
&gt; the beans about either of them.  So while we know the persona, we still know<br/>
&gt; nothing further about the man himself, or about the woman who attended with<br/>
&gt; the man (okay well, I managed to get one little detail about her, but was<br/>
&gt; stumped how to get more...)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was also a pleasure to meet Beach Bum and her daughter, Pink Cookie.<br/>
&gt; They teamed up with Maydelle Queen Bee and PrincessA and hit the ground at<br/>
&gt; full speed.  They obviously enjoy each other's company and enjoy<br/>
&gt; letterboxing together.  They were great fun.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And then there was the formidable team of Blue Butterfly, Lucy Locket,<br/>
&gt; Puddle Splasher, and my mom, NacTrailCat.  Oh my!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Got to meet JBK's mother, who makes AWESOME brownies!  May I have the<br/>
&gt; recipe?  They really were good!  She was quite a trooper, but not much on<br/>
&gt; the heat (I sympathize).  And JBK learned that she can no longer turn on a<br/>
&gt; dime...(sorry you hurt your knee)!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PurpleNic made it after all, with Lady Bug Tree.  They were also not fans of<br/>
&gt; the heat, but they persevered and managed to find all the boxes.  It was a<br/>
&gt; pleasure to see them again, after the Lindale gathering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, Adams Trails opted to stay out of the fray and find other boxes<br/>
&gt; around town.  We met up with them at Legends and got to visit with them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was quite an experience thinking about planting boxes where there would<br/>
&gt; be lots of traffic, and I was just hoping the boxes would all stay in place<br/>
&gt; through the day - and they did.  The only casualty was one set of clues that<br/>
&gt; I had not hidden with a person, but in a place, and they disappeared within<br/>
&gt; an hour of my hiding them.  THAT was weird!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I told my friend who was at the lake that he was supposed to have been<br/>
&gt; singing, and he only regretted that I hadn't told him that or he would<br/>
&gt; have.  That, by the way, was my friend She Who Volunteers Me For<br/>
&gt; Everything's husband.  I call him He Who Humors Me When She Who Volunteers<br/>
&gt; Me For Everything Isn't Around (okay, not really, but he does).  She and<br/>
&gt; their son are off at Boy Scout camp for six weeks...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hook's was owned by friends of my family who we have known since I was a kid<br/>
&gt; - I went to school with two of Mrs. Hooker's younger siblings, took six of<br/>
&gt; the ten guitar lessons I ever had from Mr. Hooker, coached their daughter in<br/>
&gt; soccer, and then had the pleasure of working with them again when our<br/>
&gt; daughters were on drill team together.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; John and Madeleine at the Democratic booth are scouting friends as well as<br/>
&gt; both are Fearless Fox's professors from Lon Morris.  John is also a<br/>
&gt; patrolmate of Fearless Fox's from Wood Badge.  They are positively wonderful<br/>
&gt; folks who I have learned so much from and who give richly to the community.<br/>
&gt; And I LOVE to hear her talk!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Michael, the Owl of SR554, is also a scouting friend but we go back further<br/>
&gt; than that even.  Fearless Fox and Michael and Lightning and Michael's son<br/>
&gt; are hiking buddies and Michael's wife and daughter do Girl Scouts together<br/>
&gt; and I've worked with them on letterboxing before.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And of course, Maydelle Queen Bee's mom held one of the clues.  While she<br/>
&gt; has boxed with MQB several times, she actually went boxing on her own this<br/>
&gt; past week!  I thought that was a very appropriate Bible verse for<br/>
&gt; letterboxers, didn't y'all?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I WISH I knew what happened to the folks that were holding the extra clues -<br/>
&gt; I find it very interesting that that many people can be in that small a<br/>
&gt; space and not find each other.  It was an interesting experiment I suppose.<br/>
&gt; Perhaps they are so accustomed to seeing strange folk walking around all the<br/>
&gt; time that y'all just blended in for them - I find that hard to believe with<br/>
&gt; Blue Butterfly and Beach Bum and Pink Cookie all wearing tomatoes on their<br/>
&gt; heads!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The tomato fight didn't happen after all - some felt it was a waste of<br/>
&gt; perfectly good tomatoes, others thought it was unjustifiably cruel to the<br/>
&gt; tomatoes, and others thought it was just too hot.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - what shall we do for next year?<br/>

<div>Congratulations, Lucy. Sounds like everyone had a great time and you did a great job thinking it all up and putting it all together and cheering everyone along, and...and... and! Sorry I missed all the fun. Sure have enjoyed reading all the posts, tho. Almost like being there, but without the heat.<br/>So next year? already have it on the calendar. Anyone else?<br/>BGJ<br/><br/>--- In <a href="http://us.mc806.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" ymailto="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@ yahoogroups. com</a>, Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I am so glad everyone got to come! I had a lot of fun too. The only thing<br/>&gt; I wish is that they would move this festival to - say - November, and then<br/>&gt; it would be a lot MORE fun!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I thoroughly enjoyed meeting Frost Maiden, who accompanied Gryzzled<br/>&gt; Gryphon. However,
 he has apparently thoroughly indoctrinated her into his<br/>&gt; secrecy, so that no information was forthcoming from her that would spill<br/>&gt; the beans about either of them. So while we know the persona, we still know<br/>&gt; nothing further about the man himself, or about the woman who attended with<br/>&gt; the man (okay well, I managed to get one little detail about her, but was<br/>&gt; stumped how to get more...)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It was also a pleasure to meet Beach Bum and her daughter, Pink Cookie.<br/>&gt; They teamed up with Maydelle Queen Bee and PrincessA and hit the ground at<br/>&gt; full speed. They obviously enjoy each other's company and enjoy<br/>&gt; letterboxing together. They were great fun.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And then there was the formidable team of Blue Butterfly, Lucy Locket,<br/>&gt; Puddle Splasher, and my mom, NacTrailCat. Oh my!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Got to meet JBK's mother, who makes AWESOME brownies! May I have the<br/>&gt; recipe?
 They really were good! She was quite a trooper, but not much on<br/>&gt; the heat (I sympathize). And JBK learned that she can no longer turn on a<br/>&gt; dime...(sorry you hurt your knee)!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; PurpleNic made it after all, with Lady Bug Tree. They were also not fans of<br/>&gt; the heat, but they persevered and managed to find all the boxes. It was a<br/>&gt; pleasure to see them again, after the Lindale gathering.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And finally, Adams Trails opted to stay out of the fray and find other boxes<br/>&gt; around town. We met up with them at Legends and got to visit with them.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It was quite an experience thinking about planting boxes where there would<br/>&gt; be lots of traffic, and I was just hoping the boxes would all stay in place<br/>&gt; through the day - and they did. The only casualty was one set of clues that<br/>&gt; I had not hidden with a person, but in a place, and they disappeared within<br/>&gt; an hour of
 my hiding them. THAT was weird!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I told my friend who was at the lake that he was supposed to have been<br/>&gt; singing, and he only regretted that I hadn't told him that or he would<br/>&gt; have. That, by the way, was my friend She Who Volunteers Me For<br/>&gt; Everything's husband. I call him He Who Humors Me When She Who Volunteers<br/>&gt; Me For Everything Isn't Around (okay, not really, but he does). She and<br/>&gt; their son are off at Boy Scout camp for six weeks...<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Hook's was owned by friends of my family who we have known since I was a kid<br/>&gt; - I went to school with two of Mrs. Hooker's younger siblings, took six of<br/>&gt; the ten guitar lessons I ever had from Mr. Hooker, coached their daughter in<br/>&gt; soccer, and then had the pleasure of working with them again when our<br/>&gt; daughters were on drill team together.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; John and Madeleine at the Democratic booth are scouting friends as
 well as<br/>&gt; both are Fearless Fox's professors from Lon Morris. John is also a<br/>&gt; patrolmate of Fearless Fox's from Wood Badge. They are positively wonderful<br/>&gt; folks who I have learned so much from and who give richly to the community.<br/>&gt; And I LOVE to hear her talk!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Michael, the Owl of SR554, is also a scouting friend but we go back further<br/>&gt; than that even. Fearless Fox and Michael and Lightning and Michael's son<br/>&gt; are hiking buddies and Michael's wife and daughter do Girl Scouts together<br/>&gt; and I've worked with them on letterboxing before.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And of course, Maydelle Queen Bee's mom held one of the clues. While she<br/>&gt; has boxed with MQB several times, she actually went boxing on her own this<br/>&gt; past week! I thought that was a very appropriate Bible verse for<br/>&gt; letterboxers, didn't y'all?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I WISH I knew what happened to the folks that were holding the
 extra clues -<br/>&gt; I find it very interesting that that many people can be in that small a<br/>&gt; space and not find each other. It was an interesting experiment I suppose.<br/>&gt; Perhaps they are so accustomed to seeing strange folk walking around all the<br/>&gt; time that y'all just blended in for them - I find that hard to believe with<br/>&gt; Blue Butterfly and Beach Bum and Pink Cookie all wearing tomatoes on their<br/>&gt; heads!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The tomato fight didn't happen after all - some felt it was a waste of<br/>&gt; perfectly good tomatoes, others thought it was unjustifiably cruel to the<br/>&gt; tomatoes, and others thought it was just too hot.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So - what shall we do for next year?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>
