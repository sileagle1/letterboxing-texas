<div>I am of the "less is 
more" school of thought on this one.  My favorite memories when I look 
through my logbook are one or two finds per outing, with lots of time for 
exploring.  Of course, this could have a lot to do with the fact that I 
would have a mutiny on my hands if I tried to push for finding more boxes each 
trip.  Usually discovering a quiet little place is reward enough.  
That and the sonic milkshakes that must accompany every outing, that 
is.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That being said, I love 
a good series (hint, hint Boots...just in case you have something in mind!) so I 
can't really say that I never find more than a box or two at a time.  But 
if I were in an unfamiliar place, I would definitely look for just a box or two 
and enjoy the location the finder wanted to show me.
