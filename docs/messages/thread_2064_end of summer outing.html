<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">We just got back from a 
fabulous last day of summer vacation outing, and I want to advertise two 
spectacular spots.  Our first stop was Sea Center Texas, a couple of weeks 
ago the kids and I went to find Silver Eagle's "Gordon Grouper" box.  This 
is a "can't be missed" spot, especially if you have kids.  There is a great 
little FREE aquarium, with all sorts of displays on the Gulf, and super cool 
touch tanks containing very feisty crabs.  We went back today, because when 
we were replacing the microbox, I somehow managed to knock it down between two 
pilings holding up the boardwalk.  After many tries at retrieving the box, 
we had to give it up for lost.  If you all think it feels bad to find out 
one of your own boxes has gone missing, imagine the feeling of knowing you have 
lost a great box that has been in place for a LONG time.  But leave it to 
me and my crew to mess thins up.  Anyway, I recarved SE's original stamp, 
and added a little bonus "I'm Sorry" stamp from us, and put it all in a box too 
big to fit down any little cracks.  If you haven't yet visited Sea Center 
TX, make a point to go.  It is one of those great places we never would 
have found without letterboxing.  From there we went on down to Quintana ( 
a short drive down 288) to find Dewberry's "Hummer of a Summer" box.  It is 
located in a super little county park, with a great beach and an ANTI AIRCRAFT 
GUN (I think this falls under the "only in Texas" category)  A great spot 
for a picnic dinner (there is a Church's Chicken in Freeport, and it will stay 
warm until you reach the park!)  We had planned to go on to the bird 
sanctuary in Quintana and find the boxes there, but had way too much fun on the 
beach, so those will have to wait until next time.  I was thinking on the 
way home about what Dewberry said the other day about not being afraid to leave 
without a box, and she was right.  For me, the best part of letterboxing is 
all the great places we have found, and all the fun we have had out in search of 
those little plastic boxes.  When you slow down, especially if you are out 
with kids, they begin to enjoy it much more.  And leaving a box for "next 
time" means you have a reason to return to those great spots.  Thanks to 
Silver Eagle and Dewberry for a perfect end to a wonderful summer.  I just 
am not ready for school to start again.  MO5</font></div></body></html>

the Whole MO5 Gang (well maybe not Naomi) picked up trash while on the<br>
beach at Quintana Beach Park.<br>
<br>
It is a lovely spot, and the trash makes me sad.  We picked up what we<br>
could too, but they've got way more hands!<br>

School starts tomorrow and I'm sad.  <br>
My baby's going to kindergarten. . .  <br>
