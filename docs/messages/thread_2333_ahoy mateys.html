                    <div class="plaintext-content">thanx you guys for all the Texas info.  i have convinced by dear hubby<br/>
to leave this alaskan coldness and fly down to Texas earlier.  we are<br/>
just waiting on the 89 yr old aunt to make up her mind when she wants<br/>
to go on the "little ole Lady " tour. hopefully i will be around those<br/>
parts dec 18th thru jan 1.<br/>
what I need is a straight up mapquest/Gps/garmin/route  thingie JUST<br/>
for letterboxing. Besides being a map to letterboxes it would include:<br/>
 places to stop the car safely, marked places to picnic by a<br/>
letterbox, a gourmet market to buy food stuffs,a place to buy carving<br/>
material, lockboxes and journals.  It would also include a sports bar<br/>
to drop the spouse off at while you go look, photo kiosk/picture<br/>
maker, some kind of meeting place,complete with fancy schmazing<br/>
coffees, especially for meeting other boxers for exchanges. And then<br/>
the map would automatically put in your F count.  LOL<br/>
 the only way i letterbox is when i am on vacation so these are my<br/>
requests to Santa. <br/>

<div>Hey Denise -</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are from the Shreveport area and have planted the only boxes there so far.  We don't live there currently (we are in DC) but we plan on being "home" to visit family during the same time you are down there.  We would love to get together for an exchange - and maybe we can get a couple more planted for you when we arrive!  Hope you have a fabulous trip - sounds like adventure of some sort is headed your way!  :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take care, Honour of the Boxalots</div>
