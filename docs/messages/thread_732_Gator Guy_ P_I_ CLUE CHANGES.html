I'll write more about our misadventures with the storm on Saturday night<br>
later, but wanted to very quickly give everybody a "heads up" about the<br>
Gator Guy box that The Gentleman & Tenderfoot placed in Brazos Bend on<br>
Thursday. <br>
On Sunday, Stillwater & I checked on the box and found it sitting only about<br>
3 inches above water!<br>
So please email me or check LbNA site for very slight alteration of<br>
clues...basically same spot, but just a little higher!!!<br>
We noticed that several of you had already found it (gulp - was that part of<br>
the midnight boxing frenzy??? You guys are nuts!) so hopefully we didn't<br>
hinder anyone by moving it slightly.<br>
Cheers!<br>

PS I'm so sorry we left before I could enjoy the witty remarks from this<br>
group (Wes & Hawk!!!) about the Guy Gator box - we just arrived home to an<br>
inbox full of emails, and those two made me grin!<br>

Maybe we should initial our boxes so you can tell which lion placed them &<br>
whether they're likely to be safe or require playing in traffic! (Only<br>
kidding - to be fair, I'm sure the water was much lower when they arrived -<br>
but The Gentleman said he thought a gator box should really be placed near<br>
the correct habitat!!!)<br>

Whew. Glad you moved it up. I was a bit nervous stretching my arm down <br>
in there so close to the water! :p<br>
