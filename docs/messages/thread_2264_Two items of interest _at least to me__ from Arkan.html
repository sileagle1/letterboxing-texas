                    <div class="plaintext-content">The first, my Paddle to the Sea box near Glenwood AR, finally got its<br/>
first real visitor!  Fearless Fox and Lightning planted it for me<br/>
during their four day hiking trip last Thanksgiving.  I finally got to<br/>
visit it myself last month, and today I got a real honest-to-goodness<br/>
finders report!  YEA!<br/>
<br/>
And second, I got home today to a letter from my neighbor who has been<br/>
away in Arkansas for several weeks.  She found an article about<br/>
letterboxing in Games Magazine and thought of us and sent it to me and<br/>
Lightning.  Interesting article - I must say though, I cringed a bit<br/>
when I read "Boxers should always try to find out when a box was<br/>
planted since floods and other weather events can cause boxes to go<br/>
missing, and sometimes animals will find boxes and move them.  The<br/>
older the box, the less likely it will still be in its original<br/>
location."  Yeesh.  Nothing like a sweeping generalization that<br/>
completely fails to address the effect of good maintenance and a good<br/>
hide on the longevity of a box.  I understand what the author was<br/>
trying to say, but it sure seems like that would give someone the<br/>
wrong idea.<br/>
<br/>
Another item of interest I found was a quote attributed to Silent<br/>
Doug, someone I would consider to be a reliable source of information.<br/>
 Assuming he is accurately quoted, he estimates there are hundreds of<br/>
thousands of boxes in the US.  Now LBNA shows about 26,600 right now,<br/>
and if you were to say that there were another 26,000 on AQ (and while<br/>
there are some on AQ that aren't on LBNA, there aren't THAT many!),<br/>
that would be 52,600 and say another 26,000 had been archived, for a<br/>
total of nearly 80,000 boxes.  I wonder if that means Doug believes<br/>
there are twice as many WOMs and "listed elsewhere" boxes as there are<br/>
publicly (AQ and LBNA) listed boxes?  Do you remember how you felt<br/>
when you learned that there is a whole 'nother world out there full of<br/>
stuffed Tupperware all around places you had been? Does this<br/>
possibility give you that same feeling all over again?  Hmmm...maybe<br/>
he will uncloak and either refute the quote or expound on that<br/>
statement!<br/>
