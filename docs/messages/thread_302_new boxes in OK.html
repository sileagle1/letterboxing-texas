We went trout fishing up north this weekend and of course had to <br/>
place two new boxes.  Look under my Kantexan boxes in Eastern <br/>
Oklahoma in Gore for the first two of my "Lost Texan" series.  The <br/>
fishing was spotty but the country was beautiful!<br/>
Silver Eagle, I can't RSVP yet because I have to convince my spouse <br/>
to get into Letterboxing!  :)  The kids and I are interested.  We'll <br/>
let you know as soon as we can about the Brazos Bend Event.-Kantexan<br/>
