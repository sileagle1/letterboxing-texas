                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
I've been a nominal member of this list for several months but have <br/>
never posted, just because I can't access yahoogroups at work, and I <br/>
have teenagers who hog my pc at home. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I thought it might be time to just say hi, virtually, since <br/>
I did meet several of you at the Great Book Adventure in October.<br/>
<br/>
And . . . I have a confession. Reading over posts from the last <br/>
couple of months, I learn that I have probably committed a cardinal <br/>
sin or two. Late last month, my DH and I found a letterbox that was <br/>
scattered all over the place so we found all the pieces, took it <br/>
home, cleaned the stamp, provided a new box and logbook, and <br/>
replaced it, including the old logbook in case the planter wanted <br/>
it. We notified the planter that we were doing this. Now I find that <br/>
may have been the WRONG thing to do. <br/>
<br/>
Yesterday we did something even worse. We found a microbox that had <br/>
apparently been waterlogged for a long time, to the point that we <br/>
couldn't even get the stamp out of the container because it was <br/>
crumbling. So we took it with us and immediately emailed the placer <br/>
to offer to mail it back to them in case they would like to dry out <br/>
the logbook and keep it if they wanted to. We can't repair it and <br/>
it's over an hour from home so we can't replace it any time soon. I <br/>
guess this was the WRONG thing to do again but I guess we just did <br/>
what we'd like someone to do for one of our boxes. <br/>
<br/>
This isn't to dredge up old flame wars, it's just to say that if we <br/>
breached protocol we're sorry--we enjoy letterboxing but <br/>
aren't "pros" at it. <br/>
<br/>
On a brighter note, just wanted to mention that we've been boxing <br/>
for about seven months and have thoroughly enjoyed seeing new places <br/>
and things--kind of like why we enjoy volksmarching, except easier <br/>
to do spontaneously and closer to home. THANKS to Thimble Cat, for <br/>
offering an adult Girl Scout training at Crazy Quilt last year, and <br/>
getting us (okay, me, but DH is willing to be dragged along, with or <br/>
without the dogs)interested in letterboxing.<br/>
