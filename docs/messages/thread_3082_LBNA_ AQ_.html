<div>LOL...we had a discussion not too long ago about who likes searching by county and who likes searching by city.  It seems most of us who are rural like the county approach (LBNA) - those who are more urban tend to like the city approach (AQ).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It might also help your frustration to understand the differences in philosophy between the two sites:  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a> is designed to take a minimalist approach to the technological side of letterboxing.  In origin, letterboxing clues were spread hand-to-hand and there was a certain beauty to that.  When it came over here, that was highly impractical and technology crept in.  LBNA's mission is to provide "just the clues, nothing but the clues" - to allow boxers to develop and play the game creatively in their own way and to facilitate them to appreciate letterboxing for the act of letterboxing, not for the technology of letterboxing.  Some would say that it is planter-oriented, and by definition it really is, since it is purely and simply a repository of letterboxing clues.  A few added features have been tacked on, like counts and finders' logs, but these are sort of clunky features, aren't they?  It is operated by a group of folks who tend to move it along very slowly and with a very long-range approach.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>AtlasQuest was designed to be more finder-friendly.  Lots of features for searching and communicating and recording finds.  Lots of bells and whistles.  Truly a nice site with fluid motion.  Ryan is very responsive to users and tries to give them what they want.  It has made getting started incredibly easy for new boxers.  And the mapping is a key feature on AQ and unparalleled.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I personally much prefer LBNA, although I refer to AQ also.  For me, I spend much less time at my computer with LBNA - I search to find the clues I need, print them, and run.   And this is so even though there are about 30-40% more clues for Texas on LBNA than there are on AQ.  I find that when I log on to AQ, I find myself spending hours on there and although I walk away with a fistful of clues, I don't have the same time to go find them.  This is a downfall of mine - I eek down into the nitty gritty of it and start chasing rabbit trails and getting sidetracked.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also find that I get way too wrapped up in counting on AQ.  I'm an accountant by education and past profession, so I feel that if I have the count feature there, it HAS to balance to my counts in my logbook.  I could go crazy trying to find that one little box I didn't log on AQ.  And counting isn't where it's at for me in letterboxing - I would much prefer to find one really nice box on a given day than ten drive-bys.  It helps me not to see counts emphasized.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Notice that for both of these reasons why I prefer LBNA over AQ, I refer to personal quirks that make LBNA more suitable FOR ME.  Others have equally good reasons for preferring AQ over LBNA - FOR THEM.  <br/> </div>
<div>Before I continue, let me post a newbie alert - I am NOT picking on newbies in the following paragraphs, nor am I saying ALL or NO newbies can do or understand what I am describing!  I LIKE newbies, okay?  Now...</div>
<div><br/>I think that one of the detriments of AQ to letterboxing is this:  By automating much of the thought processes of letterboxing, new boxers don't "get" the nuances of the game.  As an example, by offering so many ways to catalog boxes, new users sometimes don't get the reasoning behind the categories.  Back in the pre-AQ days, we sometimes had to really noodle through how to count a box - it didn't necessarily have an easy little cubbyhole.  It reminds me of when I was in college - we didn't use computers at all in my accounting coursework.  We had to make every entry by hand and we used the double entry system and had to thoroughly understand it to make it work.  When I really was an accountant and had several years of experience under my belt, I found myself hiring newly graduated accountants who had learned on computers and in working with them, I realized they missed so many of the nuances of the logic behind the computer programs because they had never had to put the thought processes to work that got them to the end result.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Because of the ease of use, some new boxers rely on AQ to tell them how to letterbox rather than allow older boxers to share with them the fundamentals.  And I don't think it's a matter of making sure new boxers know "this is how we've always done it..." but rather, "this is the logic behind why it is done this way..."  Over the course of four years (for me), I've seen a lot of new boxers come in and read the FAQ on either LBNA or AQ and start proclaiming how it should be done without truly understanding the concept.  There have also been many new boxers who have come in and quietly learned from their predecessors and then come forward with some amazingly astute and cool additions to the game.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>LBNA was it when I started out - and I found it to be incredibly frustrating and even maddening at times trying to understand what I was looking at.   I would read a little and then try to follow up on some of what I was reading, only to get frustrated by all the different tracks.  I would leave it for a few days and then find myself drawn back to read some more.  LBNA, in its maddening organization, caused me to dig in and learn the game before I played it the first time.  And of course, I then figured out that only by playing it could I learn it.  The ultimate paradox.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's entirely possible to get a good grasp on the game without ever visiting LBNA, only AQ.  But it is also incredibly easy to skim the surface of letterboxing and never realize there is so much more!  Kind of like swimming - I can float like crazy and think I'm swimming, but if I never dive under the water, I have no idea what I'm dealing with!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The long and short is - enjoy AQ for its ease and flow, but be patient and learn LBNA too because there is a lot there you won't get from AQ.  We are very lucky to have them both!  But perhaps most importantly, always continue to learn the game because it is dynamic and changes with every new member that comes on board. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well heck Vicki, you didn't ask for most of that, but as I was thinking about your frustration with LBNA, it kind of led me to think of other things too!</div>
