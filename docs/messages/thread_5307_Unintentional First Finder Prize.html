                    <html><body><p>I went letterboxing today, finding a few and placing two, but I almost left more than I intended.  After spending a lot of time at Forest Park Cemetery, I left to go find a couple more boxes a few miles away.  As I was walking I rolled up my coat sleeve to see what time it was and was shocked to see no watch!  I frantically looked all over in the car and realized it must have come off somewhere back at the cemetery.  So back I went, revisiting all the places I had been before, until I found it right next to the Jesse Jones letterbox I had placed earlier.  I have no idea how it came off or why I didn't notice, but I was very glad to find it since it was my wedding present over 25 years ago and I really didn't want to lose it.  Sorry there is no first finder prize, but hopefully you will get a laugh when you find this box.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>
