<div>That CT State Forest Dept letterboxing program was actually my introduction to letterboxing when I lived in CT. They place a letterbox in each of their 30 state forest and publish the clues on the LBNA site. If you find 5 of their boxes, you earn a patch from the State Forest (EPA) and if you find all 30, you earn a walking stick. I have both the patch and the stick and when my sister (Viewfinder) was visiting me in CT last fall (before I moved back to Texas), she also earned her CT State Forest Patch. So if any of you have trips planned to New England next fall to enjoy the gorgeous fall foliage, be sure to plan to visit at least five of the state forests and claim your patch! It's difficult to visit five forests in one day, but probably possible. However CT is a little state, and some of the forests are in close proximity to each other. Many of the hikes require some pretty hardy hiking, and some require tree identification and other interesting clues. Really a great series.</div>
