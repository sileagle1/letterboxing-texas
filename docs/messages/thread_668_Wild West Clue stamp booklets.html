Hi everyone!<br>
<br>
I've been chatting with Ruby T. to see what I can do to help her get <br>
things ready for the Clue game.  Together, we've come up with a stamp <br>
booklet that you may want to use to stamp your clues into.  Of <br>
course, you may just want to stamp into your regular logbook <br>
instead.  :-)  The booklet (as I've assembled it) requires 1 sheet of <br>
cardstock and 5 pages of regular paper.  Also, printer, scissors and <br>
stapler.<br>
<br>
The booklet has a page for the victim stamp, 12 suspect stamp pages, <br>
12 crime scene pages, 12 weapon pages, a couple of "notes" pages and <br>
a final page for the answer to the mystery!<br>
<br>
Anyhoo...I've posted some instructions, cover art and inside pages in <br>
the files section if anyone is interested in it.  If you would like <br>
to use one of these clue booklets, but are unable to print, don't <br>
have time, etc., please just post and let me know!  I would be happy <br>
to make up booklets for anyone who wants them.  I'll bring them with <br>
me Saturday morning when we come to the park.<br>
<br>
Of course, this is just optional.  I thought it might help keep me <br>
organized and or course, my children think it's very "detective-like" <br>
and thus, a must have.  :-)<br>
<br>
I hope this might be helpful to ya'll, and I can't wait for the <br>
Event!  Thanks to Ruby T. for all of her assistance (and letting me <br>
toss my two cents into the game)!<br>
<br>
See you all soon!  BusyBeesFamily<br>

my contribution was: "Wow! Great idea! You go, girl!"...;-)<br>
<br>
I've already printed mine out & the pages look fantastic! Thanks so much for<br>
a wonderful addition to the CLUE game - they are going to be really neat<br>
souvenirs for all of us!<br>

COOOOOL!!!!!! Great job, busybeesfamily! I can hardly<br>
wait to start collecting stamps on the pages. I used<br>
all premium cardstock, and it was too thick to staple.<br>
I cut each page in half where I had folded it, then I<br>
punched a hole in the upper left corner of each page<br>
and put a cable-tie through it. This created a loop of<br>
plastic holding all the pages together. Now I can flip<br>
through the pages easily and stamp away!<br>
<br>
When I'm done, I will probably transfer the pages<br>
(including title page, etc.) to my logbook. Since I<br>
can do this after the event, I will have time to add<br>
in photos and notes at my leisure. The CLUE logbook<br>
will become part of my permanent logbook.<br>
