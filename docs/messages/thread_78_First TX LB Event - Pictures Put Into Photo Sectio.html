site because Yahoo limits the amount of MB that can be<br>
transferred each hour, I have put the pictures from the<br>
Event in the Photos section of this Talklist.  Just click<br>
on Photos on the left side of this list, then click the<br>
album FTLE.  You can click on each photo to see larger<br>
images up to the full size.  Only people belonging to<br>
this Talklist will be able to see them so that is why<br>
I put them on my website, too.  Enjoy!<br>
