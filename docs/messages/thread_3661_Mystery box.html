<div>I've had some finders report that my Mystery box <u><em>"Simple Gifts: 
Music Box #10"</em></u> is missing, so I checked on it just the other day while 
out doing some routine letterbox maintenance and I'm happy to report that it's 
still quietly and safely hidden just where it's supposed to be.  The 
mystery clues aren't that difficult to solve, but I think perhaps the reason 
some finders haven't found it (even after solving the mystery clues) is that it 
is really well-hidden - very carefully placed so as not to be at all visible or 
to be accidentally discovered because it is in a fairly vulnerable 
location.  So, just in case you're one of those who have tried and not 
found it, that letterbox is still there, I'm happy to say, and hopefully will 
continue to remain well-hidden (and many many thanks to previous finders who did 
take such care to replace it exactly where they found it so that it has lasted 
so well!)</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I was checking out all the posts I have missed in the past couple<br>
of weeks, this post caught my attention. I pulled up the clue on AQ. I<br>
copied the numbers to Excel and I worked on it for over an hour.<br>
<br>
Tonight, I was in bed. But, I was having a bit of pain, so I thought I<br>
would sit at the computer for a few minutes waiting for some Aleve to<br>
take effect.<br>
<br>
I opened the Excel sheet (I'm bad, it was still up on my computer) and<br>
continued to work on it some more. Remember I'm Mystery Challenged. I<br>
got on AQ for a minute and read some of the posts (the smaller ones, I<br>
have hundreds waiting to be read or ignored). One post was Amanda from<br>
Seattle giving an NPR Radio interview. She mentions being able to use<br>
Google to find answers to codes. I tried it out. Didn't find a thing<br>
helful. Mostly it was 911 stuff.<br>
<br>
So, I tried again. Aha, I got it. How exciting is that. I may even<br>
venture that way tomorrow (with water and possibly an umbrella).<br>
<br>
Thank you for challenging me and making me feel almost whole again.<br>
