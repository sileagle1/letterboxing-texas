<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I've been thinking a 
lot about dewberry's question on goals for 2008 letterboxing.  My goal is 
to put a sense of adventure back into my letterboxing outings.  In Houston, 
there are so many boxes to find, that I could never leave the city, and still 
never have enough time to find all the boxes out there. (And, believe me, I am 
not complaining about this!)  But when we first started letterboxing, boxes 
were few and far between, and every find involved something unknown, and many 
involved a spectacular road trip with the kids eating junk food (bribes work 
wonders!) all the way to a new adventure.  We took many short weekend trips 
to places I never would have had the inclination to visit otherwise, and the 
memories of these trips are treasures to me.  So my goal for 2008 is to 
pack the car, lots of juice boxes and moonpies, and get out of town for a few 
weekends to meander around discovering surprises along the way.  Who knows 
when the nest Stonehenge or suspension bridge or civil war cemetery or colony of 
bats or beautiful backroad or.....is at the end of the day's drive?

<div>I like your goal and agree completely!  The most fun is to find a 
place that's completely new to you, get to explore it looking for a letterbox 
and have all these serendipitous discoveries along the way, whether in your own 
area or way off in a totally unfamiliar place.  The nice stamp 
&amp; logbook are just frosting on the cake, but even if you don't find 
anything, it's still a good time.  </div>
<div>I think my goal parallels yours:  it's not about the count and 
certainly there are enough letterboxes around now to be a little 
selective rather than compulsive.  It should be an adventure!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those looking for the antecedent, my question was posed on the<br>
Gulf Coast boxers list, rather than here, but I'm happy to have talk<br>
about it here too.<br>
<br>
I'm not a goal-maker when it comes to letterboxing, more a<br>
see-what-come type of person.  But, I have some series and boxes that<br>
have been percolating in the back of my head that I'd liked to see<br>
actualized.<br>
<br>
We'll be going on a trip to Seattle in March to see my sister, with a<br>
side trip to the Oregon Coast.  And this summer, we'll be taking a<br>
Colorado/Wyoming roadtrip.  Both of those are exciting and fun.<br>
<br>
But, I love little sleepy Texas towns, quirky roadside attractions,<br>
diners with ancient waitresses & delicious pie, and just driving<br>
around and seeing something that makes you go...STOP this car this<br>
instant!  And that's why I like tooling around on Texas backroads and<br>
what keeps me going for mini-adventures and letterboxes in the middle<br>
of no-where.<br>
<br>
I really appreciate people who plant boxes at the spots that may not<br>
be the biggest tourist attraction in their area, but that are<br>
interesting, odd & fun.  I know that these boxes do not get nearly the<br>
amount of traffic that boxes right on the Interstate do, but I really<br>
love them when I find them, and enjoy looking back through my logbook<br>
remembering the adventure.  That's why I'm hooked.<br>

<div>One of the nicest, most relaxing vacations my husband and I had 
was a leisurely, no-destination trip exploring the OK and TX panhandles, 
years and years ago.  It was prompted by a trip the previous summer 
to the USSR, and after that, we thought west TX and OK would be a 
definite step up in comfort and luxury!  Our goal each day was have 
lunch at a cafe on a town square and have BIG iced tea and pie with BIG meringue 
- and we were never disappointed!  Along the way we discovered pretty city 
and state parks, explored the Palo Duro canyon, saw lots and lots of sky and 
grain elevators, found some really pretty scenery unexpectedly in OK, and it was 
great!  Of course this was long before we knew anything about letterboxing 
(about in 1988), but that would sure be fun to do again and plant a 
few!   vf</div></font><br/><br/><br/><div><font style="color: black; font: normal 10pt ARIAL, SAN-SERIF;"><hr style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px"/>Start the year off right.  <a href="http://body.aol.com/fitness/winter-exercise?NCID=aolcmp00300000002489" target="_blank" title="http://body.aol.com/fitness/winter-exercise?NCID=aolcmp00300000002489">Easy ways to stay in shape</a> in the new year. </font></div></body></html>

<p>I, personally, think that all y'all's goals should be roadtripping up here to Louisville, KY and spreading the Texas Love throughout our beautiful bluegrass state.  What a fun weekend that would make.  Kentucky would never be the same.  Maybe Gov would reconsider the name of Kentuxas.  Only if he didn't make us wear penguin suits all the time.  ;-) <br/><br/>MoWizLiz<br/><br/><b><i><a href="mailto:blhjrh@aol.com" target="_blank">blhjrh@aol.com</a></i></b> wrote:

<div>I like your goal and agree completely!  The most fun is to find a place that's completely new to you, get to explore it looking for a letterbox and have all these serendipitous discoveries along the way, whether in your own area or way off in a totally unfamiliar place.  The nice stamp &amp; logbook are just frosting on the cake, but even if you don't find anything, it's still a good time.   </div>
<div>I think my goal parallels yours:  it's not about the count and certainly there are enough letterboxes around now to be a little selective rather than compulsive.  It should be an adventure!  </div>
