updates from the oldies, I thought I would go ahead<br/>
and throw in.<br/>
<br/>
I've been involved in formal letterboxing for about<br/>
two years.  I found it about three years ago through a<br/>
homeschooling group I was in and finally found my way<br/>
to the real game.  I'm forever grateful to Silver<br/>
Eagle and BabyBear for being forward thinking and kind<br/>
enough to plant boxes in my area before there were<br/>
even any boxers here.  <br/>
<br/>
I started this list, but it isn't my list - it belongs<br/>
to the group.  I've learned so much from the members<br/>
of this list and I look forward each day to logging on<br/>
to see what's going on with the folks here.<br/>
<br/>
I live in Cherokee County and until recently was the<br/>
only boxer in this neck of the woods.  I've been so<br/>
thankful that TexasLuvBug got involved!  It also seems<br/>
we are getting traffic passing through these days, so<br/>
it isn't such a hopeless jaunt to check on a box<br/>
anymore - we almost always find new stamps in our<br/>
journals! YEA!<br/>
<br/>
I have a daughter, ElmoLuvr, who just graduated from<br/>
high school and is itching to get out into the world. <br/>
Since we've been boxing, she's always been my carving<br/>
compadre and the official fisher-out of boxes in our<br/>
family.  She's working at scout camp this summer<br/>
(she's using her carving skills to teach woodcarving!)<br/>
so I'm getting used to her not being around, but I<br/>
don't think I'm going to like it very much when she<br/>
really leaves.  I asked her recently if she thought<br/>
she would keep boxing after she leaves home, and she<br/>
felt like she probably would.  Guess we'll be seeing<br/>
her stamp solo sometime soon.  I imagine she'll be<br/>
changing her stamp and trail name soon too.<br/>
<br/>
I also have a son, formerly Wolf and now Lightning. <br/>
He's 9 years old and he has a firm grasp of<br/>
letterboxing.  He's pretty good with clues, but he<br/>
won't go box-diving like my daughter does.  He's had a<br/>
couple "interesting" boxing experiences (hanging by<br/>
his fingers over a small waterfall comes to mind, as<br/>
does taking an unexpected tumble down a long<br/>
embankment).  He keeps on going though - my kind of<br/>
guy!<br/>
<br/>
My husband doesn't have a trail name.  He's not really<br/>
too much into letterboxing, although he is a big<br/>
hiker, so he never turns down a boxing trip.  He's a<br/>
real trouper and never complains, so we love him for<br/>
indulging us.  I do think we are inching him into a<br/>
commitment - he's been playing at a stamp lately and a<br/>
trail name will probably follow.  It's probably still<br/>
gonna be awhile before he gets up in the morning and<br/>
says "Let's go letterboxing!"<br/>
<br/>
I'm currently working on a family stamp based on 3 A's<br/>
and 1 M - the initials of our first (real) names. <br/>
It's gonna be cool.<br/>
<br/>
We are also big into scouting.  I don't get nearly as<br/>
many letterboxing outings as I would like, so we try<br/>
to combine our scouting jaunts with boxing.  So far,<br/>
I've had real good luck introducing cub scouts to<br/>
boxing.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess that sums me up - next!<br/>
<br/>
