<br/>
Just wanted to post a reminder that my Cookie Caper series is ready <br/>
to go!  All stamps are carved, boxes hidden and clue pages published <br/>
(although since I just upgraded my web-hosting account, I am having <br/>
a little trouble "redelegating" the pages.  It is a LOT more work <br/>
than I was led to believe!  So...if you email me for clues and then <br/>
a couple of the links aren't working...keep trying them!  I hope <br/>
they have the glitches worked out by Friday or Saturday at the <br/>
latest.)<br/>
<br/>
I am VERY EXCITED to offer this series!  It has been great practice <br/>
for me to get out there and plant more boxes (my first box <br/>
disappearing so quickly kinda put a damper on that "planting part" <br/>
of my soul!).  I've also tried to use several different "elements" <br/>
including a micro-box, a piggy-back box, a hitchhiker, etc.  I've <br/>
tried to make the boxes easy to find, but did want to try writing a <br/>
few more cryptic clues.  The stamps are all very lovely (thanks to <br/>
much help from NorthStars family...I just KNEW I was gonna be glad <br/>
that I introduced them to lboxing!).<br/>
<br/>
And...my kiddos are just DYING to start giving away boxes of Girl <br/>
Scout cookies!  (My daughter's goal this year is to sell 1,000 boxes <br/>
of cookies and use her Cookie Credits to go to Brownie Camp this <br/>
summer for a whole entire week without her mother!   Imagine that!)  <br/>
We will also have more cookies available for you to purchase if you <br/>
are interested...our council charges $3.00 per box.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
If you come down to complete the series, please consider hiding a <br/>
box in our area.  I know that we would be happy to "adopt" or help <br/>
you maintain any boxes in our neck of the woods.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhoo...here is the link to The Cookie Caper Info Page:<br/>
