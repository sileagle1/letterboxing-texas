<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I was out at Terry 
Hershey this morning planting the next part of the Mythical Creatures series 
(more on that in a bit) when I spotted my first Bluebonnets of the season right 
there in my favorite section of the park!  I'll tell you what, growing up 
in Michigan we couldn't wait for the first peek at yellow and red leaves in the 
fall...but after 15 years in Texas I think it is even more spectacular to see 
the first bits of wildflower color peeking out of the grass.  The changing 
of the leaves, although unbearably beautiful, means the beginning of a quick 
fall before the seemingly endless winter sets in, so it gives you sort of a sad 
feeling.  But when you see the wildflowers you know long, warm lazy days 
are on their way...and school is almost out.  In my book that is a much 
happier feeling!</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">  I planted 2 more 
boxes this morning, and had plans to plant 5 in total.  However, as I was 
looking for a spot for box number 3, 2 things happened.  First, about 4 
huge trucks pulled into the park for some work on a part of the trail that has 
eroded; and second, the 2 year old spilled her water on the 4 year old's 
favorite dress.  Anyone who has ever had kids side by side in a stroller 
when something like this happens knows that it means is time to go home.  I 
will go back this weekend without the stroller girls and plant the next 3 
boxes.  So Lucy Lockett, JBK, Sandibox, PEAS, and Teamking never fear...I 
have not forgotten your boxes, and will get the clues out asap.   
Thanks again for all the contributions to this series, I have had a blast with 
it so far.  And if you still want to send me a box just go right 
ahead...I'm only halfway through the park!  (hint, hint)
