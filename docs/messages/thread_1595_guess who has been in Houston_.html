Someone told me it was really easy and others have said it was really<br>
hard, so it was kind of hard to judge.  It is in a terrible place and<br>
probably won't last, so if this one is on your priority list, I would<br>
go sooner rather than later.  OTOH, if Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's<br>
Murphy's Laws hold true, this one will last until the next ice age--it<br>
violates many of my tried-and-true rules for letterbox hiding, so<br>
therefore, perversely, may be in a great spot!!<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, our Dragonfly Dos box out in Lake Somerville is in danger<br>
of being chomped to death by some animal on a plastic diet, so if<br>
anyone is heading out that way, please take a replacement container.<br>
We would most appreciate it.<br>
