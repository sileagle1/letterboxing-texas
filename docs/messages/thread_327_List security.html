                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here's a topic I've been pondering for quite awhile,<br/>
and I thought that as our list grows, it is a great<br/>
time to bring up the idea of list security.  Let's<br/>
think of this as setting up a neighborhood watch.<br/>
<br/>
I want you all to know that I don't intend or desire<br/>
to alarm anyone or make anyone paranoid, but I really,<br/>
truly do worry about personal safety and how a list<br/>
like this potentially affects safety.  As the list<br/>
owner, I feel a certain amount of responsibility for<br/>
exercising as much alertness as I can so that the list<br/>
is "safe" for all the members.  <br/>
<br/>
First of all, I'm not going to get into the specific<br/>
ramifications of what could happen if bad guys were to<br/>
use our list.  I frankly think the risk is relatively<br/>
low, although it IS there, so that I prefer not to<br/>
dwell too much on dramatizing the risk. If anyone<br/>
feels we need to speak those risks, we can open that<br/>
up in a different thread, but I would like to see any<br/>
discussion of specific risks stay constructive and<br/>
non-alarmist.<br/>
<br/>
One of my biggest concerns with a list like this is<br/>
that we, by virtue of the fact that we are a<br/>
geographically-based group who share a<br/>
geographically-based interest, tell a little more<br/>
about ourselves and our locations than we would<br/>
typically share on the internet.  Couple that fact<br/>
with the fact that letterboxing can, and often is, an<br/>
isolated activity, I worry that this list could be<br/>
targeted by someone with "non-letterboxing intent." <br/>
Fortunately, we are still small enough in number that<br/>
somebody knows somebody who knows or has met most<br/>
everyone here.<br/>
<br/>
Do you wonder by now what we do to keep the list safe?<br/>
<br/>
Well, first of all, I'm going to speak as "I" most of<br/>
the time, because I don't want to imply that what I<br/>
think is necessarily what Silver Eagle thinks.  He<br/>
can, and I'm sure will, speak well enough for himself!<br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle and I look at each request to join this<br/>
list to see why the requestor wants to join. <br/>
Admittedly, we (or at least I) aren't terribly picky,<br/>
but I want to see that the reason given sounds<br/>
letterboxerish (letterboxerish, non-letterboxing<br/>
intent???  Don't y'all love these terms I'm coming up<br/>
with?).  Also, when the member is accepted, they get a<br/>
welcome letter (most of y'all got it, I'm sure!)<br/>
asking them to post an introduction.  Hopefully,<br/>
they'll get that intro out there, because that is the<br/>
list membership's opportunity to meet someone and size<br/>
them up and to know who is out there reading their<br/>
posts.  Members are more than welcome to fade into<br/>
lurkerdom if they so desire, but I sure like to see<br/>
that intro at the very least.<br/>
<br/>
I've considered whether we should bounce members who<br/>
don't post intros within, say, 30 days.  I hate to do<br/>
that, but at the same time, I think I owe it to the<br/>
active members to help them know their co-list<br/>
members.<br/>
<br/>
I would ask that if you invite someone to join our<br/>
list, you should email me or Silver Eagle and let us<br/>
know to expect your friend (or better yet, send us the<br/>
email address and we'll invite them!), or at least<br/>
tell your friend to use your name in their reason to<br/>
join (kind of like a secret knock!!!).  <br/>
<br/>
Do any of you have thoughts about all of this?  Ideas<br/>
about how we, as moderators, can be more diligent in<br/>
our gatekeeping?  Or how we all, as members, can be<br/>
more conscious of list security?<br/>
<br/>
This is a little rambly, I know, but I wanted to get<br/>
y'all thinking about how you would like to see our<br/>
little neighborhood protected....<br/>

<br/>
We certainly want anyone to be able to FIND the list,<br/>
and don't want to be exclusive by any means, except<br/>
that the members of the list need to have a general<br/>
interest in letterboxing, whether they are just<br/>
curious about it after reading an article, or are<br/>
serious letterboxers in Texas, or have relatives or<br/>
ties to Texas and letterbox elsewhere - we have all<br/>
kinds on this list, and I think that's great!  DON'T<br/>
take the link to the list off your webpages!<br/>
<br/>
I have no problems with lurkers-I have some lists I<br/>
belong to that I rarely speak up on - I glean a lot,<br/>
but contribute little. However, I don't think it is<br/>
inappropriate (and I lean strongly toward saying it is<br/>
good manners) to tell the group you are out there. <br/>
Think of it as a conference call - when you sign into<br/>
a big telephone meeting, you may never say a word<br/>
during the meeting, but when you join, you are at<br/>
least expected to say your name and "who you are".<br/>
<br/>
The "reason for joining" is a relatively new yahoo<br/>
feature that just appeared out of nowhere not too long<br/>
ago.  I love it!  But no, you probably joined before<br/>
that feature was added.<br/>
<br/>
Here's one of the reasons I think security is<br/>
something more than miniscule but less than gargantuan<br/>
to take into account:  even though the list is closed<br/>
and you must theoretically join to see the posts, it<br/>
is possible to google a member's name and find their<br/>
activity on a list and even pull up posts.  Those<br/>
searches seem to be pretty transient, since the same<br/>
google results I got on myself last week are not the<br/>
same ones I got just now (I truly am NOT this<br/>
egocentric, but I have an ongoing curiosity about how<br/>
it works)  At any rate, it is very possible for<br/>
someone to stumble into our group without even a<br/>
slight interest in letterboxing.  <br/>
<br/>
Case in point, this very thing happened to me<br/>
personally.  I had chatted casually with someone from<br/>
another interest of mine for a little while, but I had<br/>
a series of computer problems and wasn't able to<br/>
communicate with them for awhile and never got back to<br/>
it again.  This person googled my screen name and<br/>
stumbled into the big list and subsequently joined<br/>
that list and this one.  They sent me an email saying<br/>
"they knew I still used my email address because they<br/>
had observed my activity on the letterboxing lists." <br/>
I have never figured out who they are or even if they<br/>
are still on this list, but the extent they went to to<br/>
track me down was disproportionate to the nature of<br/>
our previous correspondence, and that's a little<br/>
unnerving!<br/>
<br/>
Because talking about area boxes and talking about<br/>
possible plans is part of what makes a list like this<br/>
dynamic and lively and keeps people in the flow of<br/>
local letterboxing, I think that it would be difficult<br/>
to say "don't talk about who you are or where you live<br/>
or what you are up to".  The key has to be in closely<br/>
monitoring the membership.  Needless to say, list<br/>
security is only a start to maintaining personal<br/>
safety and each person has to be responsible for their<br/>
own wellbeing once they are in the field, but that job<br/>
would be easier if we can be more assured about who<br/>
knows what to begin with.<br/>
<br/>
So there, that's a little more of where this line of<br/>
thought comes from for me.  I want to stress still<br/>
that I don't see it as a monstrous problem, but I<br/>
think now is a good time for all of you as members to<br/>
really think about it and have some input into how you<br/>
want to see it addressed by your moderators.  As the<br/>
list grows, it becomes more difficult to say "oh yeah,<br/>
I know MonkeyToes, he's that really energetic guy,<br/>
isn't he?"<br/>

Lucy, I trust you &amp; Silver Eagle to set up whatever kind of screening<br/>
you feel necessary. I'm the moderator of a few small yahoogroups, and I<br/>
find that it's impossible to keep someone disruptive out if he/she is<br/>

Actually I think it's not too much to ask each new member to introduce<br/>
himself - that's what you would do in any other social situation, right?<br/>

&gt; for NOT sharing personal information as soon as they<br/>
&gt; sign up? <br/>
<br/>
That's my point though (obviously not well made!), I<br/>
wouldn't want the list to NOT be able to share<br/>
personal information!  BUT, if everyone is to feel<br/>
comfortable sharing personal information, they should<br/>
be able to know who is listening to them.<br/>
<br/>
I worry less about the lurker who has been on the list<br/>
for a few weeks than about the person who joined and<br/>
has never, in several months, even said "hello".  I<br/>
also don't worry about the lurker who says "hello" and<br/>
then fades into the wallpaper, never to speak again. <br/>
Everyone has their own motivation for being on a list,<br/>
and even MOST of those who fit into the "never spoke,<br/>
been here awhile" category are not a problem.  It's<br/>
those few, like the one I related in an earlier post,<br/>
that concern me.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I kind of equate it to a community.  What<br/>
would you think if you went to a gathering and some<br/>
guy showed up.  Nobody knew who he was, he didn't<br/>
introduce himself, he queued up in the food line, but<br/>
nobody saw him doing the stamping frenzy.  He never<br/>
introduced himself to anyone, never talked to anyone,<br/>
but he sure hung out with the group.  Frankly, I<br/>
personally would be pretty leery by the end of the<br/>
day, and if I were to run into him in the woods, I<br/>
would have to worry a little.  I'm betting some of you<br/>
would have an interesting way of dealing with that<br/>
situation, and I'd love to know what it is!<br/>
<br/>
Just for your reference, Eoghan, even though I<br/>
disagree with you, I do think I got more than .02<br/>
worth!<br/>
