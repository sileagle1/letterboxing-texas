after a hauntingly good time of letterboxing in Texas last week! Not <br>
only did we love the Great Book Adventure and the Snap Crackle and <br>
Clues in Memorial Park, but we even got to take in most of the boxes <br>
from last year's Halloween gathering in Telge Park! It was so nice <br>
seeing many of you again, and making some new friends in Texas, too! <br>
We'll try to write up a trip report one of these days, if things ever <br>
calm down around here a bit. Meanwhile, thanks so much for all the <br>
hard work that must have gone into those terrific gatherings - and for <br>
a truly phenomenal number of great boxes!!!<br>
Cheers,<br>
<br>
