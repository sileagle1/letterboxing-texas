Letterboxing doesn't use a GPS at all, which is one of the beauties of it!<br/>
Letterboxing is based on verbal clues which use compass readings, visual<br/>
clues, and landmarks.<br/>

                    <html><body><div>All you really have to have is a logbook of some sort, a personal rubber stamp of some sort, ink of some sort (ink pad or markers) and clues. Before you go out, you should read over your clues to see if you need anything else, like a compass or a map.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When you find a box, you'll find the box contains a logbook and a rubber stamp. You will stamp your stamp into the box's logbook, the box's stamp into your logbook. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Very likely, everything came out of the box in plastic baggies, so be sure to put everything back in their baggies, put it all back into the box, and seal the box well, without anything sticking out of the box. Rehide the box so that it cannot be seen at all, and above all else, be stealthy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Both <a href="http://atlasquest.com">atlasquest.com</a> and <a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a> have very good tutorials for getting started, as well as clue listings. In Texas, it's important to check both websites because some boxers list their boxes on one but not the other. Another good website is <a href="http://letterboxing.info">letterboxing.info</a> - Silent Doug's website.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm sure others will chime in with more information for you, and you will find that everyone does things a little differently; however, the above information is pretty universal. The keys to letterboxingare to be stealthy (don't draw attention to yourself while you are retrieving a box, don't ask rangers or other non-boxers for help, that sort of thing), courteous (rehide and reseal well), and to have fun - sometimes you won't find boxes you go for, but if you find a way to have fun along the way, letterboxing will almost always be enjoyable to you.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another caveat regarding boxes you don't find. Just because you don't find a box, doesn't meanit isn't there, so please - if you choose to log your finds online, don't mark "attempts" until you have contacted the placer. "Attempts" can be a deathcall for a box! I recently had a situation where a box was marked with an attempt by an experienced boxer, but it was later reported found by another boxer on the same day. I don't know whether the boxer who came up empty-handed might have gone for the box while the other boxer had it removed, or if she was just looking in the wrong place, but any number of things might have happened! Often, the placer will have a good idea whether a box might actuallybe missing or not, or can give you some insight into what you might be doing wrong in searching. </div>

 listings, there's an icon for whether or not it needs a compass, so if you don't have one yet, you can just skip over those for now.<br/><br/></div><div>There are lots of letterboxes and several letterboxers here in the DFW area.  I'm not sure who's up near Plano, since I'm over on the other side of the Metroplex.  If you like boxing, then you can always come to an event/gather to meet other boxers.  There was one just a couple weeks ago in Denton where we got to meet several of the boxers here in the Metroplex.<br/><br/>Hope that helps, and happy hunting!<br/>Rogue Artist<br/><div><hr size="1"/><b><span>From:</span></b> Kim Mayfield

There are lots of letterboxes and several letterboxers here in the DFW area. I'm not sure who's up near Plano, since I'm over on the other side of the Metroplex. If you like boxing, then you can always come to an event/gather to meet other boxers. There was one just a couple weeks ago in Denton where we got to meet several of the boxers here in the Metroplex.<br/>

<div></div>
<div>When you find a box, you'll find the box contains a logbook and a rubber stamp. You will stamp your stamp into the box's logbook, the box's stamp into your logbook. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Very likely, everything came out of the box in plastic baggies, so be sure to put everything back in their baggies, put it all back into the box, and seal the box well, without anything sticking out of the box. Rehide the box so that it cannot be seen at all, and above all else, be stealthy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Both <a href="http://atlasquest.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">atlasquest.com</a> and <a href="http://letterboxing.org" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxing. org</a> have very good tutorials for getting started, as well as clue listings. In Texas, it's important to check both websites because some boxers list their boxes on one but not the other. Another good website is <a href="http://letterboxing.info" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxing. info</a> - Silent Doug's website.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm sure others will chime in with more information for you, and you will find that everyone does things a little differently; however, the above information is pretty universal. The keys to letterboxing are to be stealthy (don't draw attention to yourself while you are retrieving a box, don't ask rangers or other non-boxers for help, that sort of thing), courteous (rehide and reseal well), and to have fun - sometimes you won't find boxes you go for, but if you find a way to have fun along the way, letterboxing will almost always be enjoyable to you.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another caveat regarding boxes you don't find. Just because you don't find a box, doesn't meanit isn't there, so please - if you choose to log your finds online, don't mark "attempts" until you have contacted the placer. "Attempts" can be a deathcall for a box! I recently had a situation where a box was marked with an attempt by an experienced boxer, but it was later reported found by another boxer on the same day. I don't know whether the boxer who came up empty-handed might have gone for the box while the other boxer had it removed, or if she was just looking in the wrong place, but any number of things might have happened! Often, the placer will have a good idea whether a box might actuallybe missing or not, or can give you some insight into what you might be doing wrong in searching. </div>

<br/>It'll take a little time to decide what you like and what you don't like in a logbook and a stamp and ink, what trail name and images suit you, things like that - and it's better to wait to invest much time and money in it all until you have a chance to figure a few things out.<br/>

<div>When I went to find my first box, all I had with me was:<br/>
<ul>
<li>The clue printed out from a website<br/></li>
<li>A stamp I carved out of an eraser that I found laying around the house</li>
<li>Blank index cards</li>
<li>A black stamp pad I had swiped from the office for the afternoon</li></ul>In reality, that's all you really absolutely have to have - and a lot of people start off with stamps they have laying around the house. I've learned since then that it's a good idea to have a wet paper towel or rag to clean the stamps off with. I've also gotten a compass since then too, but you know when you read the clue if you need one or not - so if you don't have one right now, you can still go find a box, just make sure the clue doesn't require a compass - on the AtlasQuest clue listings, there's an icon for whether or not it needs a compass, so if you don't have one yet, you can just skip over those for now.<br/>
<br/></div>
<div>There are lots of letterboxes and several letterboxers here in the DFW area. I'm not sure who's up near Plano, since I'm over on the other side of the Metroplex. If you like boxing, then you can always come to an event/gather to meet other boxers. There was one just a couple weeks ago in Denton where we got to meet several of the boxers here in the Metroplex.<br/>
<br/>Hope that helps, and happy hunting!<br/>Rogue Artist<br/>

<div>All you really have to have is a logbook of some sort, a personal rubber stamp of some sort, ink of some sort (ink pad or markers) and clues. Before you go out, you should read over your clues to see if you need anything else, like a compass or a map.</div>
<div></div>
<div>When you find a box, you'll find the box contains a logbook and a rubber stamp. You will stamp your stamp into the box's logbook, the box's stamp into your logbook. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Very likely, everything came out of the box in plastic baggies, so be sure to put everything back in their baggies, put it all back into the box, and seal the box well, without anything sticking out of the box. Rehide the box so that it cannot be seen at all, and above all else, be stealthy.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Both <a href="http://atlasquest.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">atlasquest.com</a> and <a href="http://letterboxing.org/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxing. org</a> have very good tutorials for getting started, as well as clue listings. In Texas, it's important to check both websites because some boxers list their boxes on one but not the other. Another good website is <a href="http://letterboxing.info/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">letterboxing. info</a> - Silent Doug's website.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I'm sure others will chime in with more information for you, and you will find that everyone does things a little differently; however, the above information is pretty universal. The keys to letterboxing are to be stealthy (don't draw attention to yourself while you are retrieving a box, don't ask rangers or other non-boxers for help, that sort of thing), courteous (rehide and reseal well), and to have fun - sometimes you won't find boxes you go for, but if you find a way to have fun along the way, letterboxing will almost always be enjoyable to you.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Another caveat regarding boxes you don't find. Just because you don't find a box, doesn't meanit isn't there, so please - if you choose to log your finds online, don't mark "attempts" until you have contacted the placer. "Attempts" can be a deathcall for a box! I recently had a situation where a box was marked with an attempt by an experienced boxer, but it was later reported found by another boxer on the same day. I don't know whether the boxer who came up empty-handed might have gone for the box while the other boxer had it removed, or if she was just looking in the wrong place, but any number of things might have happened! Often, the placer will have a good idea whether a box might actuallybe missing or not, or can give you some insight into what you might be doing wrong in searching. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Hope this helps!</div>
