I know it's been said but it really was a great weekend. I was nervous about going but everyone was so nice and welcoming. I'm looking forward to next year. I also have a question. I may have made a boo-boo. My mother was going on trip out west and offered to plant a box for me. I didn't ask where she was going (my parents go on `toodle about Texas' trips often and I get to hear ALL about it when they get home.) She just told me that there was a little museum that would be a good spot for a specific image. It turns out the spot she was talking about was at Fort Concho. After posting it I went to the site and found out it's a National Historic Landmark. Would this fall under the National Parks rules? It looks like it may be part of the Texas Fort Trails, maybe. I don't know what I should do.  Should I pull it? If I should, is there someone in San Angelo who might be able to pick it up for me? It's called `Operator?' status unavailable. <br>

                    <html><body><div>I think the question should be "Who OWNS Fort Concho?" and that would answer your question. The short answer is that it is owned by the City of San Angelo, so you're probably good. However, given that the site is a NHL, they might be a little touchy about a box, so you may want to see if you can somehow confirm their position on stashing games on their property.</div>
<div></div>
<div>After reading your question, I did a little quick research. I found that National Historic Landmarks are designated by the Secretary of the Interior, who oversees theNational Parks Service. It appears the NPS is responsible for keeping the list of NHL's and for recommending new NHL sites, but that doesn't automatically mean they own the sites.</div>
<div></div>
<div>That said, I know that after a location is designated as a historic site, there are pretty strictlimitations on what can be done with the location in the future. It's possible there may be rules addressing our type of activity, but I didn't immediately find that.</div>
<div></div>
<div>FYI, here's some good information about National Historic Landmarks:</div>

Thanks everyone for the input. I will change its status to available and see how it goes. Hopefully it will stay for awhile. And yes I did change my trail name. It was hard to walk up to people and say "hi my name is amazing". I had been thinking about changing it for awhile but getting to say it over and over at TALE7 convinced me. I know my new trail name is a little corny but its fun to say.<br>
