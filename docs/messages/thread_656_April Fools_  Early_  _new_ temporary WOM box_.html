This is no joke!<br>
<br>
North of where two Jesters meet<br>
A Fool lies in wait. . .<br>
<br>
Happy April Fools<br>
<br>
We have created a temporary WOM box (thru April 6th) to celebrate <br>
that deliciously silly holiday April Fools (a particular favorite <br>
when you're a 7 year old boy).  Clues for this box are hidden inside <br>
our Rabbit House box.  Because some of you have already visited that <br>
box and would have no reason to go back, we're just letting you know <br>
about it.  We won't be posting this new tricky (the trick is that <br>
there's no trick) box on LBNA, we're leaving it "unpublished", but <br>
you are more than welcome to share the location of the clues with <br>
any letterboxing friends or email buddies.  <br>
<br>
We've included a different kind of first finder prize than our usual <br>
bookmark, more of a treat than a trick.  Would love to hear what the <br>
First Finder thinks!<br>
<br>
Isn't it funny?  The Rabbit for Rabbit House was my first carving.  <br>
I was so proud of it, and now it looks very crude, especially <br>
compared to the intricate work of say the April Fools Carving.  I <br>
considered re-carving Rabbit, but decided to leave it alone.  I <br>
wonder how others feel about their first carvings?<br>
<br>
If all goes well, we'll be placing Back in the Saddle later today as <br>
well.  <br>

It would be one LONG days' drive. I should know- I live only 12 <br>
miles from Palo Duro Canyon and Houston is waaaaaay far from me! <br>
About 10 hrs or so, depending on stops and stuff. I'd love to make <br>
it to the Meet-up this year, but it's a long way. We'll be coming <br>
THROUGH Houston that weekend after a trip to Louisiana, and will be <br>
in San Antonio during the actual days of the meet. <br>
<br>
A more central location for TX would be Dinosaur Valley in Glen <br>
Rose... not that I'm trying to chase people away from Palo Duro. <br>
Palo Duro would be a great place for a camping-out meet, but it's <br>
just SO far from most of the TX LBers. While I understand fairness <br>
in having Meet-ups in various places across the state, I also know <br>
that it's best to have it in places where MORE people can actually <br>
attend. <br>
