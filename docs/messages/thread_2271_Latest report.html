The Honorable Mr. Tancredo should be a name familiar to most Texans - even<br>
if he is from Colorado.<br>
<br>
This report is pretty much up to date.  Many of the figures used are from<br>
2005.  Much of it is centered on TEXAS.<br>
<br>
I share this with you all because like me, many of you travel these areas.<br>
I just last month took a two-day trip across the Amistad Lake and Big Bend<br>
area.  You should be aware of the dangers.  Please take it for what it is<br>
worth. You never carry an umbrella until the weather man says rain.<br>
Likewise, being aware of danger lets you be better prepared for it.  You<br>
decide how much it means to you and your family and act accordingly.  If it<br>
does not apply - please delete it with my apologies for dumping it on you.<br>
<br>
While I do not seek danger, neither do I turn from it.  I avoid crossing the<br>
border, but I do not avoid the border itself.  I live my life as I will, and<br>
if a situation turns ugly I hope to deal with it.  This is why I am legally<br>
licensed and usually do go armed.  I am a warrior, I bear no illusions.  If<br>
confronted by something this organized my only hope it to take as many as<br>
possible with me.  I hope to stay in the fight at least till the ammo runs<br>
out.  However, avoiding this kind of fight if you can is the best policy.<br>
<br>
Finally - if this report bothers you as much as it does me, keep it in mind<br>
when you go to vote.<br>
<br>
Mike.<br>
