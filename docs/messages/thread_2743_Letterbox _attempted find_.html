<div>For myself, I don't note a box as missing until I hear it from either a very reliable boxer or several folks (or verify it myself).  There have been too many times when someone (and not necessarily newbies) report my box as being missing, only to find it right where I left it.  And there have been a few occasions when I myself would have thought I had done a perfect job of searching for a box and would have sworn it was gone, only to see that someone found it right after me or the placer verified it was in place.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since you aren't getting an answer from the one who reported it missing, try writing to the person who found it and ask them directly for feedback on the clues.  Was anything ambiguous?  Was something not as described?  Especially since they were a relatively experienced boxer, you should be able to take their feedback and decide what to do next.

<div>If I were to look at your clues (or any clues) and only see one "attempted", I would still look for it, unless it was an "attempted" on a box by someone who is notorious for not hiding very well.  I don't think one "attempted" runs potential finders off from a box that is planted by someone known to be reliable (like yourself)...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - I don't usually mark boxes as "Attempted" because I don't want to risk discouraging someone else just because I might not have found it.</div>

<div>
<div>When someone reports a box as "attempted" it can be the kiss of death for a box! I've also had that happen only to find out that they didn't exactly <em>attempt </em> the box, but rather ran out of time or energy and didn't <em>look</em> for the box. That happens to me sometimes on my series of boxes that are in the same park or on the same trail. People find one or two but not the rest and report them as attempted. I'd rather they just report the two they found and ignore the others until they've actually attempted them. That's kind of confusing, I guess.</div>

<p>I was only concerned that no one would even look for it since it had <br/>been "attempted". This has become a moot point in this case because <br/>the box was found saturday morning, by another new boxer by the way, 
<br/>The Bishop. I contacted him and he said that he had no trouble with <br/>the clues and the box was right where it should have been. So, I <br/>don't know what the other person's problem was. And, I wasn't <br/>
picking on that person because he or she is a new boxer. There <br/>seems to be a lot of new ones and that's a good thing. However, <br/>even when they notify me, a lot of them don't don't seem to be <br/>logging the boxes on either AtlasQuest or LbNA, so it's hard to tell 
<br/>the history of the box unless you actually go look at the logbook. <br/>The very first "governor" box I put out, "Price of Liberty" was <br/>first found this week by a brand new boxer; it was her first find.

<div>I've had folks tell me boxes in a series were "N/A" which I usually take to mean that they didn't get to them, but I've also had some mark them as attempted when they didn't get to them. I'm like you.... I rarely will mark a box as attempted even when I did attempt it because I figure it could have been "just me"! I do try to email the placer and let them know I couldn't find it though, in case they want to check on it or tell me what a "dummy" I was!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Whether there is a formal definition or not, there is an implied one:  If you actually go to search for the box and are unable to find it after following the directions TO the box, you have attempted it.   If you run into the bear or fall into the hole, that would be a "bad luck" category. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The problem with logging attempts is that someone else sees your attempt and thinks "WELL - Lucy didn't find the box, so it MUST be gone."  What they don't know is that maybe I have a pretty low find ratio of - say - 1 out of every 10, because I walk to where the box should be and if it doesn't wave and holler, I don't find it.

without locating a box.  I'm sure it must be right behind the next <br/>
tree. Sometimes I spend way too much time looking for a box when <br/>
there are others just waiting to be found.  On the other hand, I may <br/>
not even take the clues for a box that has been reported <br/>
as "attempted", thinking that I would be wasting my time looking for <br/>
it.  After this discussion, however, I have learned a couple of <br/>
things.  I'll look at boxes marked "attempted" a little bit closer, <br/>
giving more consideration to the attempter.  I may even decide to <br/>
look for it, just in case the hunter just missed it.  Also, I may <br/>
never log an attempted find as "attempted".  Instead, I think I'll <br/>
notify the placer that I tried to find the box and explain the <br/>
circumstances and how I interpreted the clues, then leave it to him <br/>
to decide if the box is missing or not.  Thanks, y'all.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whether there is a formal definition or not, there is an implied <br/>
one:  If<br/>
&gt; you actually go to search for the box and are unable to find it <br/>
after<br/>
&gt; following the directions TO the box, you have attempted it.   If <br/>
you run<br/>
&gt; into the bear or fall into the hole, that would be a "bad luck" <br/>
category.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The problem with logging attempts is that someone else sees your <br/>
attempt and<br/>
&gt; thinks "WELL - Lucy didn't find the box, so it MUST be gone."  <br/>
What they<br/>
&gt; don't know is that maybe I have a pretty low find ratio of - say - <br/>
1 out of<br/>
&gt; every 10, because I walk to where the box should be and if it <br/>
doesn't wave<br/>
&gt; and holler, I don't find it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although you can log attempts however you choose to do it, you <br/>

there was a<br/>

originally<br/>
&gt; followed them.  I could still see why I thought I was on course <br/>
the first<br/>
&gt; time, but I realized I missed even more distinct landmarks.  That <br/>

<div>I entirely agree!  I'm such a rabbit chaser that when I begin doing research on what boxes are located in Pittsburg Texas I might easily find myself following the path of the Shawnee Trail.  How did I get there?  Who knows!  But unless I have hours to spend, I tend to stick to LBNA.  If I go to AQ to find what boxes are where, I suddenly get intrigued by all the little radio buttons and check boxes and wonder "what happens if I click this?" and then I discover the Ryan Is a Total Goober webpage with all his adventures (have y'all ever read Ryan's adventures?  Definitely worth the read!  I live vicariously through him...) and then I realize I can look up fellow boxers and see what they've been up to, and then I can cross-reference what boxes they've found that I've found, and of course I need to check.....
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I like both sites quite a lot and I hope it never comes down to choosing between one or the other because they complement each other so well.</div>

I don't want folks not to look for it until <br/>it's<br/>&gt; &gt; loss has been confirmed, just because it's been attempted and not<br/>&gt; &gt; found. LSQ's box,
 "Pinwheel - Quilt Block Series" is nearby, so <br/>if<br/>&gt; &gt; you go to find it, I would appreciate if you would check on mine <br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; me.

<div>
<div>But... if I'm on a trip and my LBing time is limited, I have a tendency to ignore boxes that have been logged as attempted and try for those that had been found recently. Attempted doesn't absolutely mean it's gone, and if it's a box I'm really interested in, I will try anyway. I really appreciate it when the placer notes on the clue sheet that the box is indeed missing.  Viewfinder and I just found "Lost Marbles" in Marble Falls and it was reported as attempted recently, however the stamp was indeed missing.</div>

<p>I don't like to give up on a box. I hate when I have to walk away 
  <br/>without locating a box. I'm sure it must be right behind the next 
  <br/>tree. Sometimes I spend way too much time looking for a box when <br/>there 
  are others just waiting to be found. On the other hand, I may <br/>not even 
  take the clues for a box that has been reported <br/>as "attempted", thinking 
  that I would be wasting my time looking for <br/>it. After this discussion, 
  however, I have learned a couple of <br/>things. I'll look at boxes marked 
  "attempted" a little bit closer, <br/>giving more consideration to the 
  attempter. I may even decide to <br/>look for it, just in case the hunter just 
  missed it. Also, I may <br/>never log an attempted find as "attempted". 
  Instead, I think I'll <br/>notify the placer that I tried to find the box and 
  explain the <br/>circumstances and how I interpreted the clues, then leave it 
  to him <br/>to decide if the box is missing or not. Thanks, y'all.<br/><br/>Boots

  perhaps think <br/>again<br/>&gt; whether you really should use the attempted 
  label. I know I went <br/>and<br/>&gt; searched for one of Lucy Locket's boxes, 
  followed the clues <br/>perfectly and<br/>&gt; found no box. I was absolutely 
  positive. I wrote her a couple of <br/>days<br/>&gt; later and she wrote back 
  and said "Hmmm...my mother found it <br/>yesterday. Are<br/>&gt; you SURE?" I 
  eventually went back to find it and lo and behold, <br/>there was a<br/>&gt; way 
  to follow the clues that was MORE perfect than the way I had 
  <br/>originally<br/>&gt; followed them. I could still see why I thought I was on 
  course <br/>the first<br/>&gt; time, but I realized I missed even more distinct 
  landmarks. That <br/>was a<br/>&gt; brand new box and if I had marked it 
  Attempted, it's possible <br/>everyone would<br/>&gt; have assumed it went 
  missing right away.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I think we should lobby for the Bad Luck

  I thought that the 'attempted' was for a boxer that <br/>*attempted* to 
  find<br/>&gt; &gt; a box, yet was unable, due to unforseen circumstances, i.e. 
  a <br/>bear was<br/>&gt; &gt; blocking the trail, you fell down a hole and 
  couldn't get back <br/>out, but used<br/>&gt; &gt; your wireless to log the 
  attempt, etc. Then, when you went back <br/>and actually<br/>&gt; &gt; found the 
  box, you logged it as found and it took away the <br/>attempted status.<br/>&gt; 
  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; *(Insert a couple of hours time lapse 
  here)*<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay, so, to satisfy my curiousity and not 
  put my foot in my <br/>mouth, I<br/>&gt; &gt; searched AQ to find out what the 
  actual definition of 'attempted <br/>find' was.<br/>&gt; &gt; I found a very 
  long, drawn out thread that I wasn't about to <br/>read. Then I<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  got distracted in reading the Boxers and Briefs blog, then I got <br/>lost in 
  a<br/>&gt; &gt; couple of threads. Then, I did the next best thing and I posted 
  <br/>a message on<br/>&gt; &gt; the Stupid Questions thread. GT answered (I knew 
  he'd still be <br/>up) and he<br/>&gt; &gt; said there was no definition of 
  'attempted find'.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Okay, that is way too much

  a very<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; reliable boxer or several folks (or verify it

  Since you aren't getting an answer from the one who reported it<br/>&gt; &gt;

  anything ambiguous? Was something not as described?<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  Especially<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; since they were a relatively experienced boxer,

</p><div>Speaking of beignets, I finally tried some. Mom and I were headed to Dallas (from Bedford) last Friday morning and I said, if we are going to Dallas, by golly, we are going to try some beignets. So, I googled the Crescent City Beignets in Plano and she googled the hospital we were going to and we headed out. We only ran one tollway (I'm looking over my shoulder for the cops now), and found the place rather easy. I wasn't that impressed by the beignets but the Cafe Au Lait, OMG, that was so good that I had 2 cups. Breakfast for two was almost twenty dollars though, that was a bit much. We got eggs also. But, I am so happy that I can now say that I've tried beignets.</div>

<div>I agree about the problems of logging "attempted" for others who might assume the box is missing.  If the box is somewhere I could return to in a reasonable time, I'd probably not log it at all after the first thwarted attempt but make another run at it before I logged "attempted" and I'd contact the placer to let them know I'd tried, so they could also know whether or not it's possibly gone.   <strong><u>BUT</u></strong> if I've driven a long way (especially a difficult-to-<wbr/>get-to-place, like when we drove up Fremont Pass in Colorado over thick ice during a heavy snowstorm only to be thwarted reaching the box by way-over-my-<wbr/>head snowdrifts between me and the box and a snowplow bearing down on me as I contemplated trying it anyway) , or if I've made a long, challenging and difficult hike and I've followed the clues exactly and know just where the box is, but something really serious keeps me from actually putting my hands on the box (like the police activity that closed the access to the Rio Grande Gorge Bridge box in NM while I sat across the gorge trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile it to try to bypass the police barricades and helicopters to get the box -- before good sense kicked in and I postponed that find for another time), then I really feel I've made a valiant attempt at the box and just have to log <u>SOMETHING</u>.  I'd like that BadLuck button!  I think if the bear chased me, as long as he couldn't climb the actual tree where the box was located (meaning it's a grizzly, not a black bear who climb trees really well), I might still go back and get the box after a short break to recover my breath, so that wouldn't have to be an "attempt,"  only a postponed find, so I'd not log it at all just yet -- unless all of the previously mentioned conditions applied.  Then I'd just have to log SOMETHING if only to record my effort!  I don't usually take those "attempted" logs too seriously anyway unless there is a series of "attempteds,<wbr/>" and then I'm likely to give it a try anyway - sometimes those boxes just reappear!  Maybe those Beignet-Eating-<wbr/>Aliens who abduct boxes periodically, or those Letterboxing Armadillos and Coyotes who borrow them for awhile put them back later, who knows!</div>

<div>But... you have to be careful exposing your opinion, albeit only a sample, because someone may take your opinion and further develop it as their own, then flood the market, once again lowering the value. So perhaps it's best to store your opinion in a Lock n' Lock , post the clues to the box on the appropriate site and anyone who is interested can seek your opinion.

<div>And since we live in a Free Market society, we should also discuss this in terms of supply and demand.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the market of opinions, there is almost always a greater supply than there is a demand which, of course, drives the price down a bit.  That is, unless the supplier withholds their opinion until such time as they are asked for it, and then they can demand a little more for it than normal.  Of course we all know that if you wait until someone asks for your opinion it is probably going to be out of date, and by then, won't be worth as much because there may well be a whole new way of thinking.  So unless you are one who is able to hold your opinion until such time as it becomes vintage, your opinion is not likely to be worth as much as you think it is worth no matter what.  And if that is the case, perhaps it is wise to hand out samples in the hope someone will find it appealing and will ask for it before it becomes outdated and worth less?  But then, flooding the market with samples is risky because you may find that the supply once again outweights the demand!

<div><span>Ah Ha! Having just bought a house, I think I'm pretty savvy about this! The seller was asking three cents for his opinion, the buyer offered one cent, the sellers countered with two cents. Then after the inspection and appraisal, they settled somewhere around one and a half cents. After all, it is a buyer's market. I guess that means your opinion is worth a bit less right now in the current market than it would have been about a year ago. So the current trend is, unless you really need to give your opinion right now, it's best to hang on to it for a few years until the market improves.

&gt; &gt; Hey Boots!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For myself, I don't note a box as missing until I hear it from <br/>
&gt; either a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; reliable boxer or several folks (or verify it myself).  There <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; been too<br/>
&gt; &gt; many times when someone (and not necessarily newbies) report my <br/>
&gt; box as being<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing, only to find it right where I left it.  And there have <br/>
&gt; been a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; occasions when I myself would have thought I had done a perfect <br/>
&gt; job of<br/>
&gt; &gt; searching for a box and would have sworn it was gone, only to see <br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone found it right after me or the placer verified it was in <br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Since you aren't getting an answer from the one who reported it <br/>
&gt; missing, try<br/>
&gt; &gt; writing to the person who found it and ask them directly for <br/>
&gt; feedback on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; clues.  Was anything ambiguous?  Was something not as described?  <br/>
&gt; Especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; since they were a relatively experienced boxer, you should be <br/>
able <br/>
&gt; to take<br/>
&gt; &gt; their feedback and decide what to do next.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   Just need a little advice from the group: one of my new Austin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes, "Two for the Price of One" has been reported <br/>
&gt; as "attempted" on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AtlasQuest. The report was by a new letterboxer and, since my <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; (were my directions confusing? Are you sure you were in the <br/>
right<br/>

&gt; It's<br/>

&gt; &gt; HA!HA! My daughter was excited to see our efforts paying off. We<br/>
&gt; &gt; are going to try to find some in Austin this month some being <br/>
yours<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I was only concerned that no one would even look for it since <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been "attempted". This has become a moot point in this case<br/>
&gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the box was found saturday morning, by another new boxer by the<br/>
&gt; &gt; way,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The Bishop. I contacted him and he said that he had no trouble<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the clues and the box was right where it should have been. So, <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't know what the other person's problem was. And, I wasn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; picking on that person because he or she is a new boxer. There<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be a lot of new ones and that's a good thing. However,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; even when they notify me, a lot of them don't don't seem to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; logging the boxes on either AtlasQuest or LbNA, so it's hard to<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the history of the box unless you actually go look at the <br/>
logbook.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The very first "governor" box I put out, "Price of Liberty" was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first found this week by a brand new boxer; it was her first <br/>
find.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It was placed Jan. 26 and not even GG had found it. He must be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; slipping.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hey Boots!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For myself, I don't note a box as missing until I hear it <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; either a very<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reliable boxer or several folks (or verify it myself). There<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many times when someone (and not necessarily newbies) report <br/>
my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box as being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; missing, only to find it right where I left it. And there <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occasions when I myself would have thought I had done a <br/>
perfect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; job of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; searching for a box and would have sworn it was gone, only <br/>
to see<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; someone found it right after me or the placer verified it <br/>
was in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since you aren't getting an answer from the one who reported <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; missing, try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; writing to the person who found it and ask them directly for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feedback on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clues. Was anything ambiguous? Was something not as <br/>
described?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Especially<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since they were a relatively experienced boxer, you should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; able<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their feedback and decide what to do next.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (were my directions confusing? Are you sure you were in the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; It's<br/>

nearby, so<br/>
