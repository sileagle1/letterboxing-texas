                    <html><body><p>There are still quite a few boxers who have listings on Geocities (myself included), and while there is still a lot of time before the shut down happens, time will go faster than you think.<br/><br/>There are a couple of different teams from AQ and LBNA working on capturing as many geocities sites and contacting as many geocities letterboxers as possible. As you run across clues on Geocities (except Silver Eagle's - I know he knows and is working on fixing his), would you forward the box names to me and I'll forward them on as the teams get a little more organized?<br clear="all"/>
