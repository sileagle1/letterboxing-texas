                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with both BL and Mike.  I think right now each of us could <br>
approach Rangers in nearby parks and try to influence their <br>
interpretation of the rules to be more lenient by displaying good LB <br>
practices.  I also think this is not a long term solution for the <br>
reasons BL states.  If we ever found the right person or persons to <br>
talk with, I think our only chance for change in our favor would be <br>
to show a distinct difference between letterboxing and geocaching.  <br>
Since the current policy was designed for geocaching and probably <br>
would be difficult to change, our best hope might be to create a new <br>
policy just for letterboxing.  We would have to show that <br>
letterboxing is less destructive and intrusive than geocaching (no <br>
offense to geocachers) and convince them it would be a win-win <br>
situation to allow LB in their parks.  I hate to alienate geocachers <br>
and I'm not even sure how we would convince park officials that <br>
letterboxers deserve better treatment, but I think that is our only <br>
hope.  At this point, if we could just get the policy to no longer <br>
require future renewals I would be happy.  It would still mean <br>
filling out a permit, but a least it would be a one-time thing.  I <br>
would also like to change the wording of the permit so that the <br>
letterboxer is only liable for the contents of the box AT THE TIME IT <br>
IS PLACED.  I don't want to be held responsible for something put in <br>
my box at a later date.<br>
<br>
So, if we can figure out where to send an email, I would be glad to <br>
send it.  I would also be willing to help craft the message with your <br>
input.  Not sure if this would work, but it might get our foot in the <br>
door and lead to other meetings.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went into the TPW website a while back and went to the "contact <br>
us" section.  I posted a generic question about the policies toward <br>
letterboxing and received a reply from a lady (also rather generic - <br>
the reply, not the lady).  She referenced a policy which basically <br>
said that it was illegal to turn over a rock or step on a twig, and <br>
so, obviously, letterboxing would not be allowed in any state park.  <br>
I replied to the message by saying that we were not geocachers, <br>
referencing the LbNA website,  and telling the lady a little bit <br>
about us, including quoting our "Leave No Trace" policy.  I also <br>
asked if there was someone we could talk to, as a group, to present <br>
our case.  I've never received an answer.  If and when I do, I'll <br>
let you know.<br>
