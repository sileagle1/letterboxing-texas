                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with both BL and Mike.  I think right now each of us could <br/>
approach Rangers in nearby parks and try to influence their <br/>
interpretation of the rules to be more lenient by displaying good LB <br/>
practices.  I also think this is not a long term solution for the <br/>
reasons BL states.  If we ever found the right person or persons to <br/>
talk with, I think our only chance for change in our favor would be <br/>
to show a distinct difference between letterboxing and geocaching.  <br/>
Since the current policy was designed for geocaching and probably <br/>
would be difficult to change, our best hope might be to create a new <br/>
policy just for letterboxing.  We would have to show that <br/>
letterboxing is less destructive and intrusive than geocaching (no <br/>
offense to geocachers) and convince them it would be a win-win <br/>
situation to allow LB in their parks.  I hate to alienate geocachers <br/>
and I'm not even sure how we would convince park officials that <br/>
letterboxers deserve better treatment, but I think that is our only <br/>
hope.  At this point, if we could just get the policy to no longer <br/>
require future renewals I would be happy.  It would still mean <br/>
filling out a permit, but a least it would be a one-time thing.  I <br/>
would also like to change the wording of the permit so that the <br/>
letterboxer is only liable for the contents of the box AT THE TIME IT <br/>
IS PLACED.  I don't want to be held responsible for something put in <br/>
my box at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
So, if we can figure out where to send an email, I would be glad to <br/>
send it.  I would also be willing to help craft the message with your <br/>
input.  Not sure if this would work, but it might get our foot in the <br/>
door and lead to other meetings.<br/>

&gt; Mike, I understand where you're coming from (yeah, all the way from <br/>
El Paso<br/>
&gt; with not even a mountain top view of our state capitol).  You, more <br/>
than any<br/>
&gt; of us here probably, can speak from experience.  Here's my question <br/>
though:<br/>
&gt; what happens when the locals no longer have the leeway <br/>
to "interpret" the<br/>
&gt; policy?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In the case of the park in your area, and in the case of Mission <br/>
Tejas<br/>
&gt; recently, the locals choose to work together with us instead of <br/>
prohibiting<br/>
&gt; us.  Then there are cases like McKinney Falls, where the locals have<br/>
&gt; interpreted the policy in such a restrictive manner that no one but<br/>
&gt; dedicated locals can plant there, and in Fairfield, where they <br/>
apparently<br/>
&gt; went in and yanked every box in the park without so much as a <br/>
notice to the<br/>
&gt; owners.  Who is to say that tomorrow they won't all play musical <br/>
rangers and<br/>
&gt; every park will have new rules?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It is certainly more appealing to work with rangers face to face, <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; perhaps we should organize and actively do that, but I think we <br/>
also need to<br/>
&gt; be thinking about the eventuality of strongly worded, heavily <br/>
enforced<br/>
&gt; policy.  How can we get in their and guide it?  What CAN we do?  I <br/>
do<br/>
&gt; believe we would eventually have to face Austin ourselves, but how <br/>
can we<br/>
&gt; prepare?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Comments?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went into the TPW website a while back and went to the "contact <br/>
us" section.  I posted a generic question about the policies toward <br/>
letterboxing and received a reply from a lady (also rather generic - <br/>
the reply, not the lady).  She referenced a policy which basically <br/>
said that it was illegal to turn over a rock or step on a twig, and <br/>
so, obviously, letterboxing would not be allowed in any state park.  <br/>
I replied to the message by saying that we were not geocachers, <br/>
referencing the LbNA website,  and telling the lady a little bit <br/>
about us, including quoting our "Leave No Trace" policy.  I also <br/>
asked if there was someone we could talk to, as a group, to present <br/>
our case.  I've never received an answer.  If and when I do, I'll <br/>
let you know.<br/>
