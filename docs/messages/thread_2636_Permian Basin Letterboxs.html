Where are you from, Stormie?  I've seen your trailname on some of our <br>
Permian Basin boxes and was wondering if you are in West Texas, which <br>
has a few good letterboxers but could use more.<br>

Janet, Hey neighbor I am from Odessa, Tx. Love YOUR letterboxs! It is <br>
one of your letterboxs that got my 16yr daughter hooked. The Tequila <br>
Mockingbird lol! She found herself a stamp and is ready to go. We are <br>
heading up toward Lubbock and Palo Duro Canyon for spring break for <br>
geocaching and Letterboxing. Then next weekend she wants to do the <br>
locals. So be on the look out for Sky - black halloween cat stamp.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, Janet (Lone Star Quilter) and I (Boots Tex) both have <br>
boxes in Midland and Odessa.  Janet's brother, (El Lobo) has a lot <br>
of GREAT boxes all over West Texas, including "Tequila Mockingbird", <br>
so you can credit Sky's interest in letterboxing to him.  Good luck <br>
hunting and we'll be looking for Sky's stamps.<br>
