<div>Looks like I'm going to Colorado instead. June turned out to be a very messed up month for my girlfriend in Bangs. Between other people going on vacation where she works and someone retiring with NO notice.......geese...............they are short of people. She couldn't even get a couple of days off to make a long weekend. </div>

<div>I have a good friend near Grand Junction who is also a boxer and has a series to place around at some different places, so that will be fun. Her husband doesn't do anything that doesn't involve a fishing pole or golf club, so she's glad to have the company, and we haven't seen each other in a while. </div>

<div>Maybe Texas in November? It'll be cooler then anyway and I'll have leftover turkey to eat. &lt;eg&gt; </div>
