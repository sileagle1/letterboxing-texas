                    <html><body><div>I work with a lady whose daughter plays competitive girls' softball and they went to a tournament up on Lake Grapevine last weekend.  They played at fields on the Southwest side of the lake and were unable to play on several fields because they were underwater, not squishy, but UNDERWATER.  She took pictures of the water still there - unbelievable.  And it's raining - again.

<div>I'm curious as I watch the aftermath of all the flooding - Lake Ray Roberts and Lake Lewisville are connected by the greenbelt corridor (which, at this time last year, was way too low for enjoyable boating) and there is Lake Grapevine in the same area, and then so many other mid-sized and small lakes too.  I guess at some point their drainage areas overlap and they must all really interact with each other.
