<div>I would probably avoid any of the boxes that are located on the north shore of Lake Grapevine (Flower Mound, etc). I went up there today to check on my Moose Series and whereas the boxes may be above water, the trails are not. I was surprised to find the lake was inches away the trail and before long, the trail dipped into the lake and disappeared. Basically, we are unable to check on the boxes and it will likely be September or October before the water is released from the lake enough to allow the lake to recede to it's normal level. Murrel Park (the location of the MMMM last November) is closed as is the road to the park. </div>

<div>I'm curious as I watch the aftermath of all the flooding - Lake Ray Roberts and Lake Lewisville are connected by the greenbelt corridor (which, at this time last year, was way too low for enjoyable boating) and there is Lake Grapevine in the same area, and then so many other mid-sized and small lakes too.  I guess at some point their drainage areas overlap and they must all really interact with each other.

<div>I read an article last weekend that those lakes all empty into the same water "downstate" and since Ray Roberts and Lewisville have less capacity to hold more water, they are releasing them before they release Grapevine (which is still 20 feet above normal).</div>
