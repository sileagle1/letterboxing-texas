For my dog owning, ham radio, letterboxing, gun owning and geocaching<br/>
friends.<br/>
<br/>
I promised an after action report on our Geocaching - Letterboxing -<br/>
Armadillo Ham Radio picnic and camping trip to Abilene State Park last<br/>
weekend.  Sorry this took so long.  In my defense I can only say that I get<br/>
up at 0400, in to work at 0500, off at 1530, spend two hours overhauling my<br/>
jeep motor every day after work, then come home at 1800 and clean the<br/>
camping stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I took off from work a half day last week Thursday to get ready and pack.<br/>
We wanted to be on the road by 0500 Friday morning.  We made it out the gate<br/>
on time, but drug our feet a bit getting gas.  We needn't have worried.  Our<br/>
friends Brad and Cherry were running even later.  No matter - nobody's life<br/>
depended on it.  And we drove slow while they caught up.<br/>
<br/>
On the road we were in constant communication with each other on VHF, and<br/>
had the UHF radio on whatever DILLO radio frequency we were in range of.<br/>
Played a lot of radio on this trip.  And the ICOM IC-901A never missed a<br/>
beat the whole trip.  The repairs I did just two days earlier were just<br/>
fine.<br/>
<br/>
We had five Geocaches planned for the trip out.  Would you believe the only<br/>
letterbox on I-10 and I-20 from El Paso to Abilene is in Fabens Texas?  Yes<br/>
- I am sure of it.  I own it.  So there were no letterboxes on the drive.<br/>
But we did find the 5 Geocaches.  Three were just geocaches, nothing<br/>
special.  These two were particularly interesting.<br/>

<br/>
We rolled into Buffalo Gap - Abilene state Park at about 4pm.  Yep - 11<br/>
hours on the road.  A few hours were spent Geocaching of course.  The sky<br/>
was looking pretty grim, but we still had some sunlight too.  We started<br/>
making camp.  I was surprised.  Our new 10 man tent went together as fast as<br/>
the 3 man tent our Brad and Cherry had.  With the tent up and anchored, I<br/>
proceeded to move the gear into the tent.  Just got that underway when the<br/>
storm struck.<br/>
<br/>
Now - some will tell you this was the mother of all storms.  I will<br/>
disagree.  I have seen worse.  I have been out in the desert in worse.  But<br/>
not as a civilian.  However, I will admit that it was a formidable storm,<br/>
and I was glad to be inside a good tent.  The rainfall was about 2-3 inches/<br/>
hour, and hail the size of nickels.  I turned on the CC Radio to get a<br/>
weather report.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.ccrane.com/radios/am-fm-radios/ccradio-plus/index.aspx<br/>
<br/>
This is perhaps the finest AM radio available for under $500.  It also does<br/>
FM, TV audio, and weather band with alert.  The weather report was kinda<br/>
grim.  Still, we were on the outskirts of the storm.  It was pretty much<br/>
over in about an hour, and the sun came out again.  Briefly.<br/>
<br/>
I called out to Brad to see if he was OK.  They had flooded out.  We were on<br/>
the high spot in the area.  But somehow Brad was in the lowest point of the<br/>
high spot, and in a puddle.  His tent was light, so we moved him a bit<br/>
higher.  We moved out tent a bit higher too.<br/>
<br/>
Some folks rolled in right during the storm and sat it out in the car.  As<br/>
the storm cleared they got out, and started to set up.  Something was<br/>
forgotten, and one of them left to find a Wal-mart.  The other started<br/>
setting up camp.  Uh-oh... A MAJOR part of the tent was also forgotten.  And<br/>
the sky was clouding up again.  We kept refining out set-up, and Moni made<br/>
dinner.<br/>
<br/>
With dinner out of the way, we started making the beds etc.  The sky was<br/>
getting VERY dark.  Not sunset - but CLOUDS!  The Wal-Mart run came back.<br/>
With a whole new tent.  So we all pitched in and started getting it<br/>
together.  Good thing too, because here comes the rain.  We finished their<br/>
tent in a light rain, then went to our own tents to dig in.  This storm<br/>
lasted about an hour too, and it was dark before it ended.  We did a few<br/>
more things around camp and prepared for bed.  I set the CC Radio for<br/>
weather alert.  Good thing I did!<br/>
<br/>
About mid-night the CC Radio weather alarm woke me.  BAD storm coming in.<br/>
And it was headed right for us.  We had about 20 minutes before it got to<br/>
us.  There wasn't much to do but prepare to run for whatever shelter if the<br/>
tent went down.  Big storm indeed.  Wind.  Rain.  Lightning.  Hail.<br/>
Fortunately for us, the tornadoes missed us completely.  After a while the<br/>
storm passed us over, and I went back to sleep.  Here is the weather map.<br/>
http://www.bbelppub.com/Abilene/Brads%20Camera/WeatherMap.jpg<br/>
<br/>
Woke the next morning to the sounds of birds chirping.  I also had a<br/>
crushing pain in my chest and could hardly breathe.  So I shoved Parker off<br/>
me and sat up.  It was just turning gray, so I lay back down between Moni<br/>
and Parker and listened to the birds chirping.  After a while Brad and<br/>
Cherry stirred, so we got up and moving too.  Brad and I assessed the camp<br/>
situation for storm damage while Moni and Cherry made breakfast.<br/>
<br/>
With breakfast out of the way, we got our gear together for the<br/>
hiking/letterboxing/geocaching.  There were 2 letterboxes in the park, and<br/>
about 12 geocaches.  I wanted to do the letterboxes first so we would have<br/>
them even if we ran out of time.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=6601  was the first one.  The<br/>
clues were somewhat non-specific.  There was two ways to work it, depending<br/>
on which way you came in.  We picked one way.  It was the wrong way.  So we<br/>
started over.  Found the box.  It was destroyed! The log book... Well lets<br/>
just say it was WATER-LOGGED!  <grin>  We dried the stamp, stamped our<br/>
logbooks, then re-hid the box.  There wasn't much we could do for<br/>
maintenance.  <br/>
<br/>
http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/TX/BufGap/  was the next letterbox.  This<br/>
one by Silver Eagle.  It was the third one of his I have done.  I have<br/>
learned that he is either very tall, or he under-estimates distance.  This<br/>
one was no different!  <grin>  But we did find it, and stamped in.  Then on<br/>
to the geocaches.  We found 4 geocaches before it was time to return to the<br/>
picnic.<br/>
<br/>
The picnic was fun.  We learned that our camping partner of the night before<br/>
was Amy - W7AMY.  She was interested in the geocaching we did and we ended<br/>
up teaching her about it.  Visited with a number of the other Ham Radio ops<br/>
for a while.  Slowly it started to break up.  And we gathered around the<br/>
tents.  Amy and her family went out to look for a few geocaches.  We were<br/>
waiting.  Waiting for dark.  Waiting for this cache!<br/>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?guid=f82e6424-2660-4e49-91<br/>
9b-2c6f241fdfa1<br/>
<br/>
This cache has to be done in the dark with a flashlight.  The coordinates<br/>
leads you to the start point.  From there you shine a flashlight around<br/>
looking for a clue.  The clue was a very small reflector on a tree.  Go to<br/>
it and sweep the light around.  There is another one there.....  And on and<br/>
on about a half mile in the deep dark woods.  Good thing there were 7 of us,<br/>
it could get pretty scary in the woods at night.  But Amy's 5 y/o daughter<br/>
did most of the flashlight work.  And we found the cache.  WHAT GREAT FUN it<br/>
was!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Uh-oh....  How do we get back?  Did anyone lay in a track-log on the GPS?  I<br/>
didn't.  Well, nothing to do but start off and hope we can follow our<br/>
footprints.  Shine the light down the trail and what's that?  A reflector.<br/>
And another.  What a thoughtful cache owner!  Back out on the road in<br/>
minutes, and back to the tent.  The weather was nothing like the night<br/>
before.  It was pleasant, and we all sat out talking for a few hours before<br/>
bed.  Then at bedtime, I set the CC Radio for weather alert again.  And it<br/>
didn't go off all night.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning I had that crushing pain in my chest and could hardly<br/>
breathe again.  So I shoved Parker off me and sat up.  Moni got up and<br/>
started making breakfast as I started slowly breaking camp.  We wanted to<br/>
get home.  But more importantly, we had about 10 geocaches on the list for<br/>
the trip home.  Soooo..... Breakfast done - vehicles loaded, and on the<br/>
road.<br/>
<br/>
Moni stopped a few times for photos.  She is so lucky.  There was a huge<br/>
longhorn sleeping in a corral that she wanted a photo of.  So she stopped<br/>
the van and got out.  And that longhorn got up and came to her, standing<br/>
just perfect for the photo.  The photo doesn't do him justice!<br/>

&amp;.src=ph<br/>
<br/>
Chatting on the radio, we decided to skip some of the caches to concentrate<br/>
on some other stuff.  We grabbed one cache on the road, then ran to Midland<br/>
for lunch at Clear Springs restaurant.  Great seafood.<br/>
<br/>
After lunch we went to Odessa for a series of 5 similar geocaches.  This was<br/>
the first of the group.<br/>

16-489343f5d620<br/>
We did two other geocaches after the 5 in Odessa, then got home about<br/>
sunset.  Unpacked the van, and settled in for the evening.  Clean-up could<br/>
start the next day.<br/>
<br/>
All I all - a wonderful weekend.  We would do it again.  Without the rain if<br/>
possible.  If you missed it, you missed it!<br/>
<br/>
Next Saturday Moni and I are going to Hueco Tanks to search for two<br/>
letterboxes.  They are said to be the two oldest letterboxes in Texas.  They<br/>
are reported as missing.  We will see.<br/>

&gt; maintenance.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; it and sweep the light around.  There is another one there.....  <br/>
And on and<br/>
&gt; on about a half mile in the deep dark woods.  Good thing there <br/>
were 7 of us,<br/>
&gt; it could get pretty scary in the woods at night.  But Amy's 5 y/o <br/>
daughter<br/>
&gt; did most of the flashlight work.  And we found the cache.  WHAT <br/>
GREAT FUN it<br/>
&gt; was!!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Uh-oh....  How do we get back?  Did anyone lay in a track-log on <br/>
the GPS?  I<br/>
&gt; didn't.  Well, nothing to do but start off and hope we can follow <br/>
our<br/>
&gt; footprints.  Shine the light down the trail and what's that?  A <br/>
reflector.<br/>
&gt; And another.  What a thoughtful cache owner!  Back out on the road <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; minutes, and back to the tent.  The weather was nothing like the <br/>
night<br/>
&gt; before.  It was pleasant, and we all sat out talking for a few <br/>
hours before<br/>
&gt; bed.  Then at bedtime, I set the CC Radio for weather alert <br/>
again.  And it<br/>
&gt; didn't go off all night.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next morning I had that crushing pain in my chest and could <br/>
hardly<br/>
&gt; breathe again.  So I shoved Parker off me and sat up.  Moni got up <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; started making breakfast as I started slowly breaking camp.  We <br/>
wanted to<br/>
&gt; get home.  But more importantly, we had about 10 geocaches on the <br/>
list for<br/>
&gt; the trip home.  Soooo..... Breakfast done - vehicles loaded, and <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; road.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Moni stopped a few times for photos.  She is so lucky.  There was <br/>
a huge<br/>
&gt; longhorn sleeping in a corral that she wanted a photo of.  So she <br/>
stopped<br/>
&gt; the van and got out.  And that longhorn got up and came to her, <br/>
standing<br/>
&gt; just perfect for the photo.  The photo doesn't do him justice!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Chatting on the radio, we decided to skip some of the caches to <br/>
concentrate<br/>
&gt; on some other stuff.  We grabbed one cache on the road, then ran <br/>
to Midland<br/>
&gt; for lunch at Clear Springs restaurant.  Great seafood.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After lunch we went to Odessa for a series of 5 similar <br/>
geocaches.  This was<br/>
&gt; the first of the group.<br/>

6669-47c0-a6<br/>
&gt; 16-489343f5d620<br/>
&gt; We did two other geocaches after the 5 in Odessa, then got home <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; sunset.  Unpacked the van, and settled in for the evening.  Clean-<br/>
up could<br/>
&gt; start the next day.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All I all - a wonderful weekend.  We would do it again.  Without <br/>
the rain if<br/>
&gt; possible.  If you missed it, you missed it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Next Saturday Moni and I are going to Hueco Tanks to search for two<br/>
&gt; letterboxes.  They are said to be the two oldest letterboxes in <br/>
Texas.  They<br/>
&gt; are reported as missing.  We will see.<br/>

<div></div>Great adventure.  My letterboxing brother-in-law, El Lobo, who 
  lives <br/>in Midland, tells me that he has five letterboxes ready to plant in 
  <br/>and around Midland this week.  Too bad you missed them.<br/><br/>Boots
