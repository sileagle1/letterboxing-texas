McKinney Roughs nature program just part of day of adventure<br/>
Saturday, March 28, 2009 <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes you go to the store to buy apples, but you come home with Dutch apple pie. <br/>
<br/>
That's how it felt after a recent trip to McKinney Roughs Nature Park in Bastrop County. I signed up my two children for a two-hour Junior Naturalists program, for ages 6 to 10 (my 5-year-old was allowed to join). <br/>
<br/>
The program itself is an easy way to get kids looking around outdoors on the lovely grounds of the Lower Colorado River Authority's 1,100-acre park and natural science center. As it turns out, we also had a nice picnic and met a family who showed us all about "letterboxing," which is like a treasure hunt to search for hidden rubber stamps that you imprint in a logbook. Put all that together and our simple morning plans extended into an afternoon of exploration and delight for the children. <br/>
<br/>
Of course, outdoor discovery is the purpose of the educational park, as well as the Junior Naturalists program, which meets 10 a.m. to noon the first Saturday of the month, through May (it should start again in September). Cost is $5 per child (preregistration required). <br/>
<br/>
"We usually teach something of the naturalists' skills, such as journaling, tracking, learning how to research using field guides," said Erin Barker, natural science program coordinator. "The whole point is for them to learn about something in the natural world and get outdoors and introduce them to the park." <br/>
<br/>
We started at the Visitors Center, which houses a gift shop, an exhibit of small native animals (snakes, gecko, etc.) as well as classroom space. The center is spacious and crisply designed. <br/>
<br/>
Only two other kids, Sara and William Perkins were signed up for the Junior Naturalists, though up to 10 kids per teacher can participate. Parents aren't required to stay, so Rayven and Ed Perkins opted to go to the farmers market in Bastrop. <br/>
<br/>
Though topics vary, that day naturalist Louise Ridlon was teaching about camouflage in nature. She started off by having the kids make and decorate journals. Then we headed out on a short hike, until we came to a clearing where Ridlon scattered colored toothpicks. The kids had to find the toothpicks while doing relay races. (Ridlon, a former kindergarten teacher, knows how to get kids to burn off energy.) They did this twice, once over dirt and grass, and again amid dried pine needles. They counted up which colors they found the most/least of and took notes in their journal. Ridlon, who was patient when attentions wandered, discussed how animals that blend in with their surroundings can better elude predators and catch prey. <br/>
<br/>
"Would you want to be a red worm?" easily spotted by predators, she asked. No, they chimed. Then we headed back inside, where the kids designed camouflaged animals, using scissors, markers, etc. Artistic Sara, 7, created a tiger at sunset. <br/>
<br/>
That was it - short and simple. It would have been fine if our day ended there. We had gotten to roam the park and learn a bit. But the Perkinses, RV travelers staying for now in Bastrop, asked if we'd like to join them letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
That's when our day went from perfectly fine apples to sweet apple pie. <br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing (not a program of the park) is an international hobby where people hide small containers that hold a rubber stamp and a booklet. You can look up www.letterboxing.org to find directions to letterboxes wherever you travel. Rayven Perkins had printed out clues to four letterboxes in McKinney Roughs, so off we went. <br/>
<br/>
The kids ran excitedly ahead along the trails as she called out, "We're looking for a bench on the right" or "Look down the hill straight ahead for a stump." <br/>
<br/>
The letterboxes were hidden in trees and under rocks. We found stamps picturing Texas Gov. Edmund Davis, a bluebird, a fox in socks and a lizardlike critter, which was particularly hard to find because it came in a tiny film-size canister. The kids loved finding these hidden items. <br/>
<br/>
The Perkins family brought their own inkpad and stamp, picturing an RV. They stamped their own logbook and left an imprint of their RV in each letterbox's small logbook. (Letterboxing is similar to geocaching, but without the need for a GPS device.) <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Annabee, I guess my reply was focused on this particular article, and I didn't mean to be so quick to make a judgement, but your point is well-taken.  If there is a reporter out there interviewing letterboxers, the general rule would be to be careful about mentioning letterboxes by name or being too specific about a letterbox's location.  I wonder where the reporter is finding letterboxers who are willing to be interviewed for the upcoming article?  Could they be, as this group seems to be, home schoolers?  Does anyone see anything negative about this particular article?  What are the positive things?  I'm sure your point was that the park, McKinney Roughs Nature Park, was very specific and that, if the park management didn't like the idea of letterboxes in their park, this would throw up a red flag to them and put the letterboxes in danger, and you're certainly correct.<br/>

"The whole point is for them to learn about something in the natural world and get outdoors and introduce them to the park." <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We started at the Visitors Center, which houses a gift shop, an exhibit of small native animals (snakes, gecko, etc.) as well as classroom space. The center is spacious and crisply designed. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Only two other kids, Sara and William Perkins were signed up for the Junior Naturalists, though up to 10 kids per teacher can participate. Parents aren't required to stay, so Rayven and Ed Perkins opted to go to the farmers market in Bastrop. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Though topics vary, that day naturalist Louise Ridlon was teaching about camouflage in nature. She started off by having the kids make and decorate journals. Then we headed out on a short hike, until we came to a clearing where Ridlon scattered colored toothpicks. The kids had to find the toothpicks while doing relay races. (Ridlon, a former kindergarten teacher, knows how to get kids to burn off energy.) They did this twice, once over dirt and grass, and again amid dried pine needles. They counted up which colors they found the most/least of and took notes in their journal. Ridlon, who was patient when attentions wandered, discussed how animals that blend in with their surroundings can better elude predators and catch prey. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "Would you want to be a red worm?" easily spotted by predators, she asked. No, they chimed. Then we headed back inside, where the kids designed camouflaged animals, using scissors, markers, etc. Artistic Sara, 7, created a tiger at sunset. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That was it - short and simple. It would have been fine if our day ended there. We had gotten to roam the park and learn a bit. But the Perkinses, RV travelers staying for now in Bastrop, asked if we'd like to join them letterboxing. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That's when our day went from perfectly fine apples to sweet apple pie. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing (not a program of the park) is an international hobby where people hide small containers that hold a rubber stamp and a booklet. You can look up www.letterboxing.org to find directions to letterboxes wherever you travel. Rayven Perkins had printed out clues to four letterboxes in McKinney Roughs, so off we went. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The kids ran excitedly ahead along the trails as she called out, "We're looking for a bench on the right" or "Look down the hill straight ahead for a stump." <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The letterboxes were hidden in trees and under rocks. We found stamps picturing Texas Gov. Edmund Davis, a bluebird, a fox in socks and a lizardlike critter, which was particularly hard to find because it came in a tiny film-size canister. The kids loved finding these hidden items. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The Perkins family brought their own inkpad and stamp, picturing an RV. They stamped their own logbook and left an imprint of their RV in each letterbox's small logbook. (Letterboxing is similar to geocaching, but without the need for a GPS device.)<br/>

<br/>
The few times I have been interviewed about letterboxing I was hesitant to do it for fear of too much exposure.  It is a tough line to walk;  wanting more people to know about letterboxing, but not wanting temporary, careless boxers causing problems until they get bored with it all.  I usually end up doing the interview because I figure the article will be written anyway, so I might as well get my 2 cents in.  I always stress the fun aspects of the hobby, but temper it with cautions about being stealthy and low-key.  It is ironic that I have never been interviewed for a TX publication, but I know it is just a matter of time.  It is hard to criticize people doing articles about letterboxing when that is how I found out about it, but I still think the less said the better.  If somebody really wants to find out more about it, they will do so on there own, and probably be a good, long-lasting boxer because of it. <br/>

&gt; Annabee, I guess my reply was focused on this particular article, and I didn't mean to be so quick to make a judgement, but your point is well-taken.  If there is a reporter out there interviewing letterboxers, the general rule would be to be careful about mentioning letterboxes by name or being too specific about a letterbox's location.  I wonder where the reporter is finding letterboxers who are willing to be interviewed for the upcoming article?  Could they be, as this group seems to be, home schoolers?  Does anyone see anything negative about this particular article?  What are the positive things?  I'm sure your point was that the park, McKinney Roughs Nature Park, was very specific and that, if the park management didn't like the idea of letterboxes in their park, this would throw up a red flag to them and put the letterboxes in danger, and you're certainly correct.<br/>
