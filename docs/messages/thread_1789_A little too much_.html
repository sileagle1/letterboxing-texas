When I was a kid, I literally did not wear shoes<br/>
except to school and to Sunday morning church.  I<br/>
would manage most of the time to get to evening church<br/>
without shoes because our church wasn't very far from<br/>
our home, so I usually roamed my way to church during<br/>
the afternoon and met my folks there at service time. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Beall's Department Stores, meanwhile, were<br/>
headquartered here back when it was a family-owned<br/>
company and the shoe buyer, who was one of the Beall<br/>
descendants, went to our church.  Finally, after<br/>
several Sundays of me in no shoes, he pulled my dad<br/>
aside and asked if it would help if he passed some<br/>
samples along to me.  My dad laughed and told him he<br/>
didn't think I would wear samples any more than I<br/>
would wear the rest of the shoes in my closet, but he<br/>
could try it if he wanted.  To the man's credit, he<br/>
recognized a lost cause and didn't ever bother to try.<br/>

*****A kid after my own heart!  I really don't see the<br/>
point behind shoes - most of the time.  But...<br/>
<br/>
I was privy to a pretty gruesome foot injury last<br/>
weekend, so even though I hate shoes, I sure don't<br/>
want THIS to happen to me!<br/>
<br/>
We took the scouts camping last weekend, families and<br/>
all.  Saturday afternoon, the twelve-year-old sister<br/>
of one of the boys was playing near the water<br/>
barefooted (since the lakes have been so low, there<br/>
was beach to play on).  I told her to put her shoes on<br/>
(which, even as the words left my mouth, I was struck<br/>
by the irony - but I was wearing my scout hat and<br/>
scout leaders have to say yukky things like that<br/>
sometimes) so she was heading to get her shoes when<br/>
she stepped on a stick and the stick punctured her<br/>
foot between her fourth and fifth toes.  It came right<br/>
out and, being a puncture wound, never bled.  We had<br/>
the designated nurse (a real RN nurse, and a<br/>
wilderness trained nurse no less) take a look at it<br/>
and she cleaned it up and disinfected it and put some<br/>
gauze on it and told the parents what to watch for. <br/>
We had forgotten the incident because by campfire that<br/>
evening the girl was walking fine.  <br/>
<br/>
My husband called the dad, also a scout leader, on<br/>
Monday for another matter and the dad told him he was<br/>
in Tyler with his daughter and they were getting ready<br/>
to do surgery on her foot!  They surgically opened the<br/>
foot up because it had gotten very infected and they<br/>
left it open for several days to thoroughly drain it,<br/>
and only today did they sew her back up.  We visited<br/>
them last night and they said when the foot became<br/>
angry red and swollen they had taken her to the ER. <br/>
They put her straight into the hospital and all this<br/>
began.  The hospital staff told them that if only the<br/>
wound would've bled, it wouldn't have been nearly so<br/>
bad - so the old saying "No blood, no foul" doesn't<br/>
necessarily hold true!<br/>
<br/>
As it turns out - and this is probably important for<br/>
all us outdoor dwellers to know - ERs have been seeing<br/>
a lot of nasty lake-related injuries.  Not to a<br/>
specific lake, but all the area lakes.  Apparently,<br/>
since lakes got so low in recent months and many of<br/>
them are still not up to normal, some really gnarly<br/>
stuff is growing in them right now and cuts and<br/>
scrapes that are picking up hitchhikers - and not the<br/>
kind WE have fun with!<br/>
<br/>
It has made me re-evaluate my opinion of water shoes -<br/>
I hate those things but my family practically lives at<br/>
the lake for several months of the year, so I may<br/>
reluctantly dig my one and only pair of water shoes<br/>
out of the back of my closet!<br/>

<div><span class="253200605-01042006">I 
  find this so interesting.  I wonder if a piece of wood got left in the 
  wound.  Back before the Geneva Convention, there was a historical battle 
  in which wooden bullets were fired into the enemy.  They were less lethal 
  than the standard lead, but the wood splinters caused terrible 
  infections.  That period had no anti-biotics, so I will leave the rest to 
  your imagination.</span></div>

  barefoot.  In fact, I even wear sandals around the house.  BTA -
