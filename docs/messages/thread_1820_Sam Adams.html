                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to get in on the Sam Adams action!  That's my kind of patriot.<br>
<br>
My direct ancestor Sir Thomas Dewe arrived in Virginia in 1635.  Dews<br>
have fought in the Revolutionary War (winning side) and the Civil War<br>
(losing side).  They've played good and bad roles in our nation's<br>
history.  None of that should give you any idea of my politics.<br>
<br>
I'm with those who think discussing politics on this list is probably<br>
a bad idea as someone could easily take offense even where none was<br>
meant.  We're all very different people who share this one fascinating<br>
hobby.  Viva la diversite!<br>

<div>I have a patriotic side with a dark side!  On the one hand, I'm a 
  direct descendant of Martha Washington, and on the other, I'm also descended 
  from Aaron Burr...<span class="077141303-20042006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"> </font></span></div>

<div>In the interest of a good OT discussion, I would like to pose a question 
  (and this isn't an invitation to debate specific issues as I do think that has 
  some real potential for discord):  What makes an issue political?  
  I've spent some of today thinking "patriotism vs. politicism" and while I 
  think I "feel" the difference, I've found myself talking myself in circles 
  trying to articulate the difference...If you are inclined to answer, just 
  remember to keep it BROAD! <span class="077141303-20042006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"> </font></span></div>

<div><span class="077141303-20042006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">Hmmm...  interesting question.  My first thought was 
  "Simple.  History is in the past, and politics is in the present or 
  future. </font> <font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">But after 
  thinking it over, I am not sure there is a clear answer.  In reality, 
  everything is political and religious.  Every one of us was raised in 
  some kind of environment.  Our belief system is a combination of what we 
  were taught when young, and modified by our perception of what we learned 
  later on.  Most historical events were caused by a political or religious 
  event of some sort.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="077141303-20042006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">For 
  instance, my earlier reference to the British coming to dis-arm the 
  colonies.  I have read this account in a number of places, including some 
  of the federalist papers.  It was generally accepted that were they to be 
  dis-armed, there would be no further recourse but to submit to English 
  rule.  And so true, it is hard to fight against the best weaponry of the 
  period using rakes and shovels.  It was a good plan, if it could be 
  pulled off.  The British failed, and we are free as a consequence of 
  that.  In the 1930s the Germans pulled it off, and we all know what 
  happened there.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="077141303-20042006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">I 
  think that our political and religious beliefs cloud everything we do to some 
  extent.  To not be so would be to deny everything you were taught and 
  learned.  For instance, this statement.  God does not exist, Allah 
  is the only true deity.  For some, this is true.  For others, it is 
  false.  What makes your side of that statement more right than the other 
  side?</font></span></div>

<div><span class="077141303-20042006"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">Yes 
  - I am now convinced that there is no one right answer for your 
  question.  However, I do look forward to reading other answers.  My 
  beliefs are not set in stone.  I can learn more and make 
  changes.</font></span></div>
