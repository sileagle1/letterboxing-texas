                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to get in on the Sam Adams action!  That's my kind of patriot.<br/>
<br/>
My direct ancestor Sir Thomas Dewe arrived in Virginia in 1635.  Dews<br/>
have fought in the Revolutionary War (winning side) and the Civil War<br/>
(losing side).  They've played good and bad roles in our nation's<br/>
history.  None of that should give you any idea of my politics.<br/>
<br/>
I'm with those who think discussing politics on this list is probably<br/>
a bad idea as someone could easily take offense even where none was<br/>
meant.  We're all very different people who share this one fascinating<br/>
hobby.  Viva la diversite!<br/>

&gt; Fair enough! I think diversity makes for a very interesting group.<br/>

&gt; And I hope you'll let me treat you to a Sam Adams at the next gathering!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you say - things often run off topic.  And people often tend to not<br/>
&gt; agree.  And that right must be respect - both ways.  Typically, if I<br/>
&gt; disagree, I just delete.  There are people who's mail I just block as a<br/>
&gt; rule, not worth getting panties in a wad over it.  You also have that<br/>
&gt; ability, just as you have the ability to express yourself as you see<br/>
fit.<br/>
&gt; Those rights that your family members handed down for you. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess if I am found to be too far out of line I can be locked out<br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; group.  Life is too short to get panties in a wad over that  also. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Much of history is all in the way we see it.  I will not bother to<br/>
list what<br/>
&gt; my ancestors did for the country, I did my share myself.  I<br/>
participated in<br/>
&gt; 20 + years of history before moving on to an easier life.   Well, one<br/>
&gt; ancestor did get hanged - but only because he failed to accomplish the<br/>
&gt; mission and was caught. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nowhere in that post did I advocate anything about the NRA, other than<br/>
&gt; indicating that I am a member in my sig-line.   If it is NRA<br/>
membership that<br/>
&gt; bothers you, I guess we have a problem.  No different than your<br/>
mention that<br/>
&gt; you are DAR.  I think you read too much into it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Damn glad I didn't include the rest of it.  The Waco Fiasco. <br/>
Oklahoma City.<br/>
&gt; Lets not forget Eisenhower.  That was a busy day in history.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the reply.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW - I do like Sam Adams beer!<br/>

<div>In the interest of a good OT discussion, I would like to pose a question 
  (and this isn't an invitation to debate specific issues as I do think that has 
  some real potential for discord):  What makes an issue political?  
  I've spent some of today thinking "patriotism vs. politicism" and while I 
  think I "feel" the difference, I've found myself talking myself in circles 
  trying to articulate the difference...If you are inclined to answer, just 
  remember to keep it BROAD! <span class="077141303-20042006"> </span></div>

<div><span class="077141303-20042006">Hmmm...  interesting question.  My first thought was 
  "Simple.  History is in the past, and politics is in the present or 
  future.  But after 
  thinking it over, I am not sure there is a clear answer.  In reality, 
  everything is political and religious.  Every one of us was raised in 
  some kind of environment.  Our belief system is a combination of what we 
  were taught when young, and modified by our perception of what we learned 
  later on.  Most historical events were caused by a political or religious 
  event of some sort.</span></div>

<div><span class="077141303-20042006">For 
  instance, my earlier reference to the British coming to dis-arm the 
  colonies.  I have read this account in a number of places, including some 
  of the federalist papers.  It was generally accepted that were they to be 
  dis-armed, there would be no further recourse but to submit to English 
  rule.  And so true, it is hard to fight against the best weaponry of the 
  period using rakes and shovels.  It was a good plan, if it could be 
  pulled off.  The British failed, and we are free as a consequence of 
  that.  In the 1930s the Germans pulled it off, and we all know what 
  happened there.</span></div>
<div><span class="077141303-20042006"></span> </div>
<div><span class="077141303-20042006">I 
  think that our political and religious beliefs cloud everything we do to some 
  extent.  To not be so would be to deny everything you were taught and 
  learned.  For instance, this statement.  God does not exist, Allah 
  is the only true deity.  For some, this is true.  For others, it is 
  false.  What makes your side of that statement more right than the other 
  side?</span></div>
<div><span class="077141303-20042006"></span> </div>
<div><span class="077141303-20042006">Yes 
  - I am now convinced that there is no one right answer for your 
  question.  However, I do look forward to reading other answers.  My 
  beliefs are not set in stone.  I can learn more and make 
  changes.</span></div>
