Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
	Many of you use and enjoy our Texas State Parks.  I certainly do.  Some<br/>
of you have cultivated a relationship with your local park rangers, such as I<br/>
have.  That is good, it helps us Letterboxers, Geocachers, Hikers, and it helps<br/>
the TPWD too.  Well, some of us may be in a position to help TPWD some more.<br/>
This job was particularly suited to me, but perhaps others will want to jump in.<br/>
So I thought I would ask here.<br/>
<br/>
	Many of you know I hike trails with a GPS, download the track log into<br/>
my computer, then upload it to localhikes.com for others to enjoy.  I have 51<br/>
hikes posted to date.  Well, TPWD is trying to do nearly the same thing.  There<br/>
is a group of people in Austin working on mapping the state park trails.  This<br/>
will lead to other things in the future.  But for now, they need trail maps.<br/>
<br/>
	As it turns out, the work I did for localhikes.com is about 75-% of the<br/>
job.  The rest if filling out a short form for each trail, and changing the<br/>
track log format from .GPX to .SHP.  They even give you a free program to do it<br/>
with.  If you have a GPS, can walk a trail, and are willing to do it, you can<br/>
help too.<br/>
<br/>
	If anyone here on the list is interested in GPS, mapping trails, and<br/>
helping TPWD with this project, I would be most pleased to put you in contact<br/>
with the Austin folks.  I am not sure how many parks need help, but you folks in<br/>
the eastern areas could surely find some park in need of assistance.<br/>
<br/>
	It doesn't hurt to give a little back.  And it might even help in the<br/>
future.  Maybe more than you think right now.  You know how to contact me if<br/>
there is any interest.<br/>

This is something I would be interested in doing.  I have an <br/>
inexpensive GPS, and I am not sure if it's good enough for the <br/>
technology that you're talking about, but I'm sure I could figure it <br/>
out.  Most of the trails in East Texas state parks are relatively <br/>
flat and easy, even for us senior citizens.<br/>
