<div><em><font color="#0000ff">I agree - I've seen boxes that are uncovered and 
nearby leaves and bark pieces that were apparently left on them, but rain and 
wind probably uncovered the boxes.  And I've seen armadillos near boxes, 
foxes near boxes, and of course, dogs near boxes, and even squirrels can push 
boxes out of holes in trees, so sometimes it's Nature who forgot to Recover 
Well.  Finding a good out-of-the-way place that is less vulnerable to 
accidental visibility if the cover blows off is helpful, but just taking care of 
each other's boxes is necessary, too, if we're going to continue to have lots of 
good stamps and boxes out there to be found.    HMMMM.... Foxes 
Near Boxes ... sounds like a possible letterbox to me!  I do have the

<div>And possums!  I've seen those guys on the Bear Creek trail in 
Keller, where several of my boxes are, too.  I don't use wipes on stamps 
either, and try to make sure I don't have peanut butter or recent hamburger (or

sometimes that might happen.  And who could blame an animal for that!
