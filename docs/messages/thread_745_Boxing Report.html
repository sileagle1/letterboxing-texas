We took a wildflower drive today to Lee/Washington Counties, both to <br>
find a few boxes and hide some for others who might be doing the same.<br>
<br>
We hid Dragonfly Dos at the Nails Creek Unit of Lake Somerville SP.  <br>
<br>
We found Wagon Ho and hid Flower Power at Old Baylor Park in <br>
Independence (the wildflowers are beautiful here).<br>
<br>
We found Washington on the Brazos, Texas Flag and Texas Birth at <br>
Washington-on-the-Brazos SP.  Texas Birth had been reported missing, <br>
but it was right where it was supposed to be.  Not only that but, it <br>
(and the other boxes in the park) had had 3 visitors in the last week, <br>
including Wanda and of course, our mysterious Grizzled Griffin, who we <br>
missed by just one day.  We hid The Power of the Pen in this same park.<br>
<br>
Will try to post clues on LBNA and Atlas Quest later on tonight, when <br>
I unscramble my notes.  If you need them earlier, let me know.<br>

<div>Yes, in all of the LB's I found yesterday (3/25) in Jacksonville (Drgaonfly 
Springs, Picnic on the Green, &amp; Water from the Rocks) and Fairfield (Oh 
Deer!) , guess who was the previous visitor, just 5 days earlier?  Yep, 
 Grizzled Gryphon.  I always seem to be trailing along right after 
him.  -- Viewfinder (new trail name) of tx2chic.
