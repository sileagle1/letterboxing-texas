Just checking to make sure the party's still a go.  Could you please <br>
email me the address/directions?  Otherwise I could just wander around <br>
town yelling "Lucy... Lucy, where are you?"  That might work.  :)<br>

I was wondering how the recent salmonella scare will affect the Tomato <br>
Festival?<br>
<br>
Also, if you could recommend a decent, CHEAP hotel.  I'm thinking about <br>
staying over Saturday night to do some boxing on Sunday.<br>

<div>I hadn't thought about how the Salmonella scare would affect the festival actually - but it's my understanding they've narrowed it down to tomatoes that probably originated in Florida.  Also, they don't think it's coming from homegrown tomatoes.  And speaking of - my compadre at work has a huge garden and she brought tomatoes to work for us.  Two of mine were green, so I sliced them and fried them this evening!  I may see if I can get her to give me some for the party Saturday.  Really - everyone needs to have fresh tomatoes to take home!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As far as hotels go, the one definitely not to stay in is the Pine Lodge - cheapest place in town, but the wrong kind of guests!  Based on online pricing, the best value IS Best Value Inn on Highway 79 at $71 plus tax.  However, I believe my company has a corporate rate at the Holiday Inn Express, so let me ask my boss tomorrow and confirm it with him and the hotel.  Something about $55 a night is sticking in my head on that...Also, I'm betting you can Priceline a rate somewhere around $50 - we did it in Denton a few weeks ago on a very nice hotel.  The three to stay at would be Best Western, Best Value, and Holiday Inn Express.  Trade Winds would work in a pinch.  A park bench would be better than the Pine Lodge.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just got off the phone with SJZ and she's really looking forward to meeting everyone.  Jonah says he thinks he'll come hang out for awhile too.</div>

<div>I haven't yet figured out what I'm going to do with my Tomato Fest box, but I'll post it here on the list as well as on the sites when I know.</div>

 it's my understanding they've narrowed it down to tomatoes that probably originated in Florida.  Also, they don't think it's coming from homegrown tomatoes.  And speaking of - my compadre at work has a huge garden and she brought tomatoes to work for us.  Two of mine were green, so I sliced them and fried them this evening!  I may see if I can get her to give me some for the party Saturday.  Really - everyone needs to have fresh tomatoes to take home!</div> <div> </div> <div>As far as hotels go, the one definitely not to stay in is the Pine Lodge - cheapest place in town, but the wrong kind of guests!  Based on online pricing, the best value IS Best Value Inn on Highway 79 at $71 plus tax.  However, I believe my company has a corporate rate at the Holiday Inn Express, so let me ask my boss tomorrow and confirm it with him and the hotel.  Something about $55 a night is sticking in my head on that...Also, I'm betting you
 can Priceline a rate somewhere around $50 - we did it in Denton a few weeks ago on a very nice hotel.  The three to stay at would be Best Western, Best Value, and Holiday Inn Express.  Trade Winds would work in a pinch.  A park bench would be better than the Pine Lodge.  </div> <div> </div> <div>I just got off the phone with SJZ and she's really looking forward to meeting everyone.  Jonah says he thinks he'll come hang out for awhile too.</div> <div> </div> <div>I haven't yet figured out what I'm going to do with my Tomato Fest box, but I'll post it here on the list as well as on the sites when I know.</div> <div> </div> <div>How does midnight creep up so quickly every night?  I just want to know...</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><br/><br/> </div> <div class="gmail_quote">On Tue, Jun 10, 2008 at 7:25 PM, SandiBox &lt;<a href="mailto:sandibox@msn.com" target="_blank">sandibox@msn.<wbr>com</wbr></a>&gt; wrote:<br/> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid"> <div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> <div> <div> <div> <div>Lucy,<br/><br/>Just checking to make sure the party's still a go.
