Tyler today and got the boxes at Children's Park.<br>
Barely got Heart of a Child though, I was able to find<br>
one spot for me to stamp b/c that logbook was full.<br>
We attempted to get the boxes at the University but<br>
had the worst luck! The first one had two security<br>
guards standing right by the bell tower talking. We<br>
sat there for a bit to see if they would leave, but<br>
instead they just sat there then started staring at<br>
us. So we moved on to try to get the second box but<br>
they were setting up for some big luncheon. There were<br>
a bunch of people right by the place that box was<br>
located. So then we got in our car and tried to drive<br>
to the third and fourth box, but this cop started<br>
following us! I sware, wherever we turned he turned!<br>
So we decided to just get out of there. I'm sad b/c I<br>
know those boxes are being pulled on the 10th, but we<br>
won't make it back before then. :(<br>
<br>
Blue Butterfly, I have to tell you something that's<br>
funny. After the Children's Park boxes we went to the<br>
State Park to get those. Neither one of the logbooks<br>
had your stamp in it. My girls said "I can't believe<br>
Blue Butterfly didn't get these boxes?!!! We actually<br>
beat Blue Butterfly to a box!!!!!" They were so<br>
excited. LOL<br>
Then when I got home to log in our finds I noticed you<br>
were listed as one of the past finders. So apparently<br>
those logbooks had been replaced. Which would make<br>
sense seeing as how those boxes were planted about 3<br>
years ago. LOL<br>
The girls were bummed. They thought we had actually<br>
found a box that you hadn't found yet. LOL <br>

That very same thing happened to us when we went to find those boxes <br>
last year about this time of year. We were new to letterboxing then <br>
and I listed them as attempts. After that I found out not to list <br>
boxes as attempts unless you were really sure you were in the right <br>
place and they were trully gone as people will quit looking for them. <br>
We were planning to go back and find them but never got the chance. <br>
Maybe we can get them before the 10th. We will see. Lois<br>

letterboxing. I am hearing that the ticks are out in force but so far <br>
we have not had any bite us. Here is a warning I got through email. <br>
Thought I would share.... You can take it with a grain of salt and it <br>
will go down better. Adams Trails <br>
<br>
 <br>
"Please heed this warning. It could happen to you."<br>
<br>
TICK WARNING!<br>
<br>
I hate it when people forward bogus warnings, and I have even done it<br>
myself a couple times unintentionally. ..<br>
but this one is real, and it's important. So please send this warning <br>
to everyone on your e- mail list.<br>
<br>
If someone comes to your front door saying they are checking for <br>
ticks due to the warm weather and asks you to take your clothes off <br>
and dance around with your arms up, DO NOT DO IT!! THIS IS A SCAM!! <br>
They only want to see you naked.<br>
I wish I'd gotten this yesterday. I feel so stupid."<br>

found SEVERAL on all of us! It was gross!!<br>

No, no ticks, except one that Bird Dog found crawling on his arm. <br>
But plenty of poison ivy...<br>

<div><font size="2">I think poison ivy is becoming the kudzu vine of Texas. It's already so bad this year. Since many of us do a lot of our boxing in the cooler months of the winter, our boxes are safe when we plant them, but a couple of months later can present a much different situation! I noticed some of my boxes I recently checked on now have PI near them, so I advised everyone in the clues to just be careful where they step or reach. One word: Technu... don't leave home without it!</font></div>
