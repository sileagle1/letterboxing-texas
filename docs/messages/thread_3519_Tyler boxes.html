had the worst luck! The first one had two security<br/>

sat there for a bit to see if they would leave, but<br/>
instead they just sat there then started staring at<br/>
us. So we moved on to try to get the second box but<br/>
they were setting up for some big luncheon. There were<br/>
a bunch of people right by the place that box was<br/>
located. So then we got in our car and tried to drive<br/>
to the third and fourth box, but this cop started<br/>
following us! I sware, wherever we turned he turned!<br/>
So we decided to just get out of there. I'm sad b/c I<br/>
know those boxes are being pulled on the 10th, but we<br/>
won't make it back before then. :(<br/>
<br/>
Blue Butterfly, I have to tell you something that's<br/>
funny. After the Children's Park boxes we went to the<br/>
State Park to get those. Neither one of the logbooks<br/>
had your stamp in it. My girls said "I can't believe<br/>
Blue Butterfly didn't get these boxes?!!! We actually<br/>
beat Blue Butterfly to a box!!!!!" They were so<br/>
excited. LOL<br/>
Then when I got home to log in our finds I noticed you<br/>
were listed as one of the past finders. So apparently<br/>
those logbooks had been replaced. Which would make<br/>
sense seeing as how those boxes were planted about 3<br/>
years ago. LOL<br/>
The girls were bummed. They thought we had actually<br/>
found a box that you hadn't found yet. LOL <br/>

<p>Perky P, I did get those boxes quite some time ago. When I started boxes those were just about the only ones in Smith County. It's good to hear those boxes are still alive and well. It's pretty funny that your girls were surprised that my stamp wasn't in there. Although, it is hard to be FF in these parts now which is GREAT!!! </p>
<p>Puddle Splasher....glad you found the marker, using a  another  color just wouldn't work :)</p>

That very same thing happened to us when we went to find those boxes <br/>
last year about this time of year. We were new to letterboxing then <br/>
and I listed them as attempts. After that I found out not to list <br/>
boxes as attempts unless you were really sure you were in the right <br/>
place and they were trully gone as people will quit looking for them. <br/>
We were planning to go back and find them but never got the chance. <br/>
Maybe we can get them before the 10th. We will see. Lois<br/>

letterboxing. I am hearing that the ticks are out in force but so far <br/>
we have not had any bite us. Here is a warning I got through email. <br/>
Thought I would share.... You can take it with a grain of salt and it <br/>
will go down better. Adams Trails <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
"Please heed this warning. It could happen to you."<br/>
<br/>
TICK WARNING!<br/>
<br/>
I hate it when people forward bogus warnings, and I have even done it<br/>
myself a couple times unintentionally. ..<br/>
but this one is real, and it's important. So please send this warning <br/>
to everyone on your e- mail list.<br/>
<br/>
If someone comes to your front door saying they are checking for <br/>
ticks due to the warm weather and asks you to take your clothes off <br/>
and dance around with your arms up, DO NOT DO IT!! THIS IS A SCAM!! <br/>
They only want to see you naked.<br/>
I wish I'd gotten this yesterday. I feel so stupid."<br/>

No, no ticks, except one that Bird Dog found crawling on his arm. <br/>
But plenty of poison ivy...<br/>

<div>I think poison ivy is becoming the kudzu vine of Texas. It's already so bad this year. Since many of us do a lot of our boxing in the cooler months of the winter, our boxes are safe when we plant them, but a couple of months later can present a much different situation! I noticed some of my boxes I recently checked on now have PI near them, so I advised everyone in the clues to just be careful where they step or reach. One word: Technu... don't leave home without it!</div>
