<div>Good luck to you.  We planted our first box 
about 2 weeks ago and it is already missing.  I am so discouraged.  I 
haven't been able to find anywhere to hide another box.  I don't trust any

The more boxes you find, the more you'll notice what<br/>
makes a good hiding place, but the more boxes you<br/>
plant, the more you will understand what it takes to<br/>
get a box into a good hiding place.  Many of us lost<br/>
our first time boxes, and it isn't much fun, but you<br/>
just have to accept it as part of learning the game.  <br/>
<br/>
I would suggest that you not put an intricate primo<br/>
stamp in a first box - put something simple, so that<br/>
if you lose it you can either recarve it or you can<br/>
just let it go and not worry about it.<br/>
<br/>
Our very first box went missing at some point and we<br/>
didn't replace it until last weekend.  I had taken an<br/>
image of the original when we placed it, so I had<br/>
something to go by as I recarved it.  We had to really<br/>
laugh, because back then we really weren't getting the<br/>
idea behind positive and negative space on a stamp and<br/>
the first one was awful!  I'm almost glad it went<br/>
missing!  I did realize that I hadn't accounted for<br/>
people coming along and cleaning the area, which I'm<br/>
sure is what happened to the box.  I rehid it in the<br/>
same place temporarily, but will be moving it -<br/>
probably this weekend to a safer spot.  <br/>
<br/>
Everyone worries about learning to carve, but equally<br/>
important is learning to hide.  Your first carvings<br/>
won't be your best, and your first hides won't be<br/>
great either.  Accept it and keep on trying!<br/>

<p><span>My earliest boxes seem to be the ones that
