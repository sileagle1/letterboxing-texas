<div> </div>
<div>Here's what we were thinking - rather than having a formal gathering, perhaps we could designate a particular day as "Boxing in ___________" day and we can just all show up there and box for awhile, then meet up later at a restaurant or somewhere for dinner or dessert or whatever, and to compare the day.  Our first thought was Nacogdoches, since most of us around here have either never boxed Nac or still have a good number of boxes in Nac we haven't gotten (even with Lucy Locket moved away, I still have a healthy backlog of unfound boxes in Nac - guess it wasn't all her fault after all!).  My mom, TrailCat, the consummate planner would probably have some suggestions about where we could meet up.

<div>Another idea we had tried to work out last year was to go into the far upper East Texas area and seed it.  It seems like it is filling up nicely in that area now though!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Not being a formal gathering, we wouldn't have to worry so much about weather, pavilions, RSVP lists, that sort of thing.  If we have new boxers that would want to tag along with old boxers, we could probably arrange that.  And not having to worry about logistics, we could repeat the event in another town fairly quickly (Tyler comes to mind).
