But characters... we have ghosts, bears, army men, clowns, boots, barefeet, mothers of many, cartoon characters, quilters, butterflies, gryzzled things, grannys, eagles, kokopelis, lions, mothers, a dog or two, and on and on and on. It could be fun to see how people define themselves - either portraits or characterizations would work.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You got it, PS, and it's quite a compliment coming from you, an accomplished artist and outstanding carver!  The Texians said they'd pass along the picture when they get it.  I've been trying to get them to put out another series of boxes, but haven't had much luck.  When is the new "Crazy Texas Letterboxer Bus (or Jeep)" going to start its journey?<br>
