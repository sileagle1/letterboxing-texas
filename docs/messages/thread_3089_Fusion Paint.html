</p><div>I took Dewberry's advice and decided to use the Krylon fusion paint on my letterboxes instead of camo tape. I went to our local Home Depot and Lowe's and neither of them carry Krylon paints, so then I stopped by Walmart. The kid working in the paint department asked if he could help me and I asked if he had Krylon fusion paint, and he said he thought so. He was so proud when he reached up and found it and handed it to me. I asked him why he was handing me a can of Krylon purple paint and he asked, "isn't <em>fusion</em> purple"? Realizing what he was thinking, I replied, no that's "fuchsia". It was really hard not to laugh because he was being so helpful. Anyway, we found the fusion paint in green and black, so I'm about to give it a try!</div>
