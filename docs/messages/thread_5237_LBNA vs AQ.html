Some people post clues on www.letterboxing.org and some post on www.atlasquest.com.  Some people do both for the same box.  What are the reasons to choose one over the other?  If you post only to one, do you try to remain loyal to that site?  I guess my inclination would be to post on both - except I see how that could be more time-consuming if you have a lot of plants.  And are there other places to find clues other than these two sites?<br/>

But I prefer AQ with its ease of use and social aspect which helps if you need stamps donated or questions answered in a various of ways from sarcastic to just plane rude, to truly helpful. LBNA seems harder to navigate when searching for boxes on a vacation when I don't know counties... You can find boxes on some boxers blogs but they are few and in between now days with the amount on aq and lbna. </span></div><div><span>~Dawns Glory~</span></div><div><br/></div> <div> <div> <div dir="ltr"> <hr size="1"/>  <b><span>From:</span></b> Charlotte &lt;cpease@austin.rr.com&gt;<br/> <b><span>To:</span></b> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com <br/> <b><span>Sent:</span></b> Monday, August 12, 2013 5:32 PM<br/> <b><span>Subject:</span></b> [letterboxingtexas] LBNA vs AQ<br/>  </div> <div class="y_msg_container"><br/><div id="yiv8813062861">
