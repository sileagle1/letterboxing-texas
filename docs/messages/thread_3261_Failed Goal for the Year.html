                    <html><body><div>Well I had a goal.  I realized earlier this week that I was very close to a milestone and I wanted to make it before the end of the year and ride the year out at 300 boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now believe it or not, I still haven't hit 300.  I know quite a few of y'all started boxing well after I did and hit 300 long ago.  Not me though.  In my defense, the first two years I boxed were sparse in East Texas and any boxes were well away from me so that it required a fairly long trip to garner one box.  The two years since have certainly seen box prosperity in my area and it has been wonderful, but I just can't seem to bound around and snag up double digit boxes in one day - ,my crew and I always seem to get distracted or wrapped up with something else in the course of a run, so that we have to admit to ourselves that our daily goal was too ambitious.  Sometimes I envy the folks who can make those mad runs, and maybe one of these days I'll actually make a marathon run with JBK and Wag Time.  Other times I remember that I like the pace we box at - it's just no good for getting numbers.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So today SJZ and RXKaffee showed up with Baby Jonah just as I was walking out the door to go and get my last two boxes for the year.  I had decided I would just grab the closest two I could find and call it good.  Well of course I couldn't leave when Jonah arrived, so I sat back down and resolved that I would get out there after they left, but they stayed, and stayed, and stayed.  As I was talking to them, I mentioned to RXKaffee that I had to get two more boxes this year to put me at a smooth 300.  Now SJZ and I have taken RXKaffee on a couple of wild night box runs and it sort of tickled him what we do, but he's not one you would find boxing on his own.  And yet the question he asked stopped me in my tracks "So do you have a really cool box picked out to be your #300?"  Well no I hadn't, and that's when I realized I was shooting for the number, not really for the memory.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I remember hitting 100 on Lucy Locket's Land of the Little Angel.  I remember hitting 200 on Gryzzled Gryphon's Disappearing Railroad Blues.  I want to remember #300 too, and I want it to be a really cool box.  Going for numbers hasn't been my style so far and it isn' going to be my style as I move forward.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I'm not going to make my goal this year, but you know, that's okay.  I may not be the fastest letterboxer, or the most prolific, or the most creative, but I enjoy the heck out of it and I letterbox the way I want to do it.  I'll save 300 for next year, when I've had a chance to figure out which box deserves the honors.

<div>Thanks to y'all for making the game a lot of fun, and isn't it nice that every one of us can play it like we like it?<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
