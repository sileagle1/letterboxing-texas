<br>
Kudos and many standing ovations to BreathofLife and TrillionGrams for putting together this great event revolving around a great series of books and movies. *ahem, I have only read The Hobbit and a portion of The Fellowship - I am shamed!*<br>
<br>
It was also so very nice to meet new boxers and visit with ones I've previously met.<br>
<br>
FYI: For those of you who have gotten all of my personal travelers, they are all listed correctly (and with new clues) on AtlasQuest. Log away!<br>
<br>
Question: I picked up two stamps and a cootie (thank heavens I got rid of that one and others and didn't seem to be harboring a stowaway until I really look). The stamps - and I'm wondering what the names are for logging purposes - are the ring (I know this is yours BOL or TG because I didn't get Batty's version) and the JRT. The cootie is the Scary Owl and I just want to make sure this hasn't been posted on AQ yet. Oh wonderful boxers, let me know when these are up!<br>
<br>
Hope to see you all (and more) again soon! And by soon, it'll probably be a year. Won't make it to the next TALE (boo).<br>
<br>
Anyway, long post even longer... Thanks again for this great event. Well done!<br>
