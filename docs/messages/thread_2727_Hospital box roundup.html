                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have it on my heart to organize a special letterbox series for the <br>
patients at a major children's hospital in Fort Worth, Tx. My LBing <br>
partner (the peas) and I have met with the events coordinator and she <br>
is thrilled. She tells me that there is a lull in activities in the <br>
summer months so the timing is right on. She also informs me that the <br>
children have a really hard time adjusting once they are in <br>
outpatient. Many are no longer able to participate in activities they <br>
once enjoyed and the community at large doesn't understand the life <br>
changing aspects of their experiences. Letterboxing could serve as a <br>
link to the outside world. Something fun they were introduced to <br>
during treatment and an activity they could continue with after they <br>
go home whatever state/region that may be. <br>
<br>
I plan on planting around 30 boxes within and around the hospital <br>
some will even be carried by staff and will be accessed using secret <br>
code words :) The staff will be teaching the children about the <br>
letterboxes and handing out the clues. They might even hold some <br>
craft days to create their signature stamps for the older kids and <br>
there was some talk about possibly expanding this to a special summer <br>
hospital camp. These boxes will NOT be open to the public and the <br>
clues will NOT be posted outside of the hospital. I will post the <br>
letterbox so the families can log their finds and contact the box <br>
creator but NO clues will be given.<br>
<br>
I am asking for anyone who would like to contribute boxes to sign the <br>
Hospital RoundUp tracker on AQ. I need complete boxes. Stamp, logbook <br>
(please be sure to include your name and the state you reside for the <br>
children to see!) *small stamp pad* and a box or a couple of dollars <br>
so I can purchase a box for your contribution. These boxes will be <br>
larger than typical about sandwich size because sterile wipes must <br>
be included. The stamps can be a bit larger for this reason if you <br>
would like. Also, since most will not be in the wild there is no need <br>
for LnL or even camo tape. I need them to be images that children are <br>
familiar with. Cartoon characters, storybook characters, favorite <br>
toys or treats I will need 30 different images, 10 for tiny wees, 10 <br>
for elementary age and 10 for older kids. I would like to have all <br>
the boxes in my possession for planting in one month (by May 31)<br>
<br>
If you are interested and would like to be a part of this special <br>
letterboxing "event" please sign the tracker and send me a message <br>
with your box idea -I will be moderating box submissions so as not to <br>
have duplicates and I will be contacting the participants with <br>
specific details.<br>
<br>
P.S. I will be carving a special thank you stamp for everyone who <br>
signs up to help. It will either be sent on an index card or will be <br>
a single postal letterbox I haven't decided.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
