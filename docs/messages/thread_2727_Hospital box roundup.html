                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have it on my heart to organize a special letterbox series for the <br/>
patients at a major children's hospital in Fort Worth, Tx. My LBing <br/>
partner (the peas) and I have met with the events coordinator and she <br/>
is thrilled. She tells me that there is a lull in activities in the <br/>
summer months so the timing is right on. She also informs me that the <br/>
children have a really hard time adjusting once they are in <br/>
outpatient. Many are no longer able to participate in activities they <br/>
once enjoyed and the community at large doesn't understand the life <br/>
changing aspects of their experiences. Letterboxing could serve as a <br/>
link to the outside world. Something fun they were introduced to <br/>
during treatment and an activity they could continue with after they <br/>
go home whatever state/region that may be. <br/>
<br/>
I plan on planting around 30 boxes within and around the hospital <br/>
some will even be carried by staff and will be accessed using secret <br/>
code words :) The staff will be teaching the children about the <br/>
letterboxes and handing out the clues. They might even hold some <br/>
craft days to create their signature stamps for the older kids and <br/>
there was some talk about possibly expanding this to a special summer <br/>
hospital camp. These boxes will NOT be open to the public and the <br/>
clues will NOT be posted outside of the hospital. I will post the <br/>
letterbox so the families can log their finds and contact the box <br/>
creator but NO clues will be given.<br/>
<br/>
I am asking for anyone who would like to contribute boxes to sign the <br/>
Hospital RoundUp tracker on AQ. I need complete boxes. Stamp, logbook <br/>
(please be sure to include your name and the state you reside for the <br/>
children to see!) *small stamp pad* and a box or a couple of dollars <br/>
so I can purchase a box for your contribution. These boxes will be <br/>
larger than typical about sandwich size because sterile wipes must <br/>
be included. The stamps can be a bit larger for this reason if you <br/>
would like. Also, since most will not be in the wild there is no need <br/>
for LnL or even camo tape. I need them to be images that children are <br/>
familiar with. Cartoon characters, storybook characters, favorite <br/>
toys or treats I will need 30 different images, 10 for tiny wees, 10 <br/>
for elementary age and 10 for older kids. I would like to have all <br/>
the boxes in my possession for planting in one month (by May 31)<br/>
<br/>
If you are interested and would like to be a part of this special <br/>
letterboxing "event" please sign the tracker and send me a message <br/>
with your box idea -I will be moderating box submissions so as not to <br/>
have duplicates and I will be contacting the participants with <br/>
specific details.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. I will be carving a special thank you stamp for everyone who <br/>
signs up to help. It will either be sent on an index card or will be <br/>
a single postal letterbox I haven't decided.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
