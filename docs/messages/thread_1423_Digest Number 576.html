I meant Lucy ... <br/>
Saw her face ... knew the stamp and somehow, "Ruby"<br/>
came out of my fingers.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Ruby, I'll keep my eyes peeled for your clues.<br/>
And it was AWESOME to meet you - infact to meet<br/>
everyone that I did.<br/>
<br/>
Now, Ms LUCY!<br/>
Could you email me your clues for the box you planted<br/>
at lake bardwell? (lennire @ yahoo.com) Or are they up<br/>
on LBNA (what's the name of the box if so)?<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to confuse!<br/>

&gt; Hey, Lena - it was such fun to meet you - I'm very<br/>
&gt; impressed with your<br/>
&gt; demonstration and am practicing diligently for the<br/>
&gt; next gathering;-)!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We planted the SuperCollider box near Boz, outside<br/>
&gt; of Waxahachie (clues on<br/>
&gt; LbNA) and we have permission to plant the box that<br/>
&gt; CactusLicker calls "The<br/>
&gt; Haunted Catfish" - but no box ready and no clues up<br/>
&gt; yet.<br/>
&gt; The Scarlet Pimpernel box is planted, but clues are<br/>
&gt; not quite ready. <br/>

<div>So Lena, are you going to post them on AQ also?  You know, you can 
post them on both sites at the same time if you do it on AQ first and check the 
boxes correctly (which I don't always remember to do).  We enjoyed finding 
your boxes - but I missed out on the meringue bones!  Maybe next 
time!  -- Viewfinder</div>

<div>I guess carving that stamp and making that box for the JEN gathering got 
me going - I carved 4 more stamps this week for new boxes I've been planning, 
and today my VKS (that would be Very Kind Spouse) hiked all over trails around 
Lake Grapevine and Southlake with me, planting them and then reading my clues to 
see if they make sense.  Still have one more ready to go but just haven't 
decided on its home yet - soon, I hope!  Also, I've done a little box 
maintenance since some of my smaller logbooks have been reported as full (or 
nearly so), so I've replaced logbooks in Lauren's Turtle and Meghan's Bird 
(Grapevine Heritage Park) and Lonesome Dove (Southlake) and have a few more 
ready to replace soon.  These are now Logbook II, but the boxes remain in 
the same locations. </div>
<div>    Also, last Monday, Puddle-Splasher and I drove 
all over the DFW area locating all the boxes for A League of Their Own 
(Puddle-Splasher was a little obsessed with those clues and once we got 
going on that series, we couldn't stop - a truly inspired series!   
Great work, Mater Et Regisfilia!)   But we recommend not doing them 
all in a single day, what with traffic and all in Dallas and Ft Worth and just 
about everywhere in between.  We each set a personal record, 12 finds 
in a single day including a HH - probably not a record we'll attempt to repeat 
anytime soon!  -- Viewfinder<br/></div></div>
