</p><div>It's finally gotten hot enough for Viewfinder and me to go letterboxing this week. We went to Cedar Hill State Park and found Silver Eagle's Texas Star Microbox and Baby Bear's Campground Bandit - both alive and well. (Great park and fun boxes!) I remember last time we went searching for their boxes at Lake Bardwell and ran into those letterboxing coyotes. Well... once again today, just as we were leaving the park, lo and behold there was a huge coyote standing off to the side of the road! All I can say is.... we did "recover well"!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, we planted a couple of new boxes today and hope to announce them tonight! Happy hunting!</div>

<div>I thought the same thing about Cedar Hill - what a great gathering site!  When SJZ and I were there, we camped only long enough to crash and get up and get started the next morning - that was around Thanksgiving when we took what was going to be a three day boxing odyssey.  She was still recovering from her wreck and needed to get out and going, but we overdid it a bit for her and had to cut the trip short by a day.  I wish now we had stuck around the campground a little more to let her hang out and rest up before we headed out for the day, but we were having so much fun it never occurred to either us to take it easy - and neither did the fact that stopping at every Starbucks we saw virtually guaranteed not getting a good nights' sleep!
