                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter had a soccer tournament this weekend in far northwest Harris County, so I decided to check on a few old boxes and place a couple new ones.  The first game was at Katy Park, and while I was waiting for the game to start, I noticed a bike trail I had not seen before, so I checked it out.  I walked for over a mile and saw that it crossed a road near a parking lot and just kept going.  Since we had to return the next morning for another game, I vowed to explore further and place a box somewhere along it.<br/>
<br/>
After the game we had over 4 hours to kill before the next one, so we headed to San Felipe SHS so I could place a new box.  My Father Of TX letterbox, located in nearby Stephen F. Austin SP, had been reported missing, so I created a new one.  Sadly, this was another of my old boxes placed back in 2002 and I hated losing it.  Because of potential problems in State Parks, I decided to hide the new one in San Felipe SHS, which is not part of the State Park system.  It is a nice little park with lots of history, and it's free.  Even if you found my first box, consider this one a new find since it has a new stamp.  As extra incentive to visit, Baby Bear's oldest existing letterbox is also in this park and it is in great condition.  It still has the original logbook and it was fun to look at all the visitors since it was placed way back in December, 2002.  I knew I had found it years ago, but was surprised at what I found on the first 3 pages.  My son and daughter, Clueless Collector and Running Rain, had stamped in and written notes over 6 years ago and it brought back great memories of the fun we used to have letterboxing together and all the things that have happened in their lives since then.  I must admit my eyes were damp as I sat there under a huge shade tree reminiscing with my daughter.  On the third page was my original store-bought Silver Eagle stamp which I used for the first several months of letterboxing until I finally carved the one I use today.  This might be the only logbook still out there with this stamp in it.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, after hiding my Rice Harvest Festival box on the Mason Creek Hike &amp; Bike trail, we headed for Zube Park for the final game.  We had a few hours before it started so I headed to a blueberry U-pick farm located near there called Chwielewski's.  I normally go to Moorehead's, but they were hit hard by a late frost and do not have many berries right now.  I managed to pick 4 pounds before I had to leave for her game, and I had to allow extra time to check on my first letterbox, Zube Zephyr.  The trees had grown so dense since I last came over 2 years ago that I had trouble finding the entrance where the box is located.  I finally found it and was very happy to see the box alive and well.  I had brought many items to make repairs, but none were needed.  My only regret is that the original logbook was ruined by water before I moved it higher in the tree several years ago, but the box is still very special to me and I hope it lasts many years longer.<br/>
<br/>
It was a fun and nostalgic weekend for me and I hope you will experience something similar!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I loved your story, Silver Eagle. It's wonderful when a letterbox can bring back such pleasant memories. One of my grandsons recently asked me if I'd take him letterboxing (he's six). I'm excited to have an enthusiastic little partner to go boxing with one day. I've got a day mapped out - only three or four boxes, but that's more than enough for his short legs!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found Father of Texas and Old 300 on New Year's Day, 2006, coming back from our very first letterboxing trip.  I looked back at our logbook and in my notes for your box, Father of Texas, I wrote "Easy find, birds were singing, nice day for a stroll".  On Baby Bear's box, Old 300, on the other hand, I wrote "Got grassburrs in my hand and knee retrieving the box".  That explains a lot!<br/>
