<div>This is a pretty good little safety tip....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Following the disaster in London, the Ambulance Service has launched a</div>
<div>national "In case of Emergency (ICE)" worldwide campaign.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The idea is that you store the word " I C E " in your mobile phone address</div>
<div>book, and against it enter the number of the person you would want to be</div>
<div>contacted "In Case of Emergency".</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In an emergency situation ambulance and hospital staff will then be able to</div>
<div>quickly find out who your next of kin are and be able to contact them. It's</div>
<div>so simple that everyone can do it. Please do.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please will you also email this to all the people you know, it won't take</div>
<div>too many 'forwards' before everybody will know about this. It really could</div>
<div>save your life, or put a loved one's mind at rest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For more than one contact name ICE1, ICE2, ICE3 etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's a great idea, store it in your phone then pass on the message to your</div>
<div>family and friends.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am very thankful for the safety tips, some I would never have <br>
thought of. <br>
<br>
My children continue to be concerned that I am willing to go places <br>
where people have "baited remote traps". <br>
<br>
My military son warned me that this would be a perfect way for <br>
someone to entice another to a remote location because I explained <br>
that I knew I was going to a safe place because I was going to <br>
contact the placer to make sure the box was still where it had been. <br>
Pat warned this might be a bad idea- (not because of this group <br>
because I feel comfy with the names I am begining to recognize but <br>
some who do not post regularly)He said if I was going to search then <br>
not to email in advance because that would alert the would be <br>
villian of my intended visit and I have a child in tow. Not a bad <br>
thing to consider.Also a reason to consider having a closed clues <br>
list where everyone would have to have a credit card(if only $5 fee) <br>
to assure that their identity had some validity and there was an <br>
initial list of suspects if any naughtiness ever befell a boxer.<br>
<br>
Pat also warned that placing boxes might be a no-no in areas where <br>
terroristic threats were possibilities..ie airports, because I could <br>
incurr a hefty fine if the EOD guys had to implode my letterbox <br>
<grin><br>
<br>
I am also concerned that no one knows where I am sometimes. When I <br>
reach in a hole what if I get drug in/caught???? how will I be <br>
rescued. If hubby is there he carries a convincer and I do have a <br>
cell phone but... (momma worries)<br>
<br>
Anyway for now we have decided that remote boxes include Daddy, no <br>
forewarning exactly when & where we will be and at least for now I <br>
will stick to more "easy" locations when boxing with cowabunga <br>
kid.It is more fun that way anyhow because we feel like Inspector <br>
Gadget:)<br>
<br>
Thanks for allowing these thoughts and thanks for the safety tips. I <br>
gotta loose weight before I can get under any car...put that on my <br>
to do list :)<br>

                    <html><body><p>While we in Tuscon, we were at the Pima Air Museum and the Boneyards
are across the street.  The boneyards is actually the Aerospace
Maintenance and Regeneration Center (AMARC) and is basically a junk
yard of airplanes.  It is also on base.  <br/>
<br/>
There is a box planted outside the fence along the main street called
AMARC.  There was no way we would even think of going there since
that was the week that the security issues started up again.  <br/>
<br/>
SO this was great advice about no-no areas (esp. during high security
alrets).  But the Air Museum and Boneyards are a MUST see if you
are in the area.  That was the highlight of our trip for my dh and
boys.<br/>

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>You'll find a few, as MO5 pointed out, that may not be wisely hidden, but even though the placer should've been more forward thinking in placing, it is up to the finder to be smart about sneaking about in sensitive areas too.
