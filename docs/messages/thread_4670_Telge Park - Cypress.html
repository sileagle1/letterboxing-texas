    We were there about 2 weekends ago.  I saw no evidence of tree
    trimming and cleaning...;o)  We looked for two boxes and found only
    one..i think it was "box of bones"  I wanted to look for more but my
    kids just wanted to swing...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We were in the park Tuesday.  The only place we saw any work was in the corner formed by Telge Road and Cypress Creek.  There's a couple of green benches there with a marker of some kind (Pastry Princess had a box there, but it's missing, I believe).  It appears that they are clearing out a trail from the park to that spot.  The stump where IRA Boxer's letterbox "NOW THAT'S SCARY!" was placed is completely gone, as is the box.  The 3 bricks are still lying there.  We couldn't check all the boxes, so hope you can make time to do so.  Thanks.<br/>
