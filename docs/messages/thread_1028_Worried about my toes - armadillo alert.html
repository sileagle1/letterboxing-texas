armadillos at the Houston Arboretum.  From the parking lot, just go <br/>
down the willow oak trail toward the outer loop.  They are usually <br/>
close to the junction of those two trails.  Now, and here's the key, <br/>
you need to get the kids listening and not fighting or whining.  You <br/>
hear them well before you see them!<br/>
<br/>
A bonus, you can trade a hitchhiker while you're there!<br/>

&gt; I just have to share with everyone what happened to me the other <br/>
&gt; day.  As a rule I always take my children lbing with me.  However, <br/>
&gt; when planting boxes I sometimes go alone due to having to <br/>
&gt; concentrate on writing clues.  Anyway, my kids had gone to <br/>
mother's <br/>
&gt; day out and I had 5 boxes itching for a home so out I went.  I <br/>
went <br/>
&gt; to Nichols Green, a superb park in our area.  I managed to find <br/>
&gt; absolutely awesome spots to plant 2 boxes.  After getting them <br/>
&gt; planted I started walking towards the other side of the park to <br/>
&gt; check on a box that was one of my very first plants.  As I rounded <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; corner I saw something scurrying across the grass.  I quickly ran <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; where I saw it and to my surprise it was a young armadillo.  Now <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; I child I had seen many of these out in the country from the safe <br/>
&gt; distance of the back of a truck.  I walked up pretty close and <br/>
&gt; discovered that it was oblivious to me.  I followed it around for <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; while as it rooted around.  Eventually it noticed me and walked up <br/>
&gt; to me.  I of course had on flip flops and suddenly was worried <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; my toes.  He sniffed at my feet and toes and looked me up and <br/>
down, <br/>
&gt; walked around me a couple of times the continued rooting around.  <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; watched him until he finally went back into the woods.  The entire <br/>
&gt; time I was wishing I had my children with me because they would <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; thought that this was just too cool.  Just wanted to share this <br/>
&gt; awesome experience.  Like so many have said before, it isn't about <br/>
&gt; the prize at the end but rather the experiences you have <br/>
journeying <br/>
&gt; there.  When boxing at Nichols Green, if you see my little friend, <br/>
&gt; say Hello for me!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I shared our armadillo experience quite awhile<br/>
back, but I'll share it again.<br/>
<br/>
I've always been fascinated by armadillos - maybe it's<br/>
their prehistoric look, but I think they are among the<br/>
most interesting creatures I've ever seen. <br/>
<br/>
Well, last year I had planted a box in Fairfield State<br/>
Park (about 45 minutes from the city park LuvBug<br/>
cited).  Last fall my husband, my son, and I went to<br/>
check the box.  Now bear in mind that my husband is a<br/>
LSS, but he loves to hike and he feels we need to have<br/>
him around for protection, so he was along on this<br/>
trip as usual.<br/>
<br/>
On the hike in to the box, we followed the trail which<br/>
winds around a lake.  My son ventured out to the end<br/>
of a point which drops steeply on both sides.  We<br/>
noticed odd piles of "something" at the end of the<br/>
point, and finally realized it was a community<br/>
bathroom of some sort for animals.  My son was<br/>
immediately ready to get away so he turned to come<br/>
back and misstepped and rolled down the drop-off on<br/>
one side.  He probably rolled about 25 feet, but he<br/>
was fine and we continued on (he's the one that has<br/>
all the "adventures" on our excursions).  <br/>
<br/>
As we were approaching the bench that is noted in the<br/>
box clues, we heard something rustling in front of us,<br/>
so we got quiet and continued walking.  As we walked<br/>
into the clearing around the bench, there was a<br/>
full-grown armadillo rooting for whatever it is that<br/>
armadillos root for.  Well...I've seen armadillos all<br/>
my life but I've never been within sniffing distance,<br/>
so I felt that I should get closer to check him out,<br/>
against my husband's better judgment.  The armadillo<br/>
STILL never knew I was there, so I got even closer -<br/>
because of the rougher terrain, I was wearing hiking<br/>
boots, so I wasn't at all worried about my toes.  And<br/>
still, he had no idea we were there.  I reached out my<br/>
hiking stick to tap him on the back to get his<br/>
attention and I would have done it, but my husband<br/>
reached around me (he was standing behind me ready to<br/>
yank me to safety and away from my own foolhardy<br/>
behavior) and grabbed my stick so I couldn't touch<br/>
him.  He pointed out the armadillo's very long claws<br/>
and asked if I really wanted to surprise him.  I<br/>
decided he might have been right, in that case anyway,<br/>
so we just watched him.  Finally, FINALLY, the<br/>
armadillo acknowledged us, glanced us up and down,<br/>
then turned and walked away in not too much of a<br/>
hurry.  My son and I followed him through the brambles<br/>
and the woods for a short distance, but we decided an<br/>
armadillo's life isn't very interesting after all,<br/>
especially when he knows he's being watched.  <br/>
<br/>
Meeting up with that odd character was like peeking<br/>
into ages past and getting so close to him that I<br/>
could've tapped him on the shell was indeed an amazing<br/>
experience.  What's funny is that every time I see one<br/>
squished on the road, I mourn just a little because I<br/>
feel I've actually glimpsed inside the life of an<br/>
armadillo.<br/>
<br/>
Now that was the very same day, and only moments<br/>
before, I opened my own box to find there were<br/>
actually stamps in it!  I turned the page after our<br/>
own stamps, ready to find it blank yet again, only to<br/>
find our dear GG's stamp right there - in MY logbook! <br/>
I hardly dared to turn another page, but when I did, I<br/>
discovered that Silver Eagle and Baby Bear had also<br/>
stamped in - and on the very same day I was there<br/>
checking it!  I involuntarily jerked my head up to<br/>
look for them retreating down the trail, but they<br/>
weren't there, so I insisted we drive through the<br/>
campground looking for them, and although we didn't<br/>
find them, we did find a scout pack we know and had a<br/>
grand ol' time hanging out with them for awhile.<br/>
<br/>
Soooo....as TexasLuvBug says, it for sure wasn't the<br/>
stamp that day - it was the experience!<br/>
