<div>If anyone's planning an Austin letterboxing trip, you might be interested 
in my Lady Bird's Wildflower box, which was created for the Dog Days at Double 
Lake event last weekend at Coldspring but which has now found a home near 
the Lady Bird Johnson Wildflower Center in Austin, where it 
belongs.  </div>
<div>When I've recovered from our adventures, I'll report on the four 
days that Puddle Splasher and I spent on the road (our Spring 08 Topdown 
Excellent Adventure --<em> topdown</em> refers only to the convertible top, of 
course!) to Coldspring, then on to Bastrop and to Austin before returning to the 
DFW area, all of which was really perfect -- until I Iost my glasses somewhere 
along the trails at the LBWC in Austin and we had to spend 3 hours retracing our 
steps trying unsuccessfully to find them, which sort of put a damper on the trip 
home.  Up to that point, though, it was a great trip, nice topdown weather 
most of the time, great hiking trails in the woods with blooming dogwoods and 
wildflowers everywhere, and lots of great letterboxes along the way.  The 
event at Coldspring that was our excuse for the trip was great, thanks to 
Boots Tex, Lone Star Quilter and Dewberry who planned it all, the very nice 
little park where it was held, and the letterboxers who showed up for the 
day.  I left two boxes there where they are happily planted along the 
trails in very appropriate locations: Dogwoods and Little Rabbit Fufu (and as we 
were leaving the park on Sunday evening, I spotted a huge rabbit who must be 
Little Rabbit Fufu's big tough older brother, Big Rabbit Kung Fu.  There 
are some really big rabbits in that park!).  We also saw deer, armadillo, 
and lots of birds.  Great time.  </div>
<div>I am curious, though, about whether there might be an Austin Curse on 
Letterboxing, especially after reading Black Widow's recent posting and 
considering my last letterboxing trip in Austin when I bonked my head on a tree 
limb in Zilker Park and bled all over the clues, ending that day's letterboxing 
adventures.  Maybe the answer is, when letterboxing in Austin, Be 
careful!  Don't cross the guards in shacks, watch out for protruding tree 
limbs, and hold on to your glasses!  There are some really good boxes to be 
found there, though!  And the LBWC is beautiful this time of year.
