Since the barnraising is starting to quickly approach, do we need to <br>

<br>
My attention has been diverted for a couple of weeks<br>
due to scouts, so I'm getting back to the barnraising<br>
this week.  <br>
<br>
Here's what we need to be doing:<br>
<br>
Making your boxes based on information in the counties<br>
we will be serving.  I've posted quite a bit on<br>
Johnson and Ellis and hope to get Navarro covered in<br>
the next couple of days.  You can also do your own<br>
research on those counties if you'd like.<br>
<br>
Yes, we will be doing a potluck.  However, I'm still<br>
working out the details on where we'll gather up -<br>
Waxahachie hasn't been real fast in getting back to me<br>
about the park I would like to use and one of my<br>
biggest questions is "how much power we will have". <br>
That said, it may need to be a cold pot luck.  <br>
<br>
I would like to start getting a headcount if I can<br>
please!<br>
<br>
Here's the link until I have a chance to get it<br>
posted.  If someone else wants to post it on my<br>
behalf, that'd be fine.  I'm guessing it will be this<br>
evening for me to get to it - if I didn't have this <br>
J-O-B thing hanging over my head every day, I'd have a<br>
lot more time for letterboxing stuff!<br>
<br>
Anyway, thanks for your questions and if you have any<br>
more, shoot 'em out there like you did.  I don't keep<br>
a real close watch on this account during the day, but<br>
I do check it periodically if time allows.<br>
<br>

the link to the group, so I did and then I realized I<br>
needed to write another email to let everyone know I<br>

Sooooo....link is listed on the group, and here it is<br>
