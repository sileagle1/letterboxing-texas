<br/>
My attention has been diverted for a couple of weeks<br/>
due to scouts, so I'm getting back to the barnraising<br/>
this week.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's what we need to be doing:<br/>
<br/>
Making your boxes based on information in the counties<br/>
we will be serving.  I've posted quite a bit on<br/>
Johnson and Ellis and hope to get Navarro covered in<br/>
the next couple of days.  You can also do your own<br/>
research on those counties if you'd like.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we will be doing a potluck.  However, I'm still<br/>
working out the details on where we'll gather up -<br/>
Waxahachie hasn't been real fast in getting back to me<br/>
about the park I would like to use and one of my<br/>
biggest questions is "how much power we will have". <br/>
That said, it may need to be a cold pot luck.  <br/>
<br/>
I would like to start getting a headcount if I can<br/>
please!<br/>
<br/>
Here's the link until I have a chance to get it<br/>
posted.  If someone else wants to post it on my<br/>
behalf, that'd be fine.  I'm guessing it will be this<br/>
evening for me to get to it - if I didn't have this <br/>
J-O-B thing hanging over my head every day, I'd have a<br/>
lot more time for letterboxing stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, thanks for your questions and if you have any<br/>
more, shoot 'em out there like you did.  I don't keep<br/>
a real close watch on this account during the day, but<br/>
I do check it periodically if time allows.<br/>
