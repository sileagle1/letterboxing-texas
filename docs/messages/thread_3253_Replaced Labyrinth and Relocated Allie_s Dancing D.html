<div>I finally took these letterboxes out of my laundry room and returned them 
to the wild!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Labyrinth, one of my favorites because of the real labyrinth it 
references nearby, has been returned to the cemetery at White's Chapel Church in 
Southlake, only in a slightly different location (well, they cut down the 
branches in the cedar tree where it had been previously located, and it was 
miraculously discovered by some wonderful finders who saw it in the debris 
nearby and hid it for me).  So, after some maintenance and a new logbook, 
it has been relocated in that same cemetery, available once again!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Allie's Dancing Duck has been moved to the Colleyville Nature Center, a 
truly beautiful little spot of natural beauty in the middle of Colleyville, 
between Hwy 26 (Grapevine Hwy) and Precinct Line Road.  Easy to get to, fun 
to explore, but if it's been raining, be aware that the paths are all dirt and 
likely to be sloggy mud!  Lots of lovely trails and ponds to explore, with 
all the turtles, herons, ducks, geese, and even the occasional snake to 
discover.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've also been replacing full logbooks in some of my other letterboxes that 
have been in place for several years and are now into their 3rd logbooks.  
I hope you'll all continue to enjoy these.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now, I'm working on a new one for a brand new park in an old historic 
location ... watch for The Spirit of Moo.  I hope to get it out there this 
week, if the weather cooperates.  We'll see.</div>
