Aaaaargh!  It's still listed as active on AQ, it isn't until you <br>
click on the clue that you see the report that it's gone missing for <br>
a third and final time.<br>
<br>
I certainly don't blame Thot for giving up on it.  He put a lot of <br>
effort into that box, complete with a customized container neatly <br>
holding the log book and stamp, and even some rare-earth magnets to <br>
hold it in its hiding place.  And it goes missing more often than it <br>
gets found.  I haven't been there myself, dunno why this box would <br>
disappear with such regularity.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not sure why it would disappear either. We ride<br>
our bikes to that park a lot, it is a busy park on<br>
weekends, there are various day camps held there<br>

snake/alligator/bee problem (it borders armand bayou<br>
nature preserve) and so parents don't encourage kids<br>

accidental muggle discovery might be pretty rare. That<br>
park does flood quite badly IF tide is in AND the<br>
bayous are full of rainwater. I'm not sure of the<br>
exact spot where that box is placed, but if its on the<br>
bayou side, and its near the water, there's a good<br>
chance it could get washed away, rare earth magnets or<br>
not. I don't mind replanting and recarving if I had<br>
some idea of the stamp you'd want placed, and given<br>
the plant spot is on high ground. LMK.<br>

There just seem to be some parks where it's tough to keep a box alive.<br>
 And for those spots, you just have to have the attitude that it's a<br>
treat for those finders who can find it while it's still viable and<br>
not be upset if it goes missing.  Sometimes that's tough to do.<br>

I never visited the hide myself, but my understanding is it was <br>
several feet off the ground inside a hollow tree.  Dunno how high the <br>
flood waters get, but I also think it was in the upward part of the <br>
hole, which would mean that if flood waters broke it loose it would <br>
still be trapped within the tree -- presuming it floated, which I <br>
suspect it would.<br>

I've already carved the stamp three times, it wouldn't bother me a <br>
lot to carve it a fourth time, but I tend to agree with Thot that <br>
this is a good one to give up on.  Perhaps a good idea would be an <br>
entirely new hide within the same park to see if it goes missing in a <br>
heartbeat as well.<br>
