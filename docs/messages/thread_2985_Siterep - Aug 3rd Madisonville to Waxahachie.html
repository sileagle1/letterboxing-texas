                    <div class="plaintext-content">My navigator, JR, and I started towards Dallas on I45 at around 6 <br>
am.  Our first stop was Lake Madison in Madisonville and found the <br>
Madison Quilt Block from the Quilt Block Series, Mushroom Capitol<br>
Microbox, and the Fiesta de Hongos box, which was 130 feet across a <br>
grassy field where the grass was definitely above JR's head and in <br>
places was up to my waist (I am only 5' tall).  Now this wouldnt have<br>
been too bad except it was 8 am and the dew was heavy, so both JR <br>
and I were soaked by the time we finished,  but the stamp was worth <br>
it, as were the other two boxes in this park...great carvings.  We <br>
then proceeded to Corsicana and picked up the Wolf Brand box at a <br>
really neat pocket park downtown.  Inside of this box was the <br>
Microsoft Office:Access HH which we picked up.  We then went to <br>
Pioneer Village and picked up the Pioneer Box.  This is a really <br>
neat place to visit.  JR was not allowed to go into any of the<br>
buildings, but one of the ladies in the office was nice enough to <br>
watch him while I looked around.  This Pioneer Village also has a <br>
Lefty Frizzell museum.  I didnt realize that he was born here.  The <br>
lady that watched JR for me also told me that Clyde Barrow's uncle <br>
lived in the area and Bonnie and Clyde actually came through here <br>
and Clyde went to the local florist and got Bonnie some flowers and <br>
left a note that said something to the effect of "Do you remember <br>
me?".  Thought that was interesting.  We then went to the<br>
Petroleum Park and found the Petroleum Park box.  The log book was <br>
soaked, but someone had left another little log book in it.  We then <br>
went to Oakwood Cemetery and picked up The People's Path box<br>
which is part of Boots Tex's Texas Governor's Series.  Wonderful <br>
Carving!!!  This was a neat cemetery.  Our last stop in Corsicana <br>
was Community Park and picked up the Pitch In! box.  We then <br>
traveled to Kerens to the Kerens Cemetery and found the 132nd FA <br>
Regiment Letterbox.  The placement of this box was really neat and a <br>
cool history to go with it.  As we traveled back to I45 we noticed <br>
the Bluebonnet Trading Post which had several large statues of <br>
buffalo, elk, deer, and horses in front of it.  JR saw these as we <br>
were driving by and started barking at the statues.  So if you go <br>
out that way be sure and look for these.  We then made it to the <br>
Waxahachie Creek Park to pick up 3 boxes, but when I got to the main <br>
gate to get a map, the lady informed me that all of the hiking <br>
trails were closed due to the rains.  So we continued on to<br>
Italy and found the Texas Passport Series #3 - Italy box.  Our next <br>
stop was Waxahachie to the Superconducting Super Collider to pick up <br>
the SSC - A Hole in the Ground in Texas.  It was definitely an<br>
eerie feeling out there.  I am a science teacher, so I was extremely <br>
interested in this location, and it was a really neat spot.   Next <br>
we went to Getzander Park in Waxahachie to pick up a couple of <br>
boxes.  Upon our arrival we started down the trails and realized <br>
that the clues referred to logs that were fallen over the<br>
trail...well there were numerous trees across the trail and after <br>
checking 3-4 we came to a section that was totally blocked and we <br>
couldnt find a way to get through.  So we turned around and decided <br>
to wait until another time.  We then headed to Dallas to meet up <br>
with Wag Time to go letterboxing on Saturday.  <br>
