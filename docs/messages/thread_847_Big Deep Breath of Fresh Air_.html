<br/>
Y'all may or may not have noticed I haven't been<br/>
around much this last month - I've had to take some<br/>
time away from home to tend to a family matter that<br/>
called for all my attention.  I finally logged back on<br/>
last night to find I had over 700 message waiting for<br/>
me!  OUCH!  I've managed to cull it down to 99...<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I noticed is that the details may<br/>
change, but the underlying current runs the same!  It<br/>
looks like the big list is in an uproar about a Boston<br/>
Globe article?  I quit reading those messages and just<br/>
deleted.  Meanwhile, our little corner of the<br/>
letterboxing world has kept on as usual too - happily<br/>
planting and finding and cheering each other right<br/>
along.  It sure is nice to come back to such a fine<br/>
group of folks!<br/>
<br/>
I have managed to do a little letterboxing in the last<br/>
few weeks - actually, less finding or planting, than<br/>
just box maintenance.  I've turned a new friend and<br/>
her family on to the hobby.  I don't think they ever<br/>
fully realized we were finding boxes I had already<br/>
found before, so I sent them ahead with the clues and<br/>
I followed behind and enjoyed watching them discover<br/>
the box.  They definitely have the fever!<br/>
<br/>
I'll send some sitreps along after I catch my breath,<br/>
but all appears well box-wise up here in East Texas. <br/>
I specifically made it to Tyler State Park and Mission<br/>
Tejas, as well as Jim Hogg.  And yes, our good friend<br/>
GG has made his way even deeper into the Pineywoods -<br/>
I found his stamp at Mission Tejas!<br/>
<br/>
Gosh it's good to be back!<br/>

Speaking of the "big list", when I was a brand new letterboxer, I joined<br/>
that forum just as a huge flame war was waging - with scary things being<br/>
leveled at newcomers - guess who wrote what I considered to be a very sane<br/>
and balanced support of newbies?<br/>
You guessed it - it was Barefoot Lucy! <br/>
I had started to think that letterboxers were a pretty critical, negative,<br/>
emotional bunch ...(which wouldn't have stopped us from letterboxing, but we<br/>
certainly would have been very timid about contacting anyone about the boxes<br/>
we placed or found!!!) <br/>

<div>Hi, Lucy!  Missed you. I hadn't heard anything from you 
since my own foray to the Jacksonville area in March and wondered if I'd 
somehow put a hex on you by mistake.  As a relative newbie myself, only 
about 7 months into this game, I've found that big list to be a great 
source of information, but maybe some of those people need valium, 
or just more time outdoors and away from their computers.  I'm really 
grateful that our TX group is more helpful, welcoming and friendly, and 
especially encouraging!  -- Viewfinder of

<div>No, they need to put it where that sun don't shine.  :::::::smirk::::::     I have to admit, they got me riled up a bit. Most of the time I just gance at the subjects and delete or snicker. But I won't get into a running arguement with anyone. That's what they want. I just express my opinion and run for my life. I've gotten a few e-mails saying people like the fact that I tell some of these people what I think. I have to admit that makes me feel kind of good sometimes. </div>

Brownwood for a couple of days.  <s> I want to look at the clues for Texas<br/>
because I defintley want to do some boxing.  I think this time I may stay<br/>
with her for a week, rent a car and do some boxing while she's at work,<br/>
spend part of the next weekend also so she and I can hang out some more. <br/>

So I have to sit down and look at the clues to see what boxes are where. <br/>
