                    <div class="plaintext-content">   The rain, ice, and bowl games being over (for now), the Original <br>
Texas Tour Bus has settled down and is available for callers. <br>
Therefore, find yourself in the home of Coach Gordon Wood's seven <br>
time state champion Lions and proceed from there north by northwest <br>
to a body of water named after that town. There you will find a <br>
state park bearing the same name as the body of water. Enter that <br>
park and find the trailhead near the entrance to the Council Bluff <br>
campsite. Observe the mapboard at the trailhead -- you will be going <br>
to marker #11. Start down the trail and continue along the top of <br>
the ridge with the body of water on your right. Upon reaching marker <br>
#6, the trail will narrow for a time before joining a wider path. <br>
Shortly thereafter, the trail will turn sharply to the right and <br>
drop suddenly among a giant's playground of blocks and walls. Follow <br>
the trail as it hairpins back to the right and runs along a lower <br>
shelf with the body of water on your left. Continue past markers 7, <br>
8, 9, and 10 (most of which have their numbered signs on the ground <br>
beside the posts). At marker #11 (which still has its number ON the <br>
post) count 30 steps and see a large boulder on your right with a <br>
smaller boulder to its left. In between, at the break, are several <br>
trees. The Original Texas Tour Bus is parked at the base of the <br>
smaller boulder, near the break, beneath the usual forest debris. <br>
Upon obtaining the Bus, you may either retrace your steps or <br>
continue down the trail to a barely legible marker #16, at which <br>
point you will find a rocky path ascending. Consider that path to be <br>
your "Stairway to Haven" and follow it up to a subsequent stairway <br>
and then to a path that will return you to the original trail at <br>
marker #2. Or, just continue down the trail to the fishing pier and <br>
then take the return trail (located several yards down the road <br>
leading away from the pier) to the Council Bluff campsite. Take the <br>
opportunity to explore this interesting park and its unique <br>
facilities.                                                          <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">A lovely body of water that is, and virgin territory as far as <br>
letterboxing is concerned.  I hope you remedied that situation while <br>
you were there?<br>
