I am just so thrilled you found Polly's Paws!! My<br/>
husband and I (we're 'red berry') had planted that on<br/>
and for our second wedding anniversary. Polly is our<br/>
baby *er, puppy*.<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad you enjoyed central park. That's where we<br/>
walk/jog every now and then.<br/>
<br/>
If you want, you can email me your address (off list)<br/>
and I'll send you a little FF gifty.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for finding our first box up here!<br/>
<br/>

&gt; Subject: Polly's Paws in Lewisville found today!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've been driving around all week with the clues for<br/>
&gt; Polly's Paws and <br/>
&gt; finally, today, made it to Lewisville to find this<br/>
&gt; LB in a very pretty <br/>
&gt; little park, nice short walk in the SHADE - hooray!<br/>
&gt; This is one that <br/>
&gt; would be great to take kids along because the park<br/>
&gt; has a wonderful <br/>
&gt; playground, the walk isn't long or hot, and the LB<br/>
&gt; is pretty <br/>
&gt; accessible. Cute paws stamp, too.  Thanks very much,<br/>
&gt; Red Berry, for <br/>
&gt; planting it.  I was delighted to be FF AND to refind<br/>
&gt; the 1st <br/>
&gt; Anniversary HH, which had been sent to me from<br/>
&gt; Puddle-Splasher in CT <br/>
&gt; (she'd been FF for that one)and which had been<br/>
&gt; released in the <br/>
&gt; CelticLions' LB in Denton previously.  Now, it can<br/>
&gt; continue its travels <br/>
&gt; around TX after I release it again in the next<br/>
&gt; couple of weeks.   <br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div>Thanks for your reply.  I hope you'll also decide to travel just a 
little southeast and look for some of my letterboxes (you know, the Grapevine 
and Southlake boxes are just around the lake from you, or maybe I should say, 
just a drive down Hwy 121.  And then, of course, you're almost to Keller 
and Bedford, so might as well look for all of them!  And thanks for the FF 
thingy  - is your offlist email address this one:  <a href="mailto:lennire@yahoo.com">lennire@yahoo.com</a> ?</div></body></html>
