I am just so thrilled you found Polly's Paws!! My<br>
husband and I (we're 'red berry') had planted that on<br>
and for our second wedding anniversary. Polly is our<br>
baby *er, puppy*.<br>
<br>
I'm glad you enjoyed central park. That's where we<br>
walk/jog every now and then.<br>
<br>
If you want, you can email me your address (off list)<br>
and I'll send you a little FF gifty.<br>
<br>
Thanks for finding our first box up here!<br>
<br>
Lena<br>

<div>Thanks for your reply.  I hope you'll also decide to travel just a 
little southeast and look for some of my letterboxes (you know, the Grapevine 
and Southlake boxes are just around the lake from you, or maybe I should say, 
just a drive down Hwy 121.  And then, of course, you're almost to Keller 
and Bedford, so might as well look for all of them!  And thanks for the FF 
thingy  - is your offlist email address this one:  <a href="mailto:lennire@yahoo.com">lennire@yahoo.com</a> ?</div></font></body></html>
