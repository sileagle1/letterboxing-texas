&gt; Hi all, I just wanted to give a shout out to the board about what an<br/>
&gt; awesome day Pink Cookie and I had yesterday going on a little over 5<br/>
&gt; mile hike.  My Facebook friends in the group have heard this already but<br/>
&gt; I think people use to post about their adventures on the board so I<br/>
&gt; wanted to share on here too.  Frost Maiden and Gryzzled Gryphon's tag<br/>
&gt; team efforts on The Enchanted Forest of Fantasy was well worth the 7<br/>
&gt; hours we were on the trail.  Beautiful stamps by Frost Maiden and the<br/>
&gt; tricky clues kept us going to the end!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On top of finding wonderful carvings and enjoying the hike we also saw:<br/>
&gt; a beetle that we thought at first was a snake poking it's head out... it<br/>
&gt; was huge, I googled it and it was a Eastern Click Beetle over three<br/>
&gt; inches long; bees; muggles; grasshoppers; muggles; lots of  birds;<br/>
&gt; muggles; huge caterpillers; muggles; dive bombing butterflies; muggles;<br/>
&gt; giant trees and to top it off toward the end of our hike we watched a<br/>
&gt; beautiful Bobcat stroll down the trail in front of us!   Pink Cookie got<br/>
&gt; one bee sting and I got two nice heel blisters as bonuses!  Oh did I<br/>
&gt; mention the muggles... fun fun being so stealthy... they thought we were<br/>
&gt; just some crazy girls going in the woods for the first time hehe "oh<br/>
&gt; look.. oh look... it's a bird; it's a bug; it's a big tree!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So if your ever get the chance make sure you visit the Enchanted Forest<br/>

I spent 5 hours on that series.  There was a section that I missed (later found out that there was a bad clue.  It's since been corrected). At least it was an easy walk and great stamps. And yes, I took lots of interesting pictures of trees-those muggles slowed me down.  :D I need to go back out and get the rest.<br/>

<p>My daughter had a bobcat and her baby pass through her backyard in Frisco (north of Dallas) last week. She got lots of good photos (through the window!!!). That's scary. I have a Bear Bell on my hiking stick (left over from hiking in CT and Colorado), but I never thought I'd need a Bobcat Bell in town.<br/>Puddle Splasher<br/><br/><br/></p><blockquote>-----Original Message-----

<p>Y'all be careful out there. That Bobcat may look like a kitty, but it's still a wild animal and it can hurt you.<br/>

&gt; I saw that bobcat out there, too.  She was drinking water from a puddle on the sidewalk.  I got about two feet away and took pictures.  She just kept drinking.  Later on we passed each other walking down the sidewalk.  Later on a man walking his dog said he sees he quite frequently.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I spent 5 hours on that series.  There was a section that I missed (later found out that there was a bad clue.  It's since been corrected). At least it was an easy walk and great stamps. And yes, I took lots of interesting pictures of trees-those muggles slowed me down.  :D I need to go back out and get the rest.<br/>

&gt;  toward the end of our hike we watched a<br/>
&gt; &gt; beautiful Bobcat stroll down the trail in front of us!   <br/>
&gt; &gt; So if your ever get the chance make sure you visit the Enchanted Forest<br/>
&gt; &gt; it was a trip we won't forget!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks again FM &amp; GG for the wonderful day!<br/>
