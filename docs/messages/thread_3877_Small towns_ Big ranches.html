                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a little break after Thanksgiving, so Lone Star Quilter and I <br>
decided to take a little trip to North Central Texas to fill in some <br>
of those blank counties that didn't have letterboxes.  During the <br>
trip, we placed 22 new letterboxes and found a few.  We stopped off <br>
in Meridian State Park and placed a little bird box, Chapeau Noir, as <br>
LSQ wants to put a Texas bird in every state park we visit.  While we <br>
were there we ran up to Dinosaur Valley SP and put a bird there, <br>
Cheeky Fellow, then up to Weatherford, which needed a Texas governor <br>
box for a very frugal man.  Then, we headed west and stayed a couple <br>
of nights at Lake Brownwood SP, where we left Brown Wood Duck and <br>
Honky-Tonk Juke Box.  While we were there, we took a trip out west to <br>
Runnels County to see Coppini's Cowboy on the courthouse lawn, then <br>
to Coke County and Fort Chadbourne, where we left Granny Lee.  The <br>
fort is on private land, a ranch that has been in the same family <br>
since almost the time it was a fort, and the family is restoring and <br>
protecting the site and the buildings.  It's open to the public for <br>
donations.  A must-stop if you ever get out that way.  We stopped in <br>
Abilene SP to drop off Peter, Peter, Peter (was that a bird I <br>
heard?).  While we were in Abilene, IRA Boxer snuck off to Fort <br>
Phantom Hill in Jones County and left the Phantom Cannon.  We visited <br>
The Sheriff who wore Petticoats in Coleman County, then started the <br>
drive up the Great Western Cattle Trail with the Wrangler in <br>
Trickham, up to Callahan County for a little Texas Fever, stopping by <br>
Cottonwood to visit The Newton Boys.  We left Brownwood and stopped <br>
off at Fort Griffin for about 3 days to visit the land of small towns <br>
and big ranches.  The old town of Fort Griffin was a wild and wooly <br>
western town, home of Wyatt Earp and Doc Holliday in its heyday, and <br>
its place on the Great Western Trail provided plenty of cowboy <br>
customers.  This place is also on private property, but open to the <br>
public.  It's a work-in-progress for the owner, who has hired <br>
archeologists and is replacing the buildings on their original sites, <br>
hoping to make the town a tourist destination.  We stopped in at <br>
Shaunissy's Saloon and tasted The Sins of Katie Elder.  While there, <br>
we had a bite to eat at the Chuckwagon in Throckmorton and saw some <br>
Tonkawa in Haskell County.  Also, Chief Catumseh of the Comanche, in <br>
1856, met with Robert E. Lee near Camp Cooper to discuss a peace <br>
treaty.  There's a granite marker 2 miles and 4 cattle guards into a <br>
ranch that begged for a letterbox, so it got one.  Knox County <br>
actually got 3 letterboxes: Who Needs Seeds?, Lightnin' Ben and <br>
Coyote.  Then, it was back to the cattle trail, where a cowboy could <br>
be heard singing to his pony, "Goodbye, Old Paint".  Then, "Up The <br>
Trail" to Wilbarger County and the Red River at Doan's Crossing.  We <br>
came back through Stephens and Palo Pinto Counties where we found 3 <br>
boxes and left the Carolina Chickadee at Lake Possum Kingdom.  Woke <br>
up Tuesday morning and the forecast was for some white fluffy stuff, <br>
so we headed south, aided by the gentle push of a blue norther', to <br>
get ready for Christmas.  Y'all have a good one and we'll see you on <br>
the trail.  By the way, the clues are not available yet for all those <br>
boxes, but I'm working on it and you should be able to get to them in <br>
a couple of days.  If you just can't wait, contact me and I'll share <br>
them with you.<br>

<p>We had a little break after Thanksgiving, so Lone Star Quilter and I <br/>decided to take a little trip to North Central Texas to fill in some <br/>of those blank counties that didn't have letterboxes.

Then, "Up The <br/>Trail" to Wilbarger County and the Red River at Doan's Crossing. We <br/>came back through Stephens and Palo Pinto Counties where we found 3 <br/>boxes and left the Carolina Chickadee at Lake Possum Kingdom. Woke <br/>up Tuesday morning and the forecast was for some white fluffy stuff, <br/>so we headed south, aided by the gentle push of a blue norther', to <br/>get ready for Christmas. Y'all have a good one and we'll see you on <br/>the trail. By the way, the clues are not available yet for all those <br/>boxes, but I'm working on it and you should be able to get to them in <br/>a couple of days. If you just can't wait, contact me and I'll share <br/>them with you.<br/><br/>Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br/><br/></p></div></font><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

Maybe I'll give it another shot.  There's already one in Martin County but two are always better!  I have one ready for Big Spring that I know an excellent place for.   Borden County needs one also.  When BRC had his computer consulting business (we lived in Lubbock then), he did a job for their school district and they didn't understand when he asked them if they had their files backed up that he meant
 backed up not on the computer that needed to have the operating system re-installed. They told him yes, of course.  It was the computer they used for attendance, grades, etc.  A burning computer stamp, maybe?  :-)</div>

This place is also on private property, but open to <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; public.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The lack of parks is a problem, for sure.  It takes more time to hunt <br>
out a spot.  If you like cemeteries, every county has a few.  We <br>
placed some in places that I wouldn't normally place a box, like in a <br>
hedge on the courthouse square, behind a monument on a highway, in a <br>
roadside picnic area, etc.  These may not last long, but you never <br>
know.  I've found boxes in extremely public places that seem to go on <br>
forever.  You definitely have to be more creative.<br>
