                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I posted pictures of the completed Trash Collecting Hitchhiker <br>
in the photo section (In the 'TCH' folder).  It's two 35mm film <br>
canisters glued end to end and secured with packing tape.  A log <br>
book and small stamp fit in one end and a Wal-Mart sized shopping <br>
bag goes into the other.  It's a tight fit, but you really can <br>
squeeze that thing in there.<br>
<br>
It works like this- You find it in a regular letterbox and treat it <br>
like a regular Hitchhiker, making all the appropriate stampings.  <br>
Then you remove the bag and collect any trash you find along the way <br>
back from the box.  Dispose of the trash at your earliest <br>
convenience and place a new bag into the Hitchhiker before placing <br>
the whole thing in another Letterbox.<br>
<br>
I stole the idea from a geocaching activity called Cache In/Trash <br>
Out.  They just leave a loaded film canister in the geocaches for <br>
litter collection.  It's a wonderfull idea that I wanted to bring to <br>
the letterboxing community.  It seemed to me that it would work <br>
perfectly as a HH.  Not oly are you prettying up the places we go <br>
to, but you get a (F)ind out of it. <br>
<br>
I've made two so far and will be placing them soon. If you're going <br>
to make a hithhiker anyway, I ask that you give this a try. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, I LIKE this idea!<br>
<br>
I'm going to begin teaching Leave No Trace next month<br>
and preparing for it has caused me to have a crisis of<br>
conscience about letterboxing.  I've come to the point<br>
that I can justify it because I am planting boxes in<br>
durable areas and I'm checking them so that they<br>
aren't abandoned.  Also, through letterboxing, I'm<br>
inviting folks into areas that heighten their<br>
awareness of their natural surroundings and hopefully<br>
through awareness we can foster stewardship.  <br>
<br>
I still can't say that letterboxing and LNT are<br>
completely compatible, but I can live with the<br>
difference if I change a few of my letterboxing habits<br>
and this one plays right in.<br>
<br>
I'm already looking toward making smaller boxes even<br>
though I prefer carving larger stamps and I like<br>
making a box big enough for someone to slip a HH into.<br>
 <br>
<br>
BUT-I'm definitely going to make my future HH's this<br>
way, and I think I may start my boxes by leaving a<br>
trash bag in them and writing it into my clues to<br>
request that finders bring a trash bag with them in<br>
case the one I place is missing (because if everyone<br>
brings one, theoretically there would be no need to<br>
take mine!)<br>
<br>
Could we come up with our own designation for this<br>
practice?<br>
<br>
Lucy<br>
<br>
<br>
Okay, I posted pictures of the completed Trash<br>
Collecting Hitchhiker in the photo section (In the<br>
'TCH' folder). <br>
<br>
It's two 35mm film canisters glued end to end and<br>
secured with packing tape.  A log book and small stamp<br>
fit in one end and a Wal-Mart sized shopping <br>
bag goes into the other.  It's a tight fit, but<br>
you really can squeeze that thing in there.<br>
 <br>
It works like this- You find it in a regular<br>
letterbox and treat it like a regular Hitchhiker,<br>
making all the appropriate stampings.  Then you remove<br>
the bag and collect any trash you find along the way<br>
back from the box.  Dispose of the trash at your<br>
earliest convenience and place a new bag into the<br>
Hitchhiker before placing the whole thing in another<br>
Letterbox.<br>
<br>
I stole the idea from a geocaching activity called<br>
Cache In/Trash Out.  They just leave a loaded film<br>
canister in the geocaches for litter collection.  It's<br>
a wonderfull idea that I wanted to bring to <br>
the letterboxing community.  It seemed to me<br>
that it would work perfectly as a HH.  Not oly are you<br>
prettying up he places we go to, but you get a (F)ind<br>
out of it. <br>
<br>
Ive made two so far and will be placing them<br>
soon. If you're going to make a hithhiker anyway, I<br>
ask that you give his a try. <br>

By all means, please do.  I don't care what people call it, as long <br>
as they do it.  If you can come up with a batter name please share.<br>
<br>
I'm with you on the Leave No Trace ethic.  Not just in my <br>
recreation, but in my entire existance.  I've had issues similar to <br>
yours with letterboxing.  I rationalize it because I take care of <br>
the areas where they are planted better than if a box wasn't there, <br>
so I see it as a good balance.  Actually, I think it tips the scales <br>
in the LNT direction.<br>

By the time we get find the box, it is a bonus for them.  Guess I <br>
