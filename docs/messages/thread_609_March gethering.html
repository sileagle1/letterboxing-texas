<div>Hello fellow Texans,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I forget......who's in charge of the March event? If I hadn't had this crummy surgery on my foot, I had planned on going, took a week off by that weekend and everything. I'd like to know if there are any event stamps, general stamps, boxes needed, etc, etc ,etc. &lt;s&gt; Or are personal travelers wanted/needed? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope you all have a FANTASTIC time!! There are mucho gatherings here in the east this spring and summer and I am glad I had the foot taken care of now so I will be up and running, ready for all of them. I hope you have a second annual gathering so I can make plans to come to that one. </div>
