                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made the mistake of buying the same sheet of white<br/>
material over a year ago.  It is thicker than the pink <br/>
stuff and cheaper since you get more (8.5" x 11"), but <br/>
it does not last.  All of the stamps I carved from it <br/>
have eventually crumbled, broken or eroded away.  Maybe <br/>
they have improved it and you will have better luck, but <br/>
I would just try one for a few months and see how it does <br/>
before doing too many.  <br/>
I found it with the other Speedball products in the <br/>
Art supply area, not with the stamps.<br/>

was out of <br/>
