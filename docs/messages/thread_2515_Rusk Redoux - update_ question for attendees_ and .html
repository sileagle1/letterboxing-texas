                    <html><body><div>The weather looks like it will be BRISK and maybe a little wet.  If you want to watch the weather yourself, the zip code for Rusk is 75785.  It is calling for high of 47 and about a 30% chance of rain.  It seems the weather usually improves as the date gets closer, so we will hope for that!

<div>For those of you who will be traveling to be here, do you plan on staying over to Sunday as well?  Would it benefit you for me to include outlying boxes in the clue books?  There are 26 boxes in Rusk alone, and another 10 boxes in Maydelle (about 7 miles from Rusk).  There are also now several boxes in outlying towns.

<div>And for those who are interested, there is further entertainment opportunity in Jacksonville Saturday evening.  Roland Brown - the nicest, coolest non-boxing lawyer you will ever find (he sang at my wedding) has a little back room sort of place called Roland's Next Door (
<a href="http://mail.yourlawyertexas.com:7080/blogs/RolandsNextDoor/">http://mail.yourlawyertexas.com:7080/blogs/RolandsNextDoor/</a>) where he brings great folk musicians to entertain the locals.  On the 20th, he will be hosting Small Potatoes 
<a href="http://www.smallpotatoesmusic.com/">http://www.smallpotatoesmusic.com/</a> at 7:30 p.m.  He asks for an $8 donation, but he doesn't turn anyone away.  I plan to be there and would love to have y'all join me!

<div>Fearless Fox is going to the Beast Feast, an annual vein-clogging fest at a local church, open to any non-vegetarian men with little concern for their cholesterol levels.  Yum!<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I will send my cell phone number out shortly to all attending.  In the event of bad weather, we will find a way to entertain those who came from out of town (and anyone NOT coming from out of town will, of course, be invited too!).  Please feel free to email me with questions as we draw closer to event time.

<div>Have you gotten all the personal travellers figured out?  Hmmm???</div>
