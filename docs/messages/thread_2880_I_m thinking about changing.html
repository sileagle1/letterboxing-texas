<p>
</p><div>I'm thinking about changing my trail name. Puddle Splasher suits me too well right now and I'm not sure that's a good thing. I live within a mile of a nature trail in McKinney with a letterbox which I'd not found as yet. This morning, I was restless and decided that although we had already had a pretty good rain, the sun was shining and the radar indicated the next storm was south of Dallas, at least an hour or so away. So I grabbed my backpack and headed out to find Wolf Pack 4. A short distance up the trail, I passed a young mother with three small children covered with mud and carrying bug nets. She told me that she hadn't realized until it was too late that the trail ahead was submerged under a huge mud puddle. I thanked her for the advice but continued.... just in case my perspective was different. Soon I came to the puddle and she was definitely right, and there was no way around it. I could see the tracks her kids had left in the mud as they obviously went sliding down the slippery incline into the mud puddle. So I turned around but was not daunted. I knew another way to get around to the trail I needed to take - much longer, but at least I didn't have to give up just yet. It was a beautiful morning... birds singing, a soft breeze blowing through the leaves, peaceful, and I had the trail all to myself.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally I reached the trail head from the far side. As I started up the nature trail I found quite a few muddy puddles, but I was able to bypass all of them by leaving the trail and finding my way through the woods until I could rejoin the trail in a dryer place. Following the clues, eventually I arrived at the right location and found the letterbox. The woods was full of huge, fallen trees from all the recent storms we've had roll through the area, so I found one nearby to sit and stamp into the box. The problem was, when I opened the box, it was soaked. Inside was a sheet of paper from a family from Houston who had stamped in last week and said the logbook was wet and slimy so they used a sheet of paper instead.... and that was soaked. So I looked in my backpack and found an extra logbook I carry for such occasions and a new baggie to put it in and was just about to stamp it when a huge, monstrous, evil, loud clap of thunder exploded just over my head. As I looked up, I saw a streak of lightning immediately followed by another clap of thunder. I didn't have to think too long and hard to know I was a long way from my jeep and in a pretty dangerous situation.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Needless to say, I was soaked through and through by the time I got back to the jeep.... heart pounding, and still clutching the Wolf Pack 4 letterbox in my hands. So Wolf Pack4, I've got your box, I'm going to try to dry the logbook, but it's really pretty soaked. I'll put a new logbook in it and replace the bags and box (it was leaking too). The stamp is fine, but I think the ink pad looked like the ink may have bled out of it. I'll replace your box to it's nice little hidy hole  within the next day or two... after the storms really do pass through!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Advice to anyone thinking about finding this box... just wait a few days until the trails dry out, but it's a beautiful area so I definitely recommend you add it to your list of boxes to find in the McKinney area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And me... I'll keep the name Puddle Splasher. In fact my plan is to dry my hair, treat the wounds, and go back out this afternoon because I still have a couple of boxes I want to hide!</div>

<div>When I was a teenager, my best friend/basically-a-sister and her family had a huge peach orchard.  They lived and died by the spring rains.  More rains equalled more peaches.  But late rain wasn't good because the peaches would get a species-specific mildew right on the trees.  Yuk.  But I remember walking in the orchard during a good year and pulling peaches right off the tree and eating them warm.  And the smell.  I always felt like I was sticky from head to toe by the time I walked out of the orchard.

too well right now and I'm not sure that's a good thing. I live <br>
within a mile of a nature trail in McKinney with a letterbox which <br>
I'd not found as yet. This morning, I was restless and decided that <br>
although we had already had a pretty good rain, the sun was shining <br>
and the radar indicated the next storm was south of Dallas, at least <br>
an hour or so away. So I grabbed my backpack and headed out to find <br>
Wolf Pack 4. A short distance up the trail, I passed a young mother <br>
with three small children covered with mud and carrying bug nets. She <br>
told me that she hadn't realized until it was too late that the trail <br>
ahead was submerged under a huge mud puddle. I thanked her for the <br>
advice but continued.... just in case my perspective was different. <br>
Soon I came to the puddle and she was definitely right, and there was <br>
no way around it. I could see the tracks her kids had left in the mud <br>
as they obviously went sliding down the slippery incline into the mud <br>
puddle. So I turned around but was not daunted. I knew another way to <br>
get around to the trail I needed to take - much longer, but at least <br>
I didn't have to give up just yet. It was a beautiful morning... <br>
birds singing, a soft breeze blowing through the leaves, peaceful, <br>
and I had the trail all to myself.<br>

> Finally I reached the trail head from the far side. As I started up <br>
the nature trail I found quite a few muddy puddles, but I was able to <br>
bypass all of them by leaving the trail and finding my way through <br>
the woods until I could rejoin the trail in a dryer place. Following <br>
the clues, eventually I arrived at the right location and found the <br>
letterbox. The woods was full of huge, fallen trees from all the <br>
recent storms we've had roll through the area, so I found one nearby <br>
to sit and stamp into the box. The problem was, when I opened the <br>
box, it was soaked. Inside was a sheet of paper from a family from <br>
Houston who had stamped in last week and said the logbook was wet and <br>
slimy so they used a sheet of paper instead.... and that was soaked. <br>
So I looked in my backpack and found an extra logbook I carry for <br>
such occasions and a new baggie to put it in and was just about to <br>
stamp it when a huge, monstrous, evil, loud clap of thunder exploded <br>
just over my head. As I looked up, I saw a streak of lightning <br>
immediately followed by another clap of thunder. I didn't have to <br>
think too long and hard to know I was a long way from my jeep and in <br>
a pretty dangerous situation.<br>

> Needless to say, I was soaked through and through by the time I got <br>
back to the jeep.... heart pounding, and still clutching the Wolf <br>
Pack 4 letterbox in my hands. So Wolf Pack4, I've got your box, I'm <br>
going to try to dry the logbook, but it's really pretty soaked. I'll <br>
put a new logbook in it and replace the bags and box (it was leaking <br>
too). The stamp is fine, but I think the ink pad looked like the ink <br>
may have bled out of it. I'll replace your box to it's nice little <br>
hidy hole  within the next day or two... after the storms really do <br>
pass through!<br>

According to the Leave No Trace rules of outdoors ethics, you're <br>
supposed to wear waterproof (not water-resistant) hiking boots and <br>
walk through the mud puddles, not around them. Walking around the <br>
puddles contributes to trail erosion, widens existing trails, <br>
possibly enlarges puddles, and/or contributes to the creation of social trails.<br>

<div><font size="2">I agree. I didn't feel the need to bore everyone on the list with the details, but yes, I had on my waterproof hiking boots (which by that time were coated with about four inches of mud) and I was able to pick my way around the puddles through the woods on fallen logs, rocks and bark which had split off the trees. Actually that added to the excitement (especially on my hastened return trip) as I was scurrying across those logs in my very slippery boots. But you're right, Silent Doug, and thanks for the reminder.</font></div>

<p>Wow!!!! Now that is a letterboxing adventurist. How was you trip back <br/>in the afternoon. Saver, I hope. Lois<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/>&lt;cjagger405@<wbr>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I'm thinking about changing my trail name. Puddle Splasher suits me <br/>too well right now and I'm not sure that's a good thing. I live <br/>within a mile of a nature trail in McKinney with a letterbox which <br/>I'd not found as yet. This morning, I was restless and decided that <br/>although we had already had a pretty good rain, the sun was shining <br/>and the radar indicated the next storm was south of Dallas, at least <br/>an hour or so away. So I grabbed my backpack and headed out to find <br/>Wolf Pack 4. A short distance up the trail, I passed a young mother <br/>with three small children covered with mud and carrying bug nets. She <br/>told me that she hadn't realized until it was too late that the trail <br/>ahead was submerged under a huge mud puddle. I thanked her for the <br/>advice but continued...<wbr>. just in case my perspective was different. <br/>Soon I came to the puddle and she was definitely right, and there was <br/>no way around it. I could see the tracks her kids had left in the mud <br/>as they obviously went sliding down the slippery incline into the mud <br/>puddle. So I turned around but was not daunted. I knew another way to <br/>get around to the trail I needed to take - much longer, but at least <br/>I didn't have to give up just yet. It was a beautiful morning... <br/>birds singing, a soft breeze blowing through the leaves, peaceful, <br/>and I had the trail all to myself.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Finally I reached the trail head from the far side. As I started up <br/>the nature trail I found quite a few muddy puddles, but I was able to <br/>bypass all of them by leaving the trail and finding my way through <br/>the woods until I could rejoin the trail in a dryer place. Following <br/>the clues, eventually I arrived at the right location and found the <br/>letterbox. The woods was full of huge, fallen trees from all the <br/>recent storms we've had roll through the area, so I found one nearby <br/>to sit and stamp into the box. The problem was, when I opened the <br/>box, it was soaked. Inside was a sheet of paper from a family from <br/>Houston who had stamped in last week and said the logbook was wet and <br/>slimy so they used a sheet of paper instead.... and that was soaked. <br/>So I looked in my backpack and found an extra logbook I carry for <br/>such occasions and a new baggie to put it in and was just about to <br/>stamp it when a huge, monstrous, evil, loud clap of thunder exploded <br/>just over my head. As I looked up, I saw a streak of lightning <br/>immediately followed by another clap of thunder. I didn't have to <br/>think too long and hard to know I was a long way from my jeep and in <br/>a pretty dangerous situation.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Needless to say, I was soaked through and through by the time I got <br/>back to the jeep.... heart pounding, and still clutching the Wolf <br/>Pack 4 letterbox in my hands. So Wolf Pack4, I've got your box, I'm <br/>going to try to dry the logbook, but it's really pretty soaked. I'll <br/>put a new logbook in it and replace the bags and box (it was leaking <br/>too). The stamp is fine, but I think the ink pad looked like the ink <br/>may have bled out of it. I'll replace your box to it's nice little <br/>hidy hole within the next day or two... after the storms really do <br/>pass through!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Advice to anyone thinking about finding this box... just wait a few <br/>days until the trails dry out, but it's a beautiful area so I <br/>definitely recommend you add it to your list of boxes to find in the <br/>McKinney area.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And me... I'll keep the name Puddle Splasher. In fact my plan is to <br/>dry my hair, treat the wounds, and go back out this afternoon because <br/>I still have a couple of boxes I want to hide!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Puddle Splasher<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></p></div></font><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

I guess he'd done his research. His sole objective was to build a robot, and the exhibit did not disappoint him. Not only was he able to build one, but then it's connected it to a magnetic field and it will perform tasks. He was also thrilled to find a giant replica of a cochlear implant and the inner ear showing how it works. That was cool because his cousin (my other grandson) is deaf and has one.
