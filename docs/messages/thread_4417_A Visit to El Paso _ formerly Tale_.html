<br>
I and several of my friends from CA and TX will be in El Paso for a bowling tournament at the new bowling stadium on Memorial Day weekend and I would love to meet up with you and your family while we're in town.  We will be doing some letterboxing and geocaching also and would love to have you join us.  Perhaps you can recommend some boxes for us to find that AREN'T Army Man 10 mile hikes.  We're hoping for something easy to medium range as most of the ladies aren't capable of long hikes.  Especially if it's hot.<br>
<br>
I was hoping you could suggest some good restaurants to eat at too and would love to have you and your family join us.  I have to warn you though.  We can get a little crazy when we get together but we have a great time. :)<br>
<br>
Mother's Love<br>

We'll be going directly to the hotel to check-in and unload our baggage and then we'll be ready to go find somewhere for dinner.  Friday is a free day for us to sitesee and letterbox.  Saturday we bowl at 6:00 PM and Sunday at 2:00 PM.  We are bowling at the El Paso Convention Center.  Monday we fly home so we won't be joining you and Moni at the cemetary.  I will email you off list with my cell number.<br>
