                    <div class="plaintext-content">my apologies for being slow to get around to it, but i<br/>
would also like to say hi to the new boxers who have<br/>
joined the list recently, and also encourage you to be<br/>
bold and fearless when it comes to carving stamps. <br/>
just give it a try -- it is not nearly as hard as it<br/>
seems like it will be, when you read the tutorials,<br/>
nor as hard as it seems like it will be, when you are<br/>
looking at the stamps made by experienced carvers. <br/>
even i, who am admittedly not "arty", have managed to<br/>
make satisfactory progress in carving skill, in just a<br/>
few boxes, and now i just contentedly look foward to<br/>
continuing to make progress over time.  it is not a<br/>
art contest with jurors, after all, it is supposed to<br/>
be fun!  and it IS fun!  don't miss out on the fun of<br/>
it, by waiting to be perfect on the first try.  jump<br/>
on that learning curve and get started! : )<br/>
