                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey y'all.  Just wanted to let everyone know that Hunt County now has <br/>
8 new boxes! <br/>
We finally decided to try our hands at carving so be warned these are <br/>
the first carves of two idiots.  And now there are actually some boxes <br/>
in this area. <br/>
We still have one more to plant but plan on planting it down in <br/>
Henderson County this coming weekend.  <br/>
But looking forward to having these found!<br/>
Hope to see you on the trail.<br/>
They are all listed on both AQ and LBNA.<br/>
They are in Royse City, Quinlan and Greenville.<br/>
If you are coming to the area and want to contact us ahead of time, we <br/>
would be thrilled at meeting up with others.<br/>
