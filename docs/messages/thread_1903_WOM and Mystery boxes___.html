                    <html><body><div>I recently had an interesting exchange with a new boxer in my area (to my knowledge, no one on this list).  They sent me a message telling me my Spring Hope box was missing because they looked exactly where it was supposed to be and it was gone.  I was skeptical because that box has been remarkably undisturbed in the year and a half it has been in its hiding place.  As any of you knows who has found that box, it isn't exactly straightforward (and deliberately so).   However, I went and checked on it because I didn't want to be wrong when I wrote back and said "Try again."
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wrote back that it was in place, and they wrote me that I must have left a step out of the clues.  I responded that many folks had found it, but that it was a little harder than most the boxes around here and encouraged them to find some of the other local boxes while they keep up the effort to find Spring Hope.  The clues invite a finder to ask for a clue or two, so I kept thinking they'd ask, but I wasn't going to volunteer one without them asking.  The email I got back was "Never mind.  I'll just ask someone else where it is."  Sure enough, when I checked on it again a few days later, they had signed in.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now possibly they eventually found it on their own, but their response has me wondering.  I know there is a group here in town that has promoted letterboxing, but hasn't been in touch with any letterboxers as far as I know.  I'm thinking this person was a part of that group, so I think the group as a whole just didn't get a good picture of fair play in letterboxing since it's my understanding they "read how to do it".  Assuming that's the case, they really missed out on the spirit of letterboxing, didn't they?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is so much more to letterboxing than finding boxes - especially with special boxes like WOM and mystery boxes.  With the recent discussion of the WOM box Batty is working on combined with my recent experience with my mystery box (with boxes out there like Scarlet Pimpernel, I hate to call my box a mystery box, but I guess it does occupy the dark cobwebby corner of the mystery box arena!), I thought this might be a good time to let our new friends especially know that these two types of boxes should be treated with a little extra care.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A mystery box is a box that requires some puzzling to learn the location or the specific directions.  Never give away the solution to a mystery box - you went to the effort to solve it and you know how much pleasure you derived from that, so encourage someone else who is struggling with it, but don't give it away.  It robs the finder and the placer of the satisfaction of a good hunt.  You might notice that Batty asked for a hint, NOT an answer, and IF anyone offered her a hint, it must have been in a private message!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As to WOMs (Word Of Mouth- or unpublished boxes), if you are lucky enough to get the clues to a WOM, don't ever publish them and make sure that if you pass them along, you are doing it according to the placer's preferences.   As examples, if the placer only wants someone to get the clues from them, don't hand them out at all.  If the placer only wants them passed hand to hand, don't mail them.  And if in doubt, ask the placer!  A case in point of this is my Go Jacks box.  Josephine asked me some time ago for the clues to the box.  Then not too long ago Josephine's mother asked me.  My first thought was - "Well Josephine already has them!"  Then I realized she had found it already and her mother was wanting to find it, so rather than just giving her mother the clues, her mother rightly wrote to me for the clues herself because that's what the LBNA listing says to do.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Following these couple of guidelines for WOMs and Mystery boxes keeps the fun in them for everyone.  I would like to hear other boxers' opinion or suggestions about the handling of them too!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love the different permutations of letterboxing!!!  I particularly<br>
adore puzzles and different twists and different kinds of wordplay.<br>
<br>
I have some relatively straightforward clues and some that get harder<br>
on up to pretty challenging.  I feel that there are (for most of us,<br>
Mike and far West Texas excepted) a range of different boxes<br>
available.  You should pick the boxes that are right for you.  If you<br>
aren't used to walking, don't pick one that's an 8 mile round trip<br>
hike.   If you are impatient or don't know how to be surreptitious,<br>
choose boxes that are away from crowded areas.  And, if you don't like<br>
mysteries or puzzles, stick to straight-forward boxes.  Really,<br>
there's something for every style of boxer!  <br>
<br>
For me, I think it's okay to work together to solve a mystery box. <br>
But, I would prefer people not just give others the answers.  There's<br>
nothing really to stop that, but it seems against the spirit of the<br>
adventure.  I'm generally okay with giving hints, although there are<br>
some boxes for which I won't.<br>
<br>
However, I think that it would be foolhardy to violate a placer's<br>
wishes about a WOM box, because you might not get the clues the next<br>
time!  <br>

<br>
Yes...I completely agree with both Lucy and Dewberry.  Although the <br>
challenge of  a mystery box may not appeal to some...others find it <br>
a challenge...kind of like "throwing down the gauntlet".  This is <br>
why I never want anyone to just tell me the answer.  I want to EARN <br>
it!!!  And until I do...I don't deserve the have the stamp in my <br>
logbook.  But once I figure it out...Boy!  I am going barreling out <br>
my front door to collect my stamp!<br>
<br>
I also agree with the discussion re:WOM clues.  I hope that everyone <br>
can notice that I will never specifically mention a boxer's name or <br>
specific clues unless I have first asked his/her permission.  <br>
And...I won't share WOM clues without first asking permission or <br>
following any special instructions provided in the clues themselves.<br>
<br>
As for our very own famous (infamous?) TX boxer whose boxes I am <br>
currently working on...I happened to meet this intriguing gentleman <br>
during my Cookie Caper series.  He found all of my cookie boxes and <br>
came by my home to retrieve his prize.  He is very clever, yet does <br>
not like to solve cryptic clues himself (tricky, tricky, eh?).  As a <br>
matter of fact, my Cookie series had TWO cryptic clues and one of <br>
them...he drove to the park and said, "where would I be hiding if I <br>
were a letterbox?" and proceeded straight to my box!  (Next <br>
time...I'm gonna hide it in a way out-of-the-way place!)  The other <br>
cryptic clue...he emailed me for a hint.  (I was happy to provide, <br>
by the way.)  However...I feel I would totally expose myself as <br>
the "clueless" boxer I am if I were to ask for a hint this soon.  I <br>
mean...it's not even been a year yet!!!  I cannot give up that <br>
easily!!!  I will not be defeated!!!<br>

<div>****Yeesh.  This is a good point.  I might point out that the only reason I mentioned the placer of the WOM box Batty is working on is because the story behind it is already widely known and I was filling in details of that story.  Still and even, I probably shouldn't have mentioned the name...

No..I think you're all right.  It IS a widely known story and that's <br>
why I posted on the group to get a hint.  I knew that with my <br>
cautiously worded request, a great many of you would know EXACTLY what <br>
I was talking about.  And...GG, himself, told me that the group of you <br>
were furiously puzzle-solving at the last gathering, so I know that he <br>
knows the WOM clues and solutions are "out there" so to speak.<br>
<br>

<br>
PS  Thanks to everyone who gave me a little hint.  I am now focused in <br>
an entirely different direction than before and hope to solve this <br>
puzzle soon!!!<br>
