on atlas quest.  for all of you boxers who live away from this area, <br/>
there are a lot of boxes to be found.  as of right now, the event will <br/>
be friday from 6-dark and then saturday from 8-1.  afterwards be sure <br/>
and go boxing in the area.  there are also 3 boxes in this cemetery, a <br/>
haunted statue and there will be some surprise stamps that will appear <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">hey there, i just want to say "thanks" to all the people who drove so <br/>
far to attend this event to help me transcribe the cemetery.  Gryzzled <br/>
Gryphon, Mother's Love, and Horse Rider braved both days of the event <br/>
and the Boxhounds actually came all the way from Corpus Christi to <br/>
help out today.  The event was supposed to end today at 1, however, <br/>
due to the misreading of the times, we all ended up staying till <br/>
around 5:30 this afternoon.  Four of us actually got there this <br/>
morning around 7:30-8.  I also want to say thanks to my mom for <br/>
bringing us the sandwiches, cookies, chips, and drinks today.  I think <br/>
we all needed it.  It was great seeing "old" friends and meeting some <br/>
new ones.  I am not sure how many headstones we transcribed in the two <br/>
days, but once i get that number i will surely post it.  By the way, <br/>
if you have to talk to GG, be sure and ask him about his run-in with <br/>
the local police.  again, thanks to all who came for making this such <br/>
a great event.<br/>

<div>For reals, do I need to get some cash out for bail? Come on GG, you 
      got give us the story. You know if you leave us on our own, we'll come up 
      with a story that may not be anywhere close to the truth,

<div>hey there, i just want to say "thanks" to all the people who 
          drove so <br/>far to attend this event to help me transcribe the 
          cemetery. Gryzzled <br/>Gryphon, Mother's Love, and Horse Rider braved 
          both days of the event <br/>and the Boxhounds actually came all the way 
          from Corpus Christi to <br/>help out today. The event was supposed to 
          end today at 1, however, <br/>due to the misreading of the times, we 
          all ended up staying till <br/>around 5:30 this afternoon. Four of us 
          actually got there this <br/>morning around 7:30-8. I also want to say 
          thanks to my mom for <br/>bringing us the sandwiches, cookies, chips, 
          and drinks today. I think <br/>we all needed it. It was great seeing 
          "old" friends and meeting some <br/>new ones. I am not sure how many 
          headstones we transcribed in the two <br/>days, but once i get that 
          number i will surely post it. By the way, <br/>if you have to talk to 
          GG, be sure and ask him about his run-in with <br/>the local police. 
          again, thanks to all who came for making this such <br/>a great 
          event.<br/><br/>jb kokopelli<br/><br/></div></div><span width="1"></span></div></div></div></blockquote></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's

We had a great time and it was very nice to meet the Boxhound family <br/>
