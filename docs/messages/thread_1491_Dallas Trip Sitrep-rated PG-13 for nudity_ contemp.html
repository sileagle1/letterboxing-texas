                    <div class="plaintext-content">My daughter and I got in from Dallas yesterday just a<br/>
few hours after our fellas got home from their big<br/>
hike.  They had a great time it seems, although the<br/>
terrain was a little more challenging than they had<br/>
expected, so they weren't able to do as long of a hike<br/>
as they had planned.  They did plant a box for me<br/>
while they were there (Glenwood, AR), and I'll be<br/>
posting clues a bit later today.<br/>
<br/>
As for us, we were pleased with our outcome, although<br/>
we wound up cutting our trip short by a few hours<br/>
because my daughter was starting to get really tired<br/>
and sore.  She stuck with it like a champ though!  We<br/>
can now say we've boxed in the dark and in the rain...<br/>
<br/>
We found 14 boxes in two days and one hitchhiker.  We<br/>
learned that it is quite a bit different boxing in an<br/>
urban setting than boxing in woods and parks, as we<br/>
are accustomed to doing.  I'll include a summary list<br/>
of what we found at the bottom of this, but here are<br/>
the high points of our trip.<br/>
<br/>
My daughter has gone by Elmo for a couple years, but<br/>
decided to change her name to SJZ after our animals<br/>
that she loves dearly - Sunshine, Jolly, and Zephyr. <br/>
I suspect she'll stick with this name but will evolve<br/>
it a bit into something a little more friendly to the<br/>
eye and ear.  She carved a nice little stamp to go<br/>
with it, but it caused us to be later getting out of<br/>
town than I had wanted on Thursday.  I had planned to<br/>
go to Nana's house for lunch then return home long<br/>
enough to load up and head out to pick up the<br/>
Greenville boxes Thursday evening.  Instead, we went<br/>
to Nana's and detoured to pick up Lucy Locket's<br/>
Vivaldi's Autumn (short version of the name) that<br/>
Lightning and I hadn't found the first time we went<br/>
and looked, then headed home so she could recarve.  <br/>
<br/>
We had decided we would camp, but that we would take<br/>
my in-laws' custom van so we could avoid messing with<br/>
a tent.  By the time we carved, loaded, gassed up<br/>
($1.859 a gallon!), stocked up, and hit the road, I<br/>
knew we wouldn't have daylight once we hit Greenville,<br/>
so we regrouped and decided to camp at Lake Tawakoni<br/>
the first night.  We arrived there and almost<br/>
immediately crashed so we could get up early and head<br/>
on up to Greenville.  I had hoped to plant a box there<br/>
at Tawakoni, but the winds were howling and it was<br/>
very difficult to concentrate on carving in the heavy<br/>
winds, so I gave up on that idea.<br/>
<br/>
After very good directions from a ranger at Tawakoni,<br/>
we hit Greenville and started finding boxes right<br/>
away.  We found three of the four planted there by<br/>
Catpawz, but had to move on before we could find the<br/>
fourth.  I must say - we were not real crazy about the<br/>
wind so we tried to shortcut their clues twice by<br/>
eyeballing landmarks instead of marking them off by<br/>
the clues, only to be confounded as we learned we<br/>
didn't know as much as we thought we did!  Lesson<br/>
learned-don't second guess Catpawz on their clues -<br/>
nice job y'all!  My personal favorite was Forest Park.<br/>
 We also found Oak Creek and Audie Murphy.  All very<br/>
nice.<br/>
<br/>
We headed on to Plano and looked for a couple of boxes<br/>
there.  Now bear in mind that this was SJZ's first<br/>
time to try to navigate in the city on the fly with a<br/>
map and a set of directions, so it got - interesting -<br/>
sometimes!  Did y'all know Parker Road in Plano is an<br/>
endless loop?  Neither did I, but I swear it must be<br/>
because it took us three hours to finally break free<br/>
of it!  Seriously though, she finally figured out the<br/>
navigating thing (she's great with map and compass -<br/>
in the woods) and did a flawless job after that, so<br/>
the three hour tour was well-worth it, that and we<br/>
stopped in the same Starbucks three times.  We were<br/>
able to find Cadenza's No Directions Needed! with only<br/>
minimal directions.  It was in a nice wildlife<br/>
preserve that deserves another box or two.  We also<br/>
found raindear's Plano Balloon Festival, but sadly it<br/>
was strewn about and the box lid and the stamp were<br/>
nowhere to be found, but a ziploc baggie had been<br/>
ripped to shreds.  There was a geocache in the<br/>
immediate proximity which appeared to be heavily<br/>
visited (we found it accidentally so we snooped into<br/>
its logbook).  According to raindear, he had received<br/>
word from a gc'er that the box was strewn about last<br/>
week too, and I figure since the gc'er was diligent<br/>
enough to email raindear, he was probably diligent<br/>
enough to put it back together.  If that is the case,<br/>
it would seem this was the second time recently that<br/>
the box was ravaged.  Raindear would like to replace<br/>
the stamp I think, but would like to find someone who<br/>
would adopt the box or at least be willing to check it<br/>
periodically.<br/>
<br/>
After our Parker Road tour took so long, we were about<br/>
out of daylight after finishing up the two Plano<br/>
boxes.  We decided to head on down to Cedar Hill State<br/>
Park for the night, so on the way we stopped by in<br/>
Addison for Celtic Lions' Pretty in Pink.  Because it<br/>
was dark, we missed out on seeing the pink office<br/>
building, but the fountain was really neat at night<br/>
and it made a nice place to relax and stamp in.  We<br/>
left there and went on to Downtown Dallas to find<br/>
Celtic Lions' Shawnee Trail.  I have always loved<br/>
walking through downtown Dallas at night, and<br/>
exploring the monument was striking in the early<br/>
evening.  There were several families in the area and<br/>
security was clearly present, so we felt relatively<br/>
safe - but we were certainly startled when we were<br/>
traipsing down a trail and literally stumbled across<br/>
two naked people.  I wasn't sure they were really<br/>
naked until I shined my flashlight on them to make<br/>
sure.  Yikes!  Ummm...glad I didn't have Lightning<br/>
along!  It's been a long time since I've lived in a<br/>
city, but it came rushing back to me that you have to<br/>
be prepared for what you don't know is around the next<br/>
corner...we checked our alertness and doubled it up<br/>
for the duration of our stay in the area.<br/>
<br/>
We made it to Cedar Hill without running across any<br/>
more naked people (that we knew of anyway), and we set<br/>
to making supper over a campfire - foil pouches with<br/>
veggies - the stuff of scouting!  While we waited for<br/>
our veggies and ate some cheese and lunch meat, we<br/>
debated running back in to Duncanville to grab<br/>
Cummins' Clan's Dragonfly box or heading out to look<br/>
for Silver Eagle's Texas Star and Baby Bear's<br/>
Campground Bandit boxes right there in the state park.<br/>
 I looked over at SJZ and she was nodding off even as<br/>
we talked, so I took that as a sign we should call off<br/>
any further letterboxing for the day.  My night owl 18<br/>
year old was dead in her seat at 10:00 p.m.!  I packed<br/>
her off to the van to go to sleep and cleaned things<br/>
up and headed off to sleep myself.<br/>
<br/>
I awoke bright and early the next morning to a<br/>
temperate day - and a promise of rain.  I poked around<br/>
the campsite awhile waiting for SJZ to wake up and get<br/>
moving, but finally gave up on her and decided she<br/>
could sleep while I drove.  I headed out to the<br/>
camping area where the trail was with Silver Eagle's<br/>
and Baby Bear's boxes.  I was alarmed to see that<br/>
several of the remote camping areas were closed off,<br/>
and I was afraid I wasn't going to be able to get to<br/>
the boxes.  Fortunately the area was open, even though<br/>
the area immediately beyond the trailhead was closed<br/>
down.  The motion of the van had gotten SJZ moving, so<br/>
she quickly got herself ready and while I waited for<br/>
her, I chatted with a ranger who sternly warned us off<br/>
of violating the restricted area signs.  I assured him<br/>
we only wanted to take a morning hike on the trail,<br/>
and although he was still suspicious, he allowed us to<br/>
continue on.  I must admit though - my rebellious<br/>
nature kicked in as soon as he turned his back (I'm<br/>
only secretly rebellious), and I did walk on the WRONG<br/>
side of one of the cones.  To my knowledge, nothing<br/>
blew up though.  Anyway, the trail was lovely and<br/>
peaceful and we could have easily navigated it at<br/>
night, but I did notice that there were lots of<br/>
gnarled twisted hickory trees that probably would've<br/>
looked really scary by moonlight!  SJZ noticed that<br/>
too, and we were glad we didn't try to do the trail<br/>
the night before because we might've scared ourselves<br/>
silly.  We found the two boxes and they were up to the<br/>
standard of excellence we all expect of the boxing<br/>
brothers.  We gathered them both up (the boxes, not<br/>
the brothers) and carried them to the end of the trail<br/>
which ended at a scenic overlook.  We took our time<br/>
stamping in all around and enjoying the view, and when<br/>
it started sprinkling we buttoned the boxes and our<br/>
backpack up and headed back from whence we came.  We<br/>
exited the trail and the ranger was milling<br/>
around...I'm sure wondering whether he would find us<br/>
off the path somewhere and recon'ing our way to the<br/>
restricted area (okay, maybe he wasn't really that<br/>
paranoid, but I did have to laugh at the fact he was<br/>
still hanging out there!).<br/>
<br/>
We checked out and headed on in to Duncanville for a<br/>
bite to eat at Denny's and a shot at Duncanville<br/>
Dragonfly by Cummins' Clan.  The park that Dragonfly<br/>
was in was not nearly as upscale as the parks we spent<br/>
time in in Plano, but it had a well-loved, homey feel<br/>
to it and was just a nice little park, the kind I<br/>
could while away long afternoons in.  There were a few<br/>
folks there fishing, but it was raining too so they<br/>
were quickly discouraged and left, so we were able to<br/>
do our business without arousing suspicion.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, we headed toward Richardson to get some boxex<br/>
Ruby had suggested we try.  We hit her awesome<br/>
Flamingo boxes - the only thing I want to know is "Is<br/>
the story about the flock of flamingos true?"  I'm a<br/>
little afraid to ask that in a public forum for fear<br/>
of proving my gullibility, but I really need to know! <br/>
We found Business Casual and Flamingos in Love - the<br/>
rain that persisted was great for keeping folks away. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have y'all ever noticed what an energetic<br/>
high-spirited family Celtic Lions is?  I've learned<br/>
that I love their stamps and their boxes because they<br/>
reflect those same qualities!<br/>
<br/>
We also found the Sprite and the Highlander's Life<br/>
Lessons from the Juke Box Harper Valley PTA box. <br/>
However, we were alarmed to again stumble upon<br/>
(although at least it wasn't literally this time) more<br/>
naked people - middle-aged folks making out in the<br/>
back seat of one of their cars - they had the door<br/>
open as we arrived, but had the decency to close it<br/>
before we went back to our car after find the box.  We<br/>
were beginning to wonder what it was about us that<br/>
attracted naked people in public places.  Do you city<br/>
folk run into naked people with the same frequency we<br/>
did???<br/>
<br/>
We also found wandaandpete's Dallas Cowboys.  Now this<br/>
was an adventure.  We got to the park/school with no<br/>
problem.  And we followed the clues with no problem. <br/>
We were strolling across the field as directed with no<br/>
problem.  It was only as we were approaching a key<br/>
landmark that we realized we had a problem - we were<br/>
walking in wet Dallas black gumbo mud!  Oh my!  I make<br/>
it a practice not to wear high heels, especially not<br/>
when I'm letterboxing, so when I suddenly started<br/>
feeling taller, I took notice.  About the same time<br/>
SJZ died laughing when she realized our dilemma too -<br/>
we had a bad soccer experience in this stuff several<br/>
years ago, so we knew well what we had gotten<br/>
ourselves into.  Anyway, there we stood at the edge of<br/>
this field with our newly fashioned high-heeled tennis<br/>
shoes on and wondering how to nonchalantly navigate<br/>
the rest of the way to the box, when a dog in a yard<br/>
nearby began barking at us.  Now SJZ loves animals and<br/>
she believes she can talk to them, so she began<br/>
barking back.  Yep.  Barking back.  I've seen her<br/>
outbark a poodle before, but that's another story. <br/>
Apparently she forgot we were on a clandestine mission<br/>
and in a sensitive position when she started barking,<br/>
but all that crazy barking brought the real dog's<br/>
owner to the door, and there we stood in the field<br/>
with black mud-covered shoes and a teenager barking at<br/>
her dog and no explanation for what we were doing.  We<br/>
just kind of hung out and talked to each other and<br/>
pretended it was the most natural place in the world<br/>
to have a discussion, all the while pretending the<br/>
woman wasn't there.  She finally went back inside and<br/>
we cautiously grabbed box and took it away to stamp<br/>
in.  <br/>
<br/>
We continued on to White Rock Lake with intentions of<br/>
finishing up there; however, the rain and the mud and<br/>
all our exertion was taking its toll on SJZ especially<br/>
and we decided we would return soon to finish those<br/>
boxes and also to swing out to the Fort Worth are to<br/>
get Grapevine and Denton and Southlake and Flower<br/>
Mound.<br/>
<br/>
So with that not very summary summary, I'll end with a<br/>
summarized summary below.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all for the great boxes we found this<br/>
weekend and for giving us a reason to get out of the<br/>
house and have some fun!<br/>
