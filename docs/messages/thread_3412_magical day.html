<div>We spent the weekend (Friday and Saturday 
for us) in Ft. Worth. It was absolutely wonderful! We had such a good time. The 
bad news was that we drove off from home and I realized we had forgotten our 
notebook that had our letterboxing clues. So Friday there was no letterboxing. 
We visited the butterfly exhibit at the Ft. Worth Botanical Gardens and had a 
fabulous time walking the grounds and I tried not to even bring up letterboxing 
to Stinky Monkey (hey Blue Butterfly...I didn't realize you had a Stinky Monkey 
too!), Aslan, and Sneaky Cat. After much greatness we went to spend the night 
with my husband's youngest brother's girlfriend. Thankfully she had a computer 
and internet access (YEA!) and after the kids went to bed I sat up and printed 
clues.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This morning we were off to the Ft. Worth 
zoo and had lots of fun. Then back the other way on University. We did stop to 
eat and parked on an incline...my husband put on the parking break and then it 
wouldn't release. What a pain! An hour later we finally got a screwdriver long 
enough to reach up under there and pop the button thingie that releases the 
brake and we were on our way. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So due to poor packing, poor planning, and 
some car issues, we only got to find three boxes before the sun went down. But 
they were so wonderful that we were all completely satisfied with our weekend 
and our hunt.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box #1 Lightning Whelk-- The website said 
this stamp was made by Black Widow, but the logbook said Stargazer. I haven't 
been around long enough to know if these are the same person. But let me tell 
you, that is one gorgeous stamp! The directions were clear, the box was in great 
shape, and we had a lovely time finding it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box #2 Georgia O'Keefe's Red 
Poppies--ANOTHER amazing stamp, this one by Puddle Splasher. After finding this 
one (again, great directions although we did get overzealous and pass the tree 
the directions described. After stopping and actually READING (not 
skimming) the directions we realized we were just spasms and went back to 
right where it was described. So after this stamp I am thinking that I've gotta 
learn how to carve stamps (ours are storebought, I just didn't have time to even 
think about it with three little boys, etc.) This is the first time I've even 
had the idea of MY learning to carve stamps cross my radar. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Box #3 Ornette Coleman by Viewfinder. This 
one my husband was excited about finding even though he isn't into letterboxing 
and just goes with us because he enjoys being outside and watching the kids go 
through spasms of ecstacy when one is found. (They actually quiver during the 
hunt. It is hysterical.) My husband is a music buff with several music degrees 
and he loved the idea that this was a box dedicated to a great Sax player. He 
also was very complimentary about the stamp...I think he was dying to know what 
it was going to look like. (We might get him to join us yet!!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had another box we spent a very long time 
looking for and I do not think the clues are accurate anymore due to changes in 
the garden. It is possible that we could have missed it. I plan to contact the 
owner privately and being a newbie, I don't know if it is appropriate to 
post the details here.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But I just have to tell you folks 
(Viewfinder, Puddle Splasher, Stargazer/Black Widow) that you certainly enriched 
our day and we had such a great time. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you!!!</div>

<div>I was just thinking after reading your post: those gardens are amazing this time of year or most any time of the year, but especially in the springtime. But for letterboxers, add a variety of boxes hidden there by different letterboxers, and life just couldn't get any better. One of my boxes in the Artist Series (Monet's Waterlilies) seems to have gone missing after having been there for two years. My plans are to replace it within the next few weeks. Thanks for the nice comments, Ladybird Beetlebug. You'll have to go back and find the other boxes hidden in the gardens and at Trinity Park (across University Blvd.) They're all wonderful boxes. I think Kantexan's box is the oldest one in the gardens and is amazing! Oh, and you're right: Stargazer recently changed her trailname to Black Widow. She carves beautiful stamps, doesn't she? </div>
