Yeah - I know.  Up at 0400.  Work at 0500.  Jeep head at 1600.  Dog training<br>
at 1830.  Just got home.  <sigh> and I am tired already.  Still got to feed<br>
the dog - then feed me.   <br>
<br>
Good thing the kids are gone - what would I do then?<br>
<br>
I just wanted take a few seconds to publicly thank Batty B for the neat<br>
patches.  All arrived well.<br>
<br>
I also have a batch of Geocaching patches.  Now I just need some LBNA<br>
patches, then start passing them out to friends.  Anyone know the drill to<br>
get LBNA patches?<br>

Hey Mike!<br>
<br>
I'm pretty sure that you no longer have to order LbNA patches in <br>
bulk.  They removed the "bulk orders only" tag, but it seems to keep <br>
popping up. I remember a discussion about all this on the main LbNA <br>
chat group.  Unfortunately, the lady that does the LbNA patches <br>
doesn't have a Paypal account, however, so you'll have to print out <br>
the order page and then mail a check to her.  Good luck!<br>
