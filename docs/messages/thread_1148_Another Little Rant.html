art.  It's an ongoing debate that seems to come up on<br/>
one LB list or another periodically - are we in it for<br/>
the art or are we in it for the experience?<br/>
<br/>
I look back at my first stamps and I'm amazed at how<br/>
much my carving has developed.  Do I regret planting<br/>
those first boxes?  Not at all.  I'm glad they are out<br/>
there and I don't apologize for them.  I'm sure there<br/>
are some folks who find them and think "Wow...what was<br/>
she thinking when she carved THAT?"  Who cares.  I<br/>
enjoyed carving those stamps and planting those boxes<br/>
and they were the best I could do at the time.  I<br/>
didn't promise Rembrandt in my clues after all!<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the best ways for a new boxer to become<br/>
a good boxer is to plant a box.  When you plant, you<br/>
get the full extent of the experience.  You learn what<br/>
it is like to create a box and set it free.  You<br/>
almost certainly find out what it is like to lose a<br/>
box.  You find out how nice it is to get an email<br/>
saying "found your box".  Becoming a planter makes you<br/>
a better finder.<br/>
<br/>
Most folks will be very encouraging to you as they go<br/>
and find your boxes.  But if creating and planting the<br/>
box gave you pleasure, it was worthwhile to you<br/>
anyway.  Artwork is subjective and if one person<br/>
doesn't like your stamp, someone else will come along<br/>
who does.  <br/>
<br/>
Hang in there!<br/>

Artistic stamps-give the carver some credit.  Some of<br/>
us are just starting out and have never carved a stamp<br/>
before.  If I knew all my stamps had to be works of<br/>
art before I placed them, I wouldn't be placing boxes.<br/>
 With two kids (6 months and 2 years), I'm doing good<br/>
to get anything carved and placed!<br/>
