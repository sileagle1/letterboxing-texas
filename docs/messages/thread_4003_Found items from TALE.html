I'd like to also repeat the thank you to Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter for the copier.  That was a big surprise (don't expect to see those out at the park) and extremely helpful.<br/>

After the sun set, we were forced to return to our car and head for home.  I went to retrieve my TX Letterboxing Treasure box from the deserted pavilion, which I had left at the pavilion when we were there closer to 6 because it still had activity about it.  Sitting next to my box was a bag of letterboxing items.  I contacted who I thought it might belong to and they said it wasn't theirs, so if you are missing something, e-mail me so I can see about getting it back to you.<br/>
<br/>
Happy trails, everyone<br/>
