                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone! It's been so long, y'all probably don't remember me, but I <br/>
wanted to drop by and give an update on a few of my letterboxes. <br/>
<br/>
In Evergreen Cemetery, near Skidmore, I have pulled three of my boxes. <br/>
The Bottino Family emailed me recently telling me that the books were <br/>
full and damaged. When I went to check on them, the boxes on two of <br/>
them were cracked too, so they will be replaced as well. 'Watchful <br/>
Birds' and 'Rest in Peace #1' will be returned very soon, but 'The Bee <br/>
Hive Hitchhiker Hostel' is missing 2 parts of the 3-part box stamp. So <br/>
I am going to have to do some recarving there. Apparently someone <br/>
mistook those two stamps (a bee and a hexagon(?) shape) for <br/>
hitchhikers! There are several nice hitchhikers in the hostel, but I am <br/>
taking good care of them until the whole thing is re-placed. <br/>
<br/>
I did get a report that the Lost and Found Leaf outside of a cemetery <br/>
in Beeville is alive and well - except for needing a new book. I think <br/>
it had been reported as missing before. So, I will get back to that one <br/>
with a new booklet as soon as I can get around to it. <br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing,<br/>
Busy Bee (Wanda)<br/>
