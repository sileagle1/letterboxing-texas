                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've placed seven new boxes in West Texas; four in Ector County <br>
(Odessa) and three in Midland County.  They are called "Horny <br>
Toad", "From Russia With Love", "Comanche War Trail", "Desert <br>
Flower", "Quilt Block Series - Birds in the Air", "The Pliska <br>
Aeroplane" and "Wascally Wabbit".  Could there be more in the near <br>
future?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for your kind words and wisdom, Batty B, we do appreciate <br>
them, and thanks again for taking care of LSQ's box in Georgetown.  <br>
Actually, we have an advantage in that El Lobo, a very fine and <br>
prolific letterboxer who lives in Midland is LSQ's brother!  He and <br>
his wife, Star Seeker, got us hooked on letterboxing. He will watch <br>
over our boxes for us.  Also, he is recruiting other boxers out <br>
there, so that's a good omen for the letterboxing future of that <br>
part of Texas.<br>

What great, prolific boxers the pair of you are....I know that we in <br>
Georgetown are grateful for your interest in our town and the <br>
incredible boxes that you have planted here.  :-)<br>

the group's discussions about "abandoned" boxes and boxers that <br>
