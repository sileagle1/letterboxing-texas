Hi, folks!  I'm new to letterboxing, like in the past few months new and I've carved six designs based on the Mexican loteria game (I'm Mexican American so I thought it would be cool).  Anyway, I was wondering if there was anyone or a few people out there who could help me plant them.  I've never done this before so I need big time help.<br>
<br>
I thought it would also be cool to do the clues in Spanish, so that could be the puzzle part for non-speakers: translating.  Maybe they can be hidden in places that go with the design, like the palm tree can go in Galveston.<br>
<br>
Anywho, If you've never played the game, it's like bingo.  You have your own board and one deck of cards, each with a picture and the name, like "la rosa".  Then on the older versions, they have a little rhyme that has to do with the picture.  We could add that to the description just for fun.<br>
<br>
So far I have carved the palm tree, the pear, the arrows, the sun, the rose and the heron-- which is "garza" in Spanish-- my last name.  I would really like to start with that one.<br>
<br>
Anyone, anyone?  Maybe you'd like to help on a specific one or even a few.  If you are intersted, I would really, really appreciate your help.  I can email the stamped images to you if you are really interested.<br>
<br>
Next, I plan to carve the heart, the hand, the watermelon, the crown, the prickly pear and the frog.  If you have a particular card you'd like to help plant, let me know and I can carve it.  You can Google Mexican loteria to see some of the others.<br>

<br>
I'm not sure why you need help planting your boxes since you already have an idea for the theme and clues, and have already started carving.  Now you just need to start placing the boxes and you should do that yourself.  Once you create a box you feel very attached to it and I don't think you will want to give it to someone else to plant.  If you are just looking for suggestions then I have some.  Be sure to find several boxes before placing your own so you can get an idea of what makes a good hiding place.  Once you are ready then decide on the park or other location you want to hide it in.  The actual hiding place should be a location that would not see a lot of traffic and the box should be out of sight from a trail even if not covered with leaves or rocks since animals or careless letterboxers sometimes leave boxes exposed (e.g. on the back side of a tree instead of the front).  Camouflage the box with paint or tape, too.  Also, try to hide the box on higher ground than surrounding area to avoid flooding (assuming it ever rains again).  The container should be something fairly water tight like a Lock N Lock box or pill container with contents in double ziplock bags.<br>
<br>
Memorial Park already has a lot of boxes but there is probably room for a few more.  Maybe you could use the different color trails for some of your boxes with that color, or something like that.  You sound creative so just go with your instinct and have fun with it.<br>

 are just looking for suggestions then I have some. Be sure to find several boxes before placing your own so you can get an idea of what makes a good hiding place. Once you are ready then decide on the park or other location you want to hide it in. The actual hiding place should be a location that would not see a lot of traffic and the box should be out of sight from a trail even if not covered with leaves or rocks since animals or careless letterboxers sometimes leave boxes exposed (e.g. on the back side of a tree instead of the front). Camouflage the box with paint or tape, too. Also, try to hide the box on higher<br/>&gt; ground than surrounding area to avoid flooding (assuming it ever rains again). The container should be something fairly water tight like a Lock N Lock box or pill container with contents in double ziplock bags.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Memorial Park already has a lot of boxes but there is probably room for a few more. Maybe you could use the
 different color trails for some of your boxes with that color, or something like that. You sound creative so just go with your instinct and have fun with it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Silver Eagle<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" ymailto="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Melissa" &lt;melgarza2000@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I posted this on AQ and wanted to repost it here!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Hi, folks!

                  where to plant like at a park that may be across town
                  that I don't know about, or that might not have as
                  many like Memorial Park that would be good info.  I
                  work near Memorial Park and off the North Loop, so I
                  don't know about many other places, but I guess I

<div>Howdy Melissa, and welcome to Letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
                      I'm not sure why you need help planting your boxes
                      since you already have an idea for the theme and
                      clues, and have already started carving. Now you
                      just need to start placing the boxes and you
                      should do that yourself. Once you create a box you
                      feel very attached to it and I don't think you
                      will want to give it to someone else to plant. If
                      you are just looking for suggestions then I have
                      some. Be sure to find several boxes before placing
                      your own so you can get an idea of what makes a
                      good hiding place. Once you are ready then decide
                      on the park or other location you want to hide it
                      in. The actual hiding place should be a location
                      that would not see a lot of traffic and the box
                      should be out of sight from a trail even if not
                      covered with leaves or rocks since animals or
                      careless letterboxers sometimes leave boxes
                      exposed (e.g. on the back side of a tree instead
                      of the front). Camouflage the box with paint or
                      tape, too. Also, try to hide the box on higher
                      ground than surrounding area to avoid flooding
                      (assuming it ever rains again). The container
                      should be something fairly water tight like a Lock
                      N Lock box or pill container with contents in
                      double ziplock bags.<br/>
<br/>
                      Memorial Park already has a lot of boxes but there
                      is probably room for a few more. Maybe you could
                      use the different color trails for some of your
                      boxes with that color, or something like that. You
                      sound creative so just go with your instinct and
                      have fun with it.<br/>

here!<br/>
<br/>
Hi, folks! I'm new to letterboxing, like in the past few months new and I've
carved six designs based on the Mexican loteria game (I'm Mexican American so I
thought it would be cool). Anyway, I was wondering if there was anyone or a few
people out there who could help me plant them. I've never done this before so I
need big time help.<br/>
<br/>
I thought it would also be cool to do the clues in Spanish, so that could be
the puzzle part for non-speakers: translating. Maybe they can be hidden in
places that go with the design, like the palm tree can go in Galveston.<br/>
<br/>
Anywho, If you've never played the game, it's like bingo. You have your own
board and one deck of cards, each with a picture and the name, like "la rosa".
Then on the older versions, they have a little rhyme that has to do with the
picture. We could add that to the description just for fun.<br/>
<br/>
So far I have carved the palm tree, the pear, the arrows, the sun, the rose and
the heron-- which is "garza" in Spanish-- my last name. I would
really like to start with that one.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone, anyone? Maybe you'd like to help on a specific one or even a few. If
you are intersted, I would really, really appreciate your help. I can email the
stamped images to you if you are really interested.<br/>
<br/>
Next, I plan to carve the heart, the hand, the watermelon, the crown, the
prickly pear and the frog. If you have a particular card you'd like to help
plant, let me know and I can carve it. You can Google Mexican loteria to see
some of the others.<o:p></o:p></p>
