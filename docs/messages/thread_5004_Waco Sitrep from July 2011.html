                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm finally catching up on my Waco trip. It did NOT go as planned, but<br>
we still had a good time. Trail Whale wasn't quite the letterboxer he<br>
believed himself to be (or that I had hoped he would be) - was done<br>
with it after the first box. I hassled with him for a little while in<br>
Holy Cross Cemetery, trying to get him back on board, but I finally<br>
gave up and we went to the dinosaur site, had ice cream and called it<br>
good.<br>
<br>
We did, however, find LSQ's Angel box. It was a VERY nice first stamp<br>
for Jonah's first box in his logbook. I wanted to make sure that one<br>
was really special, so I knew we would first go for either one of<br>
yours or one of hers. There was a funeral going on in the other<br>
cemetery, so I decided we would go for hers. As it turned out, when I<br>
found the box it was out in plain view. There was a note in the<br>
logbook from the groundskeeper where he had stamped the box's stamp<br>
into the box's logbook, and made a note that he had trimmed the<br>
bushes, essentially getting rid of the box's cover. Since his note<br>
sounded as if he was cool with it, I cleaned out a little indention in<br>
the ground and slid the box into it, then covered it with a little<br>
local chaff - basically grass clippings- and put a rock on top of it<br>
(without looking back at the clues, I think she had the box covered<br>
with the rock anyway).<br>
<br>
I'm really bummed we didn't get to do more boxing, but I was already<br>
thinking that I really wished Fearless Fox and d'vir were with me,<br>
most especially d'vir, because they would have loved the historical<br>
nature of most the boxes in Waco. We'll probably head back that way<br>
very soon.<br>
<br>
Following is a note I wrote to someone who was bummed she didn't feel<br>
more like "real" letterboxer because she doesn't get to box much...I<br>
thought you would enjoy the "whole" story behind our Waco trip.<br>
<br>
I took Trail Whale letterboxing with me to Waco the other day. He<br>
considers himself to be a serious letterboxer. It's been five years<br>
since I've been to Waco to box and virtually every box I had found is<br>
gone and all new ones are there. I did my crazy trip planning that I<br>
do (if you've never seen one of my maps, you're missing out!), then<br>
stepped back and made myself prioritize the boxes there to come up<br>
with a list of about 10-12 boxes that we could manage bearing in mind<br>
that I was taking a young child with me. Since about six of those<br>
boxes were in two bordering cemeteries, I figured it was very do-able.<br>
I even had the good sense to plan for one box at a place I KNEW he<br>
would enjoy - the Waco Mammoth Site. I woke him up at 6 am and he<br>
happily got up and got dressed and we hit the road right on time. Got<br>
to Waco a little more than two hours later, where we hit Hobby Lobby<br>
to get me some new markers and him a logbook of his own (my own kids<br>
didn't have logbooks until they could manage them themselves - what<br>
was I thinking getting Jonah a logbook???). Got water and hit the<br>
cemeteries (figured getting a bunch of boxes all at once would be a<br>
good way to get him in a groove and he's enjoyed<br>
cemetery boxing before). Found the first box fairly quickly and<br>
unbuttoned it to begin stamping. "Grammy. I'm tired." Nice. Great.<br>
He's tired. I invited him to sit next to me while we stamped in.<br>
"Grammy. When are we gonna be done?" Sigh. And then my foolishness hit<br>
me - I not only have to stamp my own logbook, but his too. And he's<br>
tired of letterboxing, right when our count was ALMOST "1". So he<br>
starts skipping around headstones. "Grammy. What does this one say?"<br>
So I look up and read it for him. "Grammy. What does THIS one say?"<br>
Again, I look up and read it for him. You get the idea. This went on<br>
well beyond my normal level of patience, until finally I snapped. "You<br>
SAID you are tired. Said you don't want to letterbox anymore. And yet<br>
you won't let me finish this so we can move on. Read it yourself!".<br>
"Grammy. You know I can't read!". Sigh. Finally finished stamping in<br>
and buttoned the box up. I stood up to move on<br>
to the next clue (because I am a confident Grammy who was quite<br>
certain I could engage him again and keep him going, and because our<br>
parenting style doesn't allow us to cave in to the first hint of<br>
manipulation by the kid). I looked down - and saw that some of the<br>
box's logbook pages had come out of the comb binding and were laying<br>
there on the stone (and this after I noticed that there were no more<br>
pages in the book and so had dug through my pack to find pages to<br>
leave behind). I sat down and opened up the box while enduring an<br>
attack of questions about why I was starting over. Finally got it<br>
sorted out and got the next set of clues and started working them out.<br>
Well - they had a lot of directions that required interpretation,<br>
which means - in my case - brainwork. Meanwhile, Trail Whale had<br>
spread his hopping circle a little larger and wanted me to read even<br>
more tombstones, some of them from a distance that a rabbit couldn't<br>
read, much less me. I reined him in a bit, which meant he was restless<br>
at having to stay so close, so his questions intensified. The<br>
brainwork was NOT working out. And I started getting mad at the placer<br>
for making it so darned difficult. Finally, I took a breath, continued<br>
to drip<br>
sweat, and thought things out. First, these would have been the sort<br>
of clue I enjoyed if I weren't so stinking distracted, so was it the<br>
placers fault? Only if I blamed them for not putting a warning in the<br>
clues against bringing active, talkative 3 year olds to the box.<br>
Second, my stubborn nature kicked in and I steeled myself for MAKING<br>
Trail Whale letterbox with me all day long, whether he liked it or<br>
not.  And finally, I realized that would not be fun for him, but it<br>
would also not be fun for me and why were we in Waco? To have FUN!<br>
<br>
I zipped up my bag, buckled him into the van, and drove out of the<br>
cemetery thinking the whole time that I could hardly be a<br>
self-respecting letterboxer if I came to a town with some twenty boxes<br>
available and found only one. Oh well. I went and fed him barbecue and<br>
ice cream, took him to the Waco Mammoth Site which we both enjoyed<br>
thoroughly (although we forgot to get the box) and we came home to<br>
Jacksonville with our one little find of the day. It WAS a fun day<br>
after all was said and done, just wasn't the letterboxing day I had<br>
envisioned or planned in detail. The kicker? He was looking through<br>
his logbook yesterday and said "Grammy. Why didn't we get more<br>
stamps?" Eesh...I wanted to yell at him that it was all his fault,<br>
blah blah blah. Instead I said "Well Trail Whale, I got kind of tired<br>
of letterboxing. Didn't you?" He said? "No. I wanted to find more<br>
letterboxes." So yeah, sometimes life and letterboxing don't mix very<br>
well...<br>

"Grammy. You know I can't read!". Sigh. Finally finished stamping in<br/>
and buttoned the box up. I stood up to move on<br/>
to the next clue (because I am a confident Grammy who was quite<br/>
certain I could engage him again and keep him going, and because our<br/>
parenting style doesn't allow us to cave in to the first hint of<br/>
manipulation by the kid). I looked down - and saw that some of the<br/>
box's logbook pages had come out of the comb binding and were laying<br/>
there on the stone (and this after I noticed that there were no more<br/>
pages in the book and so had dug through my pack to find pages to<br/>
leave behind). I sat down and opened up the box while enduring an<br/>
attack of questions about why I was starting over. Finally got it<br/>
sorted out and got the next set of clues and started working them out.<br/>
Well - they had a lot of directions that required interpretation,<br/>
which means - in my case - brainwork. Meanwhile, Trail Whale had<br/>
spread his hopping circle a little larger and wanted me to read even<br/>
more tombstones, some of them from a distance that a rabbit couldn't<br/>
read, much less me. I reined him in a bit, which meant he was restless<br/>
at having to stay so close, so his questions intensified. The<br/>
brainwork was NOT working out. And I started getting mad at the placer<br/>
for making it so darned difficult. Finally, I took a breath, continued<br/>
to drip<br/>
sweat, and thought things out. First, these would have been the sort<br/>
of clue I enjoyed if I weren't so stinking distracted, so was it the<br/>
placers fault? Only if I blamed them for not putting a warning in the<br/>
clues against bringing active, talkative 3 year olds to the box.<br/>
Second, my stubborn nature kicked in and I steeled myself for MAKING<br/>
Trail Whale letterbox with me all day long, whether he liked it or<br/>
not. And finally, I realized that would not be fun for him, but it<br/>
would also not be fun for me and why were we in Waco? To have FUN!<br/>
<br/>
I zipped up my bag, buckled him into the van, and drove out of the<br/>
cemetery thinking the whole time that I could hardly be a<br/>
self-respecting letterboxer if I came to a town with some twenty boxes<br/>
available and found only one. Oh well. I went and fed him barbecue and<br/>
ice cream, took him to the Waco Mammoth Site which we both enjoyed<br/>
thoroughly (although we forgot to get the box) and we came home to<br/>
Jacksonville with our one little find of the day. It WAS a fun day<br/>
after all was said and done, just wasn't the letterboxing day I had<br/>
envisioned or planned in detail. The kicker? He was looking through<br/>
his logbook yesterday and said "Grammy. Why didn't we get more<br/>
stamps?" Eesh...I wanted to yell at him that it was all his fault,<br/>
blah blah blah. Instead I said "Well Trail Whale, I got kind of tired<br/>
of letterboxing. Didn't you?" He said? "No. I wanted to find more<br/>
letterboxes." So yeah, sometimes life and letterboxing don't mix very<br/>
well...<br/>

yes and amen! My gramma juices are starting to flow majorly as our daughter and fam arrive from India in 19 days ( who's counting?). Haven't see then since last august; Bird Dog not for two years! We are super excited. They'll be here for 5 wks, and we plan several l'boxing forays.<br>
