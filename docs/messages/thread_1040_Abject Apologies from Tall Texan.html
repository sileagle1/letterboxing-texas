I don't think you so much stepped on toes as got us<br/>
going on a topic that comes up from time to time. <br/>
Hopefully I speak for everyone else, but I at least<br/>
speak for myself, that although I disagreed with your<br/>
comments regarding the merit of high traffic area<br/>
boxes, you certainly are entitled to vent a little<br/>
when you are frustrated by a box.  Just remember as<br/>
you vent that 99% of the placers are very attached to<br/>
their creations and take comments personally.<br/>
<br/>
Your attitude of "What could I have done to better<br/>
conceal..." is one I think we all struggle with.  I<br/>
recently got a similar message from Catpawz, who had<br/>
tried to find my one and only "pay to get to" box -<br/>
one in a zoo, only to find it wasn't there.  I felt<br/>
terrible!  BUT...it really is just a part of<br/>
letterboxing.  However, if placers place with the<br/>
attitude of "tough luck if you can't find it", it<br/>
makes the game not so great.  So I guess placers have<br/>
to be conscientious and finders have to be<br/>
philosophical.<br/>
<br/>
Please go back and read several of those messages in<br/>
which folks expressed their appreciation for your<br/>
contributions to the hobby so far - you are clearly a<br/>
part of the community already.  <br/>

<div>It's always all right to express your opinions, but remember that just because a box doesn't give :::you:::: the kind of experience ::::you:::: want, doesn't make it one that isn't just as good as any other. Your post was pretty much just an attack on high traffic boxes as far as I can see and not a general request that people be more careful when hiding. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm not sure where business terms like "customer-focus" and "free market" belong in a creative, unique, and often artistic hobby, but that seems to be the way your mind works  for whatever reason. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Several people, including myself took the time to respond with thoughtful posts, and I for one would have appreciated some indication that you spent  time reading and digesting each one of them rather than the "mass mailing" response you gave. I still think you really don't get it. But that's just me. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wrote three other responses and deleted them in fear that they were too harsh. I wasn't going to say anything at all, but then I got a little angry at myself for being afraid to express *my* opinions to you, when you obviously had no compulsions about expressing some pretty harsh ones of your own. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'd rather have someone like you involved in boxing, who at least gives the hobby some thought instead of someone who doesn't care, but I will always disagree with your opinions of high traffic boxes. </div>
