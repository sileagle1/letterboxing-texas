I'll be primarily a lurker as I live in Oregon. I used to live in <br>
Houston and will get back on occasion. I also managed to find and <br>

Hey Kimberley and Keith!<br>
<br>
Welcome, welcome, welcome, to Letterboxing!  We are the Samurai <br>
Stampers in Arlington and have been LB'ers since August.  We are <br>
myself, Kantexan, and my three kids:  The Pikachu Ponderer, The <br>
Cupcake Kid, and The Powerpuff Girl.<br>
<br>
We are so excited to have more letterboxers in the Metroplex.  This <br>
hobby is really starting to take off in Texas so I know you'll have <br>
a lot of fun.<br>
<br>
Again, Welcome to a really nice talk list and bunch of people.<br>

Ahhh, so it was your boxes we found!  <br>
<br>
The Lake chase 2, my nephew almost fell in the lake.  It was classic.<br>
 His mom's definitely a "neat freak" and she wasn't with us, and I was<br>
very thankful ;)  He peed on a tree near the 3rd one out of pure<br>
necessity ;)<br>
<br>
So what's up with the names?  Is it a requirement?<br>
<br>
There was at least one other group doing the lake chase today, because<br>
we were following them... the ink was always still wet on the stamps ;)<br>

Well, <br>

the long way from Maryland, we visit Tejas for family on a reqular <br>
basis. We just stashed 3 new ones in the Flower Mound area. Two are <br>
posted on LBNA website, the 3rd to come soon. We'll keep ya'll <br>
posted. <br>
Peace and Happy Trails,<br>

We are a family of 7 who has been lb'ing for about a year.  We live north <br>

> Hi!<br>
><br>
> We are a family of 7 who has been lb'ing for about a year.  We live north<br>
> of Houston so most of the boxes we have found are in this general area.<br>
As<br>
> our kids get older, we are hoping to expand that area.<br>
><br>
> We found our first hitchhiker last month and that was a great<br>
> surprise.  The owner was the one who told me about this list.  Hope to<br>
> learn lots from all of you.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi y'all,<br>
<br>
I'm Christi and I'm new to the group and to the letterboxing concept.  I <br>
am from a little town about 40 miles north of San Antonio called Boerne <br>
in the start of the Texas Hill country.  As far as I know, I'm the only <br>
one in the immediate vicinity, so if there are others I'll be thrilled <br>
to hear about them!  I say I'm new to the concept because I haven't <br>
actually done any letterboxing yet, and was introduced to the concept in <br>
a new group I joined recently to take a class in stamp carving.  Anyway, <br>
I am planning to place a few boxes in the very near future in my <br>
vicinity and we'll see if I get any visitors :)  I'm also going to try <br>
and do some finding of the ones that are close but not "here".  So, all <br>
that to explain where I am in the "letterboxing arena" :)  Now more <br>
about me:<br>
<br>
I've been married to my wonderful dh Michael for almost 11 years now.  <br>
I'm a home-based business owner (web design) and paper artist.  I'm into <br>
all kinds of arts really, but call myself a paper artist because that's <br>
my main focus.  I do scrapbooking, rubber stamping, book binding, paper <br>
making, collage art, altered art items... You name it, I'm into it :)  I <br>
also do some more traditional things like woodworking, sewing, <br>
needlework, etc.  Dh works for the local "big" insurance company as an <br>
IT analyst, but he also like to join me in some of my art project.  He's <br>
a big outdoors person (Eagle scout, orienteer, etc. ) and I'm not :) so <br>
I thought maybe the letterboxing would be a good joint venture.  Let's <br>
see, we have 4 cats and live in an old house (a 1900's style Victorian) <br>
near the town square.  My favorite colors are purple and pink... I'm a <br>
genealogist and love history.  Um, can't think of much else right now, <br>
but am glad to join y'all on the list...<br>

<div>Hi, Christi, and Welcome to the group! I think you'll find that we are a friendly, supportive bunch. New boxes generally see a lot of action, so don't worry about no one looking for your boxes once you've planted them- often it's a race to see who will be First Finder (FF)! Be sure and check out the Yahoo Group page for info on our upcoming event in March.</div>

<div>Welcome to the group, Christi. I think most of us like to head to the Hill Country in the spring so I'm sure your boxes will get plenty of visitors from all over the state. My degree is in art and am a retired graphic designer - I mostly like to work with textiles now. I owned an antique booth in Connecticut for four years, and just returned home to Texas last summer - very, very happy to be home. New England is absolutely gorgeous and I loved hiking there, but like Dorothy said, "there's no place like home".</div>

<br>
I think we have some of the most interesting people on this list. <br>
Your artistic background sounds very interesting, and I can't wait to<br>
see what you might come up with.<br>
<br>
There are some other sites you might be interested in that would help<br>
you learn about letterboxing.  Silver Eagle has a file of links in the<br>
section on the right, but here are some of my favorite:<br>
<br>
www.atlasquest.com<br>
www.letterboxing.info<br>
<br>
and then of course the new boxers yahoo group, where newbies and<br>
oldies from across the country meet to answer questions (any question)<br>
about questions letterboxing-related.  Questions are definitely<br>
encouraged!<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers/<br>
<br>
And, because you're a paper artist, you might want to learn more about<br>
postal letterboxing, as I bet it would appeal to you.  It's not really<br>
letterboxing in the same sense as following clues and finding a box in<br>
the wild, but it's a postal stamp art exchange, where people carve<br>
stamps and share them with others, either singularly or as part of an<br>
organized exchange ring.  There are a number of others who do postal<br>
letterboxing who are into bookbinding and altered books as well. <br>
Here's the link:<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/postal_letterboxing/<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is a friendly group and we're here if you have any<br>
questions.  Welcome!<br>

<p class="MsoPlainText"><font face="Courier New" size="2"><span style="font-size:

<div>Kyla! Welcome! How fortunate you are to have found letterboxing in Texas at this time. There are now so many boxes in Texas that you can spend just about every free moment out hunting for them. Just a few years ago, you could have found most of the boxes in a weekend, but because of the excellent groundwork laid by some of our original Texas boxers, the letterboxing experience in Texas has grown steadily. I hope you enjoy the experience.</div>

                    <html><body><div>Hi Channing,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You will find lots of great advice on this list, but I would like to take a moment to put things in perspective for you!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You mentioned vandalism and that it doesn't discourage you - and for that I'm glad!  I'm not sure what exactly is "local" to you, and whether there is actually a lot of vandalism going on in your area; however, in the grand scheme of things what probably seems like a lot of vandalism when you read it on the boards is a very small percentage of the whole game. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What comes across as vandalism is often just plain bad luck, or sometimes bad planning, or sometimes lack of understanding, and sometimes it's nothing more than animals!  I guess I think of vandalism as someone willfully destroying a box and that actually happens very rarely.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sometimes a finder has not rehidden a box very well and it is discovered by non-boxers (muggles) and thrown away or removed.  Other times the finder might not reseal the box well enough and it gets wet inside.  And sometimes groups box together and the person who removed the box from its hiding place isn't the one to put it back, and the one who puts it back places it in the wrong place and the box was gone.  Sometimes the placer picks a place to hide a box without taking into account the "what might happen here", like the 100 year deluge that a lot of us lost boxes to this year!  Sometimes muggles stumble across boxes and don't know what they have, and they take the box away, or a ranger finds it and confiscates it because it wasn't supposed to be where it was (either in truth or based on his/her perception).  Sometimes someone handles a box while they have food on their hands and when they return it to its hiding spot, animals sniff out the food smell, steal the box and gnaw it and claw it into oblivion.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On very rare occasions a not-so-nice muggle finds a box and they strew it about or destroy it, and maybe leave ugly messages in the logbook or write the placer a nasty email.  This happens much less often than any of the other scenarios - and thankfully so! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, yes vandalism does happen and it concerns each and every one of us because we know that it could as easily be our own box as the boxer it happened to.  But the vast majority of the time when a box is lost or destroyed, it could have and should have been prevented with a little care and thought on the part of letterboxers.  Sad that it happens that way, but thankfully it is something within our control....

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">This message is 
the second part of the continuing story of our search and recovery efforts for 
the Letterboxes known as Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks #2. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To recap the 
previous operation, my wife (Dane Lady) and I applied for and were granted 
permission, and enlisted the help of a park guide to search for both Hueco Tanks 
#1 and Hueco Tanks #2 Letterboxes. We successfully recovered Hueco Tanks #1 at N 
31 55.195 W 106 02.910. The letterbox was removed to be given to the park 
superintendent. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">With the clues 
for Hueco Tanks #2 in hand, the guide and I did a whirlwind recon of most of 
Hueco Tanks North Mountain. Dane Lady did her best not to slow us down too much. 
We identified and did a fast scan of several promising areas. We did not recover 
Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to 
concentrate on. This operation all but did my wife in. She is a real trooper, 
but not up to that kind of strenuous recon activity. I on the other hand loved 
it! </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">After discussion 
through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the clues and I was granted 
permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco Tanks #2 on my own, within the 
park rules of course. At that time I was also offered the opportunity to repair 
Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be Determined later) in the park. This 
is great news. It may be difficult to find a good hiding place that will be 
approved. But one thing is certain. It will not happen without trying. My 
ranger-friend Danny Lee says it should work out. I am hopeful and will continue 
to press forward on this as time permits. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The original 
Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape. The original logbook is ruined. The 
plastic container is crumbling. I intend to make a new stamp in the image of 
what I believe the original stamp was intended to be. I also intend to re-mount 
the original stamp and leave it in the Letterbox. And I have a good supply of 
ammo cans. One small one will be painted to match the approved location. Ammo 
cans last forever. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone knows I 
am also a Geocacher. All my letterbox hides to date are Letterbox Hybrid 
Geocaches. I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a Letterbox exclusively. I am 
not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers searching for the box. A few 
respectful Letterboxers will be enough. The park must be protected first and 
fore-most. I may request to place a Geocache out there in the future. But that 
is beyond the scope of this report. </font></div>

<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On Saturday, 24 
June 2006, a second attempt was mounted to locate the Letterbox known as Hueco 
Tanks #2. This attempt was made with the help of my son James (Army Scout) who 
was home on leave from the Army. We hit the gate as early as was possible. After 
his orientation briefing, we were on the trail. My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked 
us to keep a watch for sign of some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park. 
We promised to do so. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To get to the 
locations I GPS-waypointed on the last mission required us to hike over North 
Mountain. Although the primary point of interest was lower on the south end of 
the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is closed, open only to 
guided hiking. We were unguided on this mission, so our approach was limited. 
The western approach is nearly a shear cliff. Not impossible, but certainly more 
dangerous. Crossing the mountain was the safest allowed approach. And so we did. 
I thoroughly enjoyed that hike. We were out early and only had to share the 
mountain with a pair of foxes, some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of 
lizards. The sky was lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool. Cool for 
summer in El Paso anyway. The mission was ahead of us. We were optimistic. We 
had proper gear and equipment. We were on the hunt. Two warriors headed out to 
do what they do best. Life doesn't get better than this! I was loving it. 
W.E.T.S.U. &lt;grin&gt; </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">While we were 
hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with sheep droppings. I 
GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few. The first location was at N 31 
55.340 W 106 02.783. But soon it was obvious that the droppings were not 
difficult to find. So I stopped marking and photographing. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">James and I 
arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco Tanks #2 within an hour 
of hiking. It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a large oak tree on the 
south west end of the mountain. It is located at N <br/>31 55.242 W 106 02.860. 
We set out a safety rope, and James went down. I lowered our gear to James, then 
followed. James - being a Cavalry scout, always seems to take point. As I was 
climbing down he remarked that this secluded hole was full of sheep droppings. I 
got to the bottom and we began our search. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">For about 1.5 
hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice. We found two very 
promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks covering the holes 
in the east wall north of the tree. One hole was empty. The second had broken 
glass in it. Neither had anything resembling a letterbox inside. In the process 
of searching for the letterbox we filled two shopping bags with trash. After 
exhausting every possibility, I climbed out, pulled our gear up, and threw the 
rope down for James to get out. I enjoyed every minute in that spot. But I was 
disappointed we came out without the letterbox. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The search of 
the other areas went about like the first. None was as promising as the first. 
Some places required us to climb in and out carefully. In order to search many 
of the likely places we needed to carefully look behind the plant life. Thorns 
and scratches were the rule of the day. At one point we had to remove our gear 
and crawl through a series of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet 
dragging behind to get to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out 
empty. After nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility. 
I was not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and 
shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip we 
realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to collect 
up the bags. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On the way back, 
I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you visit Hueco Tanks State 
Park - be sure to see these paintings. They are located on North Mountain at N 
31 55.422 W 106 02.796. The coordinates will put you at the base of a rock 
face to your south. Crawl in the crevice at your feet and move west to the large 
room. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you will see some of the finest 
Indian paintings in the park. Don't forget your camera. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The return trip 
was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is not a word we accept 
easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with my son. He has grown into a 
man. The kind of man I was used to working with when I was a hard-charging 
Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you want to have by your side when 
everything else around you is going wrong. Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He 
can use his hands as weapons, and his weapons as though they were his hands. His 
hands can heal or kill with equal skill. Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line

Action Report - Hueco Tanks Letterbox #2. <br/></font></span></div></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">This message is 
the second part of the continuing story of our search and recovery efforts for 
the Letterboxes known as Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks #2. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To recap the 
previous operation, my wife (Dane Lady) and I applied for and were granted 
permission, and enlisted the help of a park guide to search for both Hueco Tanks 
#1 and Hueco Tanks #2 Letterboxes. We successfully recovered Hueco Tanks #1 at N 
31 55.195 W 106 02.910. The letterbox was removed to be given to the park 
superintendent. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">With the clues 
for Hueco Tanks #2 in hand, the guide and I did a whirlwind recon of most of 
Hueco Tanks North Mountain. Dane Lady did her best not to slow us down too much. 
We identified and did a fast scan of several promising areas. We did not recover 
Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to 
concentrate on. This operation all but did my wife in. She is a real trooper, 
but not up to that kind of strenuous recon activity. I on the other hand loved 
it! </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">After discussion 
through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the clues and I was granted 
permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco Tanks #2 on my own, within the 
park rules of course. At that time I was also offered the opportunity to repair 
Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be Determined later) in the park. This 
is great news. It may be difficult to find a good hiding place that will be 
approved. But one thing is certain. It will not happen without trying. My 
ranger-friend Danny Lee says it should work out. I am hopeful and will continue 
to press forward on this as time permits. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The original 
Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape. The original logbook is ruined. The 
plastic container is crumbling. I intend to make a new stamp in the image of 
what I believe the original stamp was intended to be. I also intend to re-mount 
the original stamp and leave it in the Letterbox. And I have a good supply of 
ammo cans. One small one will be painted to match the approved location. Ammo 
cans last forever. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone knows I 
am also a Geocacher. All my letterbox hides to date are Letterbox Hybrid 
Geocaches. I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a Letterbox exclusively. I am 
not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers searching for the box. A few 
respectful Letterboxers will be enough. The park must be protected first and 
fore-most. I may request to place a Geocache out there in the future. But that 
is beyond the scope of this report. </font></div>

<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On Saturday, 24 
June 2006, a second attempt was mounted to locate the Letterbox known as Hueco 
Tanks #2. This attempt was made with the help of my son James (Army Scout) who 
was home on leave from the Army. We hit the gate as early as was possible. After 
his orientation briefing, we were on the trail. My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked 
us to keep a watch for sign of some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park. 
We promised to do so. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To get to the 
locations I GPS-waypointed on the last mission required us to hike over North 
Mountain. Although the primary point of interest was lower on the south end of 
the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is closed, open only to 
guided hiking. We were unguided on this mission, so our approach was limited. 
The western approach is nearly a shear cliff. Not impossible, but certainly more 
dangerous. Crossing the mountain was the safest allowed approach. And so we did. 
I thoroughly enjoyed that hike. We were out early and only had to share the 
mountain with a pair of foxes, some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of 
lizards. The sky was lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool. Cool for 
summer in El Paso anyway. The mission was ahead of us. We were optimistic. We 
had proper gear and equipment. We were on the hunt. Two warriors headed out to 
do what they do best. Life doesn't get better than this! I was loving it. 
W.E.T.S.U. &lt;grin&gt; </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">While we were 
hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with sheep droppings. I 
GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few. The first location was at N 31 
55.340 W 106 02.783. But soon it was obvious that the droppings were not 
difficult to find. So I stopped marking and photographing. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">James and I 
arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco Tanks #2 within an hour 
of hiking. It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a large oak tree on the 
south west end of the mountain. It is located at N <br/>31 55.242 W 106 02.860. 
We set out a safety rope, and James went down. I lowered our gear to James, then 
followed. James - being a Cavalry scout, always seems to take point. As I was 
climbing down he remarked that this secluded hole was full of sheep droppings. I 
got to the bottom and we began our search. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">For about 1.5 
hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice. We found two very 
promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks covering the holes 
in the east wall north of the tree. One hole was empty. The second had broken 
glass in it. Neither had anything resembling a letterbox inside. In the process 
of searching for the letterbox we filled two shopping bags with trash. After 
exhausting every possibility, I climbed out, pulled our gear up, and threw the 
rope down for James to get out. I enjoyed every minute in that spot. But I was 
disappointed we came out without the letterbox. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The search of 
the other areas went about like the first. None was as promising as the first. 
Some places required us to climb in and out carefully. In order to search many 
of the likely places we needed to carefully look behind the plant life. Thorns 
and scratches were the rule of the day. At one point we had to remove our gear 
and crawl through a series of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet 
dragging behind to get to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out 
empty. After nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility. 
I was not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and 
shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip we 
realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to collect 
up the bags. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On the way back, 
I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you visit Hueco Tanks State 
Park - be sure to see these paintings. They are located on North Mountain at N 
31 55.422 W 106 02.796. The coordinates will put you at the base of a rock 
face to your south. Crawl in the crevice at your feet and move west to the large 
room. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you will see some of the finest 
Indian paintings in the park. Don't forget your camera. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The return trip 
was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is not a word we accept 
easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with my son. He has grown into a 
man. The kind of man I was used to working with when I was a hard-charging 
Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you want to have by your side when 
everything else around you is going wrong. Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He 
can use his hands as weapons, and his weapons as though they were his hands. His 
hands can heal or kill with equal skill. Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line 
with a warrior like this? </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">By the time you 
read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone. But some of you will have the 
opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood. He will be doing some letterboxing, 
scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in late September. I hope 
you-all will welcome him to your part of the state. </font></div>

Action Report - Hueco Tanks Letterbox #2. <br/></font></span></div></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">This message is 
the second part of the continuing story of our search and recovery efforts for 
the Letterboxes known as Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks #2. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To recap the 
previous operation, my wife (Dane Lady) and I applied for and were granted 
permission, and enlisted the help of a park guide to search for both Hueco Tanks 
#1 and Hueco Tanks #2 Letterboxes. We successfully recovered Hueco Tanks #1 at N 
31 55.195 W 106 02.910. The letterbox was removed to be given to the park 
superintendent. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">With the clues 
for Hueco Tanks #2 in hand, the guide and I did a whirlwind recon of most of 
Hueco Tanks North Mountain. Dane Lady did her best not to slow us down too much. 
We identified and did a fast scan of several promising areas. We did not recover 
Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to 
concentrate on. This operation all but did my wife in. She is a real trooper, 
but not up to that kind of strenuous recon activity. I on the other hand loved 
it! </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">After discussion 
through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the clues and I was granted 
permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco Tanks #2 on my own, within the 
park rules of course. At that time I was also offered the opportunity to repair 
Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be Determined later) in the park. This 
is great news. It may be difficult to find a good hiding place that will be 
approved. But one thing is certain. It will not happen without trying. My 
ranger-friend Danny Lee says it should work out. I am hopeful and will continue 
to press forward on this as time permits. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The original 
Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape. The original logbook is ruined. The 
plastic container is crumbling. I intend to make a new stamp in the image of 
what I believe the original stamp was intended to be. I also intend to re-mount 
the original stamp and leave it in the Letterbox. And I have a good supply of 
ammo cans. One small one will be painted to match the approved location. Ammo 
cans last forever. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone knows I 
am also a Geocacher. All my letterbox hides to date are Letterbox Hybrid 
Geocaches. I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a Letterbox exclusively. I am 
not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers searching for the box. A few 
respectful Letterboxers will be enough. The park must be protected first and 
fore-most. I may request to place a Geocache out there in the future. But that 
is beyond the scope of this report. </font></div>

<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On Saturday, 24 
June 2006, a second attempt was mounted to locate the Letterbox known as Hueco 
Tanks #2. This attempt was made with the help of my son James (Army Scout) who 
was home on leave from the Army. We hit the gate as early as was possible. After 
his orientation briefing, we were on the trail. My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked 
us to keep a watch for sign of some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park. 
We promised to do so. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To get to the 
locations I GPS-waypointed on the last mission required us to hike over North 
Mountain. Although the primary point of interest was lower on the south end of 
the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is closed, open only to 
guided hiking. We were unguided on this mission, so our approach was limited. 
The western approach is nearly a shear cliff. Not impossible, but certainly more 
dangerous. Crossing the mountain was the safest allowed approach. And so we did. 
I thoroughly enjoyed that hike. We were out early and only had to share the 
mountain with a pair of foxes, some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of 
lizards. The sky was lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool. Cool for 
summer in El Paso anyway. The mission was ahead of us. We were optimistic. We 
had proper gear and equipment. We were on the hunt. Two warriors headed out to 
do what they do best. Life doesn't get better than this! I was loving it. 
W.E.T.S.U. &lt;grin&gt; </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">While we were 
hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with sheep droppings. I 
GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few. The first location was at N 31 
55.340 W 106 02.783. But soon it was obvious that the droppings were not 
difficult to find. So I stopped marking and photographing. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">James and I 
arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco Tanks #2 within an hour 
of hiking. It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a large oak tree on the 
south west end of the mountain. It is located at N <br/>31 55.242 W 106 02.860. 
We set out a safety rope, and James went down. I lowered our gear to James, then 
followed. James - being a Cavalry scout, always seems to take point. As I was 
climbing down he remarked that this secluded hole was full of sheep droppings. I 
got to the bottom and we began our search. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">For about 1.5 
hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice. We found two very 
promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks covering the holes 
in the east wall north of the tree. One hole was empty. The second had broken 
glass in it. Neither had anything resembling a letterbox inside. In the process 
of searching for the letterbox we filled two shopping bags with trash. After 
exhausting every possibility, I climbed out, pulled our gear up, and threw the 
rope down for James to get out. I enjoyed every minute in that spot. But I was 
disappointed we came out without the letterbox. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The search of 
the other areas went about like the first. None was as promising as the first. 
Some places required us to climb in and out carefully. In order to search many 
of the likely places we needed to carefully look behind the plant life. Thorns 
and scratches were the rule of the day. At one point we had to remove our gear 
and crawl through a series of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet 
dragging behind to get to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out 
empty. After nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility. 
I was not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and 
shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip we 
realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to collect 
up the bags. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On the way back, 
I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you visit Hueco Tanks State 
Park - be sure to see these paintings. They are located on North Mountain at N 
31 55.422 W 106 02.796. The coordinates will put you at the base of a rock 
face to your south. Crawl in the crevice at your feet and move west to the large 
room. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you will see some of the finest 
Indian paintings in the park. Don't forget your camera. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The return trip 
was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is not a word we accept 
easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with my son. He has grown into a 
man. The kind of man I was used to working with when I was a hard-charging 
Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you want to have by your side when 
everything else around you is going wrong. Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He 
can use his hands as weapons, and his weapons as though they were his hands. His 
hands can heal or kill with equal skill. Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line 
with a warrior like this? </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">By the time you 
read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone. But some of you will have the 
opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood. He will be doing some letterboxing, 
scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in late September. I hope 
you-all will welcome him to your part of the state. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">This concludes 
the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox. I will continue to work with the park 
staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a location worthy of 
letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff. This will not happen 
quickly. Perhaps by Christmas. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">I would like to 
once again point out that not a word of this report would have been possible 
without the cooperation of the staff at Hueco Tanks state Park. Thank you 
Rangers! And it is a shining example of why I believe having an open dialog with 
the park staff about your letterbox is better than placing a letterbox secretly 
and hoping the rangers do not find it. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">I also thank 
Dane Lady and Army scout for participating is parts of this adventure. Having 
them along made it all the more enjoyable. </font></div>
<div> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Last - I will 
send a final report when Hueco Tanks #1 is repaired and replaced. This has been 
a great adventure for me. I would also like to thank Silver Eagle for asking me 
to take on this mission. I wish the 50-% successful report I bring to the list 
was a 100% successful report. I can only say we did our best. </font></div>

I  came into l'boxing about the time you were publishing the photo journal. So, I saw the pics, but didn't even knew what a Hueco Tank was. I think it was a few months before I became comfortable to know why anyone would hike to see a tank. A tank to me then was a water tank or an army tank. Tanks that were manmade. After a year, I am still learning about your tanks. Now I really want to go there. But, I think I will need a bit more training before I can tackle that adventure. I would absolutely love to see the paintings. That kind of stuff would make that trip astounding. <br/><br/>What a great story.

We did not recover  Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to  concentrate on. This operation all but did my wife in. She is a
 real trooper,  but not up to that kind of strenuous recon activity. I on the other hand loved  it! </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">After discussion  through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the clues and I was granted  permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco Tanks #2 on my own, within the  park rules of course. At that time I was also offered the opportunity to repair  Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be Determined later) in the park. This  is great news. It may be difficult to find a good hiding place that will be  approved. But one thing is certain. It will not happen without trying. My  ranger-friend Danny Lee says it should work out. I am hopeful and will continue  to press forward on this as time permits. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The original  Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape. The
 original logbook is ruined. The  plastic container is crumbling. I intend to make a new stamp in the image of  what I believe the original stamp was intended to be. I also intend to re-mount  the original stamp and leave it in the Letterbox. And I have a good supply of  ammo cans. One small one will be painted to match the approved location. Ammo  cans last forever. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Everyone knows I  am also a Geocacher. All my letterbox hides to date are Letterbox Hybrid  Geocaches. I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a Letterbox exclusively. I am  not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers searching for the box. A few  respectful Letterboxers will be enough. The park must be protected first and  fore-most. I may request to place a Geocache out there in the future. But that  is beyond the scope of this report. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The search for  Hueco Tanks #2. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">************<wbr>*********<wbr>**** Hueco Tanks #2 This box is Unclaimed.

This attempt was made with the help of my son James (Army Scout) who  was home on leave from the Army. We hit the gate as early as was possible. After  his orientation briefing, we were on the trail. My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked  us to keep a watch for sign of some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park.  We promised to do so. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">To get to the  locations I
 GPS-waypointed on the last mission required us to hike over North  Mountain. Although the primary point of interest was lower on the south end of  the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is closed, open only to  guided hiking. We were unguided on this mission, so our approach was limited.  The western approach is nearly a shear cliff. Not impossible, but certainly more  dangerous. Crossing the mountain was the safest allowed approach. And so we did.  I thoroughly enjoyed that hike. We were out early and only had to share the  mountain with a pair of foxes, some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of  lizards. The sky was lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool. Cool for  summer in El Paso anyway. The mission was ahead of us. We were optimistic. We  had proper gear and equipment. We were on the hunt. Two warriors headed out to  do what they do best. Life doesn't get better than this! I was loving it.  W.E.T.S.U. &lt;grin&gt; </font></div>
<div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">While we were  hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with sheep droppings. I  GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few. The first location was at N 31  55.340 W 106 02.783. But soon it was obvious that the droppings were not  difficult to find. So I stopped marking and photographing. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">James and I  arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco Tanks #2 within an hour  of hiking. It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a large oak tree on the  south west end of the mountain. It is located at N <br/>31 55.242 W 106 02.860.  We set out a safety rope, and James went down. I lowered our gear to James, then  followed. James - being a Cavalry scout, always seems to take point. As I was  climbing down he remarked that this secluded hole was full of
 sheep droppings. I  got to the bottom and we began our search. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">For about 1.5  hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice. We found two very  promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks covering the holes  in the east wall north of the tree. One hole was empty. The second had broken  glass in it. Neither had anything resembling a letterbox inside. In the process  of searching for the letterbox we filled two shopping bags with trash. After  exhausting every possibility, I climbed out, pulled our gear up, and threw the  rope down for James to get out. I enjoyed every minute in that spot. But I was  disappointed we came out without the letterbox. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The search of  the other areas went about like the first. None was as promising as the first. 
 Some places required us to climb in and out carefully. In order to search many  of the likely places we needed to carefully look behind the plant life. Thorns  and scratches were the rule of the day. At one point we had to remove our gear  and crawl through a series of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet  dragging behind to get to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out  empty. After nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility.  I was not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and  shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip we  realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to collect  up the bags. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">On the way back,  I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you visit Hueco Tanks State  Park - be sure to see these paintings. They
 are located on North Mountain at N  31 55.422 W 106 02.796. The coordinates will put you at the base of a rock  face to your south. Crawl in the crevice at your feet and move west to the large  room. As your eyes adjust to the dim light, you will see some of the finest  Indian paintings in the park. Don't forget your camera. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The return trip  was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is not a word we accept  easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with my son. He has grown into a  man. The kind of man I was used to working with when I was a hard-charging  Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you want to have by your side when  everything else around you is going wrong. Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He  can use his hands as weapons, and his weapons as though they were his hands. His  hands can heal or kill with equal skill. Who wouldn't be
 proud to stand on line  with a warrior like this? </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">By the time you  read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone. But some of you will have the  opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood. He will be doing some letterboxing,  scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in late September. I hope  you-all will welcome him to your part of the state. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">This concludes  the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox. I will continue to work with the park  staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a location worthy of  letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff. This will not happen  quickly. Perhaps by Christmas. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">I would like to  once again point out that not
 a word of this report would have been possible  without the cooperation of the staff at Hueco Tanks state Park. Thank you  Rangers! And it is a shining example of why I believe having an open dialog with  the park staff about your letterbox is better than placing a letterbox secretly  and hoping the rangers do not find it. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">I also thank  Dane Lady and Army scout for participating is parts of this adventure. Having  them along made it all the more enjoyable. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Last - I will  send a final report when Hueco Tanks #1 is repaired and replaced. This has been  a great adventure for me. I would also like to thank Silver Eagle for asking me  to take on this mission. I wish the 50-% successful report I bring to the list  was a 100% successful report. I can only say we did our
 best. </font></div> <div> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">You can see a  slideshow of our adventure.

<p>You know, I have heard bits and pieces of that story, but never really knew 
  the whole story. I am so glad you shared that with us again. <span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></span></p>
<p><span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Well - now

<p><span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Speaking of 
  adventures - we had quite a surprise this evening.  I was on the upper 
  floor of the garage cleaning up, and someone came up the stairs.  The 
  footsteps were not Dane Lady's.  Then my son James comes around the 
  corner.  Home from Ft. Hood for the weekend.</font></span></p>
<p><span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">We are

  note, he will be on a plane to his 3rd combat tour at 4pm Monday.  And 
  for the first time in my life I will admit I am now too old to want to go 
  along.  I have said it before, he is the guy I want with me when 
  everything else is falling apart and I need help... any kind of 
  help!</font></span></p>
<p><span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Anyway......</font></span></p>
<p><span class="953035503-02112007"> </span>I  came into l'boxing 
  about the time you were publishing the photo journal. So, I saw the pics, but 
  didn't even knew what a Hueco Tank was. I think it was a few months before I 
  became comfortable to know why anyone would hike to see a tank. A tank to me 
  then was a water tank or an army tank. Tanks that were manmade. After a year, 
  I am still learning about your tanks. <span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></span></p>

<p><span class="953035503-02112007"> </span>Now I really want to go there. 
  But, I think I will need a bit more training before I can tackle that 
  adventure. I would absolutely love to see the paintings. That kind of stuff 
  would make that trip astounding. <span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></span></p>
<p><span class="953035503-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Naaa.... 
  you don't need to be in any kind of super-shape for that park.  There is 
  lots to see and do for everyone.  I hope to soon have two letterboxes in 
  that area too.  Just to make it worth the trip.  Heck, soon I will 
  have 10 boxes out in a place where I am the 
  only boxer.</font> </span><br/><br/>What a great story. Thanks

</p><div>How great that your son surprised you. That is so good to hear. You tell 
  him when he goes back that I said to, "Keep your head low." <span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></span></div>

<div><span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Yeah - we 
  are hoping to get in a last hike on Saturday.  We will 
  see.</font> </span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's good to hear that I could make the trip before "buffing up". I 
  went on a hike the other day and only had to break once for a couple breaths. 
  This Spring, I made the same hike and had to break even when there was no 
  bench. I'm getting there. I'm almost ready to go back out and find the 3rd box 
  in the Moose Series out at Grapevine Lake. That's a bit more than I could 
  handle last Spring.<span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></span></div>

<div><span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Fitness 
  is something you need to work at - not something you can get in one 
  afternoon.  But the best way to get fit is by doing it.  I recommend 
  that if you want to get the harder letterboxes, you should just do it.  
  Pick the easier ones first, and work your way up.</font> </span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've seen the slide show for Gila. It was good. I love your slide shows. 
  I forwarded your post from earlier to my DD and told her we need to go there. 
  I figure Winter would be a good time.<span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana"> </font></span></div>

<div><span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">Noooo - 
  to cold in the winter.  Best time to hike the Gila is May-early 
  June.  July-Aug is the rainy season.  By Oct it is too cold to 
  camp.  Well, at least for me.  </font></span></div>

<div><span class="985301911-02112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana">You must 
  understand, I spent 20 years "camping" in all kinds of weather.  
  "Shooting" in all kinds of weather.  "Hiking" in all kinds of 
  weather.  I retired from that life.  I don't have to do that 
  anymore, and you can't make me!  &lt;grin&gt;   I guess maybe I 
  am getting too old to play Army anymore.</font></span></div>

  that is 6k ft plus mountainous area, even in June it was getting into the
