                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love being creative so until I get moved and settled geocaching does allow that and it gives me pleasure for people to say they are enjoying my plants. One thing you will find is photographs make great memories of either hobby....and I kind of scrapbook my letterbox finds. I keep a logbook for both hobbies. It's all about the adventure. There are some people who never plant so don't worry about it. Just have a good time!<br/>

Happy Trails,<br/>
