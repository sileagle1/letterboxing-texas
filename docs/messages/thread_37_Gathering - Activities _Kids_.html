                    <div class="plaintext-content">I will be coming with 3 grandchildren - boys 8 and nearly 2, and a <br>
girl 7. Although they will be hiking and letterboxing too, some <br>
other activities would be enjoyed as well. We'll probably bring a <br>
jumprope and maybe a koosh ball.<br>
I think it would be great if you and/or your daughter would be able <br>
to plan a few activities for kids. I'd love some kind of 'get <br>
aquainted' or 'get comfortable' activity for kids. OH - I have a <br>
large (12 handle, no hole in center) colorful parachute if you would <br>
like to use it. There are lots of activities for parachutes on the <br>
internet...search 'parachute games kids' or something like that.<br>
<br>
As far as other things, I will probably be bringing peanut butter <br>
cookies, at least...maybe some kind of trail mix. <br>
