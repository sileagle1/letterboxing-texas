                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to all who sent hog and javelina info...we have determined <br/>
that what we saw were baby javelinas.  I didn't know they were found <br/>
that far north, but I am sure that is what they were.<br/>
<br/>
We spent last weekend camping and letterboxing in Glen Rose.  This is <br/>
a stunning park.  We found Silver Eagles box, and planted another of <br/>
our own (Dino-Mite!  placed by mother of four if you want the clues)  <br/>
We also found the confederate flag box in Mexia, this is also a cool <br/>
place to visit.  We looked for Baby Bear's val verde box, but I think <br/>
the steps to the building have been recently replaced, and the box <br/>
wasn't there.  We stopped in Waco and found the don't mess with Texas <br/>
box (my favorite stamp so far!) at the suspension bridge.  We were <br/>
with my four little ones, and they all enjoyed each of these spots.  <br/>
Pouring rain and naptime kept us from finding any more boxes in Waco, <br/>
so we will save them for the next trip.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, we stopped at Washington on the Brazos on the way up.  We <br/>
looked for Baby Bears box, but if we were at the correct fallen tree <br/>
(and I think we were) it is covered with suspicious looking vines.  <br/>
After we all stepped in ants (except the baby who was riding in the <br/>
backpack) we decided to call it quits for the day.  We'll return when <br/>
the park isn't so full of people taking pictures in the bluebonnets!<br/>

changing weekly as I find more.<br/>

Thank you for letting us know that what we have been doing is what <br/>
the lbing community would want us to do.  I have seen alot of <br/>
comments about things that have gone arye with some new boxers; its <br/>
nice to know that those comments weren't directed at me.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Now I must get back to GG's Macca Moose...or sleep...or Macca...no I <br/>
really need to sleep. But, maybe being extremely tired I can figure <br/>
out what all those numbers mean.  Yikes...hopefully I can solve it by <br/>
the time I get Bastrop.<br/>
<br/>
By the way I need to find a bus.  Anyone know where I can get one at?<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Thanks so much Silver Eagle and Baby Bear! It just gets better every year! We too had a great time and enjoyed all the boxes that were placed. Chrispy, your two little munchkins were sooo cute! I'm glad you were able to make it. </p>
<p>Dewberry, I was so excited that you came! It was fun having<br/>that "stealthy" group of eight moving down the trail in mass, lead by<br/>Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket with SandiBox in the back reading the<br/>clues and shouting them up to those in front, sending SoccerChic into<br/>the sticks and briars to retrieve the boxes, and then sitting in a<br/>huge circle in the middle of the trail stamping in! Luckily, we owned<br/>the trails Saturday and the only other people we passed were letterboxers.</p>
<p>I will have to say, this was my favorite part of the day. It's not very often you can sit in the middle of the trail, stamp in and have such fun!  Can't wait till next year!</p>
