                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning, guys!<br>
<br>
Rather than write a 5-page epic of all the reasons I've been away from<br>
letterboxing for the last couple of months, I will attempt a very short<br>
list:<br>
<br>
1. Youngest son is a HS senior( those of you have been there may relate!;<br>
for the last month we've been organizing & preparing for Solar Car Team<br>
retreat in Big Bend and Senior Class ski trip in Colorado; one apparently<br>
involves javelinas and the other requires gators ;-))<br>
2. 1 wedding (my very dear younger sister & her high school sweetheart after<br>
many decades, other marriages and a couple of oceans intervening) <br>
3. 1 engagement (yippee! Those of you at Brazos last year may remember our<br>
oldest son; an engagement letterbox near the proposal site at White Rock<br>
Lake will follow! Bride-to-be's parents do not live in Dallas, so I'm<br>
thrilled to be included in planning!)<br>
4. 2 more surgeries & more yucky stuff: some of you know I've been battling<br>
cancer for a few years, and I go back & forth between wanting to keep that<br>
info private, and wanting to help broadcast the fact that people now can<br>
LIVE strong with the disease<br>
....but it occasionally really interferes with my letterboxing ;-)!!!<br>
<br>
So there you have it! No excuses - just reasons! I'm looking forward to Rusk<br>
& will be answering as many (long overdue!) emails from you all as soon as<br>
possible!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
Ruby Tuesday<br>
<br>
PS - I promise to write to those of you working on the Scarlet Pimpernel<br>
asap - have to figure out how to explain something without using my<br>
hands!!!(Almost impossible for me!)<br>

We've been worrying it was mostly all BAD stuff, not weddings and engagements
