                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good morning, guys!<br/>
<br/>
Rather than write a 5-page epic of all the reasons I've been away from<br/>
letterboxing for the last couple of months, I will attempt a very short<br/>
list:<br/>
<br/>
1. Youngest son is a HS senior( those of you have been there may relate!;<br/>
for the last month we've been organizing &amp; preparing for Solar Car Team<br/>
retreat in Big Bend and Senior Class ski trip in Colorado; one apparently<br/>
involves javelinas and the other requires gators ;-))<br/>
2. 1 wedding (my very dear younger sister &amp; her high school sweetheart after<br/>
many decades, other marriages and a couple of oceans intervening) <br/>
3. 1 engagement (yippee! Those of you at Brazos last year may remember our<br/>
oldest son; an engagement letterbox near the proposal site at White Rock<br/>
Lake will follow! Bride-to-be's parents do not live in Dallas, so I'm<br/>
thrilled to be included in planning!)<br/>
4. 2 more surgeries &amp; more yucky stuff: some of you know I've been battling<br/>
cancer for a few years, and I go back &amp; forth between wanting to keep that<br/>
info private, and wanting to help broadcast the fact that people now can<br/>
LIVE strong with the disease<br/>
....but it occasionally really interferes with my letterboxing ;-)!!!<br/>
<br/>
So there you have it! No excuses - just reasons! I'm looking forward to Rusk<br/>
&amp; will be answering as many (long overdue!) emails from you all as soon as<br/>
possible!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>
Ruby Tuesday<br/>

asap - have to figure out how to explain something without using my<br/>
hands!!!(Almost impossible for me!)<br/>
