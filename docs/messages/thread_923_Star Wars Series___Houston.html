<div><font size="2">Ok, the kids are all finally asleep, so I added the clues to 
boxes 2 and 3 in our Star Wars series...The Jedi Master and The Dark Side.  
I know Teamking and Semalee found the May The Force Be With You box 
already.  But since my son thought I had the boxes in a bad order we have 
replaced the Force box with the Jedi Master (same clues, new stamp) and re hid 
the Force further down the trail (same stamp, new spot) hope that makes 
sense.  I have found it is better not to argue with a 9 year old boy on 
matters of Star Wars, that is why we pulled the old switcheroo.  The boxes 
are on the same trail, and the series is designed to be easy to do with kids 
(and you will most likely really need them to answer the trivia questions, since 
they were written by kids!)  Have fun!  -Mother of 
Five</font></div></body></html>
