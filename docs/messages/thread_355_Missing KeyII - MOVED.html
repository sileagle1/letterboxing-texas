While we were checking our other White Rock box (Missing Key III), we<br/>
swung by to check on Missing Key II:  It was such fun to see the very<br/>
cool stamps in there - I'll be writing to their creators personally soon<br/>
- but we are going to have to re-locate the box. It was in a terrific<br/>
spot in a hollow tree on the edge of water where some great<br/>
bird-watching is possible.<br/>
Unfortunately, in a new effort to rebuild and rejuvenate White Rock<br/>
Lake, a huge new chain link fence has been erected, closing off access.<br/>
(In fact, to retrieve the box, my sweet husband had to slither under the<br/>
fence while trying to act casual...)<br/>
We'll try to get the box re-hidden next before next weekend, along with<br/>
a third White Rock Lake box in honor of cyclists. If you're likely to be<br/>
looking for it, please write to me &amp; I'll let you know if it's out there<br/>
yet!<br/>
