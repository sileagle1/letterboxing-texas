<br>
Welcome, Lena!  As someone who creates ATCs reguarly, I'm always<br>
thrilled to hear about people who collect them.  You can see some of<br>
my latest (and print them, free) towards the bottom of my webpage,<br>
http://www.aisling.net/gallery/gallery-cards.htm<br>
<br>
All of my 5/05 cards can be printed out, but if your husband collects<br>
ATCs in the 2.5" x 3.5" size, he'll need to resize the images to fit<br>
on smaller card stock or paper.  Most of my cards are 3" x 5".<br>
<br>
Cheerfully,<br>
Aisling, in Houston<br>
