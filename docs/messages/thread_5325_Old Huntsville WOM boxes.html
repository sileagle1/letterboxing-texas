                    <html><body><p>There are a couple of WOM boxes that were placed at Huntsville State Park a long time ago by Norasta.  Someone asked me if I have the clues, and I don't seem to have kept them.  I have tried to contact Norasta on AQ and LbNA, but she hasn't responded.  I assume she is no longer letterboxing. Does anyone remember them and if so, do you still have the clues?  They are called "Bear on a Tear" and "Ukpik and Aqilgieq".  </p><p></p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>
