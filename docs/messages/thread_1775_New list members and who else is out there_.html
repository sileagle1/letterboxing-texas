                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've really enjoyed reading everyone's comments about<br>
the gathering.  I had a great time myself and was glad<br>
for the opportunity to help everyone have a good time<br>
in my little part of the world. <br>
<br>
Although I knew my LSS was really pretty sick, I<br>
suspected he wasn't too sorry to miss the gathering -<br>
until he surprised me by saying more than once how he<br>
really wished he could've been there.  Slowly but<br>
surely, he's getting hooked!<br>
<br>
I just approved list membership for our new friends<br>
from Alto (she-wolf requested membership, on behalf of<br>
the family, I'm sure) - the folks that someone ran<br>
into in the woods?  I just can't imagine how I<br>
would've felt if I had been out there trying out<br>
letterboxing and some odd person figured me out and<br>
sent me off to meet a bunch of other odd characters. <br>
Those folks have guts!  I'm convinced they'll be with<br>
us for a long while...and that's yet another story to<br>
add to our collection of Texas Letterboxing Stories.<br>
<br>
I keep feeling there are several new folks who have<br>
turned up on the letterboxing scene recently, but<br>
we've had relatively few requests for membership.  If<br>
you think of someone who needs to sign up, either<br>
point them toward the link at the bottom or send me or<br>
Silver Eagle their email address and we'll invite<br>
them.  Although I believe you can certainly letterbox<br>
without ever talking to another soul, belonging to the<br>
lists helps make for good conscientious letterboxers<br>
and it helps new boxers find their way around.  <br>
<br>
Well, I can't wait to find out where the next<br>
gathering is going to be - I'll see y'all for sure<br>
next year, but hopefully long before then!<br>

List (some of you may already have this).  Seems the best way to let <br>
them know, as I'm sure many new boxers have no clue there is a <br>
special place for Texas Letterboxers.   Would this be okay, and a <br>
good idea?<br>
