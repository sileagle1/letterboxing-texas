                    <div class="plaintext-content">Nice job, BT & LSQ!  Just curious, did they say they would check on <br>
your boxes every once in a while and let you know of any problems?<br>
Also, I wonder why they don't have to follow the permit rules <br>
supposedly mandated for all State Parks?  It would appear that each <br>
park does have some leeway in how they interpret the rules.  This is <br>
good in some ways and bad in others.  It means some parks like this <br>
one currently allow boxes, but there is no guarantee the next set of <br>
Rangers will continue this policy and the boxes will be confiscated.  <br>
I guess the best we can do is negotiate with current Rangers and hope <br>
they stay a long time.  <br>
<br>
This was a great park to negotiate with since it was already known <br>
that they were geocache-friendly.  Parks that are against it will be <br>
more difficult, but at least we would have nothing to lose.  The <br>
parks that have no defined policy with letterboxes currently in them <br>
(Rangers probably unaware) are the ones I worry about.  If you <br>
discuss letterboxing with them, it might backfire and get all boxes <br>
in the park confiscated.  I guess we could ask about geocache policy <br>
first to see how they feel about them, and if they are ok with that, <br>
then ask about letterboxes.  Hopefully we would not endanger the <br>
geocaches in the park if they don't know about them, but I doubt many <br>
Rangers aren't aware of geocaches by now.  Either way, it will <br>
require good communication skills and a lot of patience, which Boots <br>
and LS Quilter obviously possess!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">They didn't even ask me for the location of the boxes, although the <br>
one lady ranger did ask me to email her the address of the website.  <br>
She said that she goes into geocaching.com and reads comments from <br>
finders and enjoys hearing the compliments they get on the park.  Of <br>
course, I guess if they know the website they will be able to locate <br>
the boxes if they choose to do so.  I thought I'd send her the <br>
AtlasQuest website address since our boxes are posted there.  As far <br>
as the mandate on "treasure hunting games", I don't know why they <br>
would allow geocaching, but none of them had ever heard of <br>
letterboxes.  I can understand how you would be worried that we have <br>
put your box and Baby Bear's box in jeopardy by discussing <br>
letterboxing with them.  I didn't tell them that there were any <br>
other boxes there, but I guess they could find out now if they <br>
really want to know.  I think they would be greatly surprised to <br>
learn that two letterboxes had been there for over four years.  This <br>
park may be small enough and remote enough that they just make up <br>
their own rules as they go.  I think this is the way we may have to <br>
approach letterboxing in state parks in the future.<br>
