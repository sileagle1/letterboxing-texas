<p>I'm getting in on this discussion a little late and I'm not sure what 
letterboxing has to do with guns except that I went to a Texas state park a 
couple of days agk and couldn't get in because they were allowing hunting that 
day. I wasn't involved in letterboxer back in the day when TPWD had a problem 
with geocaching, so I don't know that story. I can't say what Fredericksburg has 
against letterboxing or what prompted the decision to require permits in their 
parks. I do know that, until a few weeks ago, TPWD didn't have a clue about the 
existance of a thing called letterboxing. I have corresponding with Chris Holmes 
there who is in charge of geocaching activities in Texas State Parks and the 
first time I spoke to him, he told me that he had never heard of letterboxing. I 
have permitted letterboxes in 7 or 8 state parks and every time, I've had to use 
the geocache permit application because park personnel didn't know about 
letterboxing. I am working with Mr. Holmes and he has appointed a ranger from 
southeast Texas to be in charge of establishing a policy for letterboxing that 
will be equal to and similar to the geocaching policy. He has notified all park 
managers about the existence of letterboxing and has agreed to either give us 
our own separate permit application or include us equally on the existing 
geocache one. I have been assisted in this matter with a couple of our prominent 
long time letterboxers, who have given me good ideas and suggestions to present 
to TPWD. I met with Mr. Holmes's appointee, Robert Owen, last week at Huntsville 
State Park, along with Chrissy Halpen, the ranger in charge of HSP letterboxing 
and geocaching. We had a productive meeting and discussed the suggestions and 
ideas that I brought with me, including the permitting process and holding 
events in the parks, including the fact that we would probably place a lot of 
boxes during an event. These two rangers don't have a problem with that in 
theory as long as the boxes are permitted and placed by their rules. They don't 
by the way, look upon letterboxes as litter. They think that they are a viable 
activity for the parks and have asked if we would object to the promotion of the 
activiy in state parks. This is a work in progress, but all Texas State Parks 
should now be aware of letterboxing. There is a current policy in place lumped 
in with geocaching, but I think we will be recognized as an equal activity 
shortly. As of right now, you are allowed to place boxes in state parks. You 
should find out from park personnel what areas are off limits and follow their 
rules. I am still working on a working partnership with Ranger Owen and will let 
everyone know the result of those meetings when they are finalized. We may not 
get everything we ask for, but we can demonstrate to them by cooperating that we 
are willing to follow their rules when placing boxes in their parks. Building 
their trust in us will help us in our future dealings with them. The fact that 
nobody in Texas Parks and Wildlife are, or were, familiar with letterboxing, 
tells me that they haven't had any problems with us. I think it demontrates that 
we've been doing a good job with our hiding and with our events. They are 
looking for ways to improve attendence in parks and promote more appeal to 
younger people and letterboxing is one of the ways they can do that. If you 
experience a problem with letterboxing in Texas State Parks, lets talk it over 
and figure out how we can work with them. I don't think they'll ever let us 
completely police ourselves, because after all, they have bigger fish to fry, 
like hunting.<br/><br/>Boots Tex <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>,

Palmetto, 20 boxes is beyond saturation.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; When a true

&gt; Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Fredericksburg Requires Permits<br/>&gt; 
&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Let me be clear; I am not advocating ignoring the rules. I 
said the rules are too stringent<br/>&gt; &gt; for me and so my only choice is to 
not place boxes in parks with rules. I also gave a<br/>&gt; &gt; suggestion for 
making the process less stringent for Rangers and us.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
As for calling letterboxing "litterboxing", I don't see it that way. If a box is 
hidden well<br/>&gt; &gt; enough not to be seen, how is it litter? If the box is 
visible, it will go missing, so I don't see<br/>&gt; &gt; the problem.<br/>&gt; 
&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Silver Eagle<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I 
donâ€™t have all the answers. But I do know that if a city wants to put 
rules on the<br/>&gt; &gt; use of their parks or other property, that is legal. I 
have faced the same kind of mindset<br/>&gt; &gt; with owning guns, with ham 
radio antennas, with geocaching, etc etcâ€¦.. If you do not<br/>&gt; &gt; 
follow the rules, you can be banned from using the parks, or even fined. What is 
the fine<br/>&gt; &gt; for littering? I do not box a lot anymore, so I really 
donâ€™t care of this hobby becomes<br/>&gt; &gt; such a problem that it 
isnâ€™t allowed anywhere anymore.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 
&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; QUESTION: IS THAT HOW YOU WANT PEOPLE 
TO THINK ABOUT LETTERBOXING? Or<br/>&gt; &gt; maybe it should be called 
litterboxing.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 
&gt; If you really put on the other guyâ€™s shoes and give it some thought, 
you can certainly<br/>&gt; &gt; see their side of it. They already see it as a 
problem. So you ignore them and continue to<br/>&gt; &gt; do it your way â€" 
and really piss them off. What would you do?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 
&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Iâ€™m just saying â€" ya 
knowâ€¦.. &lt;grin&gt;. Times change. Sadâ€¦.. but you need to<br/>&gt; 
&gt; do whatever you think is right, and live with whatever happens.<br/>&gt; 
&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Dunno â€" you 
decide.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;
