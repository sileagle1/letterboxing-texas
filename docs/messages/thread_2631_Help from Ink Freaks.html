                    <html><body><div>As y'all know, I've got this mambo stamp project going with Cub Scouts for our district event at the end of April.  Someone came up with this workable idea, IF I can find an indelible stamp ink.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Rather than having a patch designed for the event (which I had already spent umpteen hours designing, only to find out it couldn't be done), we are going to have patches embroidered with the event name and leave them blank so the boys can stamp the camp stamp and their personal stamp on the patch.  
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>NOW - these patches wind up sewn onto the pockets of scout uniforms everywhere, so the ink really needs to be indelible.  Any thoughts on how to accomplish this?  I plan to make several copies of the camp stamp, and they will only be used that one day, so that if I have to use an ink that will damage the stamp, that will be fine as long as the stamps last the day.

Had to chime in on this topic as a GS leader and Cub SCout leader. My advice is to use regular fabric paint and use a foam brush to spread on stamp and then press onto fabric of the patches. Any other type of ink will not give you a distinct enough and bright enough impression and who knows how it will stand up to the many, many, many washings these uniforms tend to get?  A fabric paint is designed especially to withstand washing and will show up brightly enough to be seen from a distance.  They are also readily available at any craft store and come iin a large variety of colors. Only difficulty I can see is making sure that paint is not spread too thick on stamp so it will not make a squishy mess.  only need a thin layer.  Maybe squirt fabric paint onto a paper plate and have boys stamp into the plate, test on paper and then
 sstamp onto patches?</div> <div> </div> <div>JMHO, Batty B (still hanging in there!)<br/><br/><b><i>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div>As y'all know, I've got this mambo stamp project going with Cub Scouts for our district event at the end of April.  Someone came up with this workable idea, IF I can find an indelible stamp ink.</div> <div> </div> <div>Rather than having a patch designed for the event (which I had already spent umpteen hours designing, only to find out it couldn't be done), we are

     You can find some stamp pads that are made with ink specially for <br/>
fabric use.  I think most of them need to be heat set (iron, or maybe heat <br/>
gun), but maybe not all of them.<br/>
<br/>
      There is a stamp store in Longview, but I don't know if they have <br/>
fabric ink.  You might have to get it by mail.<br/>
