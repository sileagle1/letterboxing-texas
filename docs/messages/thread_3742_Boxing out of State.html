                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to share a grand adventure we had this weekend.  I'll <br/>
try not to put any spoilers.  My mom aka: boonesburrow, monkey biz, <br/>
and myself went boxing in Louisiana and Mississippi.  We started off <br/>
going to Natchez Mississippi Sat. morning.  Monkey Biz learned lots <br/>
of interesting facts at the Natchez Cemetary.  This is one of the <br/>
most beautiful and history inriched cemetaries I have ever been to.  <br/>
If you ever go find out the story about the turning Angel.<br/>
Then we went  to Emerald Mound.  It is only 1 of 2 Indian Mounds of <br/>
it sorts in the US.  The other one being up north.  We were able to <br/>
climb <br/>
to the top and it was amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Next we were off to boxing in North Louisiana.  The kids ended up <br/>
getting to walk across a suspended bridge in the middle of the <br/>
woods.  They were scared at 1st but then decided it was pretty cool <br/>
and wanted to go back that way.  Next we went to meet up with a lady <br/>
named Zinni.  She is sooo very nice and was lonely to get some boxes <br/>
put in her area.  What she didn't know is I had put some together <br/>
before I ever left Texas and then had carved 2 more while I was there.<br/>
<br/>
Long story short:  If you need some kid friendly, fun adventure, and <br/>
want to learn alot of history while in North Louisiana or Natchez <br/>
Mississippi.  Check out the boxes placed there.<br/>
In all planted 1 in Mississippi and 5 in Lousiana.  Found 8 in all.<br/>
<br/>
Where have you gone that has been a grand adventure out of state?<br/>
