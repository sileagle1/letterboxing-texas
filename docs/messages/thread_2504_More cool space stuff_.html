<div>Space Weather News for Jan. 13, 2007</div>
<div><a href="http://spaceweather.com/">http://spaceweather.com</a></div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>Observers around the world are reporting that Comet 
McNaught is now visible in broad daylight. The comet is very close to the sun, 
so it is tricky to find. If you want to try, here's how to do it: Go outside and 
stand in the shadow of a building so that the glare of the sun is blocked out. 
Make a fist and hold it at arm's length. The comet is about one fist-width east 
of the sun.</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>This weekend is a special time for Comet McNaught 
because it is making its closest approach to the sun. Solar heat causes the 
comet to vaporize furiously and brighten to daytime visibility. McNaught is now 
the brightest comet in more than 40 years, and it may become the brightest in 
centuries.</div>
