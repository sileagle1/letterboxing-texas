                    <html><body><div>Yesterday I took advantage of this nice weather to place two series of boxes on the Southern Walnut Creek Trail in east Austin:Â  <a href="http://www.austintexas.gov/department/southern-walnut-creek-trail" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.austintexas.gov/department/southern-walnut-creek-trail</a></div><div><br/></div><div>For some reason I never noticed this trail before and I was impressed with it. I was on my bike and I recommend doing that if you want to get both series at the same time, but the clues are set up so you can do them from different locations to break up the hike. Hope y'all get a chance to box before the rain comes again.</div><div><br/></div><div>Silver Eagle<br/></div></body></html>
