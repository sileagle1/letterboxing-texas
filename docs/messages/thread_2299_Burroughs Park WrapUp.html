boxes at Burroughs. Many of these will simply be replanted  around  <br/>
Houston, so you'll still have an opportuntity to get them in the  <br/>
future. Some will be returning to their owners out of state.<br/>
We are assuming that boxes supplied by any in-state people will be  <br/>
your responsibility for either picking up and/or listing on AQ or  <br/>
LBNA if you want. If you are out of town and need help with  <br/>
retrieving any boxes, let me know. I can pick up and send to you if  <br/>
needed. Otherwise, we will only be handling boxes supplied from out  <br/>
of Texas. Also, if you plan on leaving your box where it is and need  <br/>
help with interpreting the clue book for its location, let us know.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to everyone who so generously supplied boxes!!<br/>

Charlotte's Web.  I thought all of the boxes from the children's walk <br/>
had already been pulled.  I'd be glad to meet up, provide postage, or <br/>
make some other arrangements.  Just let me know what would be easiest.<br/>
