                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I planned out a day of letterboxing for last Friday, December <br>
28th.  I did my research on the letterboxes that I wanted to find in <br>
Athens, Edom, Brownsboro, New York, and Tyler and I printed out the <br>
clues for each of them.  I had a total of 15 that I was going to find <br>
before I returned home.  I left my house at 8:30 and stopped at the <br>
gas station to fill up the tank.  I started with the new plant by <br>
Fairy Dreamer at the Children's Park in Tyler, then off to Edom I <br>
went for Fairy Dreamers next 2 new plants. (Thanks for the 1st Finder <br>
certificates). Then I made my way to Brownsboro to one that I had <br>
searched for before and couldn't find.  Talking to my daughters after <br>
my 1st attempt at locating this one they told me that it was there <br>
because they had found it so I thought I'd give it another try with <br>
no luck. I didn't want to waste too much time there so on to New York <br>
I went and then to Athens.  After finding several boxes in Athens the <br>
sun was starting to go down and I knew that I would have to hurry <br>
before it was totally gone.  Well, I didn't quite finish before the <br>
sunlight was gone.  Of the 15 boxes that I set out to find there were <br>
2 that I couldn't find, 10 that I did find, and 3 that I'll have to <br>
look for another day.  So....I can't wait for Daylight Savings Time <br>
because I NEED FOR DAYLIGHT!!! <br>
<br>
I guess I could have skipped the stop for lunch and the bathroom.  <br>
NOT!!<br>
<br>
I still had a great time. :)<br>
