<br>
The First Texas Letterboxing Event is being organized by Silver<br>
Eagle and will be held at the Group Picnic Pavilion in Bastrop<br>
State Park on Saturday, March 6, starting at 11:00 AM. For<br>
directions and information about the Event, go to:<br>

<br>
You might want to bring chairs since the picnic tables<br>
may be full with food and journals.<br>
I have the Event poster made by Kathy and Baby Bear has the<br>
Event stamp so looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br>

<br>
Unfortunately, I will not be able to attend.  I hope one day to get <br>
to attend a gathering....and to get started letterboxing for that <br>
matter.<br>
<br>
Until then, thanks for letting me hang around and ask dumb questions.<br>
