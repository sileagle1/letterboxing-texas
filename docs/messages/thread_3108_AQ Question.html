My guess is that they are set at a certain number of logged finds. <br/>
You have 600 logged finds; LSQ only has 100 and something.  There are<br/>
F levels of 250 &amp; 500.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want a quick check with one of the boxes she can't see, go into<br/>

I did contact Ryan and he pointed out the fact that I could restrict <br/>
my boxes to potential finders with a certain F-count.  I didn't know <br/>
that and I feel kind of foolish.  I think when I registered a new <br/>
box I was setting that F-count number at 500, thinking it was my F-<br/>
count it was asking for and not realizing I was restricting my boxes <br/>
to those with a high F-count.  Oh well, no one ever said I was too <br/>
computer-literate.  I'm going to go in and change the restriction on <br/>
all those boxes.  LSQ and I always letterbox together, so when I <br/>
decided to list all our finds on AQ, I only listed mine because it <br/>
was a pretty big job lising both, and I didn't want the owners of <br/>
500 boxes to be getting all those old find messages.  So, she <br/>
actually has the same number of finds as I do because we find them <br/>
together.  Is there any way I can update her finds without sending <br/>
out all those notifications?  Thanks again.<br/>

<br/>
Ryan did some upgrades this weekend and there are a few changes.<br/>
<br/>
One of my favorite changes is the location search.  He is switching to<br/>
the google maps, so for all those who have entered a park, but not an<br/>
address, google maps will be able to map it with just a park name. <br/>
This will help tremendously in finding nearby letterboxes.  Not sure<br/>
if he's implemented that part yet, but it's coming.  He's been testing<br/>
on some Houston boxes.<br/>

&gt; If you send Ryan a note, he'll copy your finds to LSQ's logbook too<br/>
&gt; and you won't have to do it manually.  Easy-breezy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Ryan did some upgrades this weekend and there are a few changes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of my favorite changes is the location search.  He is <br/>
switching to<br/>
&gt; the google maps, so for all those who have entered a park, but not <br/>
an<br/>
&gt; address, google maps will be able to map it with just a park name. <br/>
&gt; This will help tremendously in finding nearby letterboxes.  Not <br/>
sure<br/>
&gt; if he's implemented that part yet, but it's coming.  He's been <br/>
testing<br/>
&gt; on some Houston boxes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Thanks, dewberry and Mike,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I did contact Ryan and he pointed out the fact that I could <br/>
restrict <br/>
&gt; &gt; my boxes to potential finders with a certain F-count.  I didn't <br/>
know <br/>
&gt; &gt; that and I feel kind of foolish.  I think when I registered a <br/>
new <br/>
&gt; &gt; box I was setting that F-count number at 500, thinking it was my <br/>
F-<br/>
&gt; &gt; count it was asking for and not realizing I was restricting my <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; &gt; to those with a high F-count.  Oh well, no one ever said I was <br/>
too <br/>
&gt; &gt; computer-literate.  I'm going to go in and change the <br/>
restriction on <br/>
&gt; &gt; all those boxes.  LSQ and I always letterbox together, so when I <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to list all our finds on AQ, I only listed mine because <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was a pretty big job lising both, and I didn't want the owners <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; 500 boxes to be getting all those old find messages.  So, she <br/>
&gt; &gt; actually has the same number of finds as I do because we find <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; &gt; together.  Is there any way I can update her finds without <br/>
sending <br/>
&gt; &gt; out all those notifications?  Thanks again.<br/>

the<br/>

that <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ryan's always responsive to those kind of questions.  Shoot <br/>
him <br/>
&gt; &gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; email and ask him.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My guess is that they are set at a certain number of logged <br/>
&gt; &gt; finds. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You have 600 logged finds; LSQ only has 100 and something.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; There are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F levels of 250 &amp; 500.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you want a quick check with one of the boxes she can't <br/>
see, <br/>
&gt; &gt; go into<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; edit boxes section.  The new Pcount and Fcount restrictions <br/>
&gt; &gt; (because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now you can restrict to people who have planted x number of <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes, not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just found) are on the same page as the clue.<br/>
