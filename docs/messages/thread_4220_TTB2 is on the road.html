                    <div class="plaintext-content">so the bus drove around a little bit this morning, there was a place they were looking for where they hoped to solve a mystery during thier stay there, but after driving up and down the road 3 times looking for this location they couldn't find it.  SO tehy had a change of plan , about 3 or 4 times along the way, they just couldn't agree on where to go next.  Untill they saw Carmel Baptist church, and decided to camp out there for a while.<br>
<br>
To find Carmel Baptist church, first make your way to Lindale any way you like.  then find where HWY 69 and FM 16 intersect.  take 16 West (toward garden valley) and drive for about 5-6 miles. look out on your right for CR 481.  Drive down CR 481 cross over 2 wooden bridges that don't really feel too safe, and look on your left for Carmel Baptist church, its accross from intercetion of CR 478.<br>
<br>
park, and look for the basket ball goal.  behind this is a mound of orange dirt.  climb over the orange mound, and keeping to the right of the stream with no water in it, make your way down to the fence line.  Look for a big tree that is 2 trunked at the  bottom and then becomes one tree.  walk right along the fence line (toward the cemetary) you will pass about 2 more trees on the fence line (after the big treee) look out on your right for 3 burned stumps, and a big pile of sticks like tree branches, under these branches the bus passangers are camping waiting impatiently to go to their next destination!<br>

 there
 for a while.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To find Carmel Baptist church, first make your way to Lindale any way you like. then find where HWY 69 and FM 16 intersect. take 16 West (toward garden valley) and drive for about 5-6 miles. look out on your right for CR 481. Drive down CR 481 cross over 2 wooden bridges that don't really feel too safe, and look on your left for Carmel Baptist church, its accross from intercetion of CR 478.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; park, and look for the basket ball goal. behind this is a mound of orange dirt. climb over the orange mound, and keeping to the right of the stream with no water in it, make your way down to the fence line. Look for a big tree that is 2 trunked at the bottom and then becomes one tree. walk right along the fence line (toward the cemetary) you will pass about 2 more trees on the fence line (after the big treee) look out on your right for 3 burned stumps, and a big pile of sticks like tree branches, under these branches the
 bus passangers are camping waiting impatiently to go to their next destination!<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div></div></wbr></wbr></wbr></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>

<div>Okay, I'm confused. This statement was posted last week: "nicatywam had it as of 8/18.

SO tehy had a change of plan , about 3 or 4 times along the way, they just couldn't agree on where to go next.
