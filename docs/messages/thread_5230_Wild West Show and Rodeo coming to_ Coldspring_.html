<p>I woke up this morning to the tap-tap-tapping of the telegraph emanating from my office. Alarmed and fearing the worst, I sprang from the comfort of my feather bed, grabbed my quill and, dipping it in the inkwell, commenced to copy down the message that was springing forth from a far-away place. To my relief, the news wasn't tragic, but told a happy tale: The Wild West Show and Rodeo is coming to East Texas! Promoters are already headed east from the wilds of New Mexico following a hugely successful run, aboard the Butterfield Stage. They will be followed by the myriad performers and animals and the train load of equipment required to put on a show of this caliber. The show train should arrive via the Santa Fe Railroad in a few days at the depot in Shepherd, where it will be unloaded onto wagons for the short trip to the fairgrounds at Coldspring, and there the famous cowboys and Indians, trick riders and sharp-shooters will perform their awe-inspiring deeds for a week or two or even more, perhaps adding an act or two during the stay. Flyers have arrived on the Overland Mail and are going up on the sides of buildings and fence-posts all across the town. I shall keep you posted on their progress.<br/><br/>Boots<br/></p></div></zzz></div></div></body>
