</p><div>I know that mater et regisfilia recently looked for the Texas Tour Bus and couldn't find it. Today I went in search and couldn't locate it either. Mater et regisfilia said she was confused by the clue "you will see three trees on your immediate left". That confused me also, but I know I was in the right location because all the other clues matched. When you say to look for a conspicuous large mound of dead leaves, were you referring to the large mound of debris, tree branches, etc piled in the northwest corner of the fenced in area? I did search that pile but did not find anything intuitively obvious! That area just doesn't seem to be the kind of area where anyone would just happen upon it, so I'd like to think it is hidden well and we just couldn't find it. Did you ever get a chance to go back and check and see if it is still there? One way of another, would you please just let us know? Thanks a bunch!</div>

<div>There were several clumps of crepe myrtles just as you pull into the gravel driveway (this is an old abandoned yard and there are still iris and daffodils scattered here and there and a wonderful huge lemon tree!). I think p ?uest may have been referring to those clumps; there were quite a few other trees on the property, but they were scattered around. I did search around the clumps of those myrtles, etc and walked all around the perimeter of the fenced yard since leaves had blown up against it (no conspicuously large mounds however). I also found an opening in the fence and walked around the outside of it looking also, but nothing! Maybe the passengers on that bus decided to just up and drive to Los Angeles or something.</div>

been . . . HIJACKED!  But if so, wouldn't the hijackers be contacting us to

<div>There was enough trash and debris at this site, that I can't imagine that it would have been picked up "as trash". Especially if it was hidden in some leaves because it doesn't look like anyone had been there cleaning that lot. The bus was too big for a letterboxing coyote to carry off, so I guess we can eliminate that possibility too.</div>
