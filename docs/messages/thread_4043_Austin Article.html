It reminds me of the article I read in the Danbury Post (Connecticut) which first led me to letterboxing five years ago. It just made me want to hop up off the sofa and immediately go find one of those little treasures... which I did!<br>

But as an Austin boxes I feel that the reporter just spilt some of the better Austin boxing secrets.  I know some of the boxes she mentioned she didn't contact the placers before placing them on the pedal-stool for noxers. "The overturned purple bucket in that garden? Definitely."  That box has already been stolen and is missing.  The haiku quotes being published with out author permission or even without their author's trail name is sub par ethical in my opinion as well.  I am glad none of my boxes were mentioned and I feel sorry for those who were blurted about with out the owners consent.<br>
In all she stressed it was all very secretive, with out keeping it of much a secret.<br>
