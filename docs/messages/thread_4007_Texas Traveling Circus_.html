                    <div class="plaintext-content">After a brief respite in my backyard, the Circus put up the big top and<br>
we had a grand ol' time.  The money was flowing for a solid week and <br>
they were kind enough to give me a cut of the profits- what a class<br>
act!  The circus is ready to haul out to the next stop, but they were<br>
hoping to have one night of fun in celebration of St. Patrick's Day <br>
first.  If you want to show them a good time, feel free to pick them up<br>
at an writer's intersection: "Hills like White Elephants" meets Sandberg Dr.<br>
<br>
They're hanging out right behind the bushes, 2 feet from the street<br>
signs.  Hurry- I suspect they're going to get wild tonight with all the<br>
festivities!<br>
