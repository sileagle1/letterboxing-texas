journals, ink, boxes and stamps. We wanted to make our own, but are <br/>
having a rough tim finding the right supplies here locally. Hopefully <br/>
our next ones will have some hand carved stamps in them. We got enough <br/>
for 3 boxes. We will be putting them together tonight and tomorrow and <br/>
will hopefully spend the rest of the week finding places to put them. I <br/>
am guessing that we will place some in Taylor, Callahan and Nolan <br/>
Counties. I will post the clues as soon as we figure it all out.<br/>
We are all very excited to start! We have a homeschool group meeting in <br/>
a few weeks and our son is going to give a short presentation on his <br/>
first letterboxing experience. Hopefully it will get a few more <br/>
families in our area interested in the whole idea. :)<br/>
