<br>
Introducing a new moving box -'Texas Tour Bus'   Here's how it will <br>
work:<br>
<br>
Like a bus, this box will move around the state and pick up passengers. <br>
I will plant the box in a location. The first person to find it (and <br>
make sure you are prepared to pick it up if you ARE first finder!) will <br>
pick it up, ADD A PASSENGER, and then replant it in a new location. <br>
(You can take it home to place your stamp in the box. Just make sure <br>
you don't keep it too long.) All of the stamps in the box should be of <br>
people. They can be real or fictional.  You could make them characters <br>
or historical figures or real people - maybe yourself!  You can also <br>
add anything you want with your stamp if you like - FF certificates, <br>
HHs, FF gifts, etc. Once you add your stamp and plant the box, then you <br>
will need to give the clue/location to this Yahoo List group. (Please <br>
don't list your clue in any other location! This is just a special box <br>
for the Texans and should only be reported and discussed on this <br>
letterboxingtexas list. I will add a general one to Atlas Quest if you <br>
want to log your find - but no clue or info will be with it.)  I will <br>
place a logbook in the box so you won't need to add one with your stamp <br>
(unless you want to add a small one for your particular passenger.) <br>
Either way, let's keep the name of the box changing so people will be <br>
able to keep up with it by adding your special location or such after <br>
the name Texas Tour Bus.<br>
<br>
Here's an example that hopefully will clarify:<br>
<br>
I plant the box in Memorial Park in Houston. I call the box 'Texas Tour <br>
Bus - Memorial Park'. I email this list with the clue (format it like <br>
the lbna site - with box name, date, your name, and the clue/location). <br>
  Then someone goes and finds it. That person picks up the box and <br>
reports to this list immediately that they picked it up. (we don't want <br>
everyone out hunting around for it and it's already been picked up!) <br>
They then add a new stamp to the box and go out and plant the box in <br>
another location. (Maybe this person is going to Dallas for the weekend <br>
and they decided to plant it up there or somewhere in between.) And on <br>
it goes. After a while, the box should be full of stamps. I thought <br>
maybe we could let it float around until the next gathering and then <br>
whoever has it can bring it to the gathering and the placers can get <br>
their stamps back and do whatever they want with them. Also note that <br>
the box itself will be a big Tupperware  big enough to hold plenty of <br>
stamps, but perhaps a bit trickier to hide.<br>
<br>
It's just a way to add some variety and maybe get a box out to some of <br>
the areas of the state and boxers that don't get as much traffic as we <br>
do in Houston.  Bit of a race, bit of a surprise, opportunity to get <br>
some more finds.  BUT, you've got to be the FIRST to get to it, or you <br>
don't get the box! :)<br>
<br>
If any other issues come up, we will just resolve along the way.<br>
<br>
One other thing  there are TWO box stamps (non-passengers) AND neither <br>
were done by TeamKing. I recruited 2 of my favorite carvers to do them <br>
so hope you will enjoy.<br>
<br>
Sound good? I'll be listing the first 'stop' within the next 2 wks so <br>
keep a lookout. From there, who knows where it will end up!<br>

<div> </div>
<div>Ready for a ride? You've got to find the bus first!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Introducing a new moving box -'Texas Tour Bus' Here's how it will</div>
<div>work:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like a bus, this box will move around the state and pick up passengers.</div>
<div>I will plant the box in a location. The first person to find it (and</div>
<div>make sure you are prepared to pick it up if you ARE first finder!) will</div>
<div>pick it up, ADD A PASSENGER, and then replant it in a new location.</div>
<div>(You can take it home to place your stamp in the box. Just make sure</div>
<div>you don't keep it too long.) All of the stamps in the box should be of</div>
<div>people. They can be real or fictional. You could make them characters</div>
<div>or historical figures or real people - maybe yourself! You can also</div>
<div>add anything you want with your stamp if you like - FF certificates,</div>
<div>HHs, FF gifts, etc. Once you add your stamp and plant the box, then you</div>
<div>will need to give the clue/location to this Yahoo List group. (Please</div>
<div>don't list your clue in any other location! This is just a special box</div>
<div>for the Texans and should only be reported and discussed on this</div>
<div>letterboxingtexas list. I will add a general one to Atlas Quest if you</div>
<div>want to log your find - but no clue or info will be with it.) I will</div>
<div>place a logbook in the box so you won't need to add one with your stamp</div>
<div>(unless you want to add a small one for your particular passenger.)</div>
<div>Either way, let's keep the name of the box changing so people will be</div>
<div>able to keep up with it by adding your special location or such after</div>
<div>the name Texas Tour Bus.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's an example that hopefully will clarify:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I plant the box in Memorial Park in Houston. I call the box 'Texas Tour</div>
<div>Bus - Memorial Park'. I email this list with the clue (format it like</div>
<div>the lbna site - with box name, date, your name, and the clue/location).</div>
<div>   Then someone goes and finds it. That person picks up the box and</div>
<div>reports to this list immediately that they picked it up. (we don't want</div>
<div>everyone out hunting around for it and it's already been picked up!)</div>
<div>They then add a new stamp to the box and go out and plant the box in</div>
<div>another location. (Maybe this person is going to Dallas for the weekend</div>
<div>and they decided to plant it up there or somewhere in between.) And on</div>
<div>it goes. After a while, the box should be full of stamps. I thought</div>
<div>maybe we could let it float around until the next gathering and then</div>
<div>whoever has it can bring it to the gathering and the placers can get</div>
<div>their stamps back and do whatever they want with them. Also note that</div>
<div>the box itself will be a big Tupperware  big enough to hold plenty of</div>
<div>stamps, but perhaps a bit trickier to hide.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's just a way to add some variety and maybe get a box out to some of</div>
<div>the areas of the state and boxers that don't get as much traffic as we</div>
<div>do in Houston. Bit of a race, bit of a surprise, opportunity to get</div>
<div>some more finds. BUT, you've got to be the FIRST to get to it, or you</div>
<div>don't get the box! :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If any other issues come up, we will just resolve along the way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One other thing  there are TWO box stamps (non-passengers) AND neither</div>
<div>were done by TeamKing. I recruited 2 of my favorite carvers to do them</div>
<div>so hope you will enjoy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sound good? I'll be listing the first 'stop' within the next 2 wks so</div>
<div>keep a lookout. From there, who knows where it will end up!</div>
