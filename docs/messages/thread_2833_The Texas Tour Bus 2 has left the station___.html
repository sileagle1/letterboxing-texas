<br/>
We didn't want to make you folks drive all the way to Alpine, but we <br/>
wanted it close enough that we could check on it if no one comes to <br/>
get it for a while, so we drove it on up to the interstate (about 80 <br/>
miles from here).<br/>
<br/>
Kent, Tx.  Kent is located in west Texas along I-10 about equal <br/>
distance from El Paso or Odessa - roughly 150 miles one-way from <br/>
either place... that's about 400 miles west of San Antonio on I-10 <br/>
for any of you attendidn the meet and greet, that don't mind a day-<br/>
trip.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note*** when I type in Kent, Tx on google maps, it points the <br/>
arrow to some other part of the state, so to be clear. Kent is at the <br/>
intersection of I-10, U.S. Hwy 80, State Hwy 118, &amp; FM 2424, on the <br/>
Missouri Pacific Railroad 36 miles E of Van Horn in southeastern <br/>
Culberson County. It was founded before 1892 and was originally known <br/>
as Antelope. <br/>
<br/>
Alrighty, so Clues already: Once in Kent locate the ruins of the old <br/>
schoolhouse on the south side of the interstate (the feeder roads are <br/>
2-way out here, so you can drive there easily). <br/>

&gt; are <br/>
&gt; 2-way out here, so you can drive there easily). <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From the Northwest corner of the outside of the school ruins walk <br/>
&gt; 35 <br/>
&gt; steps south by south-west (220 degrees) to a large pile of small <br/>
&gt; white rocks. from the center of this pile of rocks, walk 3 steps <br/>
&gt; north by northwest (310 degrees). The texas Tour Bus 2 is under a <br/>
&gt; mangled up piece of rusty tin, and a small chunk of concrete.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; ALSO, I planted a traditional box there too, but I'm not gonna <br/>
&gt; list <br/>
&gt; it for another week, so whoever goes for the bus should be first <br/>
&gt; finder... Antelope letterbox. Kent was originally known as <br/>
&gt; Antelope, <br/>
&gt; so go figure... Clues: from the center of the same pile of white <br/>
&gt; rocks, walk 5 steps south (180 degrees) to a square piece of <br/>
&gt; concrete <br/>
&gt; (about 18 inches square and 5 or 6 inches tall) that has a hole in <br/>
&gt; the center where a post once was. The center hole (and the <br/>
&gt; letterbox) <br/>
&gt; are covered by a small rock. Happy Hunting.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BTW I really enjoyed the stamps of the folks on the bus, and Cold <br/>
&gt; Front and I really stepped up our carving for our additions to the <br/>
&gt; bus, so I hope you like them. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Warm Front<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS we are having an incredible hail storm as I write this. <br/>
&gt; Mothball <br/>
&gt; sized hail has completely blanketed the ground and dropped the <br/>
&gt; temperature 25 degrees in 15 minutes... amazing, but the cat is <br/>
&gt; scared to death.<br/>
