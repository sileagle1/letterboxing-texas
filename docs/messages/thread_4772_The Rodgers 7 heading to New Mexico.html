It's with mixed emotions that I'm writing this to tell ya'll that our family<br/>
is leaving the great state of Texas to move to our new home of Las Cruces,<br/>
New Mexico!! Eaglemister got a new job of small groups Pastor at a Church<br/>
there in Las Cruces. If it's ok with ya'll I'd still like to be a part of<br/>
this yahoo group as we plan to still attend the TALE events and will be<br/>
making frequent trips back to Texas b/c of family and being so close to El<br/>
Paso. I'm going to miss Texas and all of the awesome Texas letterboxers.<br/>
Looking forward though to finding some new boxes and doing some planting in<br/>
New Mexico!<br/>
