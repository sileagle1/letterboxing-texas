It's finally about healed, but I am being much more careful now. My problem was, I wasn't paying attention and the vine had NOT leaved out yet so I scraped up against it. It's EVIL!</font></div>

                    <html><body><p>Oh isn't that the truth!!! PI is looking bad this year!<br/><br/>BUT - as to tomato vines. They really ARE in the ground, and the farmers the past few days have been scrambling to get them covered up. My favorite gardener (the plant manager at my job, who brings me all sorts of GREAT produce in the Spring) spent yesterday afternoon actually burying his tomato plants with dirt in anticipation of the expected freeze. He'll unbury them in a few days when it's safe again.<br/>
<br/>My parents had a garden center when I was a teenager, and this time of year one of us (me, if I got lucky) spent whole days in the seed bin - the cubby hole from which we sold seed of various kind by the 10 cent scoop to the fifty pound bag - selling seed to farmers. The smart farmers warned the city gardeners - "Don't plant tender plants until after the Easter freeze." And they were remarkably accurate. The guys who jumped the gun and planted early were almost always sorry. Of course, at a time like this, when we are in a warm cycle, it isn't nearly as true as it used to be, but this year - it just might be so...<br/>
<br/>What I wouldn't give for a garden this year - but I have NO good sun! (That, and as we all know, I HATE the heat, so it would have to be a cool weather garden anyway...) BUT - nothing like eating a tomato right out of the garden, warm from the sunshine, so that the juices run down your chin...did I mention there IS a tomato eating contest at the Tomato Fest???<br/>
