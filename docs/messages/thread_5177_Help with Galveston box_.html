<br>
I'm not in Texas anymore, and have gotten some messages claiming the logbook on the "Texas Clipper" letterbox I planted in Galveston is getting full.  Are any of you going to be around Galveston anytime soon so that you could check on it for me, and maybe replace the logbook?  <br>
<br>
I don't remember exactly how big the box and book are, but I don't think they were tiny.  I think it may have been one of those smallish-lunch-sized lock-n-lock containers.  <br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
