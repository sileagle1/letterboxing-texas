                    <html><body><p>If anyone has planned on going out to Telge Park here in Houston -
cancel those plans.  The park is one but puddle.  The side
that is trails is completely fenced off and the trails behind the
playground are covered with water.  There was tape to block them
off but someone had tore it down.  Not really sure if it wsa
supposed to be done.  Creek was really high and fast moving.<br/>

Hoepfully this upcoming rain wont make it worse.<br/>
