&gt; But PLEASE PLEASE be sure to re-cover up the boxes after you find  <br/>
&gt; them. I would venture to guess that often the kids in the group put  <br/>
&gt; the boxes back and they aren't being covered up very well. (as MOST  <br/>
&gt; of the exposed ones had family/kids as the last signed in)<br/>
&gt; Perhaps just a double check on the box before you leave would help.<br/>

I am going to second this!  We planted a mystery box today that will <br/>
be a sure goner if it's not rehidden well.  The general area where we <br/>
were has a dearth of any decent hiding places, so we were very pleased <br/>
to find this little patch.  <br/>
<br/>
In other notes, we are going to be doing a few more mystery boxes this <br/>
summer.  It's hot, and I figure that a mental challenge may be more <br/>
welcome than a physical one right now.  The one we hid today is fairly <br/>
easy (and if someone wants to email me off-list how easy I would <br/>
appreciate it), but I think they'll be varying degrees of tough.  Am <br/>
going to be experimenting with types of clues, so I would truly <br/>
appreciate feedback from those so inclined.  I have another ready to <br/>
go tomorrow.<br/>

ps--glad Mof5 and others have enjoyed the Inversion.  I think it may <br/>
go sometime this week, but "early June" was the only estimate I heard.<br/>
