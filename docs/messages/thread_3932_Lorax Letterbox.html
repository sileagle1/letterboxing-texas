                    <div class="plaintext-content">That box has been there for a long time.  I wonder why the ranger just <br/>
now discovered it.  I think that having to renew the permit every year<br/>
is the real problem.  That would be impossible for a lot of boxes, and <br/>
you can't develop a relationship with every park ranger.  I don't know <br/>
the answer, other than to mark the box as "confiscated" and write it <br/>
off.  I've done that to a couple of boxes.  If the park personnel start <br/>
monitoring our websites and make hunting down letterboxes a priority, <br/>
there's nothing we can do about it (and maybe they don't have enough to <br/>
do).<br/>
