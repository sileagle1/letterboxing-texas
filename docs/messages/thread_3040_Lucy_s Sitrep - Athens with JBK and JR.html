                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now y'all know I HATE the heat.  I've said it many times on this list.  And<br>
I'll say it again - I HATE HEAT.  And yet I try a couple of times during the<br>
summer to force myself out of doors to expose myself to the heat to see if<br>
it has gotten any more bearable from year to year.  And today was the day.<br>
I'm hear to tell you - I still don't like the heat.  But I didn't die from<br>
the exposure to it, and I count that as a plus.<br>
<br>
JBK picked me up at 10 a.m. and we headed out, but I have to admit (and<br>
don't tell JBK) that JR was making mean eyes at me for kicking him out of<br>
his seat.  She thinks he's perfectly lovable, but I just don't<br>
know...reminds me a whole lot of Duke on the Bush's Baked Beans commercials<br>
- you know what I mean?  He's not JUST a dog, and when she's not<br>
watching...well anyway...<br>
<br>
JBK and I decided to go check out Athens Fish Hatchery as the site for the<br>
upcoming gathering.  On my assurance that it would be totally cool, she went<br>
ahead and listed it as being at the hatchery.  We got there and checked it<br>
out and there were a couple of concerns we had, but figured they were<br>
overcomeable.<br>

 gathering site and not go boxing?  That would be silly!  SO - we ventured on to Athens' Scuba Park to find Monarch Trailer's Scuba Dude.  He was there - and scuba-ing in the dry - a good thing in his case.  If anyone reading this is a scuba dirver, the Athens Scuba Park is a pretty neat place.  It's a lake dedicated primarily to scuba diving.  They have sunken boats and planes and buses to explore while scuba diving.  Scuba diving - I'll bet it's really fun on a HOT day.  We re-submerged Scuba Dude and went on our way to find Captain Zach's box.  Scuba Dude, Captain Zach?  I almost felt like we were doing a superhero run! </div> <div> </div> <div>Anyway, despite my trepidation I kicked JR out of his seat again and off we went.  Now Captain Zach's box was hidden in the same cemetery as The Drifter.  I thought it was odd that a kid would want to plant a box in a cemetery.  But as I was writing this, I
 suddenly got it - sorry kid, I'm a little slow today I guess!  I also pondered over what he could possibly mean by "with a little help from Baby Bear".  I remembered that too, after I saw the stamp.  Nice.  So while we were there, I went ahead and got The Drifter by Adams Trails.  AT do a great job of writing up their clues so you know exactly why you are where you are when you find the box.  Cool story.  And off we were again...since the gate had been closed, we hiked ourselves up the hill and back to the parking lot in the hot HEAT.  I braved the Mean Eyes again and pre-empted JR's seat, and we headed out to presumably head home, until JBK pointed out that we were literally right next to Purtis Creek State Park and three more boxes.  Well now - who were we to waste a trip like that?  And for my part, I had already broken a good sweat, so what was another stop in the summer heat??? </div> <div> </div> <div>We pulled
 in and paused at the gate to show them JBK's "Get In The Park Free" card.  JR helped.  The lady was very friendly, we both agreed overly so.  "Go home and knit socks for the poor folks" friendly.  Much nicer than the lady at the gate at Bardwell.  Make a note of that GG.  I'll bet she would let you in the gate no matter what the time of day or night! </div> <div> </div> <div>We got the map and quickly set our plan to get the hardest box done first - you know, in case we were feeling faint of the heat, we wouldn't have to forego that box if we left it til last.  So off we went, got to the site, parked and got out and walked to the trail head.  First thing we noticed was the sign that said "Trail Closed.  Take alternate path".  The only alternate path led to the right and down the side of some presumed finger of the lake that the map said was there but that we couldn't see - we wanted to go across
 the narrow end of that finger to the other side.  We were stumped.  Finally we decided that short of going down the forbidden trail we weren't going to get that box.  As a side note, JBK noticed that the clues had changed since she had printed them and the box was probably very accessible - we just didn't know where it was while we were there!  I think the saddest of us about not being able to get that box was JR, who was actually going to go walking with us on that one! </div> <div> </div> <div>We set off again for to find Lions and Tigers and Frogs.  Now when I read that title, I couldn't help visualizing killer Frogs.  Ones with big vicious teeth and maybe pointy claws at the end of their webbed feet.  I mean, whoever thought of Lions and Tigers and Frogs being classified together?  Rest assured - there were no teeth or sharp claws on this stamp.  It was harmless and quite cute and we found it somewhere near some
 alleged fishing piers.  Poor JR again had to give up his seat, and we headed off for the last box of the day - Swimming Upstream.  Lucky JR - he got to go on this one. </div> <div> </div> <div>We found ourselves wading through thigh-high grass to get to Swimming Upstream (okay, for JBK it was waste high, but you really didn't have to go there).  It felt somewhat like swimming upstream and JR was wayyyyy lower than the grass so for him it was a whole lot like blazing trails through the wilderness must have been.  Swimming Upstream was right where it should have been and we sat on the conveniently placed sitting spot and stamped in.  </div> <div> </div> <div>We finally got back in the car and headed back to Jacksonville.  I won't mention the heat again except to say that JBK's A/C worked very well in her car.  Thank goodness.  And that I got home and was again very thankful for central heat and air and ceiling fans and
 circulating fans and window units.  Cool is good.  It truly is. </div> <div> </div> <div>All the boxes we found were dry, resealed well, and recovered well.  The Scuba Dude box was partially crushed from the weight of the block he swims under.  Another of the boxes had a torn bag we replaced.  All in all though, it looks like the newbie boxers in our area are doing a pretty good job of doing what they should be doing.  We followed them - Athens Dicer, Frankston Native, Monarch Trailer, Monkey - on most of the boxes we found. </div> <div> </div> <div>JR must not carry a grudge very long, because he seemed to genuinely like me as he smiled to me from his seat when I got out.  </div> <div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/><p>

 concerns we had, but figured they were overcomeable.  </div> <div> </div> <div>From the fish hatchery, we stopped by the East Texas Arboretum - VERY nice, anyone who comes for the gathering needs to count on going and catching the several boxes there.  Considering that the gathering is in September and it might still be hot, my suggestion is to go early, but that's just me.  Among other attractions at the Arboretum is a butterfly garden that really works!  In fact, being at the Arboretum made me want to go home and mow my yard - it was THAT nice!  Well - It WAS a hot day, so it made me want to go home and tell Lightning to mow my yard. </div> <div> </div> <div>From the arboretum, we went on to find a few boxes - I mean, how could we just go and check out the gathering site and not go boxing?  That would be silly!  SO - we ventured on to Athens' Scuba Park to find Monarch Trailer's Scuba Dude.  He was there - and
 scuba-ing in the dry - a good thing in his case.  If anyone reading this is a scuba dirver, the Athens Scuba Park is a pretty neat place.  It's a lake dedicated primarily to scuba diving.  They have sunken boats and planes and buses to explore while scuba diving.  Scuba diving - I'll bet it's really fun on a HOT day.  We re-submerged Scuba Dude and went on our way to find Captain Zach's box.  Scuba Dude, Captain Zach?  I almost felt like we were doing a superhero run! </div> <div> </div> <div>Anyway, despite my trepidation I kicked JR out of his seat again and off we went.  Now Captain Zach's box was hidden in the same cemetery as The Drifter.  I thought it was odd that a kid would want to plant a box in a cemetery.  But as I was writing this, I suddenly got it - sorry kid, I'm a little slow today I guess!  I also pondered over what he could possibly mean by "with a little help from Baby Bear".  I
 remembered that too, after I saw the stamp.  Nice.  So while we were there, I went ahead and got The Drifter by Adams Trails.  AT do a great job of writing up their clues so you know exactly why you are where you are when you find the box.  Cool story.  And off we were again...since the gate had been closed, we hiked ourselves up the hill and back to the parking lot in the hot HEAT.  I braved the Mean Eyes again and pre-empted JR's seat, and we headed out to presumably head home, until JBK pointed out that we were literally right next to Purtis Creek State Park and three more boxes.  Well now - who were we to waste a trip like that?  And for my part, I had already broken a good sweat, so what was another stop in the summer heat??? </div> <div> </div> <div>We pulled in and paused at the gate to show them JBK's "Get In The Park Free" card.  JR helped.  The lady was very friendly, we both agreed overly
 so.  "Go home and knit socks for the poor folks" friendly.  Much nicer than the lady at the gate at Bardwell.  Make a note of that GG.  I'll bet she would let you in the gate no matter what the time of day or night! </div> <div> </div> <div>We got the map and quickly set our plan to get the hardest box done first - you know, in case we were feeling faint of the heat, we wouldn't have to forego that box if we left it til last.  So off we went, got to the site, parked and got out and walked to the trail head.  First thing we noticed was the sign that said "Trail Closed.  Take alternate path".  The only alternate path led to the right and down the side of some presumed finger of the lake that the map said was there but that we couldn't see - we wanted to go across the narrow end of that finger to the other side.  We were stumped.  Finally we decided that short of going down the forbidden trail we
 weren't going to get that box.  As a side note, JBK noticed that the clues had changed since she had printed them and the box was probably very accessible - we just didn't know where it was while we were there!  I think the saddest of us about not being able to get that box was JR, who was actually going to go walking with us on that one! </div> <div> </div> <div>We set off again for to find Lions and Tigers and Frogs.  Now when I read that title, I couldn't help visualizing killer Frogs.  Ones with big vicious teeth and maybe pointy claws at the end of their webbed feet.  I mean, whoever thought of Lions and Tigers and Frogs being classified together?  Rest assured - there were no teeth or sharp claws on this stamp.  It was harmless and quite cute and we found it somewhere near some alleged fishing piers.  Poor JR again had to give up his seat, and we headed off for the last box of the day - Swimming Upstream.  Lucky JR
 - he got to go on this one. </div> <div> </div> <div>We found ourselves wading through thigh-high grass to get to Swimming Upstream (okay, for JBK it was waste high, but you really didn't have to go there).  It felt somewhat like swimming upstream and JR was wayyyyy lower than the grass so for him it was a whole lot like blazing trails through the wilderness must have been.  Swimming Upstream was right where it should have been and we sat on the conveniently placed sitting spot and stamped in.  </div> <div> </div> <div>We finally got back in the car and headed back to Jacksonville.  I won't mention the heat again except to say that JBK's A/C worked very well in her car.  Thank goodness.  And that I got home and was again very thankful for central heat and air and ceiling fans and circulating fans and window units.  Cool is good.  It truly is. </div> <div> </div> <div>All the boxes we found were dry, resealed
 well, and recovered well.  The Scuba Dude box was partially crushed from the weight of the block he swims under.  Another of the boxes had a torn bag we replaced.  All in all though, it looks like the newbie boxers in our area are doing a pretty good job of doing what they should be doing.  We followed them - Athens Dicer, Frankston Native, Monarch Trailer, Monkey - on most of the boxes we found. </div> <div> </div> <div>JR must not carry a grudge very long, because he seemed to genuinely like me as he smiled to me from his seat when I got out.  </div> <div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div> <div></div></div></div></blockquote><br/></span></div> <div> <hr size="1"/>  Fussy?

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>JBK and I decided to go check out Athens Fish Hatchery as the site for the upcoming gathering.  On my assurance that it would be totally cool, she went ahead and listed it as being at the hatchery.  We got there and checked it out and there were a couple of concerns we had, but figured they were overcomeable.

 box.  Cool story.  And off we were again...since the gate had been closed, we hiked ourselves up the hill and back to the parking lot in the hot HEAT.  I braved the Mean Eyes again and pre-empted JR's seat, and we headed out to presumably head home, until JBK pointed out that we were literally right next to Purtis Creek State Park and three more boxes.  Well now - who were we to waste a trip like that?  And for my part, I had already broken a good sweat, so what was another stop in the summer heat??? </div> <div> </div> <div>We pulled in and paused at the gate to show them JBK's "Get In The Park Free" card.  JR helped.  The lady was very friendly, we both agreed overly so.  "Go home and knit socks for the poor folks" friendly.  Much nicer than the lady at the gate at Bardwell.  Make a note of that GG.  I'll bet she would let you in the gate no matter what the time of day or night! </div> <div> </div>
<div>We got the map and quickly set our plan to get the hardest box done first - you know, in case we were feeling faint of the heat, we wouldn't have to forego that box if we left it til last.  So off we went, got to the site, parked and got out and walked to the trail head.  First thing we noticed was the sign that said "Trail Closed.  Take alternate path".  The only alternate path led to the right and down the side of some presumed finger of the lake that the map said was there but that we couldn't see - we wanted to go across the narrow end of that finger to the other side.  We were stumped.  Finally we decided that short of going down the forbidden trail we weren't going to get that box.  As a side note, JBK noticed that the clues had changed since she had printed them and the box was probably very accessible - we just didn't know where it was while we were there!  I think the saddest of us about not being able to
 get that box was JR, who was actually going to go walking with us on that one! </div> <div> </div> <div>We set off again for to find Lions and Tigers and Frogs.  Now when I read that title, I couldn't help visualizing killer Frogs.  Ones with big vicious teeth and maybe pointy claws at the end of their webbed feet.  I mean, whoever thought of Lions and Tigers and Frogs being classified together?  Rest assured - there were no teeth or sharp claws on this stamp.  It was harmless and quite cute and we found it somewhere near some alleged fishing piers.  Poor JR again had to give up his seat, and we headed off for the last box of the day - Swimming Upstream.  Lucky JR - he got to go on this one. </div> <div> </div> <div>We found ourselves wading through thigh-high grass to get to Swimming Upstream (okay, for JBK it was waste high, but you really didn't have to go there).  It felt somewhat like swimming upstream and JR was
 wayyyyy lower than the grass so for him it was a whole lot like blazing trails through the wilderness must have been.  Swimming Upstream was right where it should have been and we sat on the conveniently placed sitting spot and stamped in.  </div> <div> </div> <div>We finally got back in the car and headed back to Jacksonville.  I won't mention the heat again except to say that JBK's A/C worked very well in her car.  Thank goodness.  And that I got home and was again very thankful for central heat and air and ceiling fans and circulating fans and window units.  Cool is good.  It truly is. </div> <div> </div> <div>All the boxes we found were dry, resealed well, and recovered well.  The Scuba Dude box was partially crushed from the weight of the block he swims under.  Another of the boxes had a torn bag we replaced.  All in all though, it looks like the newbie boxers in our area are doing a pretty good job of
 doing what they should be doing.  We followed them - Athens Dicer, Frankston Native, Monarch Trailer, Monkey - on most of the boxes we found. </div> <div> </div> <div>JR must not carry a grudge very long, because he seemed to genuinely like me as he smiled to me from his seat when I got out.  </div> <div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div> <div></div></div></div></blockquote><br/></span></div> <div> <hr size="1"/>  Fussy?
