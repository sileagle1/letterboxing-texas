found in its place), I dutifully changed its status to Missing on its <br>
clue webpage several months ago.  Imagine my surprise when I got an <br>
email today from a new letterboxer saying she found it!  I confirmed <br>
that it is my box with my stamp by her description, so I am baffled as <br>
to where this box has been hiding and what happened to the other box.  <br>
Since this box is located in a cemetery, I hope this hasn't become a <br>
Ghost Box!<br>
<br>
Luckily she did not see the Missing Status when she printed the clues, <br>
or she would never have attempted it.  I guess this points out the risk <br>
of assuming a box is missing, even if it really is missing for a while.<br>
Anyway, Mother Of TX is back for now.<br>

missing (and I'm POSITIVE she was), I have to wonder if the owners <br>
of "that other box" were holding her captive. You know how dangerous <br>
it is for those Texas settlers.  No matter... I can't wait to go <br>
back out and find her at long last!<br>
