                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Our family (well, my wife) read about letterboxing on a blog based out of Austin.  We had recently got back into geocaching but man, we've really really enjoyed the few letterboxes we have found here around Weatherford, TX.  The hand carved art work is such a neat touch.<br>
<br>
Our daughter is almost 14 months, and is now letting us venture back into our hobbies outside and nature.<br>
<br>
I saw Boots Tex' name on the forums - we just found your Frugal Man here in Weatherford yesterday.<br>
<br>
Talk to you all soon!<br>
<br>
Thanks for allowing me to join!<br>
