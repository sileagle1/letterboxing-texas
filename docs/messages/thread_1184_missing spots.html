are safe and sound in their hidey hole.  Their original hiding place <br/>
has been vacated by the ants, but they looked comfortable where they <br/>
were, so I left them in the new spot.<br/>
<br/>
I have had recent reports on most of our other mystery boxes and as <br/>
far as I know they're all doing well.<br/>
<br/>
In other news, Pop the Top may have been bulldozed.  Will have to <br/>
check it out after they finish modifying the park, but this one may <br/>
end up retired rather than replaced.  We'll see.<br/>
