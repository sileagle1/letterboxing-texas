                    <html><body><p>Can y'all remind me why we wear tennis shoes not flip flops, always take water and carry a small umbrella when boxing. Cuz I done forgot them all.<br/><br/>I went to get two very simple, close to the home, practically drive by boxes. How hard can it be. I don't need water, I don't need my backpack. I'll just grab my book, stamp, markers and go. Yeah, that's a bad plan.<br/><br/>Within a few minutes on the cement trail I was dehydrated. When I got to the spot for the box, it was 500 degrees outside (without the heat index). And, the fire ants. OMG, they are evil.<br/><br/>I'm trying to sit on this rock and look like I'm writing my memoirs and these little pests (G rating) are trying to eat me alive. I must've looked like a lunatic shaking my legs and slapping at my feet. All while trying to not let the baggies blow away and hide the box from the people running by me. <br/><br/>Yeah, I'm dying just sitting there and these people are running, in 500 degree weather. One lady had a long
 sleeve shirt and pants on. One family (whole bunch of crazy people) were wearing black shirts. Sheesh, I can't even imagine.<br/><br/>So, I have been able to log a find, find a gorgeous park not 3 miles from my house, tell LSS (who sat in the hot van) about a new fishing spot and find a cool play spot for Cassie girl. <br/><br/>Letterboxing<br/>Not just a hobby<br/>It's an adventure.<br/><br/>Janet<br/>Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><br/></p><div> </div><p>
