                    <div class="plaintext-content">I came soooo close to getting to go to Telge<br>
yesterday, but I just couldn't quite clear our<br>
schedule enough - I had to be in Jacksonville until<br>
Noon and had to be back in Jacksonville this morning. <br>
Gas prices are continuing to drop, I had an eye exam<br>
this week and got a new contact lens prescription so I<br>
feel like I'm living in a whole new world again, and<br>
the weather was perfect - what more can you ask from a<br>
road trip???<br>
<br>
We did, however, make it as far as Woodville<br>
yesterday.  My LSS had to run something down there to<br>
a friend of ours who is clearing debris.  He mentioned<br>
he was going and asked if Lightning and I wanted to<br>
go.  He had no sooner gotten himself ready than<br>
Lightning and I had printed clues for three alternate<br>
routes, gathered my carving stuff (in case I needed to<br>
make a box), grabbed our stamp box (in hopes we would<br>
be able to find some boxes), and were sitting in the<br>
car waiting on him.  How could he say no to a little<br>
letterboxing???  He's such a good guy...<br>
<br>
We opted for the direct route, so we went through Rusk<br>
and stopped and grabbed Gephyrophobia and Cherokee<br>
Nations - both fun little boxes.  I remember playing<br>
in that park when I was little and we would picnic<br>
there - that footbridge was no end of fun and I've<br>
struggled with how to carve it since I started lb'ing.<br>
 Catpawz mastered it though - nice one!<br>
<br>
Lightning was taken with the word "gephyrophobia" and<br>
every time we approached a bridge for the rest of the<br>
day, he brought it up again.  There are a LOT of<br>
bridges between Rusk and Woodville!  <br>
<br>
I liked the hiding place and the delicate carving for<br>
Celtic Lions' Cherokee Nations - it was a beautiful<br>
stamp.  I would really like to choke whoever litters<br>
the first part of that little trail.  Fortunately, we<br>
had some trash bags and gloves in my backpack, so we<br>
did a quick cleanup and I would suggest that anyone<br>
who goes for that box do the same.  It only gets<br>
trashed at the very beginning of the trail apparently,<br>
so it only takes a few moments.  I was returning the<br>
box to its clever hiding place (nice job Stillwater)<br>
and caught my foot on a big grapevine I had to cross<br>
over - fortunately as I fell I grabbed the vine and<br>
swung myself down instead of splatting myself down (my<br>
usual mode of downward escalation).  Maybe after<br>
nearly 42 years, I'm finally learning to fall with a<br>
small amount of grace - I'm not even sore today!  LSS<br>
and Lightning thought I had been attacked by a pine<br>
tree when I rejoined them with pine straw stuck in my<br>
hair and all over my back.<br>
<br>
Anyway...Rusk now has lots of really good boxes, and<br>
these were the last two I hadn't yet found.  So - Lucy<br>
Locket - now that I've finished finding all the boxes<br>
in Rusk, you may as well move in and plant some more<br>
so I can be frustrated about Rusk like I am right now<br>
about Nacogdoches.<br>
<br>
We jumped back in the car and headed down to Lufkin -<br>
four boxes there.  We went first to Ellen Trout Zoo<br>
and took our pictures at the entrance with the smiling<br>
hippo before hunting the first box. We had been<br>
members there a few years ago when we traveled that<br>
way fairly often, so we were pleased to see how nicely<br>
that zoo has developed.  We consider ourselves to be<br>
zoo officionados and have been to some of the greatest<br>
zoos in the United States.  Ellen Trout is a great<br>
little local zoo and an excellent bargain for the<br>
small admission fee you pay to get in.  It is a very<br>
clean zoo, animals appear to be healthy and happy and<br>
they have a few species I don't recall ever seeing<br>
anywhere else.  They also have a stunning reticulated<br>
python, a very nice toucan, some neat sloths, and<br>
great hippos (with an excellent hippo viewing area -<br>
have you ever thought of hippos as being playful???). <br>
We got a little turned around between the hippos and<br>
the giraffes (Lightning was NOT following the plan -<br>
LOL), but we managed to grab the box.  Both these<br>
boxes by Frye Team were great - thanks for sharing<br>
them!  Oh, and on the way out, you can ride the train!<br>
 We did the zoo and the train all for $10.50...  The<br>
train takes you around the zoo and across a small<br>
lake, circles around an island and comes back.  As we<br>
were coming back around the island, a lady in front of<br>
me very blatantly tossed her Sprite can off the train<br>
so I started yelling for the guy to stop the train. <br>
He thought a kid had fallen off or something, but I<br>
explained to him that the lady had "accidentally" lost<br>
her soda and I wanted to get it for her.  She tried to<br>
deny it was hers when I presented her with the can,<br>
but her son gave her up - good boy!  I don't normally<br>
do things like that, but something hit me when I saw<br>
her toss it.  LSS hustled me to the car quick when we<br>
got off the train because she looked pretty mad and<br>
she probably could've beaten me up with that Sprite<br>
can.<br>
<br>
We went on then to the Texas Forestry Museum, which<br>
closed just a few minutes before we arrived.  They<br>
have some great exhibits outside also though,<br>
commemorating the forest industry in the state.<br>
Remember our discussion a few months ago about the SFA<br>
Experimental Forest and what a great location it is? <br>
The Urban Wildscape trail is another trail in the same<br>
series and it is of the same quality.  In their early<br>
custom, Baby Bear and Silver Eagle each planted boxes<br>
in the same forest (although I notice they were a<br>
couple of months apart) so we knew we were in for a<br>
treat with their boxes.  And as we expected, they were<br>
great stamps and excellent finds.  Silver Eagle's box<br>
needed a little TLC, as was noted on his clue page,<br>
but we stuck some strips in the box for stamping in<br>
and did a little first aid and hopefully that will<br>
tide the box over until he gets an opportunity to<br>
check on it.  It was odd, though, because there was<br>
also a single small hole in the very bottom of the<br>
box, as though "something" sank one tooth and one<br>
tooth only into the box.  It wasn't gnawed or chewed -<br>
just had what appeared to be one tooth hole!  This box<br>
was so well hidden that we worked our way to it and<br>
Fearless Fox (LSS) was the first to it and Lightning<br>
and I were close behind.  FF decided to put Lightning<br>
to the test (he had not done a great job of rehiding a<br>
box earlier in the day, so we were trying to emphasize<br>
to him the importance of the rehide - this was a good<br>
one!).  He pointed where we all knew the box was and<br>
asked him if he could see it.  Even I, with my bright<br>
new contacts, couldn't see the box and couldn't see<br>
any telltale signs of it being hidden.  Finally, we<br>
spotted one tiny anomaly and sure enough, that was<br>
where the box was.  I didn't recognize the stamp of<br>
the last finder and they didn't sign their name, or I<br>
would be sure to call attention to them right here and<br>
now.  Nice job - whoever you are!  And nice choice of<br>
hiding places Silver Eagle!<br>
<br>
Baby Bear's were clever clues and we almost missed<br>
what he was referring to, but suddenly I realized we<br>
were looking for the completely WRONG thing and we<br>
were actually standing in the middle of the area where<br>
it was.  I know that makes no sense unless you've been<br>
there...That was a cool box too!  But as I said, we<br>
expect that of Baby Bear and Silver Eagle.<br>
<br>
By that time it was pretty dusky and we hadn't eaten<br>
since breakfast so we were starving.  We found a<br>
little barbecue place, Bryan's Smokehouse, and ate<br>
there.  They served a really good baked potato loaded<br>
down with chipped beef and all the normal baked potato<br>
stuff.  The restaurant is one of these where you go<br>
through the line and order, then someone brings you<br>
your food when it's ready.  We got a kick out of<br>
watching a tableful of about eight teenagers who were<br>
apparently supposed to be waiting tables and bringing<br>
food out and refilling drinks and cleaning tables. <br>
There were way too many kids for the few customers<br>
there were (at 7 p.m., it was us and two other<br>
tables), so one kid would hop up and bring a tray out.<br>
 A few minutes later a different one would hop up and<br>
refill our drinks.  When the other tables of people<br>
left, two others jumped up and cleaned each table. <br>
Otherwise, they sat there and carried on (mind you,<br>
they were very polite kids and weren't loud or rude,<br>
just lively) and answered their cell phones.  Have you<br>
ever watched a group of eight teenagers all with cell<br>
phones?  They look like prairie dogs answering their<br>
phones - off goes the ringtone and up goes the hand to<br>
ear.  Not to mention, they all had distinctive<br>
ringtones too.  I'm lucky to remember to take mine off<br>
of vibrate when I'm not at work.  And one girl even<br>
had hers broken down to different tones for types of<br>
people - she had one for her parentals, one for this<br>
group of friends, one for that group of friends, one<br>
for other family, and she demonstrated her ringtone<br>
that she has for people she hates.  That begged my<br>
question - why would anyone you hate have your cell<br>
phone number and why would they be calling you?  LSS<br>
reminded me of our own daughter and the ephemeral<br>
nature of some of her friends...nuff said.  We left a<br>
generous tip - they took good enough care of us, but<br>
we tipped them more for entertainment value than<br>
service.<br>
<br>
We finally arrive at Woodville and sat around and<br>
visited for an hour or so, then came on home.  I<br>
seriously contemplated asking Fearless Fox if we could<br>
do a little night boxing at Lake Livingston, but I<br>
decided I would be pushing my luck - after all, he<br>
attended JEN with me last weekend and boxed with me<br>
all afternoon.  Guess we'll save those others for<br>
another day.<br>
