                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my Artist Series letterboxes, I tried leaving all the older logbooks in one of the boxes in the series when I added a new one. My reasoning was because of the location of those boxes (Ft Worth Botanical Gardens). They were visited by travelers from around the world, and I thought it really added to the fun to be able to look through the logbooks to see who had visited those boxes. However, I started receiving complaints (yes, complaints) because there were too many logbooks in the box, and I should remove them because some people had trouble closing the box. Soooooo (I know you can't please everyone), when I replaced the logbooks this week, I removed the older ones, for fear someone would find it difficult to lock the box up tight. However, I had a thought last night as I was reading all the neat messages in the logbooks (since April 2006) - maybe I should put all the past logbooks in their own box and hide them under the last box in the series (O'Keefe's Poppies) where they would be safe. That way they would be available to anyone who really enjoys looking through previous logbooks.<br>

I thought it was a requirement of the Hobby to contact the placer. I realize that was an assumption on my part. However, I can understand a few of the reasons some people don't contact.<br/>1. It's taking some of the sneaky mystery out of it. I had a hard time convincing my family that we had to give the placer a status report of the boxes we found. They had misunderstood that just because the box was clandestine &amp; we should be covert hunting it down around non letterboxers. The placer is in on it and needs input.<br/><br/>2. Newbies make huge mistakes &amp; when Newbs are trash talked on forums for those mistakes I could imagine that they aren't really interested in commercializing the process of getting the hang of it. <br/><br/>3. So many

<br>
As you know, it isn't necessary to write down all that information if you keep track of your finds on either LbNA or Atlas Quest.  When you claim the box as a find, a message will be sent to the placer automatically. Then, on LbNA, you will be given an option to contact the placer, so if you want to report a problem with the box or just let the placer know that you enjoyed the box, this is your opportunity to do so.  On AQ you also have an opportunity to leave a comment.  I know I'm "preaching to the choir", because if you're reading this post, you are probably doing all the right things.  Those who stamp into boxes and don't follow through probably aren't members of this group.<br>

We've gone to boxes with several dozen stamps in the logbook, but the listing on either LBNA or AQ only lists five or six (or less) finds.  Then there are those boxes that haven't been reported as found in a year or more...do we take the time/gas/energy to try and find it?  If we do, we get there and the last stamp made was a few months back.  I know some people like to keep their logs to themselves, but if that many people are doing it, it does the planters no good.  I try to log our finds on both sites either the evening we return or the next day.<br>
<br>
One of our boxes got its first Found report...logged a month and a half after the person had found it.  But hey, at least we know it survived for at least one find!  <br>

A finder typically ONLY contacted a placer if there was an issue with the box (like a full logbook) or if it gave such amazing pleasure in the find that they had to share the story. And even in the case of great pleasure, they often wrote sitreps or public notes on lists such as this to encourage others to also experience that particular box. Otherwise, it was left as a pleasant surprise for planters to go and check their boxes periodically and discover all the log entries. And I have to say, I so greatly enjoyed the process of periodically driving 50 miles to check my first box to see "if" there had been anyone there, and after seven months, discovering it had indeed been found. It was far more thrilling to me to discover the stamps with my own eyes than to get a computer-generated message saying it had been found.<br/>
<br/>And as a thought, NOT getting rote reports of finds encourages planters to do regular box maintenance instead of relying on someone to tell them when there is a problem. I've decided I'm going to turn notifications off so I don't continue to fall into the trap of assuming a "found" report is good enough to indicate my boxes are in good shape.<br/>
<br/>Now the thinking is that an online log is a requirement of the game, and if someone doesn't log it online they are being rude. I personally have recorded my finds online because it makes placers happy, but it also winds up creating a count for me, which I don't personally like. I am not in letterboxing for the quantity, I'm in it for the quality. You will see "most" of my finds logged, but in recent months I have quit online logging because it ruins a small part of the game for me. <br/>
<br/>I hate that potential finders see the lack of online logging as a problem to them because they are missing out on a bit of the art and mystery of the game. For my own part, I don't ever look at recent finds or how many folks have found a box before I go boxing (I do on occasion after I return) because I am virtually certain that even if the box isn't there, I will enjoy my trip out and may very well find something serendipitous and surprising will happen along the way (and I am almost never wrong). <br/>
<br/>I hate that technology has become such an integral part of letterboxing. I've said it many times before, and I'll say it again, I like <a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a> because it is nothing more or less than a repository of clues - being a data hound at heart, I could spend hours of wasted time on AQ measuring and determining which boxes are most worthy of my time and which ones I should pass on by. I spend far too much time on the computer in my job, in scouting, and in basic life to want to spend even more time on the computer in letterboxing. It is my escape from the computer. If I wanted a tech-driven game, I'd probably enjoy geocaching more.<br/>
<br/>All of this to say, I have nothing against anyone that who prefers all the tech-parts of the game. I think AQ is a wondrous system, but it isn't for me.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here, here!  I didn't initially reply to this topic since I don't live in Texas.  However I am very glad to see someone explain the "other" side of the story.  I don't log my finds on-line.  However I do usually send an email to the planter to thank them and give an update on the status of the box.  Many new boxers put way too much emphasis on when someone last logged on find on a particular box.  On a box of mine that I checked last November, I'd had about 10 messages from finders.  I was therefore pleasantly surprised to see how many other finders & families had also found the box when I checked the logbook - almost 40! <br>
<br>
There is no "tradition" or "requirement" that somebody log each find on-line for others to see.  Many actually still do this as a more clandestine activity.<br>

True. Actually I don't care if people log their finds are not. I just happen to like statistics and find it interesting that one in every 2.95 people have logged their finds in the logbooks I mentioned in my prior post. Actually, I was surprised that so many people actually did log their finds, but I think that's because of the location of these boxes. They are often visited by some pretty saavy letterboxers. I actually haven't logged my finds on LBNA in years. However, I do enjoy it when people email me after finding one of my boxes. It's the "friendly" part of letterboxing.<br>

I've often read comments on this board to the effect of "If I had gone to find that first box, and it hadn't been there, would I have continued to letterbox?"  What if I had placed my first box, say 100 miles away, and time passed and I hadn't gotten back to check on it and nobody ever reported finding it?  Would I have continued to place boxes?

I put a lot of research and effort into most of my boxes, then I plan a trip to the appropriate place to hide it, so I have time and effort and money invested in it.  I have hidden boxes knowing that Gryzzled Gryphon may the only one to ever find it, but when he reports that he, indeed, found the box and has a nice compliment for me, I feel rewarded and want to go place another one.  If he had found it, and even gotten a little pleasure from the find, but never let me know, I would consider the effort in placing the box wasted. Call it pride or whatever you want, but it's important to me to know when my box has been found, and I find that responsible letterboxers let me know. Irresponsible ones just fill up my logbook for their own reasons, and never let me know that they found the box.  I'm sorry, but I think that's rude.  What if that original box at Cranmere Pool had sat in that spot for 150 years and no one ever picked up a postcard and reported the find, would we be letterboxing today?<br>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I have to say I agree 100 percent with Boots on 
this one.  There is a big difference between logging finds online and 
writing a note to let a placer know what happened when you went to find their 
box. Think of it this way, if someone gives you a gift, you take the time to 
write a thank you note, don't you?  A simple e mail to the placer is the 
"thank you" for the time and work that went into the box.

  found it, and even gotten a little pleasure from the find, but never let me 
  know, I would consider the effort in placing the box wasted. Call it pride or 
  whatever you want, but it's important to me to know when my box has been 
  found, and I find that responsible letterboxers let me know. Irresponsible 
  ones just fill up my logbook for their own reasons, and never let me know that 
  they found the box. I'm sorry, but I think that's rude. What if that original 
  box at Cranmere Pool had sat in that spot for 150 years and no one ever picked 
  up a postcard and reported the find, would we be letterboxing 
  today?<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,

  heard anyone mention the fact that back in the "good ol' days"<br/>&gt; there 
  was no such thing as logging finds online and no one thought it was a<br/>&gt; 
  social faux pas NOT to contact the placer. A finder typically ONLY<br/>&gt; 
  contacted a placer if there was an issue with the box (like a full 
  logbook)<br/>&gt; or if it gave such amazing pleasure in the find that they had 
  to share the<br/>&gt; story. And even in the case of great pleasure, they often 
  wrote sitreps or<br/>&gt; public notes on lists such as this to encourage 
  others to also experience<br/>&gt; that particular box. Otherwise, it was left 
  as a pleasant surprise for<br/>&gt; planters to go and check their boxes 
  periodically and discover all the log<br/>&gt; entries. And I have to say, I so 
  greatly enjoyed the process of<br/>&gt; periodically driving 50 miles to check 
  my first box to see "if" there had<br/>&gt; been anyone there, and after seven 
  months, discovering it had indeed been<br/>&gt; found. It was far more 
  thrilling to me to discover the stamps with my own<br/>&gt; eyes than to get a 
  computer-generated message saying it had been found.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And as a 
  thought, NOT getting rote reports of finds encourages planters to<br/>&gt; do 
  regular box maintenance instead of relying on someone to tell them 
  when<br/>&gt; there is a problem. I've decided I'm going to turn notifications 
  off so I<br/>&gt; don't continue to fall into the trap of assuming a "found" 
  report is good<br/>&gt; enough to indicate my boxes are in good shape.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Now the thinking is that an online log is a requirement of the game, 
  and if<br/>&gt; someone doesn't log it online they are being rude. I personally 
  have<br/>&gt; recorded my finds online because it makes placers happy, but it 
  also winds<br/>&gt; up creating a count for me, which I don't personally like. 
  I am not in<br/>&gt; letterboxing for the quantity, I'm in it for the quality. 
  You will see<br/>&gt; "most" of my finds logged, but in recent months I have 
  quit online logging<br/>&gt; because it ruins a small part of the game for 
  me.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I hate that potential finders see the lack of online 
  logging as a problem to<br/>&gt; them because they are missing out on a bit of 
  the art and mystery of the<br/>&gt; game. For my own part, I don't ever look at 
  recent finds or how many folks<br/>&gt; have found a box before I go boxing (I 
  do on occasion after I return)<br/>&gt; because I am virtually certain that 
  even if the box isn't there, I will<br/>&gt; enjoy my trip out and may very 
  well find something serendipitous and<br/>&gt; surprising will happen along the 
  way (and I am almost never wrong).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I hate that technology has 
  become such an integral part of letterboxing.<br/>&gt; I've said it many times 
  before, and I'll say it again, I like<br/>&gt; letterboxing.<wbr>org because it 
  is nothing more or less than a repository of<br/>&gt; clues - being a data 
  hound at heart, I could spend hours of wasted time on<br/>&gt; AQ measuring and 
  determining which boxes are most worthy of my time and<br/>&gt; which ones I 
  should pass on by. I spend far too much time on the computer<br/>&gt; in my 
  job, in scouting, and in basic life to want to spend even more time on<br/>&gt; 
  the computer in letterboxing. It is my escape from the computer. If I<br/>&gt; 
  wanted a tech-driven game, I'd probably enjoy geocaching more.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; All of this to say, I have nothing against anyone that who prefers 
  all the<br/>&gt; tech-parts of the game. I think AQ is a wondrous system, but 
  it isn't for<br/>&gt; me. I also think it is a great tool that becomes too much 
  of a crutch for<br/>&gt; some folks. BUT - before everyone starts getting all 
  legalistic about<br/>&gt; online logging, realize there are some very good 
  reasons NOT to log online.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My .02,<br/>&gt;

                    <html><body><p>Well - what I said are pretty much my true feelings. I really, really don't like online logging for a number of reasons, but for a long time I've done it because I know it makes so many placers happy to see online log entries. I have to confess though, if I log online, I'm a lot less likely to write a personal note to the placer. It might be something like "nice location" or "liked the stamp", but hardly personal. And if the online log entries I receive are any indication, I'm not the only one that falls into this lackluster approach. <br/>
<br/>As I referred back to "the old days", I mentioned that many times folks were likely to only write an emailed note if there was a problem or if they really enjoyed the find, but you know - as I think back about it and look back through old email and logbooks, I knew about a lot more of my finders than I do now. Puddle Splasher mentioned 2.95 log entries for every reported find. Back then, it was more like 1.8 log entries to each note from finder. Interesting isn't it? A higher rate of contact when there weren't easy means of contact? Of course, back then boxes were also few and far between so most of us were eternally grateful for each and every find and every find was a treat and the much lower numbers of boxes and placers certainly would impact what goes into that ratio. <br/>
<br/>But as MO5 mentioned, there's a difference between sending a note and online logging. I'm a lot more likely than not to send a note if I don't log online. Also, I recall several occasions when I wrote to the placer or received notes from the finder that mentioned there weren't but 4 or 5 pages left in a logbook, as opposed to what we see far more often with an online log report when the log is already full. I've just made a decision to be a more personal person by NOT logging online and going back to making the effort to make a personal contact instead.<br/>
<br/>As to the first placement, I get what you're saying BootsTex, and appreciate your need for that feedback and that's why I log even though I disagree with it. That ain't how I'm wired though. I like receiving a personal note that says something of substance, but a "found" notice doesn't do it for me. And yes, I really enjoyed checking my first box every few weeks and waiting for the first finder - it meant that we had an opportunity to get out and go for a good hike in a park we really liked, saw something new and different on every trip, had funny things happening in the family along the way, great conversations, getting a chance to observe the seasons in the same place as they progressed, and finally, discovering those first log entries. Some of those things might have happened on different forays, but some of them were borne of the familiarity of the frequent trip.<br/>
<br/>Even still, I try to always write a new placer because I want to encourage them, or contact a placer of an out-of-the-way box because I know it isn't easy to check them. And if I am going to write, I'm going to find something nice to say.<br/>
<br/>I think online logging causes the following problems:<br/><br/>1) People see it as all automated, so it is more difficult for them to see through to the person behind the box, and it is easier to write something critical or unkind without considering the work and effort that went into a box.<br/>
2) Potential finders put too much credence on the find history and sometimes don't realize that a find report is only as good as the experience the moment the last finder left the box.<br/>3) More emphasis is placed on numbers because they are viewable online, so that folks who are insecure about their low numbers or who are trying to get their found numbers up so they can get to the boxes with minimum finds are more likely to report fake finds (come on now, we all know it happens!)<br/>
4) Relying on others to tell me my box's condition doesn't take the place of box maintenance. Reports are an indicator, not a guarantee. My standard may not be the same as someone else's. They may not know the condition the box is supposed to be in. It's my responsibility to do my own box maintenance with the help of placers who give reports and minor first aid, but their efforts should not replace my own. <br/>
<br/>And finally, harsh as this sounds, I really don't find making life easy on newbies to be a good reason to do some things. There are so many things about letterboxing that pit boxers against the odds, that it takes a really special personality to stick with it, even if we do spoon feed them, and I think the spoon feeding gives them an untrue expectation that everything should be automatic and that there is a formula for everything. What I DO see as an effective means of bringing newbies in and encouraging them is mentoring them and helping them learn their way around all the random obstacles that get thrown out in front of a letterboxer. More of a one-on-one approach than a dumbing down the systems approach (and I know that's not what you are suggesting, but I think that's one of the problems with online logging). <br/>
<br/>And for me and many other letterboxers, letterboxing is a means of slowing down life to an enjoyable pace. I run far too hard and long and try to cram too much stuff into too little time in my real life and my computer facilitates that so I want to kick my computer out of letterboxing as much as I can. Letterboxing gives me an opportunity to be me and the planter vs the elements in finding a box. While I love the social aspect of the game, I don't rely heavily on the opinions or experiences of others to fulfill myself in letterboxing. I enjoy stepping out into the field with nothing but my own skills and experiences to help me work with those of the placer to have a meeting of the minds at the box. If I spent too much time stewing over online logs and worrying about who found what and when and how many, it would take a lot of that pleasure away. My experience may well be (and very likely will be) different than theirs and besides that, I've had some cooler experiences letterboxing when I DIDN'T find the box than when I did, so what might I miss out on if I only went for the "guaranteed" finds?<br/>
<br/>SO - long story short, No I wasn't playing devil's advocate (althought I DO love that role sometimes!). But I was angling against online logging, not against contacting the placer. <br/><br/>I have to take Trail Whale home right now, but I'll be back in about three hours and I'll write up my day yesterday as a sitrep and write to the placers of the boxes we found. It was a really good letterboxing day, even though I missed the gathering!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">But doesn't logging online make contacting the placer easier?  When you log a find online, you are given an opportunity to contact the placer, whether it's on LbNA or AQ.  I had rather get a "found" notice with no personal comment than no notice at all.  That's all I'm saying.  At least I know that if someone found the box, it's still there.  The name "letterboxing" actually came from the practice of the finder notifying the placer by sending a postcard (placing it in the letterbox, which is British for mailbox), so notification is a traditional part of the game.<br>

                    <html><body><p>Well if you want to get right down to comparing American letterboxing to the British game, there is very little about the American game that is like the original British game. The original game had nothing to do with stamps or logbooks, or computers or anything else!<br/>
<br/>I really don't care to receive found notices. It doesn't bother me to get them, but they don't mean a thing to me. I've gotten found notices that have no log entries corresponding with them, making me wonder if they really even found my box, or if they found it but didn't have a stamp, or recorded the find on the wrong box, or ???? <br/>
<br/>I would love to hear if something interesting or even alarming happened while finding my box, or if the box needs me to check it, but just a "found"? Nahhhh...don't bother sending those on my boxes unless YOU (the broader you, not You BT) really need it to record your find in your online logbook or it makes you feel like you've finished the deal. I don't want to get in the way of someone else playing the game in a way that works for them, so if online logging makes the finder happy, then "Log on Baby!", but don't go out of your way on my account. <br/>
<br/>Going back to the comparison to the British game, do you think folks really just wrote "found" on a card and mailed it to the placer? That time period in British history was a time of courteous communication, very formal, proper to a fault. Writing "Found" on a card and mailing it off hardly would fit in the style of the time and in fact would probably be considered rude. It was much more likely to be a personal note thanking the person for adding some surprising little twist to the afternoon's sojourn on the moor. <br/>
<br/>Yes, online logging makes it easier to contact the placer, but easier isn't always better. <br/><br/>And again, it isn't the communication I object to (well - I'm not real crazy about "found"), it's the creation of an online log. And it's not hitting the "Contact the Placer" button to communicate with the placer that I object to either, but the fact that an online log is created for all to see. There are so many ways for that log to be wrong, and yet future finders use that as a crutch to decide whether to go look for a box or whether it is worthy of being found. It takes some of the mystery out of the game, the sense of surprise and serendipity that comes with heading out to see if you can find the treasure, and to make matters the very worst, it might lead them in the wrong direction and they miss out on a great box because it hasn't been found in quite a long time or there were erroneous entries in the online log. <br/>
<br/>I'm an accountant by education and years of practice. There is nothing impromptu about an accountant, nothing spontaneous, no "go for the gusto". Wouldn't you love to have an accountant making investment decisions on your retirement fund based on which mutual fund has a cool name or is based somewhere they've always wanted to go? (And given the current economic climate, I'm sure many of you are wondering if that IS how your financial people made their decisions) When I practiced my profession, I enjoyed the feeling of knowing that I had as many variables defined as I possibly could and I could virtually predict the outcome before the outset ever began. That's how a lot of folks are in their professions - they are so proficient at them that there is no wondering how things will go because they already know.<br/>
<br/>Letterboxing is a way to break out of that rut and do something that takes you out of your comfort zone. It feels so stinking good to just go for it - no analysis, no cost/benefit calculations, no risk determinations (okay, I do some risk determinations, but those are when my feet hit the ground and I look around at what I'm up against, not when I am trying to figure out which boxes to go find) - just grab some clues and my backpack and see what I can come up with. If I were to spend any time evaluating past finds, that feeling of independence and self-sufficiency would be gone for me.<br/>
<br/>The only reason I spoke up to begin with was that it seemed the tides were growing toward "one MUST log online or be considered inconsiderate". Not saying anyone said that, but it was headed that way, and I wanted to voice my very personal feelings about the topic to demonstrate a different point of view from someone who is not usually rude or inconsiderate. <br/>
<br/>I have never spoken this specifically about the topic because I know how important online logging is to many people and I don't want them to feel that I think badly of them for that. That's how they play the game, and since they like it that way, I'll just continue to glance at the little "found" notices and delete them. No sweat to me, at least not until I'm considered rude for NOT logging online. <br/>
<br/>However, I would really love it if by reading my thoughts on the topic, one online log reader said "you know, I think I'll try going boxing just once without looking at the online logs." And then, I hope they discover why it gives me the pleasure it does to NOT look at those. But if that doesn't happen, I'm good with that too. One of the things I really like about letterboxing and it's minimalist approach to rules is that it allows many, many people to get what they need from the game without seriously stepping on the toes of others who are getting what THEY need from the game in a different way.<br/>

<p>But doesn't logging online make contacting the placer easier?  When you log a find online, you are given an opportunity to contact the placer, whether it's on LbNA or AQ.  I had rather get a "found" notice with no personal comment than no notice at all.  That's all I'm saying.  At least I know that if someone found the box, it's still there.  The name "letterboxing" actually came from the practice of the finder notifying the placer by sending a postcard (placing it in the letterbox, which is British for mailbox), so notification is a traditional part of the game.</p>

&gt; Well - what I said are pretty much my true feelings.  I really, really don't<br/>
&gt; like online logging for a number of reasons, but for a long time I've done<br/>
&gt; it because I know it makes so many placers happy to see online log entries.<br/>
&gt; I have to confess though, if I log online, I'm a lot less likely to write a<br/>
&gt; personal note to the placer.  It might be something like "nice location" or<br/>
&gt; "liked the stamp", but hardly personal.  And if the online log entries I<br/>
&gt; receive are any indication, I'm not the only one that falls into this<br/>
&gt; lackluster approach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As I referred back to "the old days", I mentioned that many times folks were<br/>
&gt; likely to only write an emailed note if there was a problem or if they<br/>
&gt; really enjoyed the find, but you know - as I think back about it and look<br/>
&gt; back through old email and logbooks, I knew about a lot more of my finders<br/>
&gt; than I do now.  Puddle Splasher mentioned 2.95 log entries for every<br/>
&gt; reported find.  Back then, it was more like 1.8 log entries to each note<br/>
&gt; from finder.  Interesting isn't it?  A higher rate of contact when there<br/>
&gt; weren't easy means of contact?  Of course, back then boxes were also few and<br/>
&gt; far between so most of us were eternally grateful for each and every find<br/>
&gt; and every find was a treat and the much lower numbers of boxes and placers<br/>
&gt; certainly would impact what goes into that ratio.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But as MO5 mentioned, there's a difference between sending a note and online<br/>
&gt; logging.  I'm a lot more likely than not to send a note if I don't log<br/>
&gt; online.  Also, I recall several occasions when I wrote to the placer or<br/>
&gt; received notes from the finder that mentioned there weren't but 4 or 5 pages<br/>
&gt; left in a logbook, as opposed to what we see far more often with an online<br/>
&gt; log report when the log is already full.  I've just made a decision to be a<br/>
&gt; more personal person by NOT logging online and going back to making the<br/>
&gt; effort to make a personal contact instead.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As to the first placement, I get what you're saying BootsTex, and appreciate<br/>
&gt; your need for that feedback and that's why I log even though I disagree with<br/>
&gt; it.  That ain't how I'm wired though.  I like receiving a personal note that<br/>
&gt; says something of substance, but a "found" notice doesn't do it for me.  And<br/>
&gt; yes, I really enjoyed checking my first box every few weeks and waiting for<br/>
&gt; the first finder - it meant that we had an opportunity to get out and go for<br/>
&gt; a good hike in a park we really liked, saw something new and different on<br/>
&gt; every trip, had funny things happening in the family along the way, great<br/>
&gt; conversations, getting a chance to observe the seasons in the same place as<br/>
&gt; they progressed, and finally, discovering those first log entries.  Some of<br/>
&gt; those things might have happened on different forays, but some of them were<br/>
&gt; borne of the familiarity of the frequent trip.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Even still, I try to always write a new placer because I want to encourage<br/>
&gt; them, or contact a placer of an out-of-the-way box because I know it isn't<br/>
&gt; easy to check them.  And if I am going to write, I'm going to find something<br/>
&gt; nice to say.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think online logging causes the following problems:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1) People see it as all automated, so it is more difficult for them to see<br/>
&gt; through to the person behind the box, and it is easier to write something<br/>
&gt; critical or unkind without considering the work and effort that went into a<br/>
&gt; box.<br/>
&gt; 2) Potential finders put too much credence on the find history and sometimes<br/>
&gt; don't realize that a find report is only as good as the experience the<br/>
&gt; moment the last finder left the box.<br/>
&gt; 3) More emphasis is placed on numbers because they are viewable online, so<br/>
&gt; that folks who are insecure about their low numbers or who are trying to get<br/>
&gt; their found numbers up so they can get to the boxes with minimum finds are<br/>
&gt; more likely to report fake finds (come on now, we all know it happens!)<br/>
&gt; 4) Relying on others to tell me my box's condition doesn't take the place of<br/>
&gt; box maintenance.  Reports are an indicator, not a guarantee.   My standard<br/>
&gt; may not be the same as someone else's.  They may not know the condition the<br/>
&gt; box is supposed to be in.  It's my responsibility to do my own box<br/>
&gt; maintenance with the help of placers who give reports and minor first aid,<br/>
&gt; but their efforts should not replace my own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, harsh as this sounds, I really don't find making life easy on<br/>
&gt; newbies to be a good reason to do some things.  There are so many things<br/>
&gt; about letterboxing that pit boxers against the odds, that it takes a really<br/>
&gt; special personality to stick with it, even if we do spoon feed them, and I<br/>
&gt; think the spoon feeding gives them an untrue expectation that everything<br/>
&gt; should be automatic and that there is a formula for everything.  What I DO<br/>
&gt; see as an effective means of bringing newbies in and encouraging them is<br/>
&gt; mentoring them and helping them learn their way around all the random<br/>
&gt; obstacles that get thrown out in front of a letterboxer.  More of a<br/>
&gt; one-on-one approach than a dumbing down the systems approach (and I know<br/>
&gt; that's not what you are suggesting, but I think that's one of the problems<br/>
&gt; with online logging).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And for me and many other letterboxers, letterboxing is a means of slowing<br/>
&gt; down life to an enjoyable pace.  I run far too hard and long and try to cram<br/>
&gt; too much stuff into too little time in my real life and my computer<br/>
&gt; facilitates that so I want to kick my computer out of letterboxing as much<br/>
&gt; as I can.  Letterboxing gives me an opportunity to be me and the planter vs<br/>
&gt; the elements in finding a box.  While I love the social aspect of the game,<br/>
&gt; I don't rely heavily on the opinions or experiences of others to fulfill<br/>
&gt; myself in letterboxing.  I enjoy stepping out into the field with nothing<br/>
&gt; but my own skills and experiences to help me work with those of the placer<br/>
&gt; to have a meeting of the minds at the box.  If I spent too much time stewing<br/>
&gt; over online logs and worrying about who found what and when and how many, it<br/>
&gt; would take a lot of that pleasure away.  My experience may well be (and very<br/>
&gt; likely will be) different than theirs and besides that, I've had some cooler<br/>
&gt; experiences letterboxing when I DIDN'T find the box than when I did, so what<br/>
&gt; might I miss out on if I only went for the "guaranteed" finds?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SO - long story short, No I wasn't playing devil's advocate (althought I DO<br/>
&gt; love that role sometimes!).  But I was angling against online logging, not<br/>
&gt; against contacting the placer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have to take Trail Whale home right now, but I'll be back in about three<br/>
&gt; hours and I'll write up my day yesterday as a sitrep and write to the<br/>
&gt; placers of the boxes we found.  It was a really good letterboxing day, even<br/>
&gt; though I missed the gathering!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with Black Widow's post so much.  For us, it's a cheaper pastime than shopping and movies, and it often gets us out of town and neighborhood.  To me, the recent finds indicate wether or not to box an area.  Farther boxing with greater probability of missing boxes?  Closer boxing, same possibility?  Of course, it really all comes down to what's in our wallets.  I know it's not required, and it shouldn't be.  Too many hard rules takes the fun out of nearly anything.  But it's sometimes very helpful, depending on your hunter.<br>
<br>
As for the "good old days"...well, if it wasn't for the internet, I probably wouldn't have most of the hobbies that I do, including this one.  Technology plays into a lot of our fun, probably due because we're a bunch of Dadgum Young Hoodlums (TM).  :P  I like letterboxing because I can take something off the internet and bring it into play IRL.<br>
