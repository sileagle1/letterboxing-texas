<br/>
just wanted to share with you my recent notable<br/>
moment, which is that i have placed my 10th box.  <br/>
<br/>
i did not really set out to place what seems like kind<br/>
of a lot to me, but i think the placing part is great<br/>
fun, so i've just been going along and doing it and<br/>
suddenly i noticed, hey, wow, that's kind of neat! 10!<br/>
 and, i was more pleased than usual with how the stamp<br/>
came out, too, so that was nice icing.<br/>
<br/>
anyway, it is called Glass Castles.  <br/>
(#9, also new, is called Marvels)<br/>
<br/>
happy hunting!<br/>
<br/>
