<br>
Could be that the sender didn't realize how the system worked - i.e.,<br>
thought that perhaps the notice was going to LbNA for site update<br>
purposes only and not to the boxer who placed the box...?<br>
<br>
I don't think you're being overly sensitive; I know getting that kind<br>
of message would bother me, too.<br>
<br>
Is there anyone handy who can check on the box?  We probably won't be<br>
in the Fredericksburg area any time before the end of the year, but in<br>
case we are, I'll let you know and we'll arrange to check on the box<br>
if no one else gets there first.<br>

That way, you can know that they were in or not in the right place.  Aside from that, though, is there anyone locally that can check for you?<br/><br/>Good luck,<br/>Janet<br/>

is missing, but I would appreciate a confirmation.  I don't suspect <br>
foul play.  I'm sure we've all gotten notices marked <br>
simply "attempted" with no other explanation and that leaves you <br>
wondering.  That happened to one of my boxes a while back and I <br>
contacted the boxer, who was new to the game.  I was told that they <br>
had my box on their list to find in a park with other boxes, but they <br>
ran out of time and didn't get around to actually looking for mine. <br>
It was just a matter of being new and not understanding the <br>
implications of the word "attempted".<br>
