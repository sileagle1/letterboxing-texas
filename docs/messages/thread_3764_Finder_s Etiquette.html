Could be that the sender didn't realize how the system worked - i.e.,<br/>
thought that perhaps the notice was going to LbNA for site update<br/>
purposes only and not to the boxer who placed the box...?<br/>
<br/>
I don't think you're being overly sensitive; I know getting that kind<br/>
of message would bother me, too.<br/>
<br/>
Is there anyone handy who can check on the box?  We probably won't be<br/>
in the Fredericksburg area any time before the end of the year, but in<br/>
case we are, I'll let you know and we'll arrange to check on the box<br/>
if no one else gets there first.<br/>

That way, you can know that they were in or not in the right place.  Aside from that, though, is there anyone locally that can check for you?<br/><br/>Good luck,<br/>Janet<br/>

<p><span>Fredericksburg is on my short list of “places to letterbox”.

on it for you.  The clues seem very straightforward and it looks like a
lovely place to visit.  I’ll let you know what I find if someone
doesn’t get there before me.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

my guess is that it is someone very new to letterboxing.  Anyone who has
been doing this for any length of time (or planted a box themselves) would see
the 1000 pitfalls in such a message.  So I bet it was more a question of understandable
ignorance than bad form. Just my $.02.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

is missing, but I would appreciate a confirmation.  I don't suspect <br/>
foul play.  I'm sure we've all gotten notices marked <br/>
simply "attempted" with no other explanation and that leaves you <br/>
wondering.  That happened to one of my boxes a while back and I <br/>
contacted the boxer, who was new to the game.  I was told that they <br/>
had my box on their list to find in a park with other boxes, but they <br/>
ran out of time and didn't get around to actually looking for mine. <br/>
It was just a matter of being new and not understanding the <br/>
implications of the word "attempted".<br/>

doing this<br/>
&gt; for any length of time (or planted a box themselves) would see the <br/>

&gt; That's very kind of you, AnnaBee. I wouldn't be surpised if the box <br/>
&gt; is missing, but I would appreciate a confirmation.  I don't suspect <br/>
&gt; foul play.  I'm sure we've all gotten notices marked <br/>
&gt; simply "attempted" with no other explanation and that leaves you <br/>
&gt; wondering.  That happened to one of my boxes a while back and I <br/>
&gt; contacted the boxer, who was new to the game.  I was told that they <br/>
&gt; had my box on their list to find in a park with other boxes, but they <br/>
&gt; ran out of time and didn't get around to actually looking for mine. <br/>
&gt; It was just a matter of being new and not understanding the <br/>
&gt; implications of the word "attempted".<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can only speculate why someone would send such a message - my <br/>

&gt; &gt; that it is someone very new to letterboxing.  Anyone who has been <br/>
