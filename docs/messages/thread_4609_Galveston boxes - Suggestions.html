I guess at the very least we should use Lock 'n Lock boxes as opposed to the ones that don't have latches, and think about taking a rock or something to weigh them down with.  She mentioned the use of magnets so a box could be placed in a sheltered place.  Let's think about that.  Any suggestions?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That would be interesting, but would you have to carry a wrench to open it? :) Seriously, I've seen a lot of your boxes that were plastic jars with screw-on lids and they seem to work fine. But, they too require that the last boxer screw the lid on tightly.  I have seen a couple of boxes (not yours) with screw-on lids that were placed upside down and therefore are wet inside.  I think in those cases the water would run down around the threads and, over time, seep inside.  If the same jar were placed upright, water would drip off the lid.  I think you hang most of those from the lid for that reason.  Of course, Galveston isn't a forest, so what works in the woods may not work in the sand dunes.  Also, oleander is poisonous, and there's a lot of it in Galveston, so be careful of that.<br>

I know that Lionsmane (from Santa Fe) that many of you have met at the texas gathering has placed an underwater (in a river) box [not sure of the name] but it's a lockNlock inside a larger lockNlock with a big rock on top. he said the outer box didn't have any water inside it, much less  the inner.<br>

sounds cool!<br>
