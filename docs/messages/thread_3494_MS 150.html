weekend from Houston to Austin, TX.  <br>
<br>
He was really tired this morning and said he couldn't cut the grass<br>
tho tried to start twice.  I told him that it would be there and his<br>
neighbors wouldn't complain.<br>
<br>
The head wind he was riding into kept him in long pants and long<br>
sleeves this time but he did like doing it.  <br>
<br>
Thank you for your well wishes.<br>

                    <html><body><div>I went bike riding Saturday. I know about wind. I swear, which ever way we headed, the wind was coming towards us. What's up with that? I had to get off and walk a couple of times. My Dear Husband offered to walk the bike for me.

It was worth the pain and gasping of air.</div> <div> </div> <div>My ride was two hours long and only involved a few miles. I bet your son felt like he was on cloud nine when he finished.
