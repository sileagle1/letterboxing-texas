<div>Typically in the winter we don't have burn bans, but it's been so dry that the bans haven't been lifted from summer in some places this year.  This has been an unusual year - from the 100-year-deluge in the spring to burn bans in the winter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As far as next weekend, Frogkisses, I just called the park and there is NOT a burn ban in the Bastrop South Shore right now.  Tell your kids they can cook their hearts out!  And speaking of - something fun for kids to cook over a fire is biscuits on a stick.  Get cheap biscuits and roll them into long ropes between your palms.  Twist them around the stick like a snake, and hold 'em over the fire until they are brown on the outside.  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear that.  It just wouldn't be the same without a campfire <br>
and I hope some of you will come to ours that Saturday night to swap <br>
stories.  I hope to bring the fixings for brown bears (the biscuit on <br>
a stick BL mentions), but I add butter and a sugar-cinnamon mix to it <br>
after cooking.  Baby Bear has various techniques that are fun to <br>
watch, though not necessarily good to eat (black bears, grizzly <br>
bears, etc.).  I can't believe it is only 1 week away!<br>
