Many of us have non-letterboxing spouses.  Ruby<br/>
Tuesday has possibly the best non-boxing spouse,<br/>
Stillwater, of all of us - he is very good-natured<br/>
about keeping up with her and indulgent in her whims<br/>
and he reaches tall boxes and even apparently wound up<br/>
in the ER recently with a dose of poison ivy after one<br/>
of their outings.<br/>
<br/>
Ruby coined the phrase, LSS, for those non-boxing<br/>
spouses who smile in spite of all we ask them to do<br/>
and never complain about having to go along on our<br/>
ventures.  LSS stands for Long-Suffering Spouse and<br/>
when I hear the term it give me warm fuzzies because<br/>
these are folks who could stay home and fuss about us<br/>
doing what we do, but they go along in spite of the<br/>
elements, the environment, and everything else.<br/>
<br/>
My own LSS, Fearless Fox, is great too - although I<br/>
suspect he's actually come over to our side of the<br/>
fence.  He hasn't yet popped up in the morning and<br/>
said "Let's go letterboxing", but I think the moment<br/>
may be at hand soon.  But if not, that's okay, because<br/>
if I jump up and say it, he'll be gladly loading the<br/>
car before I know it!<br/>
