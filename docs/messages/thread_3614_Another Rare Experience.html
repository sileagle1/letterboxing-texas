                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, i already told all of you about my chance encounter with an 8 <br>
week old white siberian tiger and how i actually got to pet him.  well <br>
yesterday, my mom (CC Giraffe) and I went to Tennessee Colony to plant <br>
some boxes and when we pulled up to the Beaver Pond at Gus Engeling <br>
Wildlife Management Area, there was a boat on the pond which I thought <br>
was unusual, and then when we got out of the truck we noticed that <br>
they had captured about 6-7 turtles and had them in a cage.  well we <br>
went on and placed the 6 boxes i had for this trail and when we got <br>
back the men were at their trucks and had a 4 foot long alligator <br>
taped up and attached to a board on one of the trucks.  we thought <br>
this was odd and asked what they were doing (one of the trucks was a <br>
texas parks and wildlife truck)  come to find out, they were checking <br>
the reptiles in the pond to see what they were eating.  so being a <br>
biology teacher i had to ask if i could possibly touch the alligator.  <br>
to my surprise they said yes.  so not only was i able to touch a white <br>
siberian tiger cub but then i got to pet a 4 foot long alligator.  all <br>
of this in a week's time...what a blast...i cant wait to see what i <br>
get to pet next..<br>
