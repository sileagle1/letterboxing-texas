                    <html><body><div>I think it's so easy to get around that particular requirement that it doesn't make sense to do it, and in fact, it encourages dishonesty. All someone has to do is log enough finds to reach the threshhold, and then all those false finds skew other boxes and create other problems. And yes, this DOES happen!</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you are wanting to limit access to a particular box, I think it's far more effective to list the box, then ask that finders to contact you for the clues. A little sleuthwork on your part andsome polite conversation with the potential finder has the same effect as hiding a box behind an F count requirement. You can even diplomatically write in your listing that your box is intended as a reward for boxers who have found at least "xx" boxes, and invite them to contact you when they reach that mark. One thing this does is actually let them know that box is there (using the AQ minimum find feature, they can't even see it) and gives them something to shoot for. It's also a more upfront and honest way to do what you want to do. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I realize it puts the burden of trusting someone on you, the planter, but the same people who would not honor your request to wait to ask for the box until they've found the number are the ones who would log a bunch of falsefinds so they could get boxes that have a minimum F count requirement, so what are you gaining or losing by being upfront about it?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, using the minimum F count feature forces people to log their finds on AQ if they are going to find your hidden boxes. There are several notable finders who don't log finds there, and some who don't even use AQ. Would you really want to miss out on some nice stamps in your logbook?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I've had a few boxes I've wanted to protect by limiting access, and it has worked very well by havingfinders contact me directly for the clues. I've declined to share my clues on a few occasions for a variety of reasons, but I've always managed to find a way to be kind in doing so and the finders either understand and come back later at a more appropriate time, or they've dropped out of the game before the timing became better. I'm also able to emphasize to the finderwhy aparticular box is importantto me and ask that they be especially careful when finding it. I believe they have been far more receptive to my direct request than they would have been on a box that suddenly appeared for them to find.</div>

In order to limit traffic to the box and also prevent a foot trail from emerging (one was starting to show before I changed the clue to reflect an F-count), I decided to make it available only to letterboxers who had a little more experience and were therefore more likely to respect the whole idea of being stealthy and leaving no trace. <br/>

For those not familiar with this option, it would basically mean that clues would not be visible to a boxer unless they had found a certain number of boxes already. Pros? Cons? other issues to consider? Those of you who have used this for your boxes, what counts have you used and why? (you can reply off list if you prefer). For those who have seen clues to another's box that uses an F count, is that obvious that you're looking at a box that has a requirement that you've met?<br>

<div></div>
<div>I've been thinking about this today (bored at work) - and I believe that by automating the restrictions and making logging all but automatic, it takes some of the interpersonal communication out of letterboxing, and that in turn makes it much easier for finders to not be accountable for caring for boxes they find. You are much more likely to recover and seal up if you promised the placer you would!</div>

Then, I'd have to decide if there are people out there with less than 10 placements that would want to find my boxes.  Too much deciding.  I guess if I want to choose who finds my letterboxes, I'll have to make them WOM boxes. But then, if someone asked for the clues, I'd have to decide if they were worthy or not. Too much pressure.  I guess I'll pass.  Thanks, anyway, SandiBox.<br>

I wondered why nobody was finding those boxes, until someone asked why I had them listed on LbNA but not on AtlasQuest, and that kind of defeated the purpose of limiting them to finders of 500 or more. Duh! Anyway, I don't use that feature anymore. Now, if they had a way of limiting access to clues by P-count, I might be interested. After you've placed 10 boxes or so, the Golden Rule kind of takes over and you start treating other folk's boxes like you would like for yours to be treated.<br>

For those not familiar with this option, it would basically mean that clues would not be visible to a boxer unless they had found a certain number of boxes already. Pros? Cons? other issues to consider? Those of you who have used this for your boxes, what counts have you used and why? (you can reply off list if you prefer). For those who have seen clues to another's box that uses an F count, is that obvious that you're looking at a box that has a requirement that you've met?<br>

I have mixed feelings about the F count restrictions. I've lost SO many boxes and I know, first hand, that several of those went bye-bye due to newbie error. I like P count restrictions.

<br/>I've been enjoying reading everyone's responses to this well-posed question and I've been thinking on it as I've had time throughout the day. I find it very interesting that at least two folks used the word elitist in the course of this discussion, and both used it in the context of the F or P count minimum, but not with respect to the idea of holding boxes a little closer by restricting the clues. I think I realized why there is a distinction between the two - the arbitrarily set minimum implies that "YOU can't find this box until you've met this standard." Restricting box clues by making them into puzzles or asking finders to request them directly says "I consider this box to be special, so I'm putting a little extra work into it to be careful with it." It leaves control over the clue with the placer, while also allowing the placer the leeway of cutting someone some slack if they want to, whether that means giving them a hint to the puzzle or handing them the clue even if they've only found 44 boxes and not 50, or because they pay the best bribe - whatever. <br/>
<br/>One of the things I have always appreciated about letterboxing is that there is a variety of ways to deliver clues. It means you always have to be on the lookout for angles and options. It allows the finder and the placer to interact creatively while still allowing for friendly civility.<br/>

Hi Everyone,<br>
<br>
Being a "newbie" I have been reading the pro's and con's lately of<br>
having box requirements and I agree on having them for several<br>
reasons...<br>
<br>
On Atlas Quest & LBNA there are 5-7 boxes listed in my immediate area<br>
and I have been working on planting some...  I was wondering though,<br>
since I may not meet the requirement yet to see clues for certain boxes<br>
until I hit a plant or find count how will I know if I'm not planting in<br>
an area that hasn't been filled already with boxes?<br>

Cons? other issues to consider? Those of you who have used this for your<br>
boxes, what counts have you used and why? (you can reply off list if you<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's really why I've even considered restrictions, because of losing so many boxes. Not all (maybe none!) of them are masterpieces, but I've invested a lot of time, energy, and love into creating them. I've planted 30 boxes and as of this morning, realized I've lost TEN of them! To be fair, I don't want to blame newbies for all of that, but I'm often troubled by how many boxes (mine and others) that I find laying out in plain site. <br>
<br>
I'm really torn between leaving boxes wide open for anyone to find and knowing (hoping?) that if anyone, even just one person finds it and enjoys it, it's worth the effort VS. try to ensure it stays around for more people to enjoy.<br>
<br>
I hadn't planned on thinking this hard today! :-)<br>

I had no idea that was even possible or that there were shady letterboxers that would try to get around the system! i thought those folks were all geocachers!!!   JUST KIDDING!! I do like your suggestions for better communication between planter and boxhunter.<br>
<br>
About not logging finds online, I'd also love to hear from folks why they choose not to do this. I don't have time to check on all my boxes every week and often rely on notification from logging to prompt me to check on them. So often I'm surprised by a full logbook or some other maintenance issue that I didn't know about because I didn't think anyone had visited it. <br>
<br>
thanks for a stimulating conversation!<br>

Hi Boots Tex,  Thanks for the warm welcome!  I'm in the Irving area!  If<br>
anyone has a box at one of the local parks and it has restrictions<br>
making it not available to me yet would please let me know just the name<br>
of the park... you can email me off the group if you would prefer...I<br>
just want to make sure I'm not overloading a park with plants.  <br>
Thanks!!<br>

I plant my boxes for everyone to find, but then I put so much effort into my boxes, as everyone does, so it is disappointing when what I'd consider a particularly good carve or logbook is lost. I list my boxes on AQ as well as LBNA and often, just because I'm lazy, I just link my LBNA clues to AQ so I don't have to enter them twice. However, I think it's better NOT to do as I do, but to list the clues on LBNA separately so in case AQ is down, people can still get to the clues on LBNA. Thus.... the F-count feature wouldn't do me any good.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't log my finds on-line, but we DO always contact the placer of every box we find.  The two actions aren't mutually exclusive.  When we started letterboxing, contacting the placer was what you did if you were a conscientious sort - nice but not necessary.  Some placers actually preferred to NOT be notified, since they enjoyed the surprise of seeing who had visited only when they went to check on the box. At that time on-line logging wasn't even an option.<br>
<br>
I also have been surprised when checking some of my boxes - sometimes only 20%-25% of the finders have contacted me (via an email or logging it as a find).  However some people prefer to be secret finders and some just contact placers if there is a maintenance issue.  I certainly don't expect people to log it on-line if they find one of my placements, but do enjoy a quick email from them since that gives me some insight into the status of that particular box.<br>
<br>
Why don't I log on-line?  Because no site lists all the boxes I have found.  I prefer to keep my own spreadsheet that does include all the boxes, regardless of the source of clues.  I've also been able to customize it the way I like, sort it how I like for various purposes and like the fact that it is not a PUBLIC record of where I have been on what day.<br>

I don't have time to check on all my boxes every week and often rely on notification from logging to prompt me to check on them. So often I'm surprised by a full logbook or some other maintenance issue that I didn't know about because I didn't think anyone had visited it. <br>

Contacting the placer is the main thing to me, so a note from the finder is great and often even better than the log. It's nice to know people take the time to let you know they appreciated the adventure or to let you know if there's a problem. What I have trouble with is when people want to find your boxes, but can't afford a the courtesy (and the few seconds it takes) to let you know in whatever way, that they've been there. I can understand too placers enjoying the surprise of finding who's visited. I've just had a few situations where the logbook is full or removed by a finder and they didn't bother to let me know. I had to find out from another finder who unfortunately found it before my check up.<br>

Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] Re: F counts<br>
<br>
I don't log my finds on-line, but we DO always contact the placer of every box we find.  The two actions aren't mutually exclusive.  When we started letterboxing, contacting the placer was what you did if you were a conscientious sort - nice but not necessary.  Some placers actually preferred to NOT be notified, since they enjoyed the surprise of seeing who had visited only when they went to check on the box. At that time on-line logging wasn't even an option.<br>
<br>
I also have been surprised when checking some of my boxes - sometimes only 20%-25% of the finders have contacted me (via an email or logging it as a find).  However some people prefer to be secret finders and some just contact placers if there is a maintenance issue.  I certainly don't expect people to log it on-line if they find one of my placements, but do enjoy a quick email from them since that gives me some insight into the status of that particular box.<br>
<br>
Why don't I log on-line?  Because no site lists all the boxes I have found.  I prefer to keep my own spreadsheet that does include all the boxes, regardless of the source of clues.  I've also been able to customize it the way I like, sort it how I like for various purposes and like the fact that it is not a PUBLIC record of where I have been on what day.<br>

I don't have time to check on all my boxes every week and often rely on notification from logging to prompt me to check on them. So often I'm surprised by a full logbook or some other maintenance issue that I didn't know about because I didn't think anyone had visited it.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">thanks for the explanation. i guess i've seen them before and not realized they had a name! and thanks, BL for the great example! i loved that it was on my home turf - though before i had ever even heard of letterboxing! some of the boxes you mentioned we've found and some, sadly, had already gone missing by the time we got the letterboxing bug.<br>
