                    <html><body><div>I think it's so easy to get around that particular requirement that it doesn't make sense to do it, and in fact, it encourages dishonesty. All someone has to do is log enough finds to reach the threshhold, and then all those false finds skew other boxes and create other problems. And yes, this DOES happen!</div>
<div></div>
<div>If you are wanting to limit access to a particular box, I think it's far more effective to list the box, then ask that finders to contact you for the clues. A little sleuthwork on your part andsome polite conversation with the potential finder has the same effect as hiding a box behind an F count requirement. You can even diplomatically write in your listing that your box is intended as a reward for boxers who have found at least "xx" boxes, and invite them to contact you when they reach that mark. One thing this does is actually let them know that box is there (using the AQ minimum find feature, they can't even see it) and gives them something to shoot for. It's also a more upfront and honest way to do what you want to do. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I realize it puts the burden of trusting someone on you, the planter, but the same people who would not honor your request to wait to ask for the box until they've found the number are the ones who would log a bunch of falsefinds so they could get boxes that have a minimum F count requirement, so what are you gaining or losing by being upfront about it?</div>
<div></div>
<div>Also, using the minimum F count feature forces people to log their finds on AQ if they are going to find your hidden boxes. There are several notable finders who don't log finds there, and some who don't even use AQ. Would you really want to miss out on some nice stamps in your logbook?</div>
<div></div>
<div>I've had a few boxes I've wanted to protect by limiting access, and it has worked very well by havingfinders contact me directly for the clues. I've declined to share my clues on a few occasions for a variety of reasons, but I've always managed to find a way to be kind in doing so and the finders either understand and come back later at a more appropriate time, or they've dropped out of the game before the timing became better. I'm also able to emphasize to the finderwhy aparticular box is importantto me and ask that they be especially careful when finding it. I believe they have been far more receptive to my direct request than they would have been on a box that suddenly appeared for them to find.</div>

&gt; When they first put that feature on AtlasQuest, I thought they were asking me for my personal F-count for some reason, so I placed a few boxes and, since I had found over 500 boxes, I put an F-count of 500 on those boxes. I wondered why nobody was finding those boxes, until someone asked why I had them listed on LbNA but not on AtlasQuest, and that kind of defeated the purpose of limiting them to finders of 500 or more. Duh! Anyway, I don't use that feature anymore. Now, if they had a way of limiting access to clues by P-count, I might be interested. After you've placed 10 boxes or so, the Golden Rule kind of takes over and you start treating other folk's boxes like you would like for yours to be treated.<br/>

<br/>I don't use F-counts or P-counts on my boxes.  If I want to limit the exposure of a certain letterbox, I make the clues a puzzle, code, or some other type of mystery.  The more sensitive the box, the harder the clues.  But that's just me.  :)<br/>

<div>I've been thinking about this today (bored at work) - and I believe that by automating the restrictions and making logging all but automatic, it takes some of the interpersonal communication out of letterboxing, and that in turn makes it much easier for finders to not be accountable for caring for boxes they find. You are much more likely to recover and seal up if you promised the placer you would!</div>

&gt; &gt; When they first put that feature on AtlasQuest, I thought they were asking me for my personal F-count for some reason, so I placed a few boxes and, since I had found over 500 boxes, I put an F-count of 500 on those boxes. I wondered why nobody was finding those boxes, until someone asked why I had them listed on LbNA but not on AtlasQuest, and that kind of defeated the purpose of limiting them to finders of 500 or more. Duh! Anyway, I don't use that feature anymore. Now, if they had a way of limiting access to clues by P-count, I might be interested. After you've placed 10 boxes or so, the Golden Rule kind of takes over and you start treating other folk's boxes like you would like for yours to be treated.<br/>

I have mixed feelings about the F count restrictions. I've lost SO many boxes and I know, first hand, that several of those went bye-bye due to newbie error. I like P count restrictions.

<br/>I've been enjoying reading everyone's responses to this well-posed question and I've been thinking on it as I've had time throughout the day. I find it very interesting that at least two folks used the word elitist in the course of this discussion, and both used it in the context of the F or P count minimum, but not with respect to the idea of holding boxes a little closer by restricting the clues. I think I realized why there is a distinction between the two - the arbitrarily set minimum implies that "YOU can't find this box until you've met this standard." Restricting box clues by making them into puzzles or asking finders to request them directly says "I consider this box to be special, so I'm putting a little extra work into it to be careful with it." It leaves control over the clue with the placer, while also allowing the placer the leeway of cutting someone some slack if they want to, whether that means giving them a hint to the puzzle or handing them the clue even if they've only found 44 boxes and not 50, or because they pay the best bribe - whatever. <br/>
<br/>One of the things I have always appreciated about letterboxing is that there is a variety of ways to deliver clues. It means you always have to be on the lookout for angles and options. It allows the finder and the placer to interact creatively while still allowing for friendly civility.<br/>

Hi Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Being a "newbie" I have been reading the pro's and con's lately of<br/>
having box requirements and I agree on having them for several<br/>
reasons...<br/>
<br/>
On Atlas Quest &amp; LBNA there are 5-7 boxes listed in my immediate area<br/>
and I have been working on planting some...  I was wondering though,<br/>
since I may not meet the requirement yet to see clues for certain boxes<br/>
until I hit a plant or find count how will I know if I'm not planting in<br/>
an area that hasn't been filled already with boxes?<br/>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Being a "newbie" I have been reading the pro's and con's lately of<br/>
&gt; having box requirements and I agree on having them for several<br/>
&gt; reasons...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On Atlas Quest &amp; LBNA there are 5-7 boxes listed in my immediate area<br/>
&gt; and I have been working on planting some...  I was wondering though,<br/>
&gt; since I may not meet the requirement yet to see clues for certain boxes<br/>
&gt; until I hit a plant or find count how will I know if I'm not planting in<br/>
&gt; an area that hasn't been filled already with boxes?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's really why I've even considered restrictions, because of losing so many boxes. Not all (maybe none!) of them are masterpieces, but I've invested a lot of time, energy, and love into creating them. I've planted 30 boxes and as of this morning, realized I've lost TEN of them! To be fair, I don't want to blame newbies for all of that, but I'm often troubled by how many boxes (mine and others) that I find laying out in plain site. <br/>
<br/>
I'm really torn between leaving boxes wide open for anyone to find and knowing (hoping?) that if anyone, even just one person finds it and enjoys it, it's worth the effort VS. try to ensure it stays around for more people to enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
I hadn't planned on thinking this hard today! :-)<br/>

&gt; I have mixed feelings about the F count restrictions.  I've lost SO  <br/>
&gt; many boxes and I know, first hand, that several of those went bye-bye  <br/>
&gt; due to newbie error.  I like P count restrictions.  I agree that once  <br/>
&gt; you've planted a few, and lost them, you tend to have a deeper  <br/>
&gt; appreciation for re-hiding, etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Most of mine are available to everyone.  But for those stamps that  <br/>
&gt; took hours...or even days to carve...I like the insurance.  But I  <br/>
&gt; always give my clues out to anyone that contacts me personally to  <br/>
&gt; request them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm happy to hear that there are still some people that choose not  <br/>
&gt; &gt; to use "F" or "P" count restrictions as invented by AtlasQuest. I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; don't log my finds on-line at any website (maintain my own  <br/>
&gt; &gt; spreadsheet instead) and only use the letterboxing.org site for  <br/>
&gt; &gt; most of my plants. This doesn't mean I don't have a lot of finds  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and plants and doesn't mean I'm not a responsible letterboxer.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; We've been boxing for nearly 6 years, have found over 3,000 boxes  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and planted about 150 boxes, BUT I don't use AQ to publicly record  <br/>
&gt; &gt; this.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks to all of you who still make your clues universally  <br/>
&gt; &gt; available - either through letterboxing.org, or through a method  <br/>
&gt; &gt; that allows me to see a box and contact you for the clues!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are wanting to limit access to a particular box, I think  <br/>
&gt; &gt; it's far<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; more effective to list the box, then ask that finders to contact  <br/>
&gt; &gt; you for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues. A little sleuthwork on your part and some polite  <br/>
&gt; &gt; conversation with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the potential finder has the same effect as hiding a box behind  <br/>
&gt; &gt; an F count<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; requirement. You can even diplomatically write in your listing  <br/>
&gt; &gt; that your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box is intended as a reward for boxers who have found at least  <br/>
&gt; &gt; "xx" boxes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and invite them to contact you when they reach that mark. One  <br/>
&gt; &gt; thing this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; does is actually let them know that box is there (using the AQ  <br/>
&gt; &gt; minimum find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feature, they can't even see it) and gives them something to  <br/>
&gt; &gt; shoot for.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's also a more upfront and honest way to do what you want to do.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I realize it puts the burden of trusting someone on you, the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; planter, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the same people who would not honor your request to wait to ask  <br/>
&gt; &gt; for the box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; until they've found the number are the ones who would log a bunch of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; false finds so they could get boxes that have a minimum F count  <br/>
&gt; &gt; requirement,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so what are you gaining or losing by being upfront about it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, using the minimum F count feature forces people to log  <br/>
&gt; &gt; their finds on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; AQ if they are going to find your hidden boxes. There are several  <br/>
&gt; &gt; notable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; finders who don't log finds there, and some who don't even use  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; you really want to miss out on some nice stamps in your logbook?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I've had a few boxes I've wanted to protect by limiting access,  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and it has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; worked very well by having finders contact me directly for the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues. I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; declined to share my clues on a few occasions for a variety of  <br/>
&gt; &gt; reasons, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've always managed to find a way to be kind in doing so and the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; finders<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; either understand and come back later at a more appropriate time,  <br/>
&gt; &gt; or they've<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dropped out of the game before the timing became better. I'm also  <br/>
&gt; &gt; able to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; emphasize to the finder why a particular box is important to me  <br/>

<br/>
About not logging finds online, I'd also love to hear from folks why they choose not to do this. I don't have time to check on all my boxes every week and often rely on notification from logging to prompt me to check on them. So often I'm surprised by a full logbook or some other maintenance issue that I didn't know about because I didn't think anyone had visited it. <br/>

anyone has a box at one of the local parks and it has restrictions<br/>
making it not available to me yet would please let me know just the name<br/>

<div>I once had a couple of boxes in Irving (Las Colinas) close the Trinity River, but they were lost in the floods of 2007. I know Wagtime and jkokopelli have a few boxes in Irving, but I think they're listed on AQ and LBNA. I don't know of any WOM boxes, but I never think to ask people if they have any so I'm not a good source. I'd say, plant more unless someone contacts you off the list!</div>

&gt; I've been tempted to use this feature from time to time when boxes I know are well-hidden start disappearing (like a few have recently), but it just seems so elitest to me. I plant my boxes for everyone to find, but then I put so much effort into my boxes, as everyone does, so it is disappointing when what I'd consider a particularly good carve or logbook is lost. I list my boxes on AQ as well as LBNA and often, just because I'm lazy, I just link my LBNA clues to AQ so I don't have to enter them twice. However, I think it's better NOT to do as I do, but to list the clues on LBNA separately so in case AQ is down, people can still get to the clues on LBNA. Thus.... the F-count feature wouldn't do me any good.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't log my finds on-line, but we DO always contact the placer of every box we find.  The two actions aren't mutually exclusive.  When we started letterboxing, contacting the placer was what you did if you were a conscientious sort - nice but not necessary.  Some placers actually preferred to NOT be notified, since they enjoyed the surprise of seeing who had visited only when they went to check on the box. At that time on-line logging wasn't even an option.<br/>
<br/>
I also have been surprised when checking some of my boxes - sometimes only 20%-25% of the finders have contacted me (via an email or logging it as a find).  However some people prefer to be secret finders and some just contact placers if there is a maintenance issue.  I certainly don't expect people to log it on-line if they find one of my placements, but do enjoy a quick email from them since that gives me some insight into the status of that particular box.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't I log on-line?  Because no site lists all the boxes I have found.  I prefer to keep my own spreadsheet that does include all the boxes, regardless of the source of clues.  I've also been able to customize it the way I like, sort it how I like for various purposes and like the fact that it is not a PUBLIC record of where I have been on what day.<br/>

&gt; About not logging finds online, I'd also love to hear from folks why they choose not to do this. I don't have time to check on all my boxes every week and often rely on notification from logging to prompt me to check on them. So often I'm surprised by a full logbook or some other maintenance issue that I didn't know about because I didn't think anyone had visited it. <br/>

Contacting the placer is the main thing to me, so a note from the finder is great and often even better than the log. It's nice to know people take the time to let you know they appreciated the adventure or to let you know if there's a problem. What I have trouble with is when people want to find your boxes, but can't afford a the courtesy (and the few seconds it takes) to let you know in whatever way, that they've been there. I can understand too placers enjoying the surprise of finding who's visited. I've just had a few situations where the logbook is full or removed by a finder and they didn't bother to let me know. I had to find out from another finder who unfortunately found it before my check up.<br/>

Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] Re: F counts<br/>
<br/>
I don't log my finds on-line, but we DO always contact the placer of every box we find.  The two actions aren't mutually exclusive.  When we started letterboxing, contacting the placer was what you did if you were a conscientious sort - nice but not necessary.  Some placers actually preferred to NOT be notified, since they enjoyed the surprise of seeing who had visited only when they went to check on the box. At that time on-line logging wasn't even an option.<br/>
<br/>
I also have been surprised when checking some of my boxes - sometimes only 20%-25% of the finders have contacted me (via an email or logging it as a find).  However some people prefer to be secret finders and some just contact placers if there is a maintenance issue.  I certainly don't expect people to log it on-line if they find one of my placements, but do enjoy a quick email from them since that gives me some insight into the status of that particular box.<br/>
<br/>
Why don't I log on-line?  Because no site lists all the boxes I have found.  I prefer to keep my own spreadsheet that does include all the boxes, regardless of the source of clues.  I've also been able to customize it the way I like, sort it how I like for various purposes and like the fact that it is not a PUBLIC record of where I have been on what day.<br/>

&gt; About not logging finds online, I'd also love to hear from folks why they choose not to do this. I don't have time to check on all my boxes every week and often rely on notification from logging to prompt me to check on them. So often I'm surprised by a full logbook or some other maintenance issue that I didn't know about because I didn't think anyone had visited it.<br/>

&gt; Sitrep is short for Situation Report.  It's a description of a letterboxing<br/>
&gt; foray.  When there weren't boxes on every street corner, it was a lot more<br/>
&gt; common for boxers to write up.  It was a good way to let everyone know about<br/>
&gt; boxes that were out there, what their conditions were, to share their<br/>
&gt; experience in finding and hopefully entice others to find them as well.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's a link to the sitrep for one of my all-time favorite trips out:<br/>
