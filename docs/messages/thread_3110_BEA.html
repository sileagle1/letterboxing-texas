<div> </div>
<div>BoxDN was a bona fide New Orleans native with all the flavor and energy that includes.  He was fairly new to this list when we were planning the second annual gathering, which was about the time GG was turning up and when boxes started going missing (no connection between those two).  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our own Ruby Tuesday was the common thread through both of those stories, as she was trying to lure and trap Gryzzled Gryphon with her Gryphon Bait box.  That box, and a few others in the DFW area went missing at about the time we were all (with Ruby being the driving force) learning about our roots - some fine ladies that gave boxing a try very early on and often met at a Crescent City Cafe for lunch.  Crescent City Cafe's are apparently known for their beignets, and as used to happen more often on this list, the mention of any food item, and most especially some as scrumptious as beignets had us off on a tangent.  Somehow someone decided the boxes that were missing were somewhere near places that served beignets.  At the same time, folks thought these boxes were disappearing so mysteriously that they must have been beamed up by aliens.  Hence - they MUST be beignet-eating aliens.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And in comes BoxDN - with a style bigger than life!  He promised us (and carried through with it) that he would come to the gathering and prepare authentic beignets for us for breakfast.  They WERE perfectly perfect!  He had also brought with him an alien emissary (a blow-up alien doll) to meet and negotiate the return of our boxes.  He had the emissary prominently displayed at his campsite and later at the gathering site.  Ruby Tuesday and the rest of the Celtic Lions had arranged a marvelous Clue game, with boxes hidden throughout the park to signify all the elements of Clue.  Sadly, the BEA's struck even during the gathering and stole one of the boxes, with no regard to the presence of their own representative.  Diplomatic discussions were called off immediately and the emissary was hung in effigy.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BoxDN also instigated a wild night boxing run through Brazos Bend State Park (known for its alligators) two nights, one of which was horribly stormy but he and Wanda (of Wanda and Pete fame) could sometimes be heard rambling through the woods even in the storm.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BoxDN truly brought a richness of spirit to our gathering that year that we could never replicate on this side of the state line.  Unfortunately, BoxDN was a victim of Katrina, losing his home to flooding and all that went with that tragedy.  Since that time, he has had to make boxing a very low priority, although he occasionally pops up on the Southeast list, but never here.  BoxDN may not be a Texan, but as far as I am concerned, he has a place in the Texas Letterboxers Hall of Fame.  There's always room in my logbooks for his sig stamp!

&gt; &gt; Letterboxing Event when boxes started disappearing, a Beignet <br/>
Eating <br/>
&gt; &gt; Alien was blamed and one was "caught" and hung in effigy. If you <br/>
type <br/>
&gt; &gt; in Beignet Eating Aliens in the message search box on the Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; Letterboxing site, I believe you will find references to such <br/>
&gt; starting <br/>
&gt; &gt; March 7th, 2005 (message #1611). I'm sure there are many more <br/>
&gt; &gt; references if you do a search for BEA. (Part of Texas <br/>
Letterboxing's <br/>
&gt; &gt; young history/lore).<br/>
