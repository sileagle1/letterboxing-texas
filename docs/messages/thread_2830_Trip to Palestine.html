                    <div class="plaintext-content">We took a little day trip yesterday up to Palestine to plant a new <br>
Texas Governors Series box called The Railroad Man. We stopped off <br>
at Moscow on the way to place The Post Man, another Governor.  While <br>
in Palestine, we found Barefoot Lucy's box Columbia of the <br>
Pineywoods and enjoyed a fine lunch at the Ranch House.  Then we <br>
went to Davey Dogwood Park for BFL's Signs of Spring, Baby Bear's <br>
Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking? (hilarious box) and Silver <br>
Eagles's Go Dog Go.  Then, to Elmwood for Blue Butterfly's Elmwood <br>
Gardens and Cuney for Oscar's Lunch (we had already eaten, thank <br>
you).  Came through Jacksonville and picked up JBKokopelli's The <br>
Magnolia and the Cowboy, detoured to Maydelle and found Silver <br>
Eagle's TX RR3.  Then, 2 boxes placed by Dewberry, Shenandoah Shadow <br>
and Still Dreamin', both of which have awsome stamps.  Too many <br>
boxes, not enough time, as usual, but we did what we could.  We <br>
found all the boxes we attempted and all were in great condition.  I <br>
also went out on the Lone Star Trail with Fish Tree recently and he <br>
placed a box called Wishin' I Was Fishin' and I placed one <br>
called "The Lady" was a Tram.  These are both near his box Saint <br>
Hyacinth.  I hope you go sometime and find his boxes.  They're all <br>
fun and his stamps are unique and outstanding.<br>

                    <html><body><div>Sounds like you were very busy! Next time you get around the Jacksonville area, look up my stamp I planted there, A Mother's Love. Its planted at Love's Lookout and I don't think that yall have found any of my other boxes. That is the only one I planted out of the DFW area. I need to get busy and plant some more but I'm a beginner at carving so I have only done a couple. Let me know what you think when and if you find it.
