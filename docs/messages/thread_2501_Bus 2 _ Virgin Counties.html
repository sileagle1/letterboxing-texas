<div> </div>
<div>I've not proven this will work yet, but an idea I have is to use the atlas of Texas historical markers (<a href="http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/">http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/</a>) as a guide to finding places and box ideas in areas I don't know.  You can do a county search of markers and the descriptions include a transcript of the marker itself in a lot of cases.  It might be a way to at least get an idea for a stamp in a particular town or county, even if you can't plant the box AT the marker.  Otherwise, I wind up doing a crazy amount of research on a town and getting so involved in learning about it that I forget what I'm supposed to be doing!

<br/>
We encouraged a similar "populate the counties" project in Wisconsin <br/>
last year. I started publicizing the project mid-year. At that time <br/>
there were boxes in 42 counties and 30 counties without a box. By mid-<br/>
December there was a box in every WI county! (I know Texas is a MUCH <br/>
larger state, so it might take a bit longer!).  We had some help from <br/>
people in neighboring Minnesota who planted boxes in WI counties <br/>
across the border from them.<br/>
<br/>
Since the LBNA webmasters are busy with a variety of things, they <br/>
only update the maps periodically.  I therefore created my own map <br/>
that actually showed the names of the counties and colored in the <br/>
ones that had boxes.  It was a somewhat crudely hand-colored map, but <br/>
I could scan it and update it as soon as a new county was populated.  <br/>
I think it kept up some awareness of the project.  If you want to see <br/>
what it looked like before we had the last county populated, you can <br/>
see it here:  http://letterboxing.homestead.com/WIcounties.html<br/>
<br/>
Good luck!<br/>

<div><span class="453252821-13012007">Well, 
that was an interesting question that required a little research. I'd say that 
there are probably only 40 fairly active boxers/groups in Wisconsin (meaning 
that they find and place boxes more than on a 1-shot basis).  Most of the 
boxers are in the southeast part of the state, generally in the Milwaukee 
area.  There are a few in the the NE and a few in the central part of 
WI.  The western part of the state doesn't seem to have had many boxers at 
all, but a few seem to be emerging recently.  </span></div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007"></span><span class="453252821-13012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007">However when I recently picked up a full logbook it is obvious that there 
are others that have been out finding a few boxes - there are many names I've 
never seen on the message boards or as planters, so it is hard to really say how 
many people are boxing in the state.  </span></div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007">There's a lot of overlap of people in our Great Lakes region, with many 
of us boxing "over the border" and there has been very good turnout at recent 
gatherings in the region (80-120 people), so we generally think of ourselves as 
"Great Lakes" boxers rather than WI boxers.  People from bordering states 
will often also plant boxes across the border.  There are a lot more active 
boxers if we consider the whole region.</span></div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007">I'd 
say the growth has been somewhat steady over the past 3.5 years and we have a 
good variety of boxes.  There are several of us who enjoy some tricky clues 
and mystery boxes, we've placed some ourselves that are 4-9 mile hikes and there 
are some drive-bys.  I'd say that generally most involve at least a bit of 
a walk/hike, not simply jumping out of the car to retrieve the box.  Also 
not many truly urban boxes.</span></div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007">Most 
people in the Great Lakes region (WI, MN, IL, MI, IN, OH) seem to really enjoy 
participating in our regional message board (418 members).  Almost all list 
their clues on LBNA.  A few newer people participate regularly on the 
AtlasQuest boards and also post their boxes on that site.  It is rare in 
this area that a box in this region is posted ONLY on AQ (except when Ryan and 
Amanda from Seattle placed some boxes here recently).</span></div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="453252821-13012007">So, 
that's a summary based on my knowledge of our part of the 
world!</span></div>

<p>Hi!<br/><br/>We encouraged a similar "populate the counties" project in 
  Wisconsin <br/>last year. I started publicizing the project mid-year. At that 
  time <br/>there were boxes in 42 counties and 30 counties without a box. By 
  mid- <br/>December there was a box in every WI county! (I know Texas is a MUCH 
  <br/>larger state, so it might take a bit longer!). We had some help from 
  <br/>people in neighboring Minnesota who planted boxes in WI counties 
  <br/>across the border from them. <br/><br/>Since the LBNA webmasters are busy 
  with a variety of things, they <br/>only update the maps periodically. I 
  therefore created my own map <br/>that actually showed the names of the 
  counties and colored in the <br/>ones that had boxes. It was a somewhat crudely 
  hand-colored map, but <br/>I could scan it and update it as soon as a new 
  county was populated. <br/>I think it kept up some awareness of the project. If 
  you want to see <br/>what it looked like before we had the last county 
  populated, you can <br/>see it here: <a href="http://letterboxing.homestead.com/WIcounties.html" target="_blank">http://letterboxing<wbr/>.homestead.<wbr/>com/WIcounties.<wbr/>html</a><br/><br/>Good

<div>It sounds like in some ways y'all are very comparable relatively to us.  If you were going to tackle a box populating mission again, which direction would y'all go?  I see Michigan has boxes in every county too.  I think I'm surprised to see how many unpopulated counties IL has!  Not so surprising is MN, but then, they are on your western border, and you said the west has had more difficulty...

<div><span class="359082804-14012007">Well, 
MI was a little ahead of us in getting counties populated, but then they started 
a "friendly competition" with us to see who would have all the counties 
populated first.  They won by a few weeks, but I feel we were all winners 
since we all now have more boxes to find!  I'd do the same thing again - 
post a message whenever a new county got a box, with a link to the map and 
encouragement for more planting in the boxless counties if someone would be in 
the area.</span></div>
<div><span class="359082804-14012007"></span> </div>
<div><span class="359082804-14012007">IL has 
a similar situation as WI - most of the boxers are concentrated near the 
largest city in the state.  There has been some talk about another 
competition between IL and IN or MN to see who can get their counties 
filled.  I owe MN a few plants since they helped us 
out.</span></div>

<div><span class="359082804-14012007">I 
really think it is helpful to see a map colored in and see what counties are 
near each other.   I posted regular updates with the map, so people 
could decide if they were heading to an area, what counties were adjacent to 
each other.  That way it worked out that someone could cover 2-5 counties 
at a time.</span></div>

<div><span class="359082804-14012007">I was 
curious, so I did a little more research.  TX is about 4 times as large as 
WI and has 3.5 times as many counties (254 TX counties vs. 72 WI 
counties).  You definitely have a lot bigger project to tackle, although I 
don't know what % are already populated.</span></div>

<div><span class="359082804-14012007">Yeah, 
it can get cold up here, but we've been having a pretty mild winter so 
far.  Only snowed one day in early DEC and melted fairly quickly.  
We've actually had abnormally warm temperatures  (but this doesn't mean it 
is actually WARM).  Luckily this winter I am working on a project that is 
in California, so will be spending a fair amount of time there JAN-MAR.  
Enjoyed some temps in the 60s this week, not to mention palm trees and 
flowers!!</span></div>
