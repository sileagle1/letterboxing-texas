of the woods!  <br>
<br>
Tell me, Sea Dove, were y'all the first finders for<br>
Starry, Starry Night?  I would imagine so, since we<br>
only planted that one October 16th or so, but I'm just<br>
wondering.<br>
<br>
I hate to hear Baby Bear's Tejas was wet - we had<br>
checked it not too terribly long ago and it was in<br>
pretty good shape.  We've had so much rain since that<br>
time though, I guess I'm surprised you didn't run<br>
across more wet boxes.<br>
<br>
Thanks for the update!<br>
