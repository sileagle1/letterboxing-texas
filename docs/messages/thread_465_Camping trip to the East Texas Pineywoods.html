<div> </div>
<div>The Birds of a Feather family have returned from a holiday camping trip to the East Texas Pineywoods area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is an update on boxes:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>11/24/2004</div>
<ul>
<li>Silver Eagle's Spanish Flag - Found in good shape</li>
<li>Baby Bear's Tejas - Bag holding log book had couple inches of water and needed maintenance. Celtic Lions had left some note cards which we stamped in on. I put the notecards and stamp in new bags. I took the log book back to our camper and dried it out.  It is in sad shape. I returned the log book on 11/26/2004 to the box and found that some other boxers had stamped in on Thanksgiving, 11/25.</li></ul>
<p>11/26/2004</p>
<ul>
<li>Baby Bear's Hogg - Found in good shape</li>
<li>Barefoot Lucy and Crew's Starry, Starry Night - Found in good shape</li>
<li>Baby Bear's Stone Celt - We searched around the boardwalk platform but did not find it.</li></ul>
<p>11/27/2004</p>
<ul>
<li>Silver Eagle's Texas RR - The south end of the lake has just been recently cleared of trees.  I found the twin trees and dug through the debris, but did not find the box.</li>
<li>Birds of a Feather Family placed a new letterbox at the Rusk Unit of the Rusk/Palestine State Parks and will have the clues available in a day or so.</li></ul>

of the woods!  <br/>
<br/>
Tell me, Sea Dove, were y'all the first finders for<br/>
Starry, Starry Night?  I would imagine so, since we<br/>
only planted that one October 16th or so, but I'm just<br/>
wondering.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to hear Baby Bear's Tejas was wet - we had<br/>
checked it not too terribly long ago and it was in<br/>
pretty good shape.  We've had so much rain since that<br/>
time though, I guess I'm surprised you didn't run<br/>
across more wet boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the update!<br/>
