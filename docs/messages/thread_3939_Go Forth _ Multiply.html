                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's that time of year again...almost time for JBKokopelli's and Wag Time's<br/>
annual Circle Tour spring break trip.    In 2007, we circled through<br/>
Louisiana and Mississippi and back again.  In 2008, we circled through the<br/>
Texas hill country.  This year, after changing our minds several times,<br/>
we've settled on a tour through the Texas panhandle.  Why?  <br/>
<br/>
Why?  Because a new state map was recently uploaded and JBKokopelli<br/>
interpreted it as a challenge to populate the remaining panhandle counties<br/>
with letterboxes.  We are now faced with the task of researching and<br/>
preparing at least forty boxes for this trip.  Are we nuts?  Absolutely...it<br/>
runs in our family.   We were able to do some research last weekend and came<br/>
up with some great ideas, but we still have a long way to go.<br/>
<br/>
This evening, JBK had the idea of inviting ya'll to help with this<br/>
undertaking and I agreed that it was a brilliant idea.  If you would like to<br/>
prepare a box for the panhandle, we will take it along with us and plant it<br/>
during our trip.   This plan will let more people be involved in the effort<br/>
to populate every Texas county without having to actually do the driving.<br/>
If you are interested, please email us off-list so we can coordinate who's<br/>
doing what/where and avoid overlap.  You can then either mail your box to<br/>
one of us or bring it to TALE (as long as we get it by March 12th).   <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good for you!  That's a worthwhile thing to do.  LSQ and I went out <br/>
in that direction in December, although we never actually got into <br/>
the Panhandle.  From our experience, you have your work cut out for <br/>
you.  Most of the counties in the Panhandle, other than Potter and <br/>
Lubbock, have small popualations and miles and miles of nothing but <br/>
cotton fields and pastures and lots of sand, which moves around a lot <br/>
in March as a rule. Finding a good place to hide a box will indeed be <br/>
a challenge, but one I'm sure you are both up to. On the other hand, <br/>
the northern part of the Panhandle, the canyon lands, hold some of <br/>
the most spectacular scenery in all of Texas.  Good luck and take <br/>
care.<br/>

Just wanted to let you know that Astro D and I are making our way to<br/>
T.A.L.E. 6 and we are planning to plant some boxes in a few of the<br/>
counties that don't have boxes on our way. I have boxes planned for<br/>
Hockley, Scurry, Parmer and Bailey counties. That's four you don't<br/>
have to worry about if you want to spend more time on other counties.<br/>
