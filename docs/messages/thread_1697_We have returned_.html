This will be a short report.  We just got home - made dinner - and I am<br/>
sending this E-mail blast to everyone.<br/>
<br/>
James did arrive safely.  His flight was delayed 36 hours.  So we ended up<br/>
staying longer in Colorado Springs.  But all is well.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you had a hand in making James what he is today.  Some of you also<br/>
contributed parts for his custom sniper rifle.  Well - many of the parts<br/>
you-all sent are still serving proudly.  The only thing he brought home was<br/>
the scope.  The rest was given to some other soldiers just coming in.  James<br/>
hopes you do not mind - the new guys needed them more in Iraq than he needed<br/>
them at Ft. Carson.<br/>
<br/>
James also said the time is quickly approaching when the US will not be<br/>
needed in IRAQ.  The Iraqi Defense force is about ready.  He had some other<br/>
things to tell.  Some of it a bit disturbing.  But none-the-less....  He is<br/>
safely at Ft. Carson.  He will be coming to El Paso soon.  I will keep<br/>
you-all informed.<br/>
<br/>
For now, here is a copy of the award citation he received.  Notice the<br/>
comments from his chain of command.<br/>
<br/>
More to follow.  Good night.  We need a rest from our vacation!<br/>

<br/>
SPC Olbrisch's terrific marksmanship skills were a valuable asset to First<br/>
Platoon, Killer Troop.  SPC Olbrisch took the initiative to help trail his<br/>
peers as well as the junior soldiers on proper marksmanship techniques.  His<br/>
teaching helped many of the soldiers in First Platoon develop the confidence<br/>
and skill that they needed to defeat the enemy.  Additionally, SPC Olbrisch<br/>
volunteered his abilities to help assist on sniper missions aimed at<br/>
interdicting the enemy trying to emplace IEDs on routes in Killer Troop's<br/>
area of operation.<br/>
<br/>
SPC Olbrisch participated in more than 200 combat missions in support of<br/>
Operation Iraqi Freedom.  He prevented the movement of anti-coalition forces<br/>
in Killer Troop's sector by conducting Observation Posts, Route Security,<br/>
Traffic Control Points, and Cordon and Search operations.  His dedication to<br/>
duty, mission focus, and resolute loyalty to his fellow troopers was<br/>
critical in allowing First Platoon, Killer Troop to control the battle<br/>
space.<br/>
<br/>
As an Scout-Observer and Bradley crewman SPC Olbrisch's technical<br/>
competence, attention to detail, and commitment to excellence were<br/>
instrumental in maintaining his vehicle's combat readiness throughout his<br/>
tour during Operation Iraqi Freedom 04-06.  His hard work and dedication<br/>
facilitated First Platoon, Killer Troop's overall success in bringing<br/>
security and stability to the Iraqi Citizens.<br/>
<br/>
SPC Olbrisch showed steadfast courage and discipline in the face of enemy<br/>
contact.  Involved in multiple IED attacks on the narrow roads of Killer<br/>
Troop's area of operations, SPC Olbrisch always remained calm, followed the<br/>
directions of his leaders, and executed his battle drills to the highest<br/>
standard.  Without a doubt, his actions and initiative were vital to the<br/>
safety of his fellow troopers and the overall success of First Platoon,<br/>
Killer Troop.<br/>
<br/>
CITATION:<br/>
For meritorious service during Operation Iraqi Freedom 04-06 as a member of<br/>
Killer Troop, 3d Squadron, 3d Armored Cavalry Regiment.  SPC Olbrisch's<br/>
courage, dedication to duty, selfless service, and commitment to excellence<br/>
throughout combat operations in Iraq are qualities that all soldiers should<br/>
strive to emulate and greatly contributed to the overwhelming success of<br/>
First Platoon, Killer Troop.  SPC Olbrisch's actions reflect great credit<br/>
upon himself, 3rd Infantry Division, The Regiment of Mounted Riflemen, and<br/>
the United States Army.<br/>
