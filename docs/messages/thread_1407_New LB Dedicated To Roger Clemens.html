                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, instead of going to the JEN, I was driving my daughter to a <br/>
soccer game in Katy, so I decided to place a box while there.  I had <br/>
already found the Checkmate box in Kenneth D. Welch Outdoor Learning <br/>
Center last month and really liked that place, so I decided to place it <br/>
there.  Since I already have a box dedicated to another great TX <br/>
pitcher, Nolan Ryan, I thought it was time to do one for "The Rocket", <br/>
especially since he helped get the Astros into the World Series.  So <br/>
now you have at least 2 reasons to go to this place.  Enjoy!<br/>
