                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I finally made it back to the Lake Jackson area to find a few <br/>
of the boxes placed there recently and to place a new one at Sea Center <br/>
TX (Gordon Grouper 2).  My first Gordon Grouper had been there since <br/>
2003 but recently went missing, so I carved a new stamp and put it in a <br/>
new hiding place.  For those that stamped my first box, this gives you <br/>
an excuse to visit this great facility again, and for those that have <br/>
never been, it is a great place for families to visit.  Enjoy!<br/>

P.S.  I also posted a new TX counties map with the first colored county <br/>
of 2008 (Garza), placed by Baby Bear.<br/>
