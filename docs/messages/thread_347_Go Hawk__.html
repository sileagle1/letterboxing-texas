because I was busy cracking the code on your BLUE STAR box...and now <br/>
all of these boxes to find as well!  I am so glad you are in Houston!!<br/>
<br/>
  By the way...for those of you coming in for the event from out of <br/>
town looking for lodging, you might consider staying in Houston.  If <br/>
you find a hotel near the Sam Houston Tollway and 59 it makes for a <br/>
short (by Texas standards...about 45 minutes) trip to Brazos...and <br/>
Houston is brimming with boxes just waiting to be found! -Mother of <br/>
