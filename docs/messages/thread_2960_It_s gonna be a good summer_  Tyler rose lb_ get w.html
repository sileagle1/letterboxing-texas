Lucy, I rather like GranGran.  Congratulation to you and your family!<br/>

Silver Eagle, I'll try to check the rose letterbox asap.<br/>

Janet, hope you're feeling better and are back to speed soon.<br/>

     I'm Tx dragonfly.  I chose the name because I like dragonflys <br/>
and I am transplanted to TX (a little over 10 years ago).  I LB in <br/>
Cleveland (Ohio) every time I go to visit family and thought the tx <br/>
part added to who I was now.  I've been letterboxing for 2 years.  I <br/>
recently moved to Smith county from Bell.  This is a much more box <br/>
rich area and we've enjoyed exploring the area through hunting.<br/>
     My favorite thing about LBing is seeing places that I never <br/>
would have otherwise.  There was a small but cute residential park <br/>
(even has a little trail and a creek) near where I lived for 25+ <br/>
years that I never knew was there until I found a clue leading to <br/>
it.  Other than that, I love everything about it - I like nature and <br/>
to hike and be outside anyway, I like the stamps, the logbooks, the <br/>
challenge...  And this obsession allows me to hike in the parks with <br/>
a few family members and friends who would not otherwise hike.  As <br/>
long as I don't scare them off from hunting with me by being too <br/>
obsessed...  I've been known to say - "ok you stay here and rest and <br/>
I'll run the rest of the way to find "just one more", bring it back, <br/>
then take it back to rehide it".  (So what if we haven't eaten in 7 <br/>
hours??? And I'm the one that gets hungry 1st and usually gets a <br/>
headache and nauseous (and cranky) when I haven't eaten...).  Except <br/>
I don't get cranky when I'm letterboxing.    :)<br/>
