<div>Funny though - I wear loafers and sandals and dress shoes all day and change into boots to go out, and you wear boots all day and change into flipflops.  I wear hiking boots with shorts and capris.  It works for me, but it makes my LSS a little nuts when he suddenly realizes we're in the middle of Walmart and I'm dressed like a freak!

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I am not trying to ditch your question, and maybe someone else on here is a bigger person than I and can actually do a summation for you!  BUT - my suggestion is to kick off the flipflops and snuggle up in comfy clothes, get a cup of hot chocolate or coffee or Bailey's and a bit of comfort food (a beignet maybe?), tune out the interruptions, send the LSS or other muggles out for a long movie, open up your mind, and read the archives!  This is not meant to be a cop-out answer, more like recommending my favorite book to you!

<div> </div>
<div>Start on the first page with the first message and read forward!  You can skip a little if it gets a little mundane, but you will quickly be entertained by the wonderful group of boxers we have in Texas.  NOW - as you get into the pages, feel free to ask questions or comment about things, or to ask about different people or pose questions you will likely have, and we will all be more than happy to relive those moments and to expound on things as necessary...

I always find the box the first time out, have everything I need. . .</div> <div> </div> <div>So, anyways, the first box: No problem. Now, fast forward to that night. I'm super excited about letterboxing and go hijack DD#1 and her DF (they had just got home from happy hour with friends). DF is wearing brand new tennis shoes that probably cost over $100. It's dark and the box is off the beaten path and behind some shrubbery. I made them follow the clues like I had to. The only light we have is the glow from our cell phones. All is going good till we realize a smell is coming from the bottom of his shoe. He had stepped in pile of doggy doo. He hasn't gone out with us ever again.</div> <div> </div> <div>The next day, I go looking for a box, Curse of the Witness Tree. This is now one of my favorites because it took me three tries. When the clue says compass, I think you actually have to have a compass. Yeah,
 I'm pretty sure that's what it means. And, don't use Mapquest if you don't have an exact address, you will end up on the other side of town if you do.</div> <div> </div> <div>That's all I can humiliate my family with for now.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>"robyn.kennedy" &lt;woowooshoo@aol.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Sometimes we (me, Squished Hiker and Brods) go letterboxing after I<br/>get home from work.
