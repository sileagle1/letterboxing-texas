park that did not already have a box in it, and was appropriate for <br/>
viewing seagulls.  It did not have great hiding places, but hopefully <br/>
the box will survive since it is a micro.  Anyone planning a trip to <br/>
Seabrook area will now have to allow a full day to get all the boxes, <br/>

some "different" hamburgers that are really good, and some of the best <br/>
onion rings around.  Enjoy!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for coming out to Seabrook, SE. And thanks for<br/>
the planting of "seagulls". We had big plans to go out<br/>
and FF it this morning, but once again we are blessed<br/>
with a deluge of liquid sunshine. The kids will always<br/>
remember this as the summer when we had to put the<br/>
dog's life jacket on to take him for a walk.<br/>
Cheers to all,<br/>
