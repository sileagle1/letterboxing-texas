                    <div class="plaintext-content">Actually, we already started researching possible locations and have narrowed to probably 3, one of which is Enchanted Rock S.P.  Surprisingly they have a facility big enough for out group, but reservations at this park are often tough.  The other most likely spot will be Pametto S.P. Cedar Hill is running a distant 3rd (based on latest issues, but may get resolved).   More to come.   <br>
