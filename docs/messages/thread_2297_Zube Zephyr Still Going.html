                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did some maintenance yesterday on my first placed letterbox <br/>
(9/22/02) and I am glad to say it is still alive, though it has <br/>
weathered a few storms (literaly).  In the early days before any <br/>
letterboxers existed in my area besides Baby Bear, the only visitors <br/>
it had were from Geocachers.  Luckily, they just signed in and left <br/>
the box alone.  After about a year, I noticed a few letterboxers had <br/>
stamped in, but since there was no TX Talklist then, I had no way to <br/>
contact them and they had not contacted me.  The logbook was damp, so <br/>
I rebagged and rehid under the same log on the ground.  Then, after <br/>
the second year, I got a report from an out-of-town letterboxer that <br/>
they had found the box floating in the creek!  Thankfully they had <br/>
seen it there after not finding it behind the log and replaced it for <br/>
me.  It took me awhile to get back out there to check on it, but in <br/>
its third year I replaced the box with a camo one and used a bungee <br/>
cord to attach it to a tree up off the ground.  Unfortunately, the <br/>
logbook was so wet that most of the stamps were barely visible, but I <br/>
decided to dry it and leave it there.  However, the logbook has <br/>
continued to get worse (the wire binder is completely rusted through) <br/>
so I finally decided to replace it.  It is a good thing I moved the <br/>
box to higher ground since I could see the creek had flooded again <br/>
and the box might have been lost forever.  Even though it is a store-<br/>
bought stamp, this box has special meaning to me and I would hate to <br/>
lose it.  If you find yourself in the area (the train ride is still a <br/>
fun family thing to do for free), please visit and stamp in, even if <br/>
you have found it before.<br/>
