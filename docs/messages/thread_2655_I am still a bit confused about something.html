                    <div class="plaintext-content">I always think it's a good idea to find at least one (preferably more,<br/>
from different finders) before you plant one...it gives you a better<br/>
sense of good hiding spots and gives you ideas about how you want to<br/>
set up your box.  I really would suggest that.  Even with doing that,<br/>
we made a lot of newbie mistakes...but sometimes you just have to<br/>
learn at the school of hard knocks.<br/>
<br/>
All that said, I understand that someone always has to be the first in<br/>
an area, so I'm going ahead to give you more info.  You also might<br/>
want to read the tutorials at <br/>
www.letterboxing.info<br/>
www.atlasquest.com<br/>
www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
They are very helpful.<br/>
<br/>
A letterbox is usually a plastic tupperware-type container.  Many of<br/>
us prefer boxes under the locknlock brand name.  You don't have to use<br/>
those, but you want a box that is not that hard to close and has a<br/>
good seal.  You don't want the ziplock or other temporary type<br/>
containers (they don't close well after a bit).  This will be the<br/>
outer layer of protection for the contents...and in SE Tx it rains! <br/>
You may choose to use camo tape on the outside of the box...we can get<br/>
into brands, but you want duct-tape like material, not cloth.  Others<br/>
sometimes choose to paint theirs.  I often leave mine un-cammoed.<br/>
<br/>
Inside the letterbox, you will want to double bag (with the good<br/>
freezer-type baggies) a stamp (often hand carved or custom made...),<br/>
something to wrap the stamp up in to absorb excess ink (paper towel or<br/>
felt or cloth), and the logbook.  Inside the log (either store bought<br/>
or hand-made) you will want to stamp your family's trail stamp and the<br/>
way that you'd like others to stamp the official logbook stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Some people leave ink pads or a pen for signing in.  These are<br/>
optional.  I really don't suggest ink pads as they sometimes lead to<br/>
soggy messes, but if there's a specific color that people should<br/>
stamp, sometimes that's helpful.<br/>
<br/>
You may decorate the box or the log as you see fit--it's a more<br/>
enjoyable experience when the whole thing ties together.  However,<br/>
remember that the box will be exposed to the elements and so in<br/>
general you may not want to waste your time with decorating it....but<br/>
some people have used some great creative containers that add to the fun.<br/>
<br/>
As far as what stamp to plant, sometimes it's an image that pertains<br/>
to that park or area, sometimes it's a play on the park's name, or<br/>
sometimes it's just something you like that you've found a good place<br/>
to plant.<br/>
<br/>
I hope this answers your questions.  You are welcome to ask questions<br/>
here, but you also may find a lot of help on the newboxers board on<br/>
yahoo.  It's set up specifically as a place new boxers can ask lots of<br/>
questions!<br/>
