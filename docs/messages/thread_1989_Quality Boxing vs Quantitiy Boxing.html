Even though I have been known to get a lot of boxes per<br>
trip, it is not necessarily the way I would prefer to box.<br>
I am usually torn between lingering in nice places most<br>
boxes take me, or hurrying on to find new, nice places<br>
that other boxes will take me.  But that decision is<br>
usually made for me because I have a non-boxing family,<br>
so it seems I'm always in a hurry.  If they are with me,<br>
I have to hurry up and find the box while they enjoy the<br>
place, but after I return, they are ready to go and I don't<br>
get to enjoy the place.  If they aren't with me, I still<br>
feel like I have to hurry because it is a golden opportunity<br>
and I don't want to waste it so I look for as many boxes as<br>
I can.  The redeeming aspect of this is that I can note<br>
nice places to bring them at a later time.  So, for those<br>
of you that are not able to find many boxes per trip <br>
because your kids are enjoying themselves too much, I envy<br>
you.  You are having the most rewarding LB experience of all.<br>

P.S. BL, nice job getting a welcome box to Mike's son!<br>

<p>I know I'm new on this list but I'd like to chime in on this topic.</p>
<p>Sue &amp; I just visited Oregon a month ago. We were privileged to box with Funhog, a great friend and Don &amp; Gwen, new friends. Funhog took us to the most beautiful locations in central OR. The hikes were strenuous, the weather warm but the views and the wildlife were most rewarding. We hiked 6 to 8 hours and would find 2 boxes!</p>
<p>In CT, where we're from, boxes proliferate and you can usually find 15 to 20 in an 8 hour period without a problem. That is the type of letterboxing we're used to.</p>
<p>I have to admit. We <strong>much prefer</strong> the quality than the quantity. To hike 6 hours to see a 900 foot waterfall and a few smaller falls and pick up 3 original Columbia River Gorge boxes by Der Mad Stamper was well worth the effort.</p>
<p>Also - it's not only the journey, but who you're journeying with that makes it special! I'll go back to lurking!</p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We've found that our boxing style has really evolved over the last<br>
couple of years.  <br>
<br>
We used to try and find as many as possible, but now we're definitely<br>
in the fewer boxes, better overall experience camp.  Part of the<br>
reason we started this hobby is that we wanted our kids to grow up<br>
with our love of hiking and being in the outdoors.  So, to nurture<br>
that love, the boys have to have time for throwing rocks in creeks,<br>
finding walking sticks, rock scrambling and climbing trees.  They<br>
spent a good half hour at a park in the Hill Country a couple of<br>
weekends ago just looking at and following roly poly bugs.<br>
<br>
Part of me would still like to find all the boxes (I hate to miss out<br>
on the lovely stamps), but frankly, the boys were in danger of burning<br>
out on the hobby by being rushed from place to place.  <br>
<br>
So we attempt to find a balance.  <br>
<br>
For in-town boxes, I LOVE it when some one brings us to an unexpected<br>
park, a quirky or unusual part of Houston, a place with historical<br>
significance or an interesting connection, or a lovely spot.  I am<br>
still learning about this city.  <br>
<br>
I also like solving a puzzle, but most of you knew that already,<br>
didn't you?<br>
