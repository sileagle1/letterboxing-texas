                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since Mission Tejas SP has several examples of our rich and diverse <br>
history, Baby Bear and I decided to make the theme for the Event be <br>
TX Heritage.  This can include people, places and objects that make <br>
up the history, culture and lore of our great state.  I have created <br>
the Event website with more details:  <br>
http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/Events/TALE06/<br>
<br>
I set up the Event on AQ where you can sign-up and specify the <br>
potluck items you want to bring:<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=985<br>
<br>
I also created a table in the Database of this Talklist called TALE06 <br>
Potluck where you can specify potluck items:<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/database?<br>
method=reportRows&tbl=8<br>
<br>
And finally, I managed to reserve the Group Camping Area at Mission <br>
Tejas SP.  It holds up to 32 people but is for tent camping only, <br>
with no electricity and just 3 tables.  If you want to camp there, <br>
email me off-list and I will let you know if there is still <br>
availability.  Even if you don't camp there it will be a great place <br>
to gather for the post-Event campfire Saturday night.  <br>
<br>
If anyone wants to have any other activities (e.g. demos) at the <br>
Event, mention it here and we can discuss.  Looking forward to <br>
another great Event and seeing y'all again!<br>
