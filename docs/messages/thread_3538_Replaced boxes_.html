Here is the clue. It is in the East Texas Arboretum in Athens Tx. <br/>
<br/>
When you get to a post with #17 on it, you will find a bench to sit on. <br/>
Sit on the right end of this bench. Look at all the lovely trees. Now <br/>
look for the big 5 trunked tree. It is at a 45 degree angle from where <br/>
you sit. You really can't see this tree unless you sit on the right end <br/>
of this bench. This box is in the middle of the 5 trunks. Please make <br/>
sure the lid is closed well and it is hidden well. The next box on this <br/>
trail is Catzpaws2004's box called Texas passport series #1. Look up <br/>
the clue for this one and be prepared to find it. I found the clue to <br/>
this one in the Basement of LBNA<br/>

<div>The letterboxing basement is on LBNA - it was set up a few years ago to allow boxes to be moved off the main listings without removing them entirely.  That way the box and its history stays on the website and it doesn't mess up planters' or finders' counts.  Usually a planter would archive a box that is missing and won't be replaced and archiving sends the box to the basement.  Sometimes though, the planter is out of the picture and someone writes the webmasters and tells them the box is missing.  If they get several of those message, they might try to contact the placer as well, and if the message bounces or there is no response, they'll go ahead and archive the box.  The good thing is that if the placer comes back and they either find or replace the box, it's as easy as unarchiving it to get it back in the main listing.  Or sometimes someone comes along who manages to find a lost box, as Lois did, and they can write the WMs and ask to have it returned to the listing.  If that happens, the WMs will often ask if the recoverer would be willing to adopt the box if the planter can't be reached.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You should really venture down to the basement - there is a link for it on the main page of <a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a>.  It has happened more than once that a box that has been archived has been found, and who knows - YOU may be the one who finds it!  Some folks actually go seeking archived boxes for the challenge and honor of finding a box considered lost.</div>

<div>Inspired by your email, I just did a little housekeeping and placed some of my retired/missing boxes in the basement on LBNA. It would certainly make looking for available boxes a lot easier if we all placed our missing boxes there. On AQ, I just have them marked as retired. Thanks for the reminder.</div>
