<div><font size="2">Hey you all...I'm Mother of Five.  We started boxing 
about 2 years ago, heard about it through an article in Family Fun 
magazine.  The thing I like best about letterboxing is finding all these 
cool places that I never would have known about if it weren't for 
letterboxing...the strangest of all being a giant replica of stonehenge in a 
field near Kerville.  Only in Texas.  I am a Texan by choice, came 
here from Michigan about 13 years ago, and I never plan to leave.  I taught 
bilingual second and third grade here in Houston for 8 years, but started being 
a stay at home mom when my second child was born.  I am now mother to five 
little Texans ranging in age from 9 to 4 months.  My oldest son is having a 
lot of fun this summer planning and planting boxes of the things 9 year old boys 
love best...Star Wars, Harry Potter...I'm sure he'll have lots more ideas.  
When I look at how many boxes there are in Houston alone compared to when we 
started, and all the different types of creative clues, logbooks, and box themes 
that are out there I think about Silver Eagle and Baby Bear...how exciting it 
must be for them.  Sort of like watching your baby let go of the couch and 
stand on their own...then before you know it they are running away at full 
speed!  I love to open my e mail each day and see what my "boxing friends" 
have to say.  This is such a great list to be a part 
of.</font></div></body></html>
