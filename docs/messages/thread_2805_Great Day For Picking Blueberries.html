                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday I found myself north of Houston with my daughter at yet <br>
another soccer tounament.  For those of you that have never experienced <br>
one, it usually consists of 2 or more games per day with much waiting <br>
in between.  As it turned out, our first game was at 7:30 (had to get <br>
up at 5:30 to arrive by 6:45) but our second game was not until 2:30.  <br>
So, rather than go home and come back, I talked Running Rain into going <br>
to Lake Houston Park to find a box and place one.  Then we went to my <br>
favorite place to pick blueberries, which is not too far west of <br>
there.  It is called Moorehead's and I will give the website at the <br>
end.  It was crowded, but we still managed to pick over 11 pounds in <br>
about 1 hour (not including all the ones that went into our mouths <br>
instead of our buckets).  They only charge $1.50/lb and it is a great <br>
family activity.  I recommend calling first to make sure they are open <br>
and that there are still plenty of berries.  I also recommend going <br>
early before it gets too hot and on a weekday if possible.  Now I'm off <br>
for more soccer and a family reunion.  Enjoy!<br>

 <br/>&gt; another soccer tounament. For those of you that have never <br/>experienced <br/>&gt; one, it usually consists of 2 or more games per day with much <br/>waiting <br/>&gt; in between. As it turned out, our first game was at 7:30 (had to <br/>get <br/>&gt; up at 5:30 to arrive by 6:45) but our second game was not until <br/>2:30. <br/>&gt; So, rather than go home and come back, I talked Running Rain into <br/>going <br/>&gt; to Lake Houston Park to find a box and place one. Then we went to <br/>my <br/>&gt; favorite place to pick blueberries, which is not too far west of <br/>&gt; there. It is called Moorehead's and I will give the website at <br/>the <br/>&gt; end. It was crowded, but we still managed to pick over 11 pounds <br/>in <br/>&gt; about 1 hour (not including all the ones that went into our mouths <br/>&gt; instead of our buckets). They only charge $1.50/lb and it is a <br/>great <br/>&gt; family activity. I recommend calling first to make sure they are <br/>open <br/>&gt; and
 that there are still plenty of berries. I also recommend <br/>going <br/>&gt; early before it gets too hot and on a weekday if possible. Now <br/>I'm off <br/>&gt; for more soccer and a family reunion.
