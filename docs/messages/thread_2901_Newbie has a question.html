                    <div class="plaintext-content">This happened to me too, at Brackenridge Park in San Antonio when my<br>
LB partner and I ran into CanCan and Timeonious.  We didn't know what<br>
to do either, so we just approached them and asked them if they were<br>
letterboxing.  Cancan seemed taken aback, but she warmed up to us, and<br>
we ended up looking for our next box together (which wasn't there).  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I was relating this story at the San Antonio meet and greet<br>
last month, and Grizzled Griphon said that this is what you're<br>
supposed to do:<br>
When you meet a suspected letterboxer you're supposed to say, "Excuse<br>
me, could you tell me which direction is North?"<br>
<br>
If they fumble in their pack for a compass, they're not a letterboxer,<br>
but if they point up (toward the sky), they are.<br>
<br>
Which I guess only works if they know about that secret!  <br>
