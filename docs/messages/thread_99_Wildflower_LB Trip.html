county looking at wildflowers and doing some letterboxing.<br/>
If you haven't seen the flowers yet this year you should<br/>
get out soon since they are the best in years!  We followed<br/>
the Bluebonnet Trail, which you can see at:<br/>

<br/>
At Washington-On-The-Brazos SP I checked on my Texas Flag<br/>
box and found Droop's WOTB LB alive and well.  On the way<br/>
we stopped at Zube Park and found Baby Bear's Lady Justice<br/>
box doing fine and checked on my box there.  We then went<br/>
to Telge Park and found Park Angel and Puppy Love.  The Park<br/>
Angel needs a new logbook soon and Puppy Love clues need to be<br/>
changed to show Harris county instead of Houston county<br/>
because they currently show up in the Eastern Region of Texas.<br/>
And finally I tried to find Hershey's Kiss LB with no<br/>
success.  It is a nice park so I hope the box gets replaced<br/>
if it is indeed missing.<br/>
It was a great day and we are so happy we beat the rain home.<br/>
Happy Easter!<br/>
