Bekah...she will be 3 later this month.<br>
But we also have 4 older kids.<br>
Our oldest is 21 and married and she moved away to be a Navy <br>
wife...then we have a 20 year old son and then an 18 year old daughter <br>
and then a son that will soon be 18.<br>
We live here in Northeast Texas.  We just recently started this <br>
hobby...heard about it from Family Fun magazine.<br>
Our first trip out was June 23, 2007 and we have 16 finds and 1 <br>
exchange so far.<br>
We are very interested in any meet and greets in this area....love to <br>
