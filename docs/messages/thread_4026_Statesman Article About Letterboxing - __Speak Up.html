                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I'll bite.  I''ve been watching this discussion but haven't had time<br>
to sit down and participate in the discussion, but what the heck - I'll skip<br>
fixing supper in favor of this topic.<br>
<br>
I probably have a little bias in favor of media coverage, although my<br>
feelings have changed a little over the years.  We had a local reporter who<br>
did an article about letterboxing when my family had been boxing for about a<br>
year.  I was very uneasy doing an interview by myself since I was relatively<br>
inexperienced.  She had also contacted Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, since at<br>
that time we were the only three boxers who had boxes in this county.  We<br>
emailed back and forth about it between ourselves, and we agreed that we<br>
would be forceful about not participating in the interview unless she agreed<br>
to a few terms - not givng explicit directions to any boxes, not taking<br>
photographs of boxes, emphasizing the need for stealth.  She interviewed<br>
Silver Eagle by phone as I recall and Baby Bear by email.  Lightning and I<br>
then spent an afternoon with her being interviewed and then inviting her<br>
along to plant a box I was placing specifically for the newspaper article.<br>
For the most part, she did a very good job and she did a lot of research.<br>
<br>
Aside from that somewhat positive experience, I also worked quite a lot with<br>
the news media in one of my scout functions and I found local reporters to<br>
be invested in digging up cool local twists.  I kind of like reporter type<br>
folks, and I think at least half of them have their hearts in the right<br>
place, and heck - that's a better percentage than lawyers (sorry Gryzzled<br>
Gryphon and Cattitude and any other lawyer letterboxers...).<br>
<br>
The only down side is that it really didn't bring anyone into the game that<br>
stuck around.  Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket came along shortly thereafter,<br>
but they didn't see the article.  JBK came along a little after that, but<br>
again, they (they were a they back then) didn't read the article either.<br>
The only boxer that came in as a result of the article missed the point for<br>
the most part, planted a bunch of boxes that were great carves and lousy<br>
hides and clues.  She went incommunicado after about six months and left us<br>
with a bunch of untended boxes that went missing quickly, and perplexed new<br>
boxers who got discouraged when they couldn't find the boxes she had listed<br>
and left behind.  How long did it take us to finally get her boxes off the<br>
clue sites?<br>
<br>
So ANYWAY - yeah, I kind of like the media, but I don't think it does much<br>
for the game and has the potential for really doing some damage.<br>
<br>
As far as the Statesman article specifically, I think it was poorly done.  I<br>
don't know what the format of her column is - maybe it's a "What I did this<br>
weekend" column, so from a journalistic point of view, I guess it's fine.</div>
