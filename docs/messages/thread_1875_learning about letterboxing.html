 is how  we initially started letterboxing.  The bit I read today was short, but it  also had the LBNA link.  It made me wonder if we might see some new boxers  pop up.  It also made me wonder how all of us started letterboxing.   We know Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's story, and I think Teamking started with  the article in TIME.  What about the rest of you?   -MO5</font></div> </blockquote><br/><p>

                    <html><body><div>Somehow letterboxing hit the homeschool circuit about three years ago and made the rounds in HS groups.  Lightning and I got involved through it (we homeschooled for one year only, and I like to think the reason we HS'd was to find LB'ing).  We played a modified version of LB'ing for a few months before we finally decided to try out the real thing in September '03.

<div>As to your wondering if we will see new players, we almost certainly will.  It's funny to watch the influx of new members on this list - when suddenly several new folks turn up, inevitably there was some publicity somewhere that caused it.  Even regional publicity not in Texas causes a small jump here in Texas, and if it's national or in Texas, we see a much larger increase.
