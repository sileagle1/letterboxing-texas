                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am glad we're re-emphasizing the need for discretion and stealth.  <br>
It is possible, even with children.  Mine are careful, partially <br>
because they know how they want others to treat their boxes.  <br>
However, they're still noisy kids, so we have some excuses at the <br>
ready--like a "snack break" or a posed photo.<br>
<br>
We choose not to participate in Scouts, but Scouting makes a great <br>
excuse if ever questioned when you're out with the kids.  Just <br>
mumble something about an orienteering badge and people remember <br>
their own scouting days.  <br>
<br>
And finally, as we're going over some of the basics.  Please make <br>
sure that you rehide a box as well if not better than when you found <br>
it.  Particularly for urban boxes, that is the key to survival.  I <br>
ALWAYS double check the re-hide if the kids do it, just to make <br>
extra sure.  I find box maintenance a bore and am not likely to <br>
recarve and replace one.  Most likely, except for in a few <br>
instances, one of ours that goes confirmed missing will be "retired."<br>
<br>
Hope you're out enjoying the weekend.  We found Crimson Roar last <br>
night when we (the adults) stopped in for a pint after dinner.  <br>
Asterix says forget the coffee series, he would like all the boxers <br>
to place boxes at decent pubs!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That reminds me of a funny story that happened to us<br>
last year.  <br>
<br>
We have a box planted in Tyler State Park.  When we<br>
planted it, we had gone up past TSP to place one at<br>
Tiger Creek Refuge, so we wanted to be sure to get<br>
double benefit by getting the TSP one placed also.  <br>
<br>
Well, it was a busy day at TSP and it was very busy on<br>
the trail itself, but we didn't realize how busy until<br>
we were actually on the trail and in the area we<br>
wanted to plant. As I've mentioned recently, I really<br>
don't like the heat, so I wasn't about to waste a hot<br>
sweaty walk just to turn around and not do what we<br>
went to do!  We hung out and ate a snack, read a book,<br>
made notes in our nature journal (our what?), rested<br>
on a log, looked at bugs, blah blah blah.  We<br>
meanwhile had been scoping out the spot and knew where<br>
it needed to be, just needed to get it in place and<br>
document it.  <br>
<br>
We thought we finally had a chance to place the box<br>
and were zeroing in, when a group of several teenaged<br>
boys started down the trail.  Now bear in mind, I box<br>
with a teenage girl, so this wasn't a good situation. <br>
I suspected they were going to have to stop and check<br>
her out, so I quickly got her and my 8-year-old boy to<br>
work with me on a compass lesson.  Now - bear in mind,<br>
using a compass does NOT come easily to me, and I've<br>
only really started working hard to get good at using<br>
one in the last year or so (I mean really, what<br>
self-respecting scouter/letterboxer doesn't know how<br>
to use a compass?), so me giving a lesson was a little<br>
ironic.  Sure enough though, the guys stopped to say<br>
hello and see what we were doing, so I wound up giving<br>
them a compass lesson as well.  I was really<br>
stretching and I thought I was gonna have to launch<br>
into my weak understanding of declination before we<br>
finally got them to go away by boring them to death<br>
(and thankfully, they weren't my daughter's type).<br>
<br>
I was never so glad to get a box slapped into it's<br>
hiding place!<br>
