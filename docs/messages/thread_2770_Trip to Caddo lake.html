                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday,PsGuru, Raoarin' Lion and I loaded up the van and headed <br>
to Caddo lake and Uncertain. On our way, we made a few stops to get <br>
some new boxes:<br>
<br>
A Family Tree<br>
Marshall Pottery<br>
Skritz (Raorin'Lion thought this one was "cool")<br>
<br>
After stamping in "Skritz", we made our way to Caddo Lake State <br>
Park. Really nice park and the trails are neat and clean. Camping <br>
spots are nice and they have cabings. This another one of the <br>
projects by the "CCC". It is well maintained and they even give <br>
guided tours.<br>
<br>
Roarin' Lion and I hit the trails while PSGuru to photos, We took <br>
our time and enjoyed all the info along the trails and found two <br>
good hiding spots (I hope). <br>
<br>
After making our way back to the van, we headed to Uncertain. <br>
Uncertain is a unique little community that thrives on tourist and <br>
week-enders. I had quite a problem finding a spot for this box. <br>
There aren't any parks or other places that hiding a box would be <br>
safe, BUT I was determined to place this box in the city limits of <br>
Uncertain. I finally did find a place. Hopefully it will be there <br>
for a while. <br>
<br>
It was a fun day!<br>
