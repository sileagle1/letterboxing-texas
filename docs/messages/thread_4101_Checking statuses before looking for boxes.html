<div>I had to go back to my logbook online to determine 
if you were talking about me!  On our last lb journey last weekend, we had 
two attempts, but I thought I remembered that they were both supposed to be 
there.  I have been guilty of searching for a box no longer present (and I 
was disappointed!).  I'll blame it on my "newbie-ness".  :)  
After searching for it, I did go check the clues again on AQ and it was listed 
as active.  There was a note, however, that said retired - not in the title 
and not in the clue part.  I overlooked.it when choosing 
boxes.</div>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>Very true!  And a great story.  Funny how things happen that 
  way.  But you have to admit - that's not the norm.  Usually when 
  they are marked "retired" or archived, the placer is pretty darned sure (as 
  you were) that the box is gone OR they actually have taken possession of the 
  box.   Otherwise they leave the status as Unknown.  <br/><br/>One 
  of the things I DO really like about AQ is the fact that it has the status 
  flags.  If both the finder and the planter use them properly, they are a 
  great tool.  Of course, on LBNA boxes are completely removed from search 
  listings when they are archived, so no chance of hunting retired boxes unless 
  you specifically go looking for them there.  And then - you don't know 
  why or how it was archived unless the planter or the webmasters make a note in 
  the clues.<br/><br/>I just felt very badly because the latest reporter was very 
  disappointed not to have found it.  I would hope that folks who go 
  looking for boxes knowing the odds are stacked against them would at least 
  have a philosophical attitude about it.  I feel like the latest one I 
  have in mind just didn't notice or understand the 
  designations.<wbr/>..<br/><br/>Every time I get a report like that, it makes me 
  stop and think whether I have been keeping my clues updated.  I think I 
  have - can't promise I'm always great at it - but in the cases where they've 
  been reported missing lately, I've gone back and checked and found they were 
  already noted.<br/><br/>Oh well.  I hope someone gets a little something 
  from my note.  I always feel disappointed with them when they don't find 
  my boxes.<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Like the girl scout leader who was cleaning up the picnic table at the state park and found a plastic box, a baggie with a rubber stamp in it and a log book in a baggie, sitting on the table, apparently placed there by one of the girls, who found it, who knows where.  The box had been missing for months, and was so labled in LbNA and AtlasQuest.  She had never heard of letterboxing but was able to figure out how to contact us and offered to mail it to us, which she did, and she wouldn't let us pay for the postage.<br/>

&gt; Funny you should mention this trend, because I have noticed it too, and I don't<br/>
&gt; understand why someone even looks for those boxes. I'm glad you have pointed out<br/>
&gt; the various "status" cattegories, but I'm afraid that the folks who don't read<br/>
&gt; the clues also won't be reading this post. Occasionally, good things happen,<br/>
&gt; though, like the recent finding of my "Nimitz" box, despite the fact that it had<br/>
&gt; been missing since October and that a note was clearly placed on the clue sheet<br/>
&gt; stating that it was missing. The finder followed the original clues and found<br/>
&gt; it, so it had never really been missing, even though the report had come from a<br/>
&gt; reliable letterboxer who detailed the fact that the location of the box had been<br/>
&gt; destroyed by construction crews. I'm sure that was true and that the box was<br/>
&gt; fortunate to survive the damage and remain in the same place. It's now been<br/>
&gt; found 3 times in the last week. So, you never know for sure unless you go check<br/>
&gt; it out for yourself or someone stumbles upon it for whatever reason. <br/>

&gt; &gt; It seems like I have had a rash of no finds lately - on boxes I have either<br/>

&gt; &gt; really badly when that happens - I hate it badly enough when someone drives<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; SO - I want to make sure our new boxers have noticed that on AQ, there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; statuses, and "retired" means the placer has either removed the box or<br/>
&gt; &gt; confirmed it is gone. "unavailable" probably means the placer has pulled it<br/>
&gt; &gt; for maintenance, or perhaps it's in an area with seasonal availability.<br/>
&gt; &gt; "Unknown" means - well - who knows the status? You might get lucky and find<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of those. And of course, "Active" means that as far as anyone knows,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box is in place and active.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; On LBNA, the retired boxes are (or should be) archived, so you won't see<br/>
&gt; &gt; them in a normal search. Some folks, like me, put the words MISSING or<br/>
&gt; &gt; RETIRED in the title of the box and leave them in the listing for awhile<br/>
&gt; &gt; before archiving, so that anyone who might be behind on logging won't have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to go digging for them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm all for the idea that you never know if you'll find a box when you go<br/>
&gt; &gt; looking for it, but it really is a shame to go looking for a box that is<br/>
&gt; &gt; known to be missing before you ever left your computer screen! Of course, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; guess the possibility is that all these folks had printed off clues quite<br/>
&gt; &gt; awhile ago, but that doesn't seem too likely for ALL of them.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hope this helps?<br/>

A couple of weeks ago, I went to Mercer Arboretum to check on some boxes and they have been doing a lot of work around the pond, completely rebuilding it, in fact.  LSQ's box, Grandmother's Flower Garden was missing, but Wills World's box, Traveling Matt, was there under a log, although some clean-up work had been done around the log.  The box was in excellent condition, so I covered it up better and left it in place.  Last Thursday, we went back and replaced Grandmother's Flower Garden and the log where Traveling Matt had been was gone and the area had been bulldozed, so the box was not to be found.<br/>

<div>It might be fine.  I'm just concerned about 
the clean-up. If they are thorough, they'll surely grab that block.  But 
they may just grab the block and miss the box.  The box will be out in the
