<p>Very true!  And a great story.  Funny how things happen that 
  way.  But you have to admit - that's not the norm.  Usually when 
  they are marked "retired" or archived, the placer is pretty darned sure (as 
  you were) that the box is gone OR they actually have taken possession of the 
  box.   Otherwise they leave the status as Unknown.  <br/><br/>One 
  of the things I DO really like about AQ is the fact that it has the status 
  flags.  If both the finder and the planter use them properly, they are a 
  great tool.  Of course, on LBNA boxes are completely removed from search 
  listings when they are archived, so no chance of hunting retired boxes unless 
  you specifically go looking for them there.  And then - you don't know 
  why or how it was archived unless the planter or the webmasters make a note in 
  the clues.<br/><br/>I just felt very badly because the latest reporter was very 
  disappointed not to have found it.  I would hope that folks who go 
  looking for boxes knowing the odds are stacked against them would at least 
  have a philosophical attitude about it.  I feel like the latest one I 
  have in mind just didn't notice or understand the 
  designations.<wbr>..<br/><br/>Every time I get a report like that, it makes me 
  stop and think whether I have been keeping my clues updated.  I think I 
  have - can't promise I'm always great at it - but in the cases where they've 
  been reported missing lately, I've gone back and checked and found they were 
  already noted.<br/><br/>Oh well.  I hope someone gets a little something 
  from my note.  I always feel disappointed with them when they don't find 
  my boxes.<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/>

Like the girl scout leader who was cleaning up the picnic table at the state park and found a plastic box, a baggie with a rubber stamp in it and a log book in a baggie, sitting on the table, apparently placed there by one of the girls, who found it, who knows where.  The box had been missing for months, and was so labled in LbNA and AtlasQuest.  She had never heard of letterboxing but was able to figure out how to contact us and offered to mail it to us, which she did, and she wouldn't let us pay for the postage.<br>
