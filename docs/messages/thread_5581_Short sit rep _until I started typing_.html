                    <div class="plaintext-content">In response to the query that this list has outlived its usefulness, I am going to submit a response and my first lb sit rep.<br>
<br>
I am a lurker. I read every post that comes through though I very rarely respond. Our letterboxing has been very spotty. Like many people, we started strong and tapered off as children got older, Saturday day trips yielded to sitting in gyms for dance competitions, job changes, whatever came our way. We have gathered the stray box here and there (I grew lax in logging the finds on any website), but weren't active in a meaningful sense. There have been multiple times we've been driving down the road and said something like, "I wish we had brought the letterboxing backpack!" In light of that, we decided to take a quick trip to Dallas for our anniversary this week and made it a boxing trip. Here are the results. <br>
<br>
We left Tyler early Thursday morning and headed west on I-20. We have passed the rest stop in Van literally thousands of times. This time, we pulled off to get a box at mile marker 538 originally planted by Safari Man. The box was on the ground near the noted stump. It was filled with water, but the baggies held and the stamp and logbook were unscathed. After stamping in, we re-hid the box in the stump under quite a bit of protective material. We started back on our journey with a new stamp and a hitch hiker that jumped on board! <br>
<br>
We made our way to visit Little Oscar at Lake Tawakoni. It was our first visit there and we enjoyed the trip. It was a little chilly and faulty breezy, but we made the trek along the nature trail to the point and around to visit Oscar who was happily fishing as advertised. As usual, Boots Tex's carve and history lesson did not disappoint! <br>
<br>
We meandered back to the car and set Waze to direct us to our next stop to Pecan Grove Historic Cemetery in McKinney. We started with Ho! Ho! Holiday 2014 which was right in its place. Unfortunately, the tab on one side of the box has failed. The baggies inside were sodden and waterlogged. We dried as much as possible. The stamp is still in acceptable condition. The logbook was not salvageable. I replaced it with a new baggie and a new logbook and have been in contact with the placer in California. When we re-hid the box, we placed the damaged tab face down so rain and moisture would not have a direct path inside. We didn't have a spare box. If you are in the area with a spare box, it would help preserve this letterbox for future finders. <br>
<br>
We moved on to visit Old Leathercoat in the historic section of the cemetery. While we were unable to locate the box (I was concerned since there had been a previous attempt), we wandered for over an hour perusing the graves, reading the history of the lives laid to rest there (who was Marjorie Fuller, and why was she a Japanese POW and in a Chinese labor camp for almost 50 years?), and learning more about the Wreaths across America (www.wreathsacrossamerica.org) program. We also searched every plausible location for Old Leathercoat, but I fear he moved and left no forwarding address. While deeply saddened that I don't get to meet this governor, I don't regret the time searching for him and learning about this fascinating cemetery. <br>
<br>
Please don't discount this list. Even those of us who don't post regularly still read about your travels with fondness and longing. Please continue to plant the boxes, maintain the aging ones, and share your stories. I will continue to do my part, even if my participation is somewhat haphazard. About Live and Breathe... I truly hope the time and location are doable for us. I have already told my husband that I would like to attend and experience the tradition and fun that seems to be involved. As we are seriously NOT campers (and I am admittedly a wuss), I'm hoping for a location that is a reasonable driving distance from a Hilton. Moderate hiking I can do. Sleeping outside? Not so much! <br>
