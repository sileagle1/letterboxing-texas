                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have removed The Blue Daisy for a time. That is the box that some <br/>
homeschoolers found by mistake and we had such a hard time finding it <br/>
and replaceing it a time back. Today I went to the park and sure enough <br/>
the homeschoolers were there. Now to make it very clear---I am not <br/>
against homeschoolers so please do not take it that way. In fact the <br/>
experience was very refreshing.<br/>
<br/>
It seems that every Friday, weather permitting, the area homeschoolers <br/>
have an outing in that park. I pulled up and started to check on The <br/>
Blue Daisy when I came in contact with 2 girls. I ask them if they had <br/>
found my letterbox. One said I didn't. Then the littlest of the 2 said. <br/>
I did or rather my brother did. I asked if they found it today. She <br/>
said yes, it is still there. I said ok, I am going to check on it now. <br/>
When I came back, the brother and sister were sitting on the rail <br/>
waiting on me. I just said as I put the box in the van, Thanks for <br/>
checking on it for me. The boy said,"Your Welcome" as we parted ways <br/>
waving at each other. I will replace the box as one and I don't <br/>
remember who, suggested in another location in the same park. Hopefully <br/>
where they do not play on Fridays.<br/>

&gt; I have removed The Blue Daisy for a time. That is the box that some <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers found by mistake and we had such a hard time finding <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; and replaceing it a time back. Today I went to the park and sure <br/>
enough <br/>
&gt; the homeschoolers were there. Now to make it very clear---I am not <br/>
&gt; against homeschoolers so please do not take it that way. In fact <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; experience was very refreshing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems that every Friday, weather permitting, the area <br/>
homeschoolers <br/>
&gt; have an outing in that park. I pulled up and started to check on <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; Blue Daisy when I came in contact with 2 girls. I ask them if they <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; found my letterbox. One said I didn't. Then the littlest of the 2 <br/>
said. <br/>
&gt; I did or rather my brother did. I asked if they found it today. She <br/>
&gt; said yes, it is still there. I said ok, I am going to check on it <br/>
now. <br/>
&gt; When I came back, the brother and sister were sitting on the rail <br/>
&gt; waiting on me. I just said as I put the box in the van, Thanks for <br/>
&gt; checking on it for me. The boy said,"Your Welcome" as we parted <br/>
ways <br/>
&gt; waving at each other. I will replace the box as one and I don't <br/>
&gt; remember who, suggested in another location in the same park. <br/>
Hopefully <br/>
&gt; where they do not play on Fridays.<br/>
