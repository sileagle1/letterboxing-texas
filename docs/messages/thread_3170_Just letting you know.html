                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have removed The Blue Daisy for a time. That is the box that some <br>
homeschoolers found by mistake and we had such a hard time finding it <br>
and replaceing it a time back. Today I went to the park and sure enough <br>
the homeschoolers were there. Now to make it very clear---I am not <br>
against homeschoolers so please do not take it that way. In fact the <br>
experience was very refreshing.<br>
<br>
It seems that every Friday, weather permitting, the area homeschoolers <br>
have an outing in that park. I pulled up and started to check on The <br>
Blue Daisy when I came in contact with 2 girls. I ask them if they had <br>
found my letterbox. One said I didn't. Then the littlest of the 2 said. <br>
I did or rather my brother did. I asked if they found it today. She <br>
said yes, it is still there. I said ok, I am going to check on it now. <br>
When I came back, the brother and sister were sitting on the rail <br>
waiting on me. I just said as I put the box in the van, Thanks for <br>
checking on it for me. The boy said,"Your Welcome" as we parted ways <br>
waving at each other. I will replace the box as one and I don't <br>
remember who, suggested in another location in the same park. Hopefully <br>
where they do not play on Fridays.<br>
