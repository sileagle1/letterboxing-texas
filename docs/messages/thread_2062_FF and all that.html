<div>Well, it didn't take long for those intrepid and clever letterboxers, 
CelticLions and Grizzled Gryphon, to find my Mozart mystery box.  GG 
was first to find the box and stamp in, but before that, Ruby Tuesday had 
"virtually" solved the clues and emailed me with the solution.  There was a 
FF certificate in the letterbox, but I also emailed Ruby Tuesday a 
"<em>Virtual</em> FF" certificate to recognize her extraordinary 
sleuthing skills.   I'd thought it was a fairly simple mystery 
box, but I did think it would take more than a half an hour for Ruby 
Tuesday to figure it out and "find" the location!  I'm planning a day this 
week to go plant another in that series:  Swing, Swing! A Tribute to Benny 
Goodman, which has been riding around in my backpack for awhile now just waiting 
for me to go plant it.  Soon!  --
