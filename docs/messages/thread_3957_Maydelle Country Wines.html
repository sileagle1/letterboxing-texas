                    <html><body><div>For those of you who attended the gathering in Rusk three years ago, you may have visited the Maydelle Winery.  I visit there periodically, but usually don't try all the wines each time.  I made another visit there yesterday and did a full tasting.  I was surprised to find how much their wines have improved in three years time!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Weches isn't too terribly far from Maydelle, if you might be inclined to swing by the winery again (or for the first time) at gathering time.  They have their standard local fruit wines - Peach, Blackberry, and Elderberry, but they also have a couple of new cuvee's - an orange/grapefruit/white grape mix that was very refreshing and an apricot/pear mix that had a great sweet taste.  His Lemon Wine beat out the Messina Hof competition in a recent competition.  They also have an Apple Mead which is made with apples and honey from Mr. Maydelle Queen Bee's honey!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maydelle's wines will never be considered serious wines in the world of French names and distinctive grapes, but they are good solid sweet wines, fun to drink, and an experience to purchase.  And apparently, getting better by the year!</div>

<div>He didn't have DP wine this time.  His selection has narrowed down to about ten decent wines by now, but he still likes dumping everything together to see what happens.  I'm taking six bottle to Georgia with me (or rather, had them shipped ahead).  It'll be interesting to roll them out at the gathering this weekend!</div>
