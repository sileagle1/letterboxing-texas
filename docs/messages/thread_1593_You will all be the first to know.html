The Garden Gnome<br>
<br>
A little background from Micha F. Lindemans: "[Gnomes<br>
are] a race of small, misshapen, dwarf-like creatures<br>
that dwell in the earth. The name 'gnome' was given to<br>
them by the medieval scholar Paracelcus, in an attempt<br>
to describe the most important of the earth spirits.<br>
Gnomes live under the earth, where they guard<br>
treasures. According to Paracelcus, they move as<br>
easily through the earth as humans walk upon the<br>
ground. They cannot stand the light of the sun, for<br>
even one ray would turn them to stone. Some sources<br>
claim they spend the hours during daylight as a toad.<br>
They are in some way related to goblins and dwarfs."<br>
<br>
My gnome however, was not turned to stone in sunlight,<br>
but into a  letterbox! He is guarding the treasure<br>
that is the Fort Worth Botanical Gardens.<br>
<br>
Clues:<br>
Park at the Rose Garden and take the giant staircase<br>
down to the grass. Immediately at the bottom of the<br>
stairs, take the gate to your right into the foresty<br>
garden. Walking along the stone path, take the right<br>
fork (you should see a trash recepticle straigt<br>
ahead). Continue the stone path that bears left and<br>
crosses a little stream (some days, this may be dry).<br>
You'll soon see a series of steps that lead to a<br>
sitting area with a non-functioning bird bath or<br>
fountain. Face south with the continuation of the path<br>
leading to your right. <br>
My little garden gnome is at the base of the shrub<br>
behind the southeast corner of this little area.<br>
<br>
Rehide well and securely due to the incline.<br>
Enjoy the rest of the gardens and find all the other<br>
boxes here!<br>
