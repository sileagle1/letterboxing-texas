<p>I am sorry to hear that lake is dry. That is one of the prettiest parks I've been to. Hopefully, we'll have a wet winter and bring it back to its former glory.</p>

<div>Sad to hear about that pretty little Double Lake going dry -- hopefully, not a permanent thing.  Although, at the rate the water table in Texas is being depleted, who knows!  We may all be living in a desert zone within a few decades, if not sooner.  I remember that park especially for all the beautiful blooming dogwoods in the spring when we had that event there, and can only imagine that it's equally pretty in the fall with all those hardwood trees' leaves in color - but they need those little lakes for their reflected glory!  We could sure use some of that New England wet weather around here!</div>

Well - now those boats are all sitting on dry ground! It's unbelievable! We've been walking out on the dry lake bed a several times in the last month and it is alarming the change right now from week to week. The one bit of hope that we see each time, and now make a point to check on, is a spring that feeds the lake that is now clearly visible bubbling up from underground. In fact, it is so close to the surface that you could stick your arm down it if you were so incline (I'm NOT!). <br/>

<div>The year we had the Moose Event at Lake Grapevine, the lake was so low, dinosaur tracks that had been hidden underwater for years began to become visible. The Corps of Engineers that control that lake had to bulldoze dirt over them to protect them since zealous individuals discovered them and were ruining them by trying to makes casts of them. Maybe you should take advantage of the dried lake bed and go walk around and search for history.</div>

<div>The year we had the Moose Event at
                  Lake Grapevine, the lake was so low, dinosaur tracks
                  that had been hidden underwater for years began to
                  become visible. The Corps of Engineers that control
                  that lake had to bulldoze dirt over them to protect
                  them since zealous individuals discovered them and
                  were ruining them by trying to makes casts of them.
                  Maybe you should take advantage of the dried lake bed
                  and go walk around and search for history.</div>

the kid got discouraged he wouldn't need to do it again.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was just that dumb?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe he was from out of town, like some guy from El Paso that only sees<br/>
water like that when he travels.  Hey - I resemble that remark!  <grin>.<br/>
<br/>
I was at a quarry-lake at Redstone Arsenal many years ago.  We were fishing.<br/>
Not catching, just fishing.  This beautiful little turtle swam by my wife,<br/>
and she declared she wanted to catch it and put it in her terrarium.<br/>
<br/>
So I got down on my belly, toes hooked over the ledge, hanging upside down<br/>
and trying to grab the turtle with my free hand.  The rocks slipped.<br/>
Instead of reaching for the turtle I ended up swimming with the turtle.  But<br/>
when I came up, he was in my hand.  We kept it for a year, then turned it<br/>
loose at the quarry when we redeployed to Germany.<br/>
<br/>
We also caught several blue-tailed Skinks.  They were great when we couldn't<br/>
own any other animals.  I kinda miss those days.<br/>
<br/>
We are headed to Fort Worth in about 7 days.  If Daisy wins just two more<br/>
shows, she gets her Champion title.  River and I will also be competing in<br/>
beginner Novice obedience.  River is a novice dog, I have done this before<br/>
with Parker, and Max, and Rusty.... Wish us luck.<br/>

<p>Well - maybe he didn't like the kid, Grandma sent them out and he figured 
if<br/>the kid got discouraged he wouldn't need to do it again.<br/><br/>Maybe he 
was just that dumb?<br/><br/>Maybe he was from out of town, like some guy from El 
Paso that only sees<br/>water like that when he travels. Hey - I resemble that 
remark! &lt;grin&gt;.<br/><br/>I was at a quarry-lake at Redstone Arsenal many 
years ago. We were fishing.<br/>Not catching, just fishing. This beautiful little 
turtle swam by my wife,<br/>and she declared she wanted to catch it and put it in 
her terrarium.<br/><br/>So I got down on my belly, toes hooked over the ledge, 
hanging upside down<br/>and trying to grab the turtle with my free hand. The 
rocks slipped.<br/>Instead of reaching for the turtle I ended up swimming with 
the turtle. But<br/>when I came up, he was in my hand. We kept it for a year, 
then turned it<br/>loose at the quarry when we redeployed to Germany.<br/><br/>We 
also caught several blue-tailed Skinks. They were great when we couldn't<br/>own 
any other animals. I kinda miss those days.<br/><br/>We are headed to Fort Worth 
in about 7 days. If Daisy wins just two more<br/>shows, she gets her Champion 
title. River and I will also be competing in<br/>beginner Novice obedience. River 
is a novice dog, I have done this before<br/>with Parker, and Max, and Rusty....

[letterboxingtexas] Re: Double Lake<br/><br/>Yes, you're right, Mike, but he had a 
young boy with him and I believe that<br/>kid really wanted to catch a

sometimes fishing doesn't require a catch. Just like sometimes<br/>&gt; you don't 
find the letterbox, and you still love the adventure. The line<br/>in<br/>&gt; the 
water is just an excuse to sit outdoors and enjoy the 
moment.<br/>Catching<br/>&gt; a fish would just be an interruption.

Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Double Lake<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It was a gorgeous day 
in East Texas, washed by the weekend rains, so I<br/>went<br/>&gt; over to Double 
Lake to check it out. Double Lake is back! If you haven't<br/>&gt; seen it full 
of water, now's the time to go. One guy was fishing and I<br/>&gt; wondered if he 
knew that the lake was dry just a couple of months ago.<br/>&gt; Maybe they've 
stocked it already. The new concession stand seems to be<br/>&gt; finished, but 
dirt work or clearing or something is still going on in the<br/>&gt; day use 
picnic area. Dogwoods are beginning to bloom. I need to go over<br/>&gt; this 
week and check on the dogs.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

&gt; Fantastic! My kids and I are headed there this morning to do a few nights of spring break camping! We have a lakeside spot reserved, but I was worried we might be enjoying a lovely view of a mud flat.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the report, Boots. There are a ton of dog-boxes up there calling our names.<br/>

I'm scared to show up.  IRA and Bozo are planning another trap for me.<br/>
Where is the "Save the Bear" club?   <br/>
<br/>
PS - If you do have another Roll event, I'll bring the Ghost Poop and Clown<br/>
Cake, and we can play burn the boxers and pin the tail on the bozo, two of<br/>
my favorite games!  <br/>

<p>Dallas would be enough Hell, no need to go to NYC....Opps.     Rouge Bear, no such thing.  Teddy Bears, now that is what most of us are!  The real fear on trails is Clowns (have you seen "IT" by Stephen King), or Ghosts (have you seen poltergeist).  Not even bells with help you with these creepy dudes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, our list of supporters is growing and growing!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm scared to show up.  IRA and Bozo are planning another trap for me.  Where is the "Save the Bear" club?   <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS - If you do have another Roll event, I'll bring the Ghost Poop and Clown Cake, and we can play burn the boxers and pin the tail on the bozo, two of my favorite games!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That would be great, Boots. My kids have heard me talk about you and were a little starstruck at the prospect of meeting you (you are a letterboxing rockstar with the 6-11 year old set).  : )<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We're in campsite 53. We'll be here until tomorrow afternoon. This morning's plan is to enjoy some campfire bears (thank you for sharing that tradition, Baby Bear) and then to hit the boxing trail. It would be great to meet up with you.

<div>Just to set the record straight, it's <strong>Fort Worth</strong>, NOT Dallas, where Viewfinder calls home.  Actually, north of Fort Worth but still in Tarrant Co., <em>not</em> Dallas Co. And agrees that at least <em>driving </em>in Dallas is indeed hell.  And I really like bears, especially little baby bears.  Not sure about clowns and ghosts.</div>

It was a gorgeous day and they were finding a lot of boxes.  Phoenix8 showed me some of his stamps and I was very impressed with his carving ability.  He promised to plant more boxes in his area, the Golden Triangle, and I can't wait to make a trip down there to find and maybe plant one or two myself.  I thought I saw a little bear sniffing around for cinnamon, but I'm not sure, it might have just been a raccoon.<br/>

&gt; hell.  And I really like bears, especially little baby bears.  Not sure<br/>
&gt; about clowns and ghosts.<br/>

<br/>
We've had a great spring break - we started with camping and boxing at Double Lake and meeting you and then we met up with Open Space and Wry Me today in Alvin.<br/>
<br/>
Letterboxing folks continue to be some of the most gracious and friendly folks you could hope to come across. I feel fortunate to be a part of this community.<br/>

      I just want to let everyone know Double Lake has been closed due to lack of funding related to the government shutdown since it is a National Forest recreation facility.  Lionsmane asked me about it today because he is planning to come to the Delicious Delights event and was planning to box at Double Lake, so I went over to find out about it and the gate is closed and posted.  There is a law against trespassing on  a federal property that is posted as closed. <br/><br/><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div><br/>
