Well, after much deliberation, Baby Bear and I decided to have TALE 14 at Martin Dies Jr. State Park.  It will be on March 25, 2017, and the theme will be March Madness.  This can include much more than basketball, and I expect you Mad Hatters will be quite creative.  Even though it is almost a year away, you can sign up on AQ now if you want, and see more information on the TALE 14 webpage.<br/><br/><a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?eventId=3666" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?eventId=3666</a><br/><br/><a href="http://sileagle.webs.com/tale14.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://sileagle.webs.com/tale14.htm</a><br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><p><span><br/></span></p>

                    <html><body><span>We've been out of touch for the last couple of weeks, visiting Junction and South Llano River State Park.  That park has absolutely no Internet and no cell phone service, so we were really isolated, and haven't been following the recent letterboxing news.  I think Martin Dies, Jr. is a great park and an excellent choice, well worth the extra miles for the Central Texas folks.  The park is heavily forested, with many miles of trails (bring your own SPORES).  There are many camping spots and cabins, on a lake with creeks.  The cabins are new, having been added since the hurricane damage a few years ago.  If you saw the damage after the hurricane a few years ago, you wouldn't recognize it now.  The clean-up and restoration has been amazing.  I'd advise you to make reservations now, as it is very popular in the spring.  </span><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>Ditto, Blue Butterfly. It was another great TALE event. So fun to connect with good friends, and meet new ones! Silver Eagle and Baby Bear hit another home run! And Echo and Stitches, thanks for Friday night and Night Boxing. </p><div>Want to give special thanks to Nurse Bulldogger. She stepped up with advice and diagnosis for Bird Dog, who got bit big time by horse fly. Not as dramatic as a snake bite, but swelling and redness from wrist to middle arm. She and Yertle even got meds from him at drugstore Saturday night when they went into town for gas. Now that's what I call the Letterbox Spirit! Thanks, Bulldogger. </div><div>Happy Trails, everyone.
