First let me say it has taken me this long to get over the saddness of <br/>
missing the gathering in Brazos to even be able to tell you all how <br/>
jealous I am of the fun you had.  I'm most sad about not meeting you <br/>
all face to face, I guess you will have to remain a mystery until next <br/>
spring!  I am glad everyone had such a good time.  We were able to get <br/>
out to Brazos last Saturday for a little boxing...Ruby, Naomi found <br/>
her box, what a beautiful logbook!  Since she is too little to carve a <br/>
stamp she left her footprints in the book for you.  We also found <br/>
Bonnie alive and well, then it was on to the "Good Luck" box (hope it <br/>
works!)  We also planted a new box, "Armadillo numero uno"...so brush <br/>
up on your Spanish...clues will be posted soon!  We wanted to get the <br/>
horseshoe box as well, but the kids had had it.  That is the trouble <br/>
with boxing with the 4 and under crowd.  So close, but yet so far.  Oh <br/>
well, it's always good to save something for the next trip!  PS  Not <br/>
too long ago someone posted asking about the Pirates Booty box, it has <br/>
been reported missing, so I'll let you know when it is replaced.  -<br/>
