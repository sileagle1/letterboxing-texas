far, I have these updates to report:<br>
<br>
--Ghostly Lady of White Rock Lake--she's no longer haunting Telge<br>
park, but may shortly pop up in the Dallas area.  A huge thanks to<br>
Celtic Lions for lending her to the Houston boxing community!<br>
<br>
--Placed:  Gleeful Grinch and i risked it all for bad haiku.  Gleeful<br>
Grinch will probably be pulled around February or so, because the park<br>
where he's stashed is scheduled for improvements.  Bad haiku may be a<br>
little puzzling, but you know I can't resist (hoping to place some<br>
more mysteries soon).<br>
<br>
--Checked on some that I hadn't had reports on recently: <br>
Emma/Franklin/Nurse/Spy, Missing Spots?  and Time Flies are all doing<br>
great and required no maintenance.  That's the way we like 'em! <br>
Behaving boxes rock!<br>
<br>
I have a few more to place this week or next, including one that is<br>
going to be a super special surprise box for Houston area letterboxers.  <br>
<br>
Here's to great weather!  This is my favorite boxing season.<br>
