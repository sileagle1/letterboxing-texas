                    <div class="plaintext-content">Closer to downtown there are 2 boxes at Brackenridge Park.  The park <br/>
has just had extensive renovations, and I can't confirm that they are <br/>
still there.<br/>
<br/>
I am happy to report,the two boxes in the park are still there as of a <br/>
couple of weeks ago. Both boxes were repoerted in good shape in <br/>
August. They are GO SPURS Go! and Swingle Singers. They are close <br/>
together in the park. <br/>
