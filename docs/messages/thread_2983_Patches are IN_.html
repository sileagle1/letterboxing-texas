&gt; &gt; Well - I can try to get them to someone who will be attending the<br/>
&gt; &gt; gathering for sure (I'm penciled in - waiting on a grandbaby so<br/>
EVERYTHING<br/>
&gt; &gt; is penciled in for the moment).  Maybe PuddleSplasher?  She<br/>
ordered patches<br/>
&gt; &gt; and will be there.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I did so well - I signed the little notice last night and hung it<br/>
back on<br/>
&gt; &gt; the front door to give them permission to deliver without a<br/>
signature, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; when Fearless Fox left the house around 11 this morning, he<br/>
thought they had<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried again and so had hung another notice on the door - and took the<br/>
&gt; &gt; notice back in the house.  Consequently, when they DID try to<br/>
deliver, no<br/>
&gt; &gt; one was home again.  I called them and asked them to try again, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; tomorrow...surely tomorrow - and I told Fearless Fox to leave his<br/>
