She is letting me know, after six years of having my boxes in the park,Â  I now need a permit. I am assuming she is new to the park, since the boxes have been there so long, without anyone contacting me about a permit. She did thank me for helping draw attention to the park, and therefore having visitors that may not have visited without the boxes. <br/>Happy Boxing!<br/>BB<br/></font></font></font>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">She is going to let me do it by email. She said there are caches in the park that are not permitted either, and she is contacting them also. As been said before, it is not consistent. according to the Ranger, one of the boxes is missing, which I will not replace, (#1 by the CCC pavilion) and the other one needs a new logbook. I will get up there as soon as I can to see what to do with box #2.<br>
