                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally got to go Letterboxing, at least plant some. Been trap in <br/>
the house, which is under construction and has been forever. Of <br/>
course the weather has not helped. Anyway, got my Texas Saltwater <br/>
Series started in Baytown. Planted two there to thank Bailey's Bunch <br/>
for all LBs I got to find close to home. It also helped that my <br/>
daughter had a Volleyball game in Baytown, Saturday morning.<br/>
<br/>
My Husband(Big Daddy) has been helping me find the hiding spots, <br/>
mostly Parks with boat ramps. He wanting to plant them on buoys, <br/>
which you for have to take a boat to get to them, I said no.  I <br/>
don't know how many will be in the series but all I can say is we <br/>
have a long coast line. The next ones will be around Kemah/Texas <br/>
City, got to thank those Hoppers for all those hunts down that way. <br/>
Plus, we fish alot out that way.<br/>
<br/>
Next week, looks promising for LBing. Be in Schulenburg again all <br/>
week. Got a few to plant there. I am crossing my fingers that I make <br/>
it to La Vaca county to place one or two there, here is to hoping <br/>
anyway.<br/>
<br/>
As Big Daddy always says "Yall have Fun"<br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tejas Angel<br/>

                    <html><body><div>You might want to doublecheck the buoy thing.  I can't remember the details (a little too much sun exposure this weekend!), but awhile back here locally there was some hubbub about it being illegal to attach anything to buoys on public waters.  It mighta been a local ordinance, or it mighta been a state thing, or it mighta been one of those weird federal maritime regulations that occasionally crop up on fresh waters, or it mighta been somebody talking out of their head, but I recall something about it that was odd and it had to do with attaching something to the buoy.  I remember that much because I cataloged in my mind that it would be a bad idea to try to do a letterbox on one.

<div>This probably wasn't worth even .02, but hopefully you at least came out even.</div>
