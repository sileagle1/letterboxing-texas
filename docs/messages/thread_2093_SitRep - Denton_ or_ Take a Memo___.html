                    <html><body><div>I really miss having ol' SJZ around the house, getting in the way, stirring things up, keeping life interesting.  Raising her was a heck of a lot of fun, with a few moments of frustration, aggravation and panicked worry to go along with it.  All in all, though, she's a great young lady and it was really good to go visit her in her new home town and see her apartment and hang out with her and her boyfriend.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - being a good boxer, I wasn't going to pass on the opportunity to do a little boxing while in Denton!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ has become quite the night owl, but still a die hard boxer.  I called her Friday evening about midnight to tell her I would be picking her up about 8 a.m. to go boxing.  She was ready - with the coffee pot brewing - when I called her to tell her I was on the way.  I left Fearless Fox and Lightning snoozing soundly in the hotel room - the lazy bums!  Anyway, SJZ had apparently gotten her 3 hours of sleep between 4:30 
a.m. and 7:30 a.m. and all was right in her world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We headed out and as was customary, I handed her the book and declared her to be the navigator.  Now SJZ has her own way of navigating, and to most folks it may not make a lot of sense, but she's ridden shotgun with me enough that I know how to follow her directions, so it was all good.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>If you were going to box in a new county, wouldn't you start with the courthouse?  Of course you would!  And so did we.  As we approached the stunning Denton County Courthouse, we noticed that it sure seemed busy for a downtown Saturday morning.  We got ready to park and get out, when we realized there was a herd of people surrounding the courthouse stooping away, as though trying to break in the lower windows en masse.  There were dozens of them!  We watched them long enough to figure out they were picking up tiny pieces of trash near the building - whew!  We wouldn't have to testify at their trials for breaking and entering!  We realized right away that we had been distracted from our purpose, so we consulted the clues again and proceeded to the box which, thankfully, wasn't near those windows.  As we sat together and casually stamped in, we noticed that almost as if on whistle command, the litter pickers/window breakers stood up and file away from the building.  How odd!  We buttoned the box back up and recovered well, then decided to go to Jupiter Coffee for a quick cup of coffee (we had finished off the pot at her house) before we hit the trail in ernest.  As we were walking to the coffee shop, we spotted a sign announcing a breakfast buffet - right there downtown!  Suddenly our stomachs reminded us that we were really hungry, so we stopped in and had an excellent breakfast and planned out our day.  As we sat by the window in the restaurant, we noticed that people were beginning to accumulate on the sidewalk and I began to wonder if I had accidentally forgotten that it was Friday and I was supposed to be at work.  I asked SJZ if it was Friday or Saturday, and she assured me it was Saturday.  Whew!  I wouldn't have to think up some crazy story about being in Denton instead of at my desk!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The word "parade" started rustling through the restaurant until we were sure we had actually heard it, so we asked if there was to be a parade.  The waitress looked at us as if we were crazy and replied that there was indeed!  Well, we had the ideal parking spot for a parade - sitting in the window of a restaurant right on the parade route!  We got another cup of coffee and settled in for the parade, deciding we could leave our letterboxing until a little later on.  And so we waited.  And waited.  I finally asked what time the parade was to start - not for thirty more minutes, and it would be another thirty minutes still before it passed in front of us!  We decided we had been to a parade before and mosied along, relinquishing our table to another eager parade waiter.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We decided to head for the more southern letterboxes first, so we jumped on I35 and headed south.  We kept heading south until finally I realized the interstate looked nothing like it had when I went north on it the evening before.  We saw a sign that said I35 - W!  We were supposed to be on I35 E!  At that moment, I made a mental note to move if my town ever got two interstates with the same number.  Of course, I had another mental note already on file telling me to move if my town ever got an interstate in the first place.  Now you may wonder why SJZ didn't notice this small fact - and frankly, I did too.  But then I thought about her style of navigation and I understood entirely.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we began cutting cross-country to find I35 - E!, we got to talking about the interesting things she had seen since she moved to Denton.  She told me about leaving the movie theater one night and taking a wrong turn and finding herself near the cemetery of the State School and she told me about the weird building they had discovered that had a buff armed guard as big as a house who wouldn't tell them what the building was, only that it wasn't open to the public.  Hmph!  Does that strike your interest?  It sure piqued mine!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We eventually made our way back to town and we decided that before we continued letterboxing we would try to find out what that building was.  We found it again fairly easily and sure enough as we approached it, TWO guards as big as houses moved out of the guardhouse in perfect synchronization, blocking the drive and even part of the flower beds, I guess in case we decided we wanted to jump the hedges to get in, either that or just because they would've had to have hugged each other to keep from spilling over the side of the drive.  These guys were big and buff, and if that weren't enough, they had guns - REAL guns!  I feigned ignorance (not hard for me to do!) and asked them if this was the Higgins Distribution Center.  I heard SJZ sigh, but I didn't have time to look at her.  I was busy watching the faces of these two guys.  They replied that it wasn't, and that it was not open to the public.  I bit my lip in pretend frustration and asked if they had any idea where it might be.  One of the guys seemed genuinely puzzled (gosh, I wonder why!) and said all he could figure is that it might be (pointing) over there to an industrial park.  They sensed my doubt and the other guy said "the only thing behind us is a government installation".  I gave up then finding the Higgins DC there and was about to back up when they motioned me through and said I could pull through to turn around.  I felt this was somewhat of a victory, but I didn't dare do anything BUT pull through and leave.  SJZ and I waited until we were well away from the government installation and high fived our qualified success!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By then, Fearless Fox was calling and complaining that he had forgotten to get sunscreen and they were ready to go swimming, so in the interest of skin cancer prevention, we detoured ourselves yet again and went to Walgreen's for sunscreen and wound up shopping the clearance aisle pretty hard too.  It was a good clearance sale.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Alas, by the time we got the sunscreen back to the hotel it was almost time for SJZ to go to work and it was way too hot to letterbox alone, so I made yet another mental note to pick up where we left off on Sunday morning.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That wasn't, however, the end of our day.  We hijacked SJZ's boyfriend, Rxkaffee, and convinced him to play tour guide.  Because it was between semesters, the college wasn't having their Saturday afternoon planetarium show and we were bummed.  We decided we would just have to go to Grapevine and drink wine for the rest of the afternoon.  I got on Rxkaffee's computer to look up wineries, but he (being a bigtime computer geek) has some sort of weird computer with a strange keyboard, so all I could do was point and click and I never could figure his printer out.  He was downstairs playing Jenga with Lightning and I wasn't about to admit defeat, so I used my cell phone to make voice notes of addresses and studied the map so I knew the streets and roads in the area.  Finally, we jumped on I35 and headed south - again.  And again, we realized we were supposed to be on I35 E! and we were on I35 W.  Fearless Fox blamed me, but I swear I told him to be careful about that.  We eventually came to one of the roads I remembered and we began cutting cross-country to find Grapevine, which we eventually did!  Before we hit the first winery, we ate at Quiznos, but rxkaffee didn't eat anything, which he came to regret later when we started wine-tasting.  Turns out, the wineries in Grapevine close up pretty early, so we only got to try the one.  I bought a Port and a Blanc du Bois.  We headed back up to Denton and this time took I35 - E! and we stopped off and released Rxkaffee.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I knew better than to tempt fate two days in a row with SJZ - having her up early and ready to go on one day was an amazing feat in itself, so I quit while I was ahead.  Sunday morning I got up and headed out by myself, intent on using the hour and a half I had available for finding those three southern boxes in Denton.  Now I had one small problem.  The maps I had printed really weren't that good after all, and two of the three sets of clues didn't have directions from a major street - just said to start in thus and so park.  Using my meager maps, I worked and worked on finding one of the parks, but I never could.  Tried to stop and get directions twice, to no avail.  I started to pull a cop over to ask him, but that was a little weird the last time I did that (reference the SWAT encounter back in July), so I decided to leave the one I saw to his own devices.  I finally went along and found the location of the 2nd box, but there were neighbors around and I couldn't figure out how to explain my clunker car parked in this upscale planned community while I dug through the beds in their entryway.   Decided to come back at a less conspicuous time.  My time was up by now and I had to head back to the hotel to pick up Fearless Fox and Lightning and SJZ and Rxkaffee so we could take SJZ out for her birthday adventure.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now SJZ loves to camp.  She is a camper extraordinaire.  She can throw a tent up so fast you can't even see it happen - you just wonder how that tent appeared at your feet.  And at camp cooking, she's a rare talent.  I just hope her landlord explained to her that she can't have open fires in place of using a stove in her apartment.  She really likes anything to do with the outdoors.  But being a poor working girl now, she has enough trouble stirring up gas money, much less entry fees to go have fun, so Fearless Fox and I gave her a State Park Pass for her birthday.  You would've thought we had handed her fine diamonds.  It gratifed my heart that my girl values such a thing.  We also gave her her own lightweight backpacking tent, which she immediately took out and put up.  I think Rxkaffee was impressed and maybe even intimidated - he's never been camping!  Where else would you take a girl like that for her birthday, but to the State Park?  So we headed out to Ray Roberts Lake SP to celebrate.  Once there, we presented her park pass to her and then we all went and explored the camping areas.  Finally, we headed to the swimming area and while they were all swimming and slipped away to plant a box in honor of her birthday.  I got it planted, but not without nearly doing myself in in the heat.  I made still another mental note not to take even short hikes at 3:30 in the afternoon on days with temperatures over 100 degrees.  After a couple tall gatorades and three or four bottles of water, I decided I would live.   But I had success - the box was planted and the clues are now posted!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But was our day done?  Nooooo!  As we all wound down, we packed up to leave so I could try for the 380 boxes before we left Denton.  All got in the car, and the car engine roared to life and - kept roaring.  Yuk!  It did NOT sound good!  Our water pump had gone out!  We had two guys with reasonably good mechanic skills, but no tools to be found and no auto parts store around for miles.  We finally called TX Flutterby's husband, Fearless Fox's brother, and he came out from Corsicana with his car hauler and picked us up about 10 
p.m. and all five of us piled into his truck for the trip out of there.  We managed to drop SJZ and Rxkaffee off in Denton, but my suggestion that we do a little night boxing was NOT well received!  I'm sure the LSS brothers would've been happy to let me and Lightning go box hunting in the dark if we had been going out by 380, but it turns out we went by I35.  We headed south - all relieved at being rescured.  Finally it occurred to Fearless Fox and me that the road looked nothing like it had when we had come up on Friday evening, and we suddenly realized we were on I35 - W and we wanted to be on I35 - E!

<div>
<div>Oh Lucy! I just hope next time you come this way, I'm available to be your tour guide! I have knowledge of two things that will be beneficial to you - 1) the difference between I-35 E and I-35 W, and 2) where all the vineyards are in Grapevine (in fact I have a letterbox hidden at one of them)! After 3 1/2 wks in Calif at Cowboys Training Camp, my son-in-law will be home tonight after the game around 2:00 a.m., so my recent duties as babysitter/grandparent will be much less required than it has been during the past month.</div>

<div>But was our day done?  Nooooo!  As we all wound down, we packed up to leave so I could try for the 380 boxes before we left Denton.  All got in the car, and the car engine roared to life and - kept roaring.  Yuk!  It did NOT sound good!  Our water pump had gone out!  We had two guys with reasonably good mechanic skills, but no tools to be found and no auto parts store around for miles.  We finally called TX Flutterby's husband, Fearless Fox's brother, and he came out from Corsicana with his car hauler and picked us up about 10 p.m. and all five of us piled into his truck for the trip out of there.  We managed to drop SJZ and Rxkaffee off in Denton, but my suggestion that we do a little night boxing was NOT well received!  I'm sure the LSS brothers would've been happy to let me and Lightning go box hunting in the dark if we had been going out by 380, but it turns out we went by I35.  We headed south - all relieved at being rescured.  Finally it occurred to Fearless Fox and me that the road looked nothing like it had when we had come up on Friday evening, and we suddenly realized we were on I35 - W and we wanted to be on I35 - E! </div>

<div>Oh Lucy! I just hope next time you come this way, I'm available to be your tour guide! I have knowledge of two things that will be beneficial to you - 1) the difference between I-35 E and I-35 W, and 2) where all the vineyards are in Grapevine (in fact I have a letterbox hidden at one of them)! After 3 1/2 wks in Calif at Cowboys Training Camp, my son-in-law will be home tonight after the game around 2:00

<div><b>Subject:</b> [letterboxingtexas] SitRep - Denton, or, Take a Memo...</div>
<div><br/> </div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div>I really miss having ol' SJZ around the house, getting in the way, stirring things up, keeping life interesting.  Raising her was a heck of a lot of fun, with a few moments of frustration, aggravation and panicked worry to go along with it.  All in all, though, she's a great young lady and it was really good to go visit her in her new home town and see her apartment and hang out with her and her boyfriend.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - being a good boxer, I wasn't going to pass on the opportunity to do a little boxing while in Denton!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ has become quite the night owl, but still a die hard boxer.  I called her Friday evening about midnight to tell her I would be picking her up about 8 a.m. to go boxing.  She was ready - with the coffee pot brewing - when I called her to tell her I was on the way.  I left Fearless Fox and Lightning snoozing soundly in the hotel room - the lazy bums!  Anyway, SJZ had apparently gotten her 3 hours of sleep between 4:30 
a.m. and 7:30 a.m. and all was right in her world.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We headed out and as was customary, I handed her the book and declared her to be the navigator.  Now SJZ has her own way of navigating, and to most folks it may not make a lot of sense, but she's ridden shotgun with me enough that I know how to follow her directions, so it was all good. 
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>If you were going to box in a new county, wouldn't you start with the courthouse?  Of course you would!  And so did we.  As we approached the stunning Denton County Courthouse, we noticed that it sure seemed busy for a downtown Saturday morning.  We got ready to park and get out, when we realized there was a herd of people surrounding the courthouse stooping away, as though trying to break in the lower windows en masse.  There were dozens of them!  We watched them long enough to figure out they were picking up tiny pieces of trash near the building - whew!  We wouldn't have to testify at their trials for breaking and entering!  We realized right away that we had been distracted from our purpose, so we consulted the clues again and proceeded to the box which, thankfully, wasn't near those windows.  As we sat together and casually stamped in, we noticed that almost as if on whistle command, the litter pickers/window breakers stood up and file away from the building.  How odd!  We buttoned the box back up and recovered well, then decided to go to Jupiter Coffee for a quick cup of coffee (we had finished off the pot at her house) before we hit the trail in ernest.  As we were walking to the coffee shop, we spotted a sign announcing a breakfast buffet - right there downtown!  Suddenly our stomachs reminded us that we were really hungry, so we stopped in and had an excellent breakfast and planned out our day.  As we sat by the window in the restaurant, we noticed that people were beginning to accumulate on the sidewalk and I began to wonder if I had accidentally forgotten that it was Friday and I was supposed to be at work.  I asked SJZ if it was Friday or Saturday, and she assured me it was Saturday.  Whew!  I wouldn't have to think up some crazy story about being in Denton instead of at my desk!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The word "parade" started rustling through the restaurant until we were sure we had actually heard it, so we asked if there was to be a parade.  The waitress looked at us as if we were crazy and replied that there was indeed!  Well, we had the ideal parking spot for a parade - sitting in the window of a restaurant right on the parade route!  We got another cup of coffee and settled in for the parade, deciding we could leave our letterboxing until a little later on.  And so we waited.  And waited.  I finally asked what time the parade was to start - not for thirty more minutes, and it would be another thirty minutes still before it passed in front of us!  We decided we had been to a parade before and mosied along, relinquishing our table to another eager parade waiter. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We decided to head for the more southern letterboxes first, so we jumped on I35 and headed south.  We kept heading south until finally I realized the interstate looked nothing like it had when I went north on it the evening before.  We saw a sign that said I35 - W!  We were supposed to be on I35 E!  At that moment, I made a mental note to move if my town ever got two interstates with the same number.  Of course, I had another mental note already on file telling me to move if my town ever got an interstate in the first place.  Now you may wonder why SJZ didn't notice this small fact - and frankly, I did too.  But then I thought about her style of navigation and I understood entirely. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we began cutting cross-country to find I35 - E!, we got to talking about the interesting things she had seen since she moved to Denton.  She told me about leaving the movie theater one night and taking a wrong turn and finding herself near the cemetery of the State School and she told me about the weird building they had discovered that had a buff armed guard as big as a house who wouldn't tell them what the building was, only that it wasn't open to the public.  Hmph!  Does that strike your interest?  It sure piqued mine!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We eventually made our way back to town and we decided that before we continued letterboxing we would try to find out what that building was.  We found it again fairly easily and sure enough as we approached it, TWO guards as big as houses moved out of the guardhouse in perfect synchronization, blocking the drive and even part of the flower beds, I guess in case we decided we wanted to jump the hedges to get in, either that or just because they would've had to have hugged each other to keep from spilling over the side of the drive.  These guys were big and buff, and if that weren't enough, they had guns - REAL guns!  I feigned ignorance (not hard for me to do!) and asked them if this was the Higgins Distribution Center.  I heard SJZ sigh, but I didn't have time to look at her.  I was busy watching the faces of these two guys.  They replied that it wasn't, and that it was not open to the public.  I bit my lip in pretend frustration and asked if they had any idea where it might be.  One of the guys seemed genuinely puzzled (gosh, I wonder why!) and said all he could figure is that it might be (pointing) over there to an industrial park.  They sensed my doubt and the other guy said "the only thing behind us is a government installation".  I gave up then finding the Higgins DC there and was about to back up when they motioned me through and said I could pull through to turn around.  I felt this was somewhat of a victory, but I didn't dare do anything BUT pull through and leave.  SJZ and I waited until we were well away from the government installation and high fived our qualified success! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By then, Fearless Fox was calling and complaining that he had forgotten to get sunscreen and they were ready to go swimming, so in the interest of skin cancer prevention, we detoured ourselves yet again and went to Walgreen's for sunscreen and wound up shopping the clearance aisle pretty hard too.  It was a good clearance sale. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Alas, by the time we got the sunscreen back to the hotel it was almost time for SJZ to go to work and it was way too hot to letterbox alone, so I made yet another mental note to pick up where we left off on Sunday morning. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That wasn't, however, the end of our day.  We hijacked SJZ's boyfriend, Rxkaffee, and convinced him to play tour guide.  Because it was between semesters, the college wasn't having their Saturday afternoon planetarium show and we were bummed.  We decided we would just have to go to Grapevine and drink wine for the rest of the afternoon.  I got on Rxkaffee's computer to look up wineries, but he (being a bigtime computer geek) has some sort of weird computer with a strange keyboard, so all I could do was point and click and I never could figure his printer out.  He was downstairs playing Jenga with Lightning and I wasn't about to admit defeat, so I used my cell phone to make voice notes of addresses and studied the map so I knew the streets and roads in the area.  Finally, we jumped on I35 and headed south - again.  And again, we realized we were supposed to be on I35 E! and we were on I35 W.  Fearless Fox blamed me, but I swear I told him to be careful about that.  We eventually came to one of the roads I remembered and we began cutting cross-country to find Grapevine, which we eventually did!  Before we hit the first winery, we ate at Quiznos, but rxkaffee didn't eat anything, which he came to regret later when we started wine-tasting.  Turns out, the wineries in Grapevine close up pretty early, so we only got to try the one.  I bought a Port and a Blanc du Bois.  We headed back up to Denton and this time took I35 - E! and we stopped off and released Rxkaffee. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I knew better than to tempt fate two days in a row with SJZ - having her up early and ready to go on one day was an amazing feat in itself, so I quit while I was ahead.  Sunday morning I got up and headed out by myself, intent on using the hour and a half I had available for finding those three southern boxes in Denton.  Now I had one small problem.  The maps I had printed really weren't that good after all, and two of the three sets of clues didn't have directions from a major street - just said to start in thus and so park.  Using my meager maps, I worked and worked on finding one of the parks, but I never could.  Tried to stop and get directions twice, to no avail.  I started to pull a cop over to ask him, but that was a little weird the last time I did that (reference the SWAT encounter back in July), so I decided to leave the one I saw to his own devices.  I finally went along and found the location of the 2nd box, but there were neighbors around and I couldn't figure out how to explain my clunker car parked in this upscale planned community while I dug through the beds in their entryway.   Decided to come back at a less conspicuous time.  My time was up by now and I had to head back to the hotel to pick up Fearless Fox and Lightning and SJZ and Rxkaffee so we could take SJZ out for her birthday adventure. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now SJZ loves to camp.  She is a camper extraordinaire.  She can throw a tent up so fast you can't even see it happen - you just wonder how that tent appeared at your feet.  And at camp cooking, she's a rare talent.  I just hope her landlord explained to her that she can't have open fires in place of using a stove in her apartment.  She really likes anything to do with the outdoors.  But being a poor working girl now, she has enough trouble stirring up gas money, much less entry fees to go have fun, so Fearless Fox and I gave her a State Park Pass for her birthday.  You would've thought we had handed her fine diamonds.  It gratifed my heart that my girl values such a thing.  We also gave her her own lightweight backpacking tent, which she immediately took out and put up.  I think Rxkaffee was impressed and maybe even intimidated - he's never been camping!  Where else would you take a girl like that for her birthday, but to the State Park?  So we headed out to Ray Roberts Lake SP to celebrate.  Once there, we presented her park pass to her and then we all went and explored the camping areas.  Finally, we headed to the swimming area and while they were all swimming and slipped away to plant a box in honor of her birthday.  I got it planted, but not without nearly doing myself in in the heat.  I made still another mental note not to take even short hikes at 3:30 in the afternoon on days with temperatures over 100 degrees.  After a couple tall gatorades and three or four bottles of water, I decided I would live.   But I had success - the box was planted and the clues are now posted! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But was our day done?  Nooooo!  As we all wound down, we packed up to leave so I could try for the 380 boxes before we left Denton.  All got in the car, and the car engine roared to life and - kept roaring.  Yuk!  It did NOT sound good!  Our water pump had gone out!  We had two guys with reasonably good mechanic skills, but no tools to be found and no auto parts store around for miles.  We finally called TX Flutterby's husband, Fearless Fox's brother, and he came out from Corsicana with his car hauler and picked us up about 10 
p.m. and all five of us piled into his truck for the trip out of there.  We managed to drop SJZ and Rxkaffee off in Denton, but my suggestion that we do a little night boxing was NOT well received!  I'm sure the LSS brothers would've been happy to let me and Lightning go box hunting in the dark if we had been going out by 380, but it turns out we went by I35.  We headed south - all relieved at being rescured.  Finally it occurred to Fearless Fox and me that the road looked nothing like it had when we had come up on Friday evening, and we suddenly realized we were on I35 - W and we wanted to be on I35 - E!

 didn't dare do anything BUT pull through and leave.  SJZ and I waited until we were well away from the government installation and high fived our qualified success! </div> <div> </div> <div>By then, Fearless Fox was calling and complaining that he had forgotten to get sunscreen and they were ready to go swimming, so in the interest of skin cancer prevention, we detoured ourselves yet again and went to Walgreen's for sunscreen and wound up shopping the clearance aisle pretty hard too.  It was a good clearance sale. </div> <div> </div> <div>Alas, by the time we got the sunscreen back to the hotel it was almost time for SJZ to go to work and it was way too hot to letterbox alone, so I made yet another mental note to pick up where we left off on Sunday morning. </div> <div> </div> <div>That wasn't, however, the end of our day.  We hijacked SJZ's boyfriend, Rxkaffee, and convinced him to play tour guide.  Because it was between
 semesters, the college wasn't having their Saturday afternoon planetarium show and we were bummed.  We decided we would just have to go to Grapevine and drink wine for the rest of the afternoon.  I got on Rxkaffee's computer to look up wineries, but he (being a bigtime computer geek) has some sort of weird computer with a strange keyboard, so all I could do was point and click and I never could figure his printer out.  He was downstairs playing Jenga with Lightning and I wasn't about to admit defeat, so I used my cell phone to make voice notes of addresses and studied the map so I knew the streets and roads in the area.  Finally, we jumped on I35 and headed south - again.  And again, we realized we were supposed to be on I35 E! and we were on I35 W.  Fearless Fox blamed me, but I swear I told him to be careful about that.  We eventually came to one of the roads I remembered and we began cutting cross-country to find Grapevine, which we
 eventually did!  Before we hit the first winery, we ate at Quiznos, but rxkaffee didn't eat anything, which he came to regret later when we started wine-tasting.  Turns out, the wineries in Grapevine close up pretty early, so we only got to try the one.  I bought a Port and a Blanc du Bois.  We headed back up to Denton and this time took I35 - E! and we stopped off and released Rxkaffee. </div> <div> </div> <div>I knew better than to tempt fate two days in a row with SJZ - having her up early and ready to go on one day was an amazing feat in itself, so I quit while I was ahead.  Sunday morning I got up and headed out by myself, intent on using the hour and a half I had available for finding those three southern boxes in Denton.  Now I had one small problem.  The maps I had printed really weren't that good after all, and two of the three sets of clues didn't have directions from a major street - just said to start in thus and so
 park.  Using my meager maps, I worked and worked on finding one of the parks, but I never could.  Tried to stop and get directions twice, to no avail.  I started to pull a cop over to ask him, but that was a little weird the last time I did that (reference the SWAT encounter back in July), so I decided to leave the one I saw to his own devices.  I finally went along and found the location of the 2nd box, but there were neighbors around and I couldn't figure out how to explain my clunker car parked in this upscale planned community while I dug through the beds in their entryway.   Decided to come back at a less conspicuous time.  My time was up by now and I had to head back to the hotel to pick up Fearless Fox and Lightning and SJZ and Rxkaffee so we could take SJZ out for her birthday adventure. </div> <div> </div> <div>Now SJZ loves to camp.  She is a camper extraordinaire.  She can throw a tent up so fast you can't
 even see it happen - you just wonder how that tent appeared at your feet.  And at camp cooking, she's a rare talent.  I just hope her landlord explained to her that she can't have open fires in place of using a stove in her apartment.  She really likes anything to do with the outdoors.  But being a poor working girl now, she has enough trouble stirring up gas money, much less entry fees to go have fun, so Fearless Fox and I gave her a State Park Pass for her birthday.  You would've thought we had handed her fine diamonds.  It gratifed my heart that my girl values such a thing.  We also gave her her own lightweight backpacking tent, which she immediately took out and put up.  I think Rxkaffee was impressed and maybe even intimidated - he's never been camping!  Where else would you take a girl like that for her birthday, but to the State Park?  So we headed out to Ray Roberts Lake SP to celebrate.  Once there, we
 presented her park pass to her and then we all went and explored the camping areas.  Finally, we headed to the swimming area and while they were all swimming and slipped away to plant a box in honor of her birthday.  I got it planted, but not without nearly doing myself in in the heat.  I made still another mental note not to take even short hikes at 3:30 in the afternoon on days with temperatures over 100 degrees.  After a couple tall gatorades and three or four bottles of water, I decided I would live.   But I had success - the box was planted and the clues are now posted! </div> <div> </div> <div>But was our day done?  Nooooo!  As we all wound down, we packed up to leave so I could try for the 380 boxes before we left Denton.  All got in the car, and the car engine roared to life and - kept roaring.  Yuk!  It did NOT sound good!  Our water pump had gone out!  We had two guys with reasonably good
 mechanic skills, but no tools to be found and no auto parts store around for miles.  We finally called TX Flutterby's husband, Fearless Fox's brother, and he came out from Corsicana with his car hauler and picked us up about 10 p.m. and all five of us piled into his truck for the trip out of there.  We managed to drop SJZ and Rxkaffee off in Denton, but my suggestion that we do a little night boxing was NOT well received!  I'm sure the LSS brothers would've been happy to let me and Lightning go box hunting in the dark if we had been going out by 380, but it turns out we went by I35.  We headed south - all relieved at being rescured.  Finally it occurred to Fearless Fox and me that the road looked nothing like it had when we had come up on Friday evening, and we suddenly realized we were on I35 - W and we wanted to be on I35 - E! </div> <div> </div> <div>ARRRRGGGGGHHHH!</div> <div> </div> <div><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot

<div>Lucy, I'll bet that when you were on your cross-country cut-through to 
Grapevine, you were zipping right past some of my boxes, or at least within 
spitting distance of the one in Roanoke and those in Southlake (plus, those in 
Grapevine in Heritage Park are just a couple of blocks from downtown where you 
were probably sitting and sipping!).  Maybe next time!  (And maybe

<div>And of course, that's why I enjoy boxing with SJZ.  She has this zany way of navigating, which half the time is dead-wrong, but somehow we manage to get where we are going in the end.  But her navigation skills are why we often don't find as many boxes as we would've hoped, although we do manage to find lots of other things that interest us in the meantime!  When she and I went to box up in Dallas at Thanksgiving last year we spent a good couple of hours on Plano Parkway or some such huge street, driving up and down and getting thoroughly turned around and laughing our heads off about it.  And of course, stopping at every Starbucks we saw - we were just a little embarassed when, after an hour and a half, we stopped at the same one again.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am trying really hard not to overload my family with this new <br/>
obsession. But, it's so exciting, the whole process. Choosing which <br/>
box to start with, printing the clues the correct way (had to stop <br/>
looking for Duck, Duck, Goose Friday night because the whole right <br/>
side of the clue was cut off), getting everything ready, then <br/>
actually going on the hunt. Even the stamping in is a process. Do we <br/>
find a table or squat on the ground. Last Saturday I tried to find <br/>
The Curse of the Witness Tree and Mapquest had me all messed up. So <br/>
that's on hold for now. But, it's always in the back of my mind. I <br/>
think about when I'll have a reason to go to Arlington. And with gas <br/>
prices, I like to plan around my regular errands. It makes the <br/>
mundane choirs of life become all part of an exciting game. <br/>
<br/>
I have a whole list of boxes in the botanical gardens. Since there <br/>
are so many I'm going to have to make a day of it. Now, I have to <br/>
plan a picnic, make sure I have no other prior commitments, then <br/>
decide how many can be found before my 5 yr old poops out. To me <br/>
that's as exciting as the search process.<br/>
<br/>
How bad am I addicted? Do I need to start looking for a 12 step <br/>
program already. It hasn't been a week yet.<br/>

&gt; I think it with my spouse it hits overload when traffic and <br/>
unfamiliar  <br/>
&gt; highways and detours are involved, and then when the clues are <br/>
vague and you  <br/>
&gt; really don't know where to tell the driver to turn or park or stop, <br/>
it  gets more <br/>
&gt; stressful, especially when you wind up in the wrong place or on <br/>
the  wrong road <br/>
&gt; and have to turn around. He'd prefer the exploring  and hiking, <br/>
without <br/>
&gt; stopping to hunt for and stamp into  boxes! (Maybe because I make <br/>
so many wrong <br/>
&gt; guesses, and misread clues,  and my spouse winds up finding the box <br/>
and wondering <br/>
&gt; how I ever do it  alone!)   But then, when PuddleSplasher and I go <br/>
out on <br/>
&gt; letterboxing  adventures, that's part of the fun!  Those accidental <br/>
detours and  <br/>
&gt; serendipitous discoveries are part of the adventure. All part of <br/>
the game,  <br/>
&gt; right?  But I have found some wonderful boxes in far away places, <br/>
and  treasure <br/>
&gt; each of those stamps!  And none of them were drive-bys, they  <br/>
involved careful <br/>
&gt; calculations of which ones would be worth the risk of  overload.  <br/>
(I just <br/>
&gt; hate it when, like you said, I estimate wrong on the  overload <br/>
question!)<br/>
