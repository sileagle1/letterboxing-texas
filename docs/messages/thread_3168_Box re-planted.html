     Just letting you know, I have re-planted my Go Spurs Go! Box in <br/>
San Antonio. Same stamp, and the location is about the same as before, <br/>
but a little safer (i hope) Clue has been updated. By the way, I was <br/>
there to watch Lucy Locket's high school band march in the UIL State <br/>
marching contest. They did a great job! They were among the top 18 2a <br/>
bands in the state! <br/>
