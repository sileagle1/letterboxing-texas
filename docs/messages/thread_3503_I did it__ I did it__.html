Harleton for the Longview/LA Initiative! We had SO<br/>
much fun!! I can't wait for someone to try to go find<br/>

warn ya'll, these boxes aren't for those who are in<br/>
search for beautiful stamps. LOL It's for someone who<br/>
is in it for the adventure of the hunt. These were my<br/>
very first stamps that I've ever carved so they aren't<br/>
all that great. I hope to look back on them someday to<br/>
see that I've improved in my carving abilities. :)<br/>
It was kind of funny b/c I told my husband I felt like<br/>
I was leaving my babies out in the wild to face all<br/>
kind of dangers. (Weather, animals, vandalizers, etc.)<br/>
It made me kind of sad. LOL But not sad enough to not<br/>
do it again. I'm already planning my next plants in<br/>
Longview! I may actually like planting more than<br/>
hunting. Well, maybe not, but it's a close second!<br/>
