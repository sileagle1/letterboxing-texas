                    <div class="plaintext-content">The last report had TTB2 going south on I-45, slowing down to exit at <br>
New Waverly.  Somewhere, the person driving the bus was unsure of <br>
where to go, so picked up a pilot/navigator, which promptly turned the <br>
Wrong Way, losing the motorcade.  Taking over again, the rancher from <br>
Central Texas turned left at New Waverly and headed east toward <br>
Coldspring.  Just before getting there, he turned south again and then <br>
left into Double Lake National Recreation Area.  He didn't have to pay <br>
to get in, but I did.  Bearing right, the bus went all the way to the <br>
parking area, where it jumped a curb and went between the concession <br>
stand on the right and the swimming hole on the left, then past the <br>
ampitheater to the trailhead sign at the junction of trails.  Just to <br>
the left was a red, white and blue sign for the Lone Star National <br>
Recreation Trail.  Passing that sign it went 88 steps (I counted <br>
them), to a downed tree lying perpendicular to the trail, then turned <br>
right and followed that tree to where it crossed another log which was <br>
running parallel to the trail.  The driver got out and cleared a spot <br>
to park at the junction of the two logs, then covered the bus with <br>
slabs of bark. I don't know what's going on, but it looks like that <br>
bus is hunkering down for a spell.<br>
