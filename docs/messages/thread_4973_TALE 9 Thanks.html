                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well another TALE has come and gone and I just want to thank everyone who came for making it successful again.  Special thanks to Lone Star Quilter for making and donating a beautiful quilt displaying TX wildlife.  It was won by Blue Butterfly who had the highest bid in the silent auction.  I also want to thank everyone who donated prizes for the raffle, especially Bell Motel, who brought the Smithsonian magazine.  She also brought many pill containers for future letterboxes, made mosaic butterfly cookies that were beautiful and delicious, and was a good sport about "winning" the underwear during the raffle.<br>
<br>
I was glad to see many long-time boxers but also enjoyed meeting several new ones.  DS In Memphis came all the way from Memphis, TN to attend and surprise her sister, and I was pleased to find out she was the one who found my Memphis In May letterbox alive and well after surviving the Mississippi River flood.  But perhaps the biggest surprise for me was meeting a TX boxer who has been active almost as long as Baby Bear and I.  Doxie Mama showed me her first find and it was Baby Bear's Lamar stamp from early 2003.  I was amazed she could stay under the radar for that many years and was happy she finally decided to meet us.  Hopefully we didn't scare her back into hiding.<br>
<br>
Luckily the weather was great since there were many boxes to find.  The park has added many trails since we had the last TALE there 7 years ago and I look forward to finding the ones PI Joe will inevitably place on the most remote ones.  But as much fun as finding boxes is, my favorite part of these Events is talking with all of you.<br>
I always learn a little something new, even about boxers I have known for years, and I thank you for sharing your stories.<br>
<br>
I have created an album in the Photos section and put a few pictures in it, but feel free to add more.  I plan to reserve the dining hall at Bastrop SP soon for next year when we will celebrate our 10th TALE.  I'm already looking forward to seeing y'all there!<br>
