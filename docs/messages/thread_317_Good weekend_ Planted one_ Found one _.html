having a choice of hundreds of boxes to find each weekend! <br>
We were pretty thrilled to find ONE - Silver Eagle's Texas Star - we<br>
have meant to drive down to Fair Park for a while, but never got around<br>
to it.<br>
It was a little unnerving to be able to see the letterbox from about 30<br>
feet away! Yikes! What a vivid reminder that we all need to try to<br>
re-hide with wind, rain and animals in mind!<br>
There were lots of Fair Park employees milling around, setting up for an<br>
event, so I posed by the hiding spot while my husband snapped away photo<br>
after photo as I covered it very thoroughly with my left hand hidden by<br>
a backpack....those folks must have thought we were demented tourists or<br>
an incredibly old besotted honeymoon couple...;-)<br>
<br>
Planted our first in a series of "Texas Bronze" boxes - THE SHAWNEE<br>
TRAIL - it's in Pioneer Park in downtown Dallas near the Dallas<br>
Convention Center (where our youngest was showing off his school's Solar<br>
Car in the Technology Expo this weekend) - a very picturesque place with<br>
over 40 bronze longhorns on a cattle drive. <br>
A couple of folks on this list have offered to beta-test the clues, so<br>
we'll be sending them out privately first, but if you plan a trip to<br>
Dallas, please write & ask for them. <br>
<br>
Hope everyone else had a great weekend!<br>
