Thanks so much for starting a group for Texas. I live in NYC but was <br>
born and raised in Texas. I'm a newbie boxer and my two lone and sad <br>
little boxes are placed in Central Texas. <br>
Our home state seems a little arid in the letterbox area. :(<br>
<br>
I'm trying to get off my lazy duff and place a few boxes here in the <br>
city. There are only I think 4 or 5 in the whole place. Hopefully <br>
I'll be going to Brownwood in November and will do a few more. <br>

Great to hear from you - if there is any chance you'll be back in Texas<br>
next spring, it'd be fun to meet & greet at the TX gathering. <br>
My husband is in New York city frequently on business & I've challenged<br>
him to try to place a microbox there - so we'll let you know if he<br>
succeeds!<br>

we're a little light on boxes right now, but if you<br>
had seen how few we had even a year ago, you would be<br>

short time!<br>

Have you heard any news of your two boxes in Central<br>
Texas?  I'm sure someone on this list can update you<br>
if you need one!<br>

I'd love to go to a gathering in Tx. Is there info on it someplace? <br>
If I know far ahead enough, I could probably go. <br>
<br>
There are a grand total of four in Manhattan. The hitchhiker that is <br>
listed is no longer in Central Park. No one seems to know anything <br>
about it. *I* want to place some here but find it very hard trying <br>
to decide on a place I think will be safe. So far I haven't met the <br>
challenge.<br>
