Hi all,<br>
<br>
I have been driving around with three letterboxes in my car meaning <br>
to plant them all week, but I sort of got sidetracked working on <br>
this one.  Hopefully, we'll get the others hidden soon.<br>
<br>
Emma/Franklin. . .Nurse/spy is the gender-bending story of a Civil <br>
War Union soldier and spy.  I think it's really neat and I learned a <br>
lot about women serving in the Civil War in the process of <br>
researching this box.  Part of the clues are in cipher form, but <br>
it's a simple cipher that anyone can solve.<br>
<br>
Right now the clues are on atlas quest.  I'm want to add a <br>
photograph, so I chose that site to host.  Will link from LBNA <br>
sometime much later today.<br>
<br>
Would appreciate an email from finders letting us know what you <br>
think.<br>
<br>
Welcome to Carol!  One of those boxes in our car is destined for <br>
Mercer.  Hopefully we'll get it placed before you go.<br>
<br>
Wishing good weather for you all.  Baseball season has started, so <br>
boxing on Saturdays will be dubious for the next few months.<br>
