a select group of folks with children who might want to start this hobby. The 
thing is, most folks with children want to know what they are getting into 
before they drag their kids into it. And the idea of letterboxing, to a 
beginner, is quite foreign. So showing them exactly what it is and what it

<div> </div>
<div>Now I love kids - don't get me wrong.  Heck, I have one that hangs around my house all the time and I spend hours a week with bunches of other ones.  BUT - there are quite a few kid groups (homeschoolers, scout groups, 4-H, whatever) that are approaching letterboxing.  I think that's fine, except that SOME of their leaders are not helping them understand that on the other side of that box is a planter, someone who went to a lot of trouble to put it out there, and other finders who want to find the box in good order without having the hunt spoiled by bad rehiding or missing boxes.  They approach it as they would an afternoon at the movies, or a day of roller skating, or a night at the bowling alley.  Letterboxing, in my opinion, is very much an interactive game and they miss that point.  
<br/> </div>
<div>Posting a picture on a website without permission from the owner of the box is a hint that the leaders of the group aren't getting and conveying the whole picture.</div>

<p>No, they don't.  I didn't even know if it was considered "wrong".  I know it's wrong to post clues to boxes, and from what the gal told me, you can't really decipher where the box is by the photos.   
</p><div><br/> </div>
<div>I guess there's nothing really wrong with it.  The thing is, they are trying to promote letterboxing as a hobby, and any new boxers now have a spoiler for that box.  Isn't part of the fun getting to the box, not knowing what the stamp is going to look like?  That's my stamp on the logbook cover.

willing to bet they haven't planted any yet, and therefore cannot <br>
appreciate the issue from a planters point of view.<br>

I saw there was a "contact us" button on the left-hand side of the <br>
page.  Also an "administrator" button at the bottom.  You might try <br>
one of those methods of reaching them.<br>

Good luck,<br>

Although it's true that this is a hobby with "no rules," there are<br>
social conventions and generally accepted practices.  Most of these<br>
