<div>I wouldn't care at all if it enticed folks 
to get started. It isn't like the posted the entire thing to the world. It is to 
a select group of folks with children who might want to start this hobby. The 
thing is, most folks with children want to know what they are getting into 
before they drag their kids into it. And the idea of letterboxing, to a 
beginner, is quite foreign. So showing them exactly what it is and what it 
consists of is like tasting the party cake before you order it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would be honored. Think of all the 
families who may start letterboxing because your stamp enticed them! Who cares 
if it "ruins" the suprise for the select group of people? Those kids will be 
just as excited to find the stamp whether or not they know what it looks like. 
For kids, it is the finding that is important. It is the adults who are all 
about the stamp.</div>

<div>And it's not that I would mind so much, but that they are setting a bad precedent right off the bat for the kids they are trying to introduce to the hobby.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I love kids - don't get me wrong.  Heck, I have one that hangs around my house all the time and I spend hours a week with bunches of other ones.  BUT - there are quite a few kid groups (homeschoolers, scout groups, 4-H, whatever) that are approaching letterboxing.  I think that's fine, except that SOME of their leaders are not helping them understand that on the other side of that box is a planter, someone who went to a lot of trouble to put it out there, and other finders who want to find the box in good order without having the hunt spoiled by bad rehiding or missing boxes.  They approach it as they would an afternoon at the movies, or a day of roller skating, or a night at the bowling alley.  Letterboxing, in my opinion, is very much an interactive game and they miss that point.  
<br/> </div>
<div>Posting a picture on a website without permission from the owner of the box is a hint that the leaders of the group aren't getting and conveying the whole picture.</div>

I saw there was a "contact us" button on the left-hand side of the <br/>

permission of the hiders whose stamps he's showing.  Cyclonic has an<br/>
online logbook like that, where only those who have given him<br/>
permission have their stamps shown.  Otherwise it's a definite<br/>
violation of letterboxing etiquette.<br/>
<br/>
I really wish that folks would read a little bit more about things. <br/>
Although it's true that this is a hobby with "no rules," there are<br/>
social conventions and generally accepted practices.  Most of these<br/>
things are common sense, but that doesn't help when people don't have<br/>
sense.<br/>
<br/>
I love it when the stamp is a fun twist or has a surprise to it.  I<br/>
don't really want to see before I open that box...<br/>

&gt; Whether or not you can determine the location is not the point.  They <br/>
&gt; should not have published images of your stamp and spoiled it for <br/>
&gt; future finders.  If they wanted to show people what they are getting <br/>
&gt; into, they should have used an image of their own stamp.  I'd be <br/>
&gt; willing to bet they haven't planted any yet, and therefore cannot <br/>
&gt; appreciate the issue from a planters point of view.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I saw there was a "contact us" button on the left-hand side of the <br/>
&gt; page.  Also an "administrator" button at the bottom.  You might try <br/>
&gt; one of those methods of reaching them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck,<br/>

&gt; &gt; No, they don't.  I didn't even know if it was considered "wrong".  <br/>
&gt; I  <br/>
&gt; &gt; know it's wrong to post clues to boxes, and from what the gal told  <br/>
&gt; &gt; me, you can't really decipher where the box is by the photos.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess there's nothing really wrong with it.  The thing is, they <br/>
&gt; are  <br/>
&gt; &gt; trying to promote letterboxing as a hobby, and any new boxers now  <br/>
&gt; &gt; have a spoiler for that box.  Isn't part of the fun getting to the  <br/>
