                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Susan! I am just 11 miles south of you, in Skidmore. There are <br/>
3 letterboxes in Evergreen Cemetery between Beeville and Skidmore, <br/>
too... nearer to Skidmore. <br/>
<br/>
Have you started carving your stamp yet? Or gotten a log book? <br/>
<br/>
I have only been letterboxing since August of 2002 - not quite 6 <br/>
months. Let's see...an intro... I am 51, married for 33 years, have <br/>
5 children and 5 grandchildren. I write a newspaper column - <br/>
Skidmore Sketches in the Beeville Bee-Picayune. My interests besides <br/>
my family and letterboxing are native plants, gardening, herbs, <br/>
nature, reading, history, paper arts, scarecrows and other 'yard <br/>
art', the internet, teaching religious education to mostly second <br/>
graders, and lots of other things. <br/>
<br/>
I am hoping to get back to letterboxing as soon as this cold, windy <br/>
weather passes and my car is out of the shop. <br/>
<br/>
Welcome to a great hobby!<br/>

&gt; Hi, my name is Susan Tashiro. I am very new to letterboxing.  I've <br/>
&gt; been reading about geocaching and chanced upon <br/>
&gt; www.letterboxing.org   I saw that there are quite a few letter <br/>
boxes <br/>
&gt; in South Texas...and a bunch around where I live, in Beeville.  I <br/>
&gt; saw that one was here in Beeville, so I went out this morning and <br/>
&gt; found it...my very first.  I really wasn't prepared...didn't have <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; rubber stamp or inkpad with me.  I'll have to go back and stamp <br/>
it. <br/>
&gt; I can't wait to go check out those at Goliad and the other <br/>
&gt; surrounding places.  This is going to be so much fun!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are any of you close to me?  Wanda, I saw you name on the box <br/>
here.  <br/>
&gt; Are you in Beeville?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since there are so few of us on here and it seems that you all <br/>
&gt; already know each other, would it be a problem for you all to <br/>
&gt; introduce yourself to me? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I sure wish it wasn't so windy.  I'd go to Goliad right now.<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Hi Wanda.  I've seen your name many times in the Bee-Pic.  I think we've met...back several years ago.  I used to work at the hospital...in the ER and on 2nd floor.  I'm a nurse.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm 48, attached to Bryan, have 2 children and 5 grandchildren.  They all live out of state which is a real bummer.  I grew up in Calliham (old Calliham where The Calliham unit of Choke Caynon is now).  My dad (88 yrs young) still lives in the new Calliham.  I'm a soapmaker...I made soap from scratch using lye, lotions and other bath/body products.  I love the outdoors and frequently go hog hunting with Bryan.  I enjoy the internet, sightseeing,  arrowhead hunting and just being outside.  I divide my time between Carrizo Springs/Crystal City and Beeville.  Bryan is welding down there and we have a travel trailer set up down there in a beautiful RV park on the Nueces River.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am very excited about letterboxing!  Can't wait to do more.  I'm thinking that Popeye in Crystal City (spinach capitol of the world) needs a letterbox.  I'll have to go check that out when I go back down there.  There are sooooo many places I can think of.  Can't wait to get started!!!!!  <br/></div>
