                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Susan! I am just 11 miles south of you, in Skidmore. There are <br>
3 letterboxes in Evergreen Cemetery between Beeville and Skidmore, <br>
too... nearer to Skidmore. <br>
<br>
Have you started carving your stamp yet? Or gotten a log book? <br>
<br>
I have only been letterboxing since August of 2002 - not quite 6 <br>
months. Let's see...an intro... I am 51, married for 33 years, have <br>
5 children and 5 grandchildren. I write a newspaper column - <br>
Skidmore Sketches in the Beeville Bee-Picayune. My interests besides <br>
my family and letterboxing are native plants, gardening, herbs, <br>
nature, reading, history, paper arts, scarecrows and other 'yard <br>
art', the internet, teaching religious education to mostly second <br>
graders, and lots of other things. <br>
<br>
I am hoping to get back to letterboxing as soon as this cold, windy <br>
weather passes and my car is out of the shop. <br>
<br>
Welcome to a great hobby!<br>

                    <html><body><div>Hi Wanda.  I've seen your name many times in the Bee-Pic.  I think we've met...back several years ago.  I used to work at the hospital...in the ER and on 2nd floor.  I'm a nurse.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm 48, attached to Bryan, have 2 children and 5 grandchildren.  They all live out of state which is a real bummer.  I grew up in Calliham (old Calliham where The Calliham unit of Choke Caynon is now).  My dad (88 yrs young) still lives in the new Calliham.  I'm a soapmaker...I made soap from scratch using lye, lotions and other bath/body products.  I love the outdoors and frequently go hog hunting with Bryan.  I enjoy the internet, sightseeing,  arrowhead hunting and just being outside.  I divide my time between Carrizo Springs/Crystal City and Beeville.  Bryan is welding down there and we have a travel trailer set up down there in a beautiful RV park on the Nueces River.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am very excited about letterboxing!  Can't wait to do more.  I'm thinking that Popeye in Crystal City (spinach capitol of the world) needs a letterbox.  I'll have to go check that out when I go back down there.  There are sooooo many places I can think of.  Can't wait to get started!!!!!  <br/></div>
