<body><!-- Converted from text/plain format --><br/>
<p>Good evening 
all.<br/><br/>        Just last week the 
discussion was hydration systems and Camel-Bak.  Well - due to Father's Day 
my Camel (Bak) stable has been increased by one new Camelbak.  I have too 
many now - one has got to go.  So I thought I would "offer" it up to those 
of you who were interested in a 
Camel-Bak.<br/><br/>        Note - this isn't 
one of the light-weight civilian models.  This is the Military version, 
tough and rugged.  It is 3-color desert camouflage colored.  It is in 
great shape - no rips or tears or worn spots.  I did have the local shoe 
shop sew two attachment points - one on each side of the upper cargo pouch 
- for hanging my radio gear etc.   It is a neat job - not a hack job 
(thats why I paid him and didn't try it myself).  The specs say 100 OZ/3L, 
but if you hold it right as you fill it - it gets nearly a full gallon.  
The drinking tube is insulated too - water stays cooler than the clear civilian 
one.  BTW - the letterboxing kits for both me and the wife fits easily in 
the upper pouch with room to spare.  It has MOLE straps for hanging more 
gear/pouches on it.  The little elastic ears on the bottom allow you to 
roll up the waist straps and tuck them in so they do not dangle.  CIV 
version don't have that either.</p>

<p>Water: 100 oz. (3.0L)<br/><br/>Cargo: 540 Cu. In.  
(8L)<br/><br/>CamelBak's MULE is still the most efficient and compact way to carry

Harness during fast-paced, on-the-run missions - it stabilizes the load as you

no one is interested it goes to my buddy's surplus store.  Photos available

</p><p>Good evening all.<br/><br/>        Just last week the discussion was hydration systems and Camel-Bak.  Well - due to Father's Day my Camel (Bak) stable has been increased by one new Camelbak.  I have too many now - one has got to go.  So I thought I would "offer" it up to those of you who were interested in a Camel-Bak.
<br/><br/>        Note - this isn't one of the light-weight civilian models.  This is the Military version, tough and rugged.  It is 3-color desert camouflage colored.  It is in great shape - no rips or tears or worn spots.  I did have the local shoe shop sew two attachment points - one on each side of the upper cargo pouch - for hanging my radio gear etc.   It is a neat job - not a hack job (thats why I paid him and didn't try it myself).  The specs say 100 OZ/3L, but if you hold it right as you fill it - it gets nearly a full gallon.  The drinking tube is insulated too - water stays cooler than the clear civilian one.  BTW - the letterboxing kits for both me and the wife fits easily in the upper pouch with room to spare.  It has MOLE straps for hanging more gear/pouches on it.  The little elastic ears on the bottom allow you to roll up the waist straps and tuck them in so they do not dangle.  CIV version don't have that either.

&gt; &gt; These have an MSRP of $112. I have seen them on special for $85. <br/>
&gt; I want<br/>
&gt; &gt; $40 for it, plus $5 shipping for the lower 48. If you like, I <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; put a<br/>
&gt; &gt; new unused bladder in it for an additional $10. If no one is <br/>
&gt; interested it<br/>
&gt; &gt; goes to my buddy's surplus store. Photos available on request.<br/>
