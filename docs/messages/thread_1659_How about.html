                    <div class="plaintext-content">Eh, just another idea or two or a hundred for the gathering because<br/>
I'm into this kind of stuff.<br/>
<br/>
1. A raffle? Put in a dollar or two for a ticket drawing...<br/>
For a letterboxers DREAM package (Grand prize)...<br/>
Pink (or white) stuff, carving tools, stamp markers, box-building<br/>
supplies (ziplocks, camo tape, tupperware/gladware/whatever-ware boxes)?<br/>
Or several smaller prizes like prepared boxes (with stamp block,<br/>
ziplocks, premade booklets *rambleramble*)<br/>
Money goes to pay fees for the reservation of the area or back to<br/>
whoever bought all this stuff or whatnot.<br/>
And yeah, set up a time where everyone is back at the site, be there<br/>
to win - because I'm MEAN like that. *cacklecackle*<br/>
And I wouldn't mind getting the stuff and running this. Someone, just<br/>
tell me yes, that you'd be into this and I'll do this.<br/>
<br/>
2. At the JEN barnraising, we exchanged recipes...<br/>
Anyone wanna do that again? Not that we HAVE to bring the foods<br/>
(although it wouldn't hurt) ... Eh, just another excuse for me to get<br/>
recipes into my food rotation. Heck, I'm doing this anyway. Now I just<br/>
gotta find a good recipe to poison you with.<br/>
Oh, was that "outloud"?<br/>
<br/>
ANYWAY, yeah. Lemme know?<br/>
