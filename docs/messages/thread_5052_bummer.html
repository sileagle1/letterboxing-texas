                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Puddle Splasher.  Don't go out of your way, but if you're driving right by and have time, I'd appreciate it.  They'll probably chauffeur you to the governor if you ask them to :)  I usually don't retire a box on the first attempt unless I know the person, but they seemed pretty certain they were in the right place and that the trees were gone, so they're probably right.  We need to make another trip to the Dallas area, it's been a while since we've hunted for letterboxes there.<br/>
