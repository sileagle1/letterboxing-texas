12 of us, from all across the US are banding together for a unique<br/>
project.  Each of 12 boxes will spend (a little less than) one month<br/>
in each destination.  <br/>
<br/>
I will hide the first box soon (probably Memorial Park for easy<br/>
access).  Then, on the 25th of the month, it will be pulled and mailed<br/>
to its next destination.  As soon as I receive the next month's box<br/>
I'll post it.  I probably will announce here, or on GulfCoast Boxers<br/>
as well as on AQ.<br/>
<br/>
November's Box is provided by Speedsquare, from Indiana, and is titled<br/>
I never promised you a Rose Garden.  Look for clues around November 1st.<br/>
<br/>
I may have a special prize for those who get all 12 boxes.  Still<br/>
thinking of that.<br/>

I warned the group not to expect too many finders when their boxes<br/>
were down here.  We just don't seem to be the rush-out-and-find-it<br/>
type of crowd.  Not like some of the other stops the boxes are going<br/>
to make.<br/>
<br/>
I had done a similar project where I was carving stamps based on what<br/>
was blooming in my garden.  I would leave the box out for 3 months,<br/>
then pull it and hide it in a new spot for the new season with a new<br/>
stamp (it had the same logbook, which I thought would be neat).  There<br/>
really was very little interest (1-2 finders maybe per stop), so I<br/>
ceased that project.  Generally, I don't care how many finders my<br/>
boxes get, as long as the people who do find it seem to enjoy it, but<br/>
this seemed like wasted effort that could go into other boxes.  These<br/>
were some of my most intricate stamps to date and I was putting a lot<br/>
of time into them.<br/>
<br/>
I had a box this summer that was out for two months and had two finders.  <br/>
<br/>
Now my holiday lights series last year got a lot of finders (I thought<br/>
it was fun and people seemed to enjoy it).  I have an idea for a new<br/>
holiday series for this year that I think might be well received as<br/>
well.  <br/>

Thanks to Bailey's Bunch for being FFs on Hefe-Bison.  Each recently<br/>
planted box is my favorite, but I have to say, these clues will<br/>
probably always make me smile!<br/>
