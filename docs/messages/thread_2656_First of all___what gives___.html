I'm JBKokopelli's cousin.  Last fall she started telling the family <br/>
about this new hobby she'd learned about and we all looked at her like <br/>
she'd lost her mind.  You're gonna go WHERE, looking for WHAT?  HUH?  <br/>
It made no sense.  Little by little we started to understand and I went <br/>
with her on a couple of hunts.  Then I figured "If I'm going to tag <br/>
along, I might as well be keeping my own log, so now here I am.  In <br/>
fact, we just got back from a road trip where I planted my first 4 <br/>
boxes and she did something like 30.  We also found a lot along the way.<br/>
<br/>
As an FYI, a couple of months ago I was in the tire store waiting on my <br/>
car and flipped through a "Family Fun" or "Family First" magazine. <br/>
There was a 6-page article about LB.  By that time I understood the <br/>
concept, but it was great publicity!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting,<br/>

<div>Funny how you talk about your family looking at JBK like she was weird or something.  My family used to do the same, but they are coming around.  My mom is jumping in and so is my sis-in-law.  It's just a matter of time for the rest of 'em...resistance is futile.

<div>I found out about letterboxing through a online homeschool forum. A few 
weeks ago a lady posted a message that asked if anyone had ever done 
letterboxing. A few people responded that they had and provided links. I was 
curious, looked up the link and the rest is history.
