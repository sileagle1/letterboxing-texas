<div>If you are working on those PT clues and feel stumped, let me suggest that many (but not all) folks are willing to confirm or redirect you if you approach them by email prior to the gathering about their PT.  Some folks are glad to help, for others it is part of the game not to give any help - just remember, sometimes it never hurts to ask!</div>
