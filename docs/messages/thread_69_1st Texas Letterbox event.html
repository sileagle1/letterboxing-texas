<br/>
Our family also had a wonderful time at the picnic.  What fun it was <br/>
to meet fellow letterboxers.  The food was yummy (we would like the <br/>
chili and thai chicken recipes, too!), the weather just PERFECT and <br/>
of course the company outstanding!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to Silver Eagle for organinzing the event, and to everyone for <br/>
making the 1st event a success.<br/>
<br/>
So, when is the next one?<br/>

<div>Hopefully I did not infect anyone (except my brother Silver Eagle who deserves it) with my cold.  I wasn't feeling to well the day of the event, but just could not miss it.  I still had a great time, and can't wait for the next one.   Thanks to all of you for your help and for your efforts in spreading Letterboxing in Texas!!!!</div>
