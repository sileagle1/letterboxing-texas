<div>This past April, M-Dot and I went to Tempe, Arizona where he competed in 
Ironman, AZ. While there, I planted my first out of state letterbox, Ironman 
Arizona, along the marathon course.  Since then, I have enjoyed the e-mail 
updates on how my little box is doing.   A couple of weeks ago,  
I was contacted by a letterboxer who lives near the area where my box is 
located, telling me that the logbook was full, and they offered to mail it to 
me.  We exchanged information and this evening, it arrived in the 
mailbox!  With a mug of hot chocolate, I sat down and carefully read the 
entries.  I have had so much fun looking at all of the stamps from 
letterboxers who stamped in!  Many left little notes about their journey, 
nice trails, they liked the stamp, tough to find with the construction etc...but 
the one thing that seemed consistent was that for the most part, they wrote how 
hot it was on the day the found the box!  One entry stated that it 
was 112 degrees! Wow!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It really means a lot to me that other boxers took the time to write little 
notes about their adventure finding the box.  The first finder wrote that 
it was their first ever letterbox to find- what a bonus!  In the future, I 
am going to try to be more diligent in my logbook entries in the hopes that 
others enjoy reading through their logbooks as much as I did!</div>

<div>Thanks for the reminder of what it means to a placer to get those special little notes!<br/><br/> </div>

seldom write extra notes.  But I have also been sent back log books <br/>

slow down, write notes, enjoy the place the box is placed!  Thanks <br/>
