                    <div class="plaintext-content">When I met the young lady who would become Lone Star Quilter, she had a father named Charles, a brother named Charles Jr. and an uncle named Charles.  Her father was called Charles, her brother was (and still is) called Chuck and her uncle was Charlie, so they had it all worked out.  Since my given name is Charles, it presented a little problem, but it's worked for 40 years.  It seems that, whenever her father and I were mentioned in the same conversation, it was obvious, in context, which Charles was which.  So, if Boots wants to be Boots, there's probably a reason for it and I'm sure it'll work out.  Hey, Boots, if you're tuned in, let us know how you chose your trail name and where you live and anything else you'd like to share.  As for Bear Food, you're on your own.  We might end up calling you Honey; that's bear food, isn't it?<br>

<p>When I met the young lady who would become Lone Star Quilter, she had a father named Charles, a brother named Charles Jr. and an uncle named Charles.  Her father was called Charles, her brother was (and still is) called Chuck and her uncle was Charlie, so they had it all worked out.  Since my given name is Charles, it presented a little problem, but it's worked for 40 years.  It seems that, whenever her father and I were mentioned in the same conversation, it was obvious, in context, which Charles was which.  So, if Boots wants to be Boots, there's probably a reason for it and I'm sure it'll work out.  Hey, Boots, if you're tuned in, let us know how you chose your trail name and where you live and anything else you'd like to share.  As for Bear Food, you're on your own.  We might end up calling you Honey; that's bear food, isn't it?</p>

&gt; I was just curious because if they are local it might be worth a note to let<br/>
&gt; them know there is a nearby active boxer with a very similar trail name.  Not<br/>
&gt; to ask them to change their trail name, but to let them know they may not be<br/>
&gt; unique and might get confused with someone else.  Some people care about<br/>
&gt; that, some don't.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wisconsin Hiker did that for me a long time ago  my sister-in-law was<br/>
&gt; trying her hand at letterboxing and she wanted to go by the trailname TX<br/>
&gt; Flutterby.  WH let me know there was a nationally known very active<br/>
&gt; letterboxer named Flutterby (from CT I think), so there might have been some<br/>
&gt; overlap.  I didn't mention it to my sister-in-law because I didn't figure<br/>
&gt; she would get too serious and I didn't figure their paths would cross, but<br/>
&gt; it was nice to know just in case it was something she/we cared about.  As it<br/>
&gt; turned out, she's kind of dropped off, so it really didn't matter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When Lucy Locket showed up on the scene, I felt a little weird having<br/>
&gt; another Lucy around, but now I can't imagine her (or me) with any other<br/>
&gt; trail name and it's kind of fun having such a cool letterboxer as a name<br/>
&gt; sister.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, can you imagine poor Bear Food? Entering this harmless seeming<br/>
&gt; game only to find him/herself as an unwitting pawn in the ongoing war<br/>
&gt; between the Bear and the Ghost?  Oh My<br/>

&gt; &gt; I saw that, which is ironic because my dad's name was Charlie....<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; I can't tell where they are from. Neither are members of this group, at<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; least under their trail name. They are both listed on AQ, but with no<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; profile information. They have both found only a few boxes and placed none.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; They have both found at least one of my boxes, so I would have to assume<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; they are in Texas, but that's not necessarily so. There's also a newbie<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; named Barefoot Charlie.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There's a new letterboxer out there named "Boots". I would like for<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; all of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you to be aware that it isn't me, even though some of you call me by<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; name. There's also a new letterboxer named "Bear Food". IRA Boxer<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; assures me<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; that he is not bear food, despite the fact that he's been boiled and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; set on<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fire by a certain bear.<br/>
