Catfish (Big Bertha's) doesn't have a street address<br/>
per se (well, I'm sure they do, but it's probably a<br/>
rural route).  It's about six miles further down<br/>
Highway 84 from Texas State Railroad Park toward<br/>
Palestine, in the town of Maydelle.  You could google<br/>
Maydelle.  In Maydelle there are about three<br/>
businesses on the main road (Highway 84), all on the<br/>
right if you are going toward Palestine from Rusk. <br/>
Big Bertha's is the middle one.  And she has a sign<br/>
out that says - you guessed it - Big Bertha's. <br/>
Apparently she is known for her Big Bertha Breakfast<br/>
too.  It is really truly a little country store with<br/>
wooden walkways outside and a swinging wooden screen<br/>
door and wooden floors inside that aren't level when<br/>
you walk, but it is excellent catfish.  And if you<br/>
don't like catfish, they do have a menu of just good<br/>
country cooking.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you so much. That'd be great you can email me off list with your<br/>
number just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Although, Semalee paid for her campsite and may not be able to attend.<br/>
She offered it to me and I'll find out more details tomorrow. I'd hate<br/>
that she paid and it not be used at all. We'll see what happens.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks! <br/>

&gt;   Okay, I know this is getting to be last minute.<br/>
&gt; I was ready to come to the gathering 2 months ago.<br/>
&gt; Found out that husband isn't going to be able to go (work, gee).<br/>
&gt; So I took us both off the reservation list.<br/>
&gt; NOW, he says I should still go so I'm back on.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My Questions:<br/>
&gt; I'm going to camp (I LOVE TO CAMP). Can anyone point me in the right<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since it's just me and 1 person tent, would anyone be willing to share<br/>

&gt; We kind of set it as meet there between 7 and 9 or so.<br/>
&gt;  That way, those folks who are running late don't feel<br/>
