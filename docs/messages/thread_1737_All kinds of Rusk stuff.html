<br>
Catfish (Big Bertha's) doesn't have a street address<br>
per se (well, I'm sure they do, but it's probably a<br>
rural route).  It's about six miles further down<br>
Highway 84 from Texas State Railroad Park toward<br>
Palestine, in the town of Maydelle.  You could google<br>
Maydelle.  In Maydelle there are about three<br>
businesses on the main road (Highway 84), all on the<br>
right if you are going toward Palestine from Rusk. <br>
Big Bertha's is the middle one.  And she has a sign<br>
out that says - you guessed it - Big Bertha's. <br>
Apparently she is known for her Big Bertha Breakfast<br>
too.  It is really truly a little country store with<br>
wooden walkways outside and a swinging wooden screen<br>
door and wooden floors inside that aren't level when<br>
you walk, but it is excellent catfish.  And if you<br>
don't like catfish, they do have a menu of just good<br>
country cooking.<br>
