                    <div class="plaintext-content">Have you tried the Letterbox Search feature on LbNA?  You can search by state, region, county, city or a word or phrase in the box name or clue.  I really like that the boxes are listed by county.  If you want all the boxes in a county and nothing else, just pick (for instance) Texas and Cameron County and you'll see all the boxes in Cameron County. Don't neglect LbNA or you'll miss some great boxes. Also be sure to check for mystery boxes.<br/>
