                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we first found out about letterboxing, we went and checked the<br>
letterboxing.org website and there were just a couple in the state of<br>
Texas, but none anywhere near Houston.  Since we had a new baby, I<br>
just filed that away as something to do if I we ever made it to<br>
Connecticut or Oregon...we surely didn't take the initiative and start<br>
planting the way BB & SE did here.   Several years later, we were<br>
planning a vacation to Colorado and I remembered letterboxing, so I<br>
checked the website to see if there were any there.  Imagine my<br>
surprise when I realized there were some letterboxes within a few<br>
miles of my house!  We went right out the next day and found our first.<br>
<br>
Our first find was Houston Texans (since retired) by Baby Bear.  Next<br>
up were a number of the Indian Tribes by happy days as we made our way<br>
through OK to Colorado.  We realized right away how much fun we would<br>
have finding new places and seeing new things.  I didn't realize how<br>
much fun it would be to carve, plant, and meet other letterboxers. <br>
That all came later.<br>
