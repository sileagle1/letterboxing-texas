                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, in the spirit of the new goal I filled in a virgin county in Montana last week!!  Our trip to Glacier NP was excellent, seeing 8 total bears, 2 moose, and many other great wildlife and sites.   Got within 100 yards of a mama grizzly and her 2 cubs, so I thought for a minute baby bear may be lunch, or my wife would pepper the poor bear with her trusty can of bear spray.  I placed a box in East Glacier, which if NOT in the Park, and we finished our trip and headed back to Spokane, WA.   When we arrived we went straight to Finch Arboretum, the site I discussed before my trip of where Silver Eagle and I found our first box - Finch Arboretum.  The box had been reported missing, but I still wanted to look for it, and place my own box in this amazing park.  Good thing for me the park is beautiful, and had fresh fruit you can pick up and take, so my wife was entertained for awhile.  We followed the beginning of the clues and I decided to hide my box along the way (Seven Year Itch), then we continued on.   What amazed me is I could not figure out the clues, and could not find the bridge that we found this box under 7 years ago.  WOW, either I'm getting worse at this, or we got extremely lucky our first trip out.   Of course I had Silver Eagle to help back then, not a Love Bunny looking at me and saying "Isn't it missing anyway".   I found a bridge, but I don't think it was the right one, so I will just have to live with the memory of the original find.   Anyway, we had a great trip and I'm glad to be back in GREEN TEXAS!<br>
