    I found Box of Ants years ago, back in November of 2003. I remember
    the thrill of locating it from those vague clues. Wow! I'm going to
    have to go back and revisit that one and stamp in with my new name
    and stamp.  I used to go by the name TxHiPowr back then. The Mattke
    family was very active back in the early days of Austin geocaching
    and letterboxing.  I think Bell Motel had some contact with them
    recently and talked them into relisting some of their old boxes on
    AQ.<br/>

Back when Baby Bear and I first started letterboxing (2002) there were only about 10 or so boxes in all of TX and the closest ones to us were in Austin.  Some of the first boxes we tried to find were by Eoghan but we were not successful since his clues were pretty tough for us rookies.  So my first finds in that area were Barton Creek Greenbelt, Hiking Pug and Mt Bonnell.<br>
<br>
Over the next several months Baby Bear and I tried to find Eoghan's boxes (O-Knots, Gordian Knot, Wraith, Peacocks Cry) but were only able to find Peacocks Cry and some of the O-Knots.  Then we noticed a new box placed in Austin by somebody called Ants1 and were excited to know another letterboxer was active in the area.  Baby Bear was first to look for Box Of Ants and was successful. He liked the area so much that he went back to place his Anteater box as a tribute.  I then made the trip and found both in early 2003 and that success helped me finally find all of Eoghan's boxes except Wraith and Gordian Knot.  It turned out that Gordian Knot was missing and Wraith was thought to be, but Baby Bear and I made one last effort to find it and were finally successful.  Later, when Ants1 no longer participated, Baby Bear adopted Box Of Ants but I doubt he has visited it since. <br>
<br>
With all the boxes available now it is hard to believe we used to spend days searching for 1 box in a city over 150 miles away.  I also remember one or two boxes by Mattke's that were very challenging and I hope the clues get republished for others to attempt them.  Thanks Open Space for posting this story and allowing me to take another trip down memory lane as we start a new year.<br>

<div style="FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri'; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt">
<div>I’m so glad that Open Space and Wry Me found “Box of Ants”.  I 
contacted the Mr. Mattke  about two years ago about “Box of Ants” because 
the logbook was full, and the box needed maintenance.  The Mattke family 
had placed two boxes in Austin, “Park &amp; Hide” and “Box of Ants”.  Mr. 
Mattke was very nice, but said they had placed the boxes when they were 
home-schooling their children.  Now the children were grown, and he had 
moved on to other interests.  He asked me to adopt the boxes.  Baby 
Bear had already adopted “Box of Ants” on LBNA, so I adopted both boxes on 
AtlasQuest, and “Park &amp; Hide” on LBNA.  “Box of Ants” was one of my 
first finds in Austin, but only because I lived very near it, and had the local 
knowledge to figure it out quickly.  When lionsmane was visiting some years 
back, he was the one who solved the “Park &amp; Hide” clue, but it took me 
multiple trips to actually find the box.  Unfortunately, the link to the 
map that the Mattke’s used in the “Park &amp; Hide” clue no longer works, so I 
hope the hint I posted is helpful.  I really admire how clever the clues 
were.  I am guilty of posting “directions” to boxes, not “clues”.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I mailed the “Box of Ants” logbook back to the Mattkes, since it was full, 
but here is their signature stamp image, which was the cover of the 
logbook.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div style="FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri'; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none"><img alt="Mattke family letterboxing stamp image" src="http://mattkefamily.com/imgs/photo/mattkefamily_stamp.jpg"/></div></div>
<div>
<div style="FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri'; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">I 
originally found only the chewed lid of the original container, and the logbook 
in “Box of Ants”, so I have replaced the logbook, the carve, and the container, 
since Mr. Mattke was not interested in doing so.  This means I have 
committed one of the cardinal sins of letterboxing – replacing an entire box, 
but still listing it under the original owner.  I just can’t take credit 
for those marvelous clues!  And I did not want the box to “die”.  (I 
think some critter up there really likes the taste of pink stuff and 
Tupperware.)  The “Anteater” carve was still there when I found it, but 
I’ll be happy to re-plant it if Baby Bear would like to mail me a new carve (or 
give it to me at TALE).  </div>
<div style="FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri'; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">When 
I found “Park &amp; Hide”, all the original parts were still there – with plenty 
of comments by geocachers who had stumbled upon it.</div></div>
<div>
<div style="FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri'; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none"> </div></div>
<div>
<div style="FONT-STYLE: normal; DISPLAY: inline; FONT-FAMILY: 'Calibri'; COLOR: #000000; FONT-SIZE: small; FONT-WEIGHT: normal; TEXT-DECORATION: none">I 
actually drew out all the directions of “Gordian Knot” on a large piece of 
paper, and used it to find the hiding spot described, but no box.  Dawn’s 
Glory and I are convinced we found the Wraith’s hiding place, but again no 
box.  Still, Eoghan’s clues were so clever, that the solving was fun, even 
if the carve was long gone.</div></div>

                              Space and Wry Me found “Box of Ants”.  I
                              contacted the Mr. Mattke  about two years
                              ago about “Box of Ants” because the
                              logbook was full, and the box needed
                              maintenance.  The Mattke family had placed
                              two boxes in Austin, “Park &amp; Hide” and
                              “Box of Ants”.  Mr. Mattke was very nice,
                              but said they had placed the boxes when
                              they were home-schooling their children. 
                              Now the children were grown, and he had
                              moved on to other interests.  He asked me
                              to adopt the boxes.  Baby Bear had already
                              adopted “Box of Ants” on LBNA, so I
                              adopted both boxes on AtlasQuest, and
                              “Park &amp; Hide” on LBNA.  “Box of Ants”
                              was one of my first finds in Austin, but
                              only because I lived very near it, and had
                              the local knowledge to figure it out
                              quickly.  When lionsmane was visiting some
                              years back, he was the one who solved the
                              “Park &amp; Hide” clue, but it took me
                              multiple trips to actually find the box. 
                              Unfortunately, the link to the map that
                              the Mattke’s used in the “Park &amp; Hide”
                              clue no longer works, so I hope the hint I
                              posted is helpful.  I really admire how
                              clever the clues were.  I am guilty of
                              posting “directions” to boxes, not
                              “clues”.<o></o></span></p>

      Gunslinger back in 2003  and remember where it was. I just now
      have written to Brown Knight via LbNA to get their thoughts on the
      idea of recreating this classic letterbox.  I have also written to
      Eoghan recently on another subject and have not gotten a response
      yet.  The last time I tried to contact him it took a while before
      he responded as he did not monitor the email address listed on
      LbNA on a regular basis.<br/>

I'll check them out and see if there are suitable hiding spots nearby the original locations and how much the original clues would have to be modified.<br/><br/>As for the O'Knots, I have the GPS coordinates for the 4 referenced orienteering posts so we could recreate them. The main problem I see is that two of the hiding spots were dead trees/hollow logs. I'm guessing that they are burned up and gone. We will have to find new hiding spots nearby.  Some area of the park are less damaged than others. If we are going to start moving these boxes a little ways then we might consider the possibility of moving them to "better" locations entirely.<br/><br/>PI Joe<o:p></o:p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></body></html>
