                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lone Star Quilter and I just got back from a letterboxing trip to <br/>
Bell, Williamson, Coryell and Hamilton Counties.  We found 10 boxes <br/>
and a hitchhiker and we placed five new boxes.  The boxes we found <br/>
were "State Dance", "Batty Bat", "State Flying Mammal" and "Texas <br/>
Passport Series #5 - Florence", all in Williamson County, "Dana <br/>
Peak", "Play Ball" and the "Peace" and "Friendship" series, all in <br/>
Bell County, and "Double Feature" and "Neff Bat", both in Coryell <br/>
County.  In Williamson County, LSQ placed "Square Dance - Quilt <br/>
Block Series" and I placed "To Hell and Back" and "Three Legged <br/>
Willie".  We also placed the first two boxes in Hamilton County: <br/>
my "Brushy Bill aka Billy the Kid" and LSQ's "Crazy Nine Patch - <br/>
Quilt Block Series".  None of our new boxes are posted yet.  <br/>
Hopefully, I'll that done later on today.  Probably the toughest <br/>
hike we've yet taken to find letterboxes was the Peace and <br/>
Friendship boxes at Miller Springs Nature Center in Belton.  The <br/>
hike took us a little over two hours, down into ravines and back <br/>
out, down into a rocky creek bed (one notation in the logbook called <br/>
it the "Ravine of Death") and back up the other side because the <br/>
bridge was out.  We saw a deer and a beautiful red fox that just sat <br/>
and looked at us.  Okay, I admit it wasn't anything like Mike O. <br/>
does around El Paso, but for a couple of senior citizens, it was <br/>
challenging, but worthwhile.  The box in Florence was interesting <br/>
after we finally found the cemetery (be persistent, the name of the <br/>
street in the clues is wrong).  There was a young man in a <br/>
wheelchair (a paraplegic), alone in the cemetery.  He was just <br/>
rolling along, apparantly practicing operating the chair.  We were <br/>
having trouble finding the right tombstone (turns out the name was <br/>
wrong), so we were driving around and every time we turned a corner, <br/>
the young man was in front of us.  But, we found the box and left <br/>
him guarding it for us.  As a coincidence, out of the ten boxes we <br/>
found, 3 of them were bats (4 if you count "Play Ball").<br/>
