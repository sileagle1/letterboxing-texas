                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
I just wanted to introduce myself, I am called WOWMOM because I like <br/>
to take my 5 year old son on adventures, and when went letterboxing, <br/>
he couldn't stop saying "WOW MOM!", the name stuck. I live on the <br/>
border of Mexico and we finally just got two boxes! (thanks to birds <br/>
of a feather). I am the official planter of doomed boxes, seeing any <br/>
attempt I make, the box dissappers or has to be rescued by someone :)<br/>
I think I'll just stick to finding for a while. I will be at the <br/>
gathering, just got my campsite reservation, and look forward to <br/>
meeting everyone. I would love to see what everyone carves with, how <br/>
to make nice log books, and some advice on how to plant boxes that <br/>
won't disappear. I will bring ... ummm..ohh! some newbie enthusiasm <br/>
and a kid who can sniff out clues from a mile away, but needs to <br/>
learn to be quiet about it. He's like a hound dog on the trail of a <br/>
rabbit! <br/>
Look for me at copperas creek, I am in the blue popup with the red <br/>
ram truck. If my brother comes we will also have radio,TV, VCR, DVD <br/>
player, XBOX, GameBoy, phones, ... (He had one bad experience <br/>
letterboxing in Aransas Wildlife Refuge being eaten by mosquitoes, <br/>
and now he refuses to come out of the trailer.)<br/>
<br/>
We'll see you soon,<br/>
Carie<br/>
<br/>
P.S. My friends don't get it, I even took time from my Disney <br/>
vacation to letterbox. I'm lovin' it.<br/>

I guess I am one of the few lucky ones to find your two<br/>
boxes before they went missing.  Hopefully your other one<br/>
in Choke Canyon is still there.  If you live near Brownsville<br/>
it would be great if you could try to find an old box<br/>
that was placed several years ago.  The clues are no longer<br/>
on the Texas clue page, but I have the direct link to them: <br/>
<br/>
http://www.rpmrlm.com:1020/tx/brownsvl.htm<br/>
<br/>
I'm just curious if it still exists.  I hope to get down<br/>
that way later this year and place a few of my own.  It<br/>
would be nice if you could plant a few, also.<br/>

I will be at Copperas Creek also. I will have  a green, possibly lopsided<br/>
tent. All the cabins were taken. Oh well. I tent camp every year for July<br/>
4th so I guess it will be twice this year! Maybe I will make me a camp sign<br/>
that says LBNA. I dont know what the final verdict was on the ribbons on the<br/>
car antenna. 3 colors braided together? Will have to look back on that one.<br/>
Happy hunting and planting,<br/>

                    <html><body><div>I know what you mean about my friends not getting it.   I usually get strange looks from them, especially when they find out I take vacations just for searching out letterboxes.   I too found the Disney boxes.  The thing they don't understand is that I have found many new and wonderful places (the wilderness lodge at Disney is great!!!) due to letterboxing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think the only way to really get someone to understand is to take them out and find a box.   I recently went on a trip to Salt Lake City for business, and told my partner I was going to hike downtown and look for a box.   He wanted to go, but was laughing most of the way.   After trudging through the snow, finding the landmarks, and finally the box (with a Hitchhiker!), he could not wait to tell everyone at the meeting about what he had done.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I honestly would be just as uninspired if it had not been for my brother bringing along some clues for a box in Spokane on a backpacking trip we went on a few years ago.   We had just enough time to give it a shot, and thank goodness we found the box.   That sealed the deal.  Soon we had come up with names (Silver Eagle for him, Baby Bear for me), and began trying to populate Texas, as the state did not offer much for finding.   Except for the petty fights on the LBNA talk list, this has been a great experience, and hopefully a life long hobby.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope you enjoy as much as we have, and look forward to seeing everyone at the 1st Event!!!</div>
