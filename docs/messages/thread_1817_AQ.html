                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm sure you all have realized that I like mystery boxes.  There<br/>
are lots of ways to play this lovely little game and lots of levels to<br/>
play it on.  <br/>
<br/>
We've hidden plenty of straight forward, easy-to-locate boxes<br/>
Some boxes that require a hike<br/>
Quite a few boxes that you have to solve some sort of puzzle to find<br/>
(some puzzles are easy, some are difficult and as people around here<br/>
get better and better I search for new ways to raise the level)<br/>
and at least one box that we're still waiting for people to realize is<br/>
 out there.<br/>
<br/>
Different approaches to boxes keeps letterboxing amusing for us, and<br/>
hopefully for others as well.  I remember how badly we wanted people<br/>
to find our first boxes.  But personally, I now care much less about<br/>
how many people find our boxes, than that the ones who do enjoy the<br/>
experience.  I love hearing from someone who feels triumphant about<br/>
having solved the clues or found a Gramatrick box.  Ask Mother of<br/>
Five--she struggled with Surrender Dorothy! but I think that struggle<br/>
made victory that much the sweeter, my pretty.<br/>
<br/>
Over the last nearly two years, my placing habits (and our finding<br/>
habits) have changed and evolved.  I expect that evolution will<br/>
continue, I'm just not sure how.  <br/>

<div>My thoughts exactly!  I lke puzzles and mysteries, but sometimes I 
just want a good hike or to discover a new location, and I'd really rather go 
find the box and read the logbook and stamp the stamp.  It's about being 
out there for me, mostly!  And, of course, first I'd have to know of the 
existence of the box to even think about it!  --
