<br>
How cool that you're into rocketry. My brother is VERY much into <br>
rocketry- and has been since he was a teen. He does alot of events in <br>
the Dallas area... I bet you know him, if you attend events up there <br>
too. Ever heard of Bill Gee? :-)<br>
<br>
Anyway, welcome to letterboxing. I'm even newer than you, I've only <br>
letterboxed since this spring, and the hot weather quickly put a <br>
damper on some of the long hikes I want to go on- but hopefully FALL <br>
will get here soon! lol<br>
