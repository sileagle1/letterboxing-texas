<div><font size="2">Having been misplaced in Connecticut when I first started letterboxing, the first thirty boxes I found were placed by the CT State Forestry Department in their 30 various state forests. Each hike was vastly different, educational, and entertaining. My first five Texas boxes were hidden by the Celticlions, and I quickly realized that boxing in Texas was going to be a very special treat. The first Silver Eagle box I found was north of San Diego, CA. I love that we have so many new boxers in the great state of Texas, and the talent of Texas boxers is amazing. </font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all - I have a confession to make! I've so enjoyed that <br>
answers to this question that I "borrowed" the idea for our Newboxers <br>
list.<br>
<br>
Secondly - our answer to the question:<br>
<br>
Sue and I found Jay Drew's "Zoom, Zoom, Zoom" in Essex, CT on June <br>
16, 2002. <br>
<br>
It was Sue's XXth birthday (that wasn't a typo!) and we had gone away <br>
to a B&B as a surprise for her birthday. I even brought the clues for <br>
several boxes in the vicinity. <br>
<br>
Letterboxing was something Sue spotted many months previous in a <br>
local newspaper and we had talked about trying but never did. I <br>
brought our supplies with us that weekend and we spent the afternoon <br>
doing several of Jay's boxes.<br>
<br>
Little did we know that we'd become such great friends with Jay and <br>
that we'd become so hooked - traveling around the country and to <br>
Dartmoor in search of Tupperware!<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; FONT-FAMILY: Arial">I started thinking of it on broader terms, realizing that with only a LITTLE extra effort, I could find boxes further afield.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And Lightning became particularly attached to letterboxing too, so now I had a compadre in the family.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And SJZ was cool with it, even though she was and is more of an opportunistic boxer.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And Fearless Fox, while he isn't much of a boxer, enjoys all the activities that go along with it and generously humors us.</span></p>

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I'll tell him more what that would entail when the time gets closer.</span></p></div>
