<body id="compText">To all you letterboxers who hike, backpack, camp, fish, etc... I get a lot of my backpacking recipes from Chef Glenn, The Backpacking Chef's website. The dehydrated chili I took on my AT hike this spring was his recipe, and it was the best thing I ate all week. He also hikes on the AT, as heÂ did this Spring about the same time as me. He has some interesting reviews of lightweight hiking equipment too. Just thought I'd share.
