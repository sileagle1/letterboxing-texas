<div>No! I was way off from the beginning. When I read the placer's comment: "if you ask if it's on the Appalachian Trail and I answer no, could mean it's not literally on the Trail but could be in the proximity", I was hoping it was in the area of CT or MA where I used to hike the Trail, but it seems like it's no where near that. I have been reading the chain however, and like you, Barefoot Lucy, WISH I were close enough to play!</div>

<div>Dewberry's new YoM box sounds like fun - hope it finds it's way to me eventually!</div>
