&gt; Sheesh...while we were making tomato jokes at Fearless Fox's expense, SJZ was busy wrecking her bicycle.  I'm sitting in a hospital room with her now, waiting for her to go to sleep.  We expect that she will have surgery tomorrow to fix her shin, which she gashed open to the bone.  Dare I say?  Yes I do.  It looks like diced tomato.<br/>
