&gt; Puddle Splasher, this week would have been a perfect time to visit Double Lake. Because of the rains, the lake is full, everything is green, the temperatures have been unusually cool (or at least less hot) for July. We took our grandkids over there Monday and didn't see a single other person. Also, they tore down the old concession building and restrooms and built brand new ones. It might be a good place for another mini-meet in the fall.<br/>
