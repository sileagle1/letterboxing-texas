                    <html><body><div>Funny how things hit you - but I was on a scout outing this weekend - a family trip with Lightning's patrol - when this very question came up.  Three of the four families are well aware of letterboxing and the fact that if we go anywhere, you can bet I'm also taking some clues if there are any boxes in the area to be found.  The fourth family is new to scouting and I only met the mom for the first time this weekend.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night, after dinner all together (14 of us total), I announced that I was heading out to find a few boxes before sunset (7:30, so I only had time for a scant few at best).  The mom of the new family asked me what I was talking about and I invited her along.  The other two moms didn't want to go, so it was just the two of us - and a great opportunity to get to know one another.  I gave her the clue book and we went over my homemade map and we set out.  She was by far the best navigator I've ever boxed with - hands down, no questions asked.   We got to the site of the first box and she had actually been there before so she was telling me all about the place.  I had never been, but I was really bummed they were closed because listening to her describe it, it sounded like my kind of place - one of those places I probably never would've found, but for letterboxing.  In fact, I might well have spent an hour or two there before I moved along!  We quickly found the box, and we found a gate that was open that allowed us to explore a bit before leaving - needless to say - nervously since we were afraid someone might come along and lock the gate.  It was a cool experience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We went on and found a second one, but it took us longer driving around to find the specific location (not actual road time, but on-site drive time) than actually finding the box, and when we found it, the view from it was - well - uninspiring.  While the subject matter might have been quite fascinating, that wasn't particularly well brought out in the clues and I found myself wishing I had thought to do more research of my own about the location.  Because of the fading light, we decided to call it good for the night.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we were driving away, she said "You know, now I wish we had stopped after the first one."  I was a little shocked to hear her say that, because I've felt that myself sometimes - the next to last box was such a good one - why did I have to go for "one more"?  It reminded me yet again that it is just fine to find even just one box in a day, if it was a really good one - one at a location I can get excited about, a nice stamp, a good search - that sort of thing, rather than boxes I can practically hang my hand out of the car to grab.  What really bugged me about the whole thing with her was - I went and found a few more early this morning, but that second box so turned her off that she wasn't interested in finding anymore, even after she had seemed to exchited about learning about the game.  Hopefully she'll go with me again sometime, but it won't be because she thinks she'll find anything like that second one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So what do y'all think?  To make it easier for you to think about it, here's a scenario - you are in a town with 40 boxes you have never found.  Would you strive to find the 40, choosing not to spend any more time in one place than you have to to find the box?  Or would you strive to find the 40, and plan to come back some other time to explore the cool things you didn't have time to do on your boxing day?  Or would you just go ahead and take the time to explore while you box, and plan to return some other time to find more boxes and do more exploring?  Are you a numbers person or an experiential person?  Needless to say, there is no right or wrong answer, and probably not even very many folks who are strictly one way or the other.  I'm just curious the thoughts of the group...<br clear="all"/>

 disappointing, but to me those boxes just make you appreciate the good ones even more.  i guess i sort of live by the philosophy that someone has taken the time to place the box for some reason and that i can appreciate.  one more issue with this question is that with gas prices as high as they are and in the region that i live having boxes so spread out, that if i am going to spend the gas money, then i want to make the most out of it and get the most boxes i can in one trip......ok, that is my 2 cents worth, of course i am not even sure if it is worth that...LOL</p>

<div>This will come as no surprise to you, Lucy, because I live in an area where there probably are at least 40 boxes which I haven't found. Even with the knowledge that some will inevitably go missing before I have the opportunity to find them, I still feel no pressure to rush around from box to box gathering as many stamps as possible. To me, a mediocre experience is a real downer, but a wonderfully interesting box (ie: total package) is a rush! I so admire and appreciate planters who put a lot of thought into their boxes, clues and locations. I've definitely been known to only pick up one or two boxes in a town, because I want to enjoy the entire experience - even if it takes all day. A really good box is an inspiration for me to keep striving to make my boxes better. My goal is for people to enjoy the boxes I've placed enough that I can feel I've contributed to a positive and fun experience for whoever finds it. I have several boxes on my worktable that I haven't placed yet because I haven't found a "perfect spot" for them yet.</div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am somewhere in the middle, but closer to "any letterbox is <br/>
wonderful". But I am in Bee County and there are no letterboxes here <br/>
except ones I have planted, and no great sites to hide letterboxes, <br/>
really. <br/>
<br/>
For me, the 'count' has nothing to do with it. But, in the day, I did <br/>
like to get as many as possible, because...well, just because they <br/>
are there, and I might not get another chance to get them, I guess. <br/>
But still, I did not rush frantically around trying to get every last <br/>
one. I am no longer willing to go any distance to letterbox, so that <br/>
leaves me in kind of a quandry. I am in the position of hiding and <br/>
finding my own boxes. ;)<br/>
<br/>
But a less than stellar letterbox has not ever left a bad taste in my <br/>
mouth. Give me a few trees, and I am happy. A historical letterbox is <br/>
WONDERFUL, but one just hidden in some random trees is good too. I <br/>
love trees or cemeteries or ...even fenceposts, I guess. To me, they <br/>
are all interesting to some degree. I love the surprise of what kind <br/>
of stamp is in the box. And I love seeing someone else's handiwork in <br/>
a handcarved stamp. Again, a great stamp is wonderful, but a very <br/>
humble stamp is good too. <br/>
<br/>
Although I haven't made or hidden a letterbox in quite a while, I do <br/>
have a couple of stamps carved, and some boxes in the making. They <br/>
will be hidden nearby, even though there are no great points of <br/>
interest here. That is, provided I can find ANY decent place to hide <br/>
them. <br/>
<br/>
Oddly enough, geocaching is really gaining popularity around here. <br/>
Now to me, I can't really see a whole lot of fun in that. But since <br/>
there are no letterboxes other than mine, here, I have taken my <br/>
grandsons out geocaching twice lately - 4 caches one day, and 2 the <br/>
second day. The oldest one loves using my GPS. But I'd much rather be <br/>
letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, and the other day, I was in line at a store, when the lady who <br/>
hid the geocaches we found, came up behind me. We are acquainted and <br/>
so I struck up a conversation with her. She has found at least one of <br/>
my letterboxes and said she takes friends to it every now and then to <br/>
show them what letterboxing is. We were amused at our differences in <br/>
favoring one over the other. She said that to her, letterboxing just <br/>
didn't cut it, because the clues tell you just right where to go, as <br/>
in, "Pick up this rock and look under it.". So for her, it is <br/>
apparently the puzzle of the hunt that is the thing. For me, besides <br/>
the outdoors, it is the artsy quality of letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
For anyone interested, you can see and read about our geocaching in <br/>
my blog, in the July entries. I think the June entries (archives) <br/>
have some letterboxing posts, too. <br/>

<div>I'll weigh in on this one, Lucy, because I've done both:  some 
"marathon" letterboxing a few times, and then some really special finds that 
took a long time to find, maybe even longer to solve the clues or more than one 
trip to get the box, and were all the more special for the extra personal 
investment of time and trouble.   From my point of view, anytime 
I've tried to look for too many boxes in a single trip (which would be just 
about anything over 6 or 7 maximum in a single day, even close 
together), I get a headache and begin to lose interest and the whole thing 
becomes more of an ordeal I just have to get through than an adventure or 
pleasant experience.  It's always that "one more box" that undoes me and 
makes me swear off letterboxing for awhile -- and has almost lost my LSS 
to letterboxing altogether unless I can practically guarantee a really 
good location that's worth the trip.  That's just me, of course - 
others might feel totally energized by more boxes to be found-go for it 
all!   That's OK for them, but not for me, I've found.   
I've also become more discriminating (in a good sense, I hope) about the boxes 
I'll even look for: I want a good letterboxing experience, an interesting or 
scenic or previously-undiscovered (by me) location, an interesting or artistic 
or unique stamp or logbook or clues.  I'm not really after upping my count 
(it's past 700, but I didn't even notice when that happened until 
sometime later as I logged the last dozen or so finds into my own 
personal records).  On long trips, I'll take clues, but only for those that 
sound like a good hike or a place I want to explore, or maybe a special box by 
some boxer I've heard about and whose stamps I expect to be really 
worthwhile.  I'm very happy to bring home 2 or 3 stamps on a two-week trip 
to a totally different place, and I've got a story to go with every one (which, 
lucky for most of you, I only share with a few people so you all  don't 
have to skim past all the trivial details from me).    
When I do get inspired to plant new boxes, more and more often it's not because 
there's a box I want to plant, but because there's a place I want to take 
finders to discover (well, OK, sometimes it's because there's a box I want to 
plant and I try to wait until I find that cool location that's just right!  
I've got three of those sitting in my letterboxing Box O' Stuff right now 
waiting until I find that just-right place; one has been waiting 3 
years.   Sometime I'll find that place and plant those 
boxes.  Until then, well, there are enough other boxes out there for 
finders to enjoy that mine can continue to wait.)</div>
<div>Nice thing about letterboxing:  no rules (but etiquette, 
yes).   Different people can take different approaches and enjoy the 
game their own way -- just as long as they consider and respect the environment, 
the specific locations, and the other planters/finders involved in the game, not 
just "litterboxing" or trashing other planters' boxes in the process.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, and on that note, I'd like to publicly recognize and thank some 
letterboxers:  Clueless Blues, I think they are, who were the last finders 
on a box I was checking on this week while doing a little maintenance and 
upkeep - they not only had carefully resealed every little baggy and the 
box itself very carefully, they'd replanted it so carefully and well that I 
almost couldn't find it myself - taking good care of my letterbox!  Thanks, 
guys!  I really appreciate your consideration for future finders!

commemorated with a letterbox don't always have awe-inspiring locations to go

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>
</p><div>Funny how things hit you - but I was on a scout outing this weekend - a 
family trip with Lightning's patrol - when this very question came up.  
Three of the four families are well aware of letterboxing and the fact that if 
we go anywhere, you can bet I'm also taking some clues if there are any 
boxes in the area to be found.  The fourth family is new to scouting 
and I only met the mom for the first time this weekend.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night, after dinner all together (14 of us total), I announced that I 
was heading out to find a few boxes before sunset (7:30, so I only had time for 
a scant few at best).  The mom of the new family asked me what I was 
talking about and I invited her along.  The other two moms didn't want to 
go, so it was just the two of us - and a great opportunity to get to know one 
another.  I gave her the clue book and we went over my homemade map and we 
set out.  She was by far the best navigator I've ever boxed with - hands 
down, no questions asked.   We got to the site of the first box and 
she had actually been there before so she was telling me all about the 
place.  I had never been, but I was really bummed they were closed because 
listening to her describe it, it sounded like my kind of place - one of those 
places I probably never would've found, but for letterboxing.  In fact, I 
might well have spent an hour or two there before I moved along!  We 
quickly found the box, and we found a gate that was open that allowed us to 
explore a bit before leaving - needless to say - nervously since we were afraid 
someone might come along and lock the gate.  It was a cool 
experience.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We went on and found a second one, but it took us longer driving around to 
find the specific location (not actual road time, but on-site drive time) than 
actually finding the box, and when we found it, the view from it was - well - 
uninspiring.  While the subject matter might have been quite fascinating, 
that wasn't particularly well brought out in the clues and I found myself 
wishing I had thought to do more research of my own about the location.  
Because of the fading light, we decided to call it good for the night.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we were driving away, she said "You know, now I wish we had stopped 
after the first one."  I was a little shocked to hear her say that, because 
I've felt that myself sometimes - the next to last box was such a good one - why 
did I have to go for "one more"?  It reminded me yet again that it is just 
fine to find even just one box in a day, if it was a really good one - one 
at a location I can get excited about, a nice stamp, a good search - that 
sort of thing, rather than boxes I can practically hang my hand out of the car 
to grab.  What really bugged me about the whole thing with her was - I went 
and found a few more early this morning, but that second box so turned her off 
that she wasn't interested in finding anymore, even after she had seemed to 
exchited about learning about the game.  Hopefully she'll go with me again 
sometime, but it won't be because she thinks she'll find anything like that 
second one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So what do y'all think?  To make it easier for you to think about it, 
here's a scenario - you are in a town with 40 boxes you have never found.  
Would you strive to find the 40, choosing not to spend any more time in one 
place than you have to to find the box?  Or would you strive to find the 
40, and plan to come back some other time to explore the cool things you 
didn't have time to do on your boxing day?  Or would you just go ahead and 
take the time to explore while you box, and plan to return some other time to 
find more boxes and do more exploring?  Are you a numbers person or an 
experiential person?  Needless to say, there is no right or wrong answer, 
and probably not even very many folks who are strictly one way or the 
other.  I'm just curious the thoughts of the group...<br clear="all"/><br/>--

&gt;<br/>
&gt;<br/>
I agree with you on this point, Wagtime. As much as I love a nice <br/>
long hike, the hike isn't necessarily what I think makes a great <br/>
location for a box. When I stated that I liked boxes that were in <br/>
good locations, I don't think that requires a long hike, but rather <br/>
an interesting, thoughtful hiding place. A drive-by can definitely be <br/>
a good location if it's safe and interesting. Some of my favorite <br/>
boxes have been truly urban such as Ruby Tuesday's box in downtown <br/>
Dallas, Kantexan's boxes in downtown Ft Worth, the box I found on the <br/>
busiest corner of downtown Reno, or VF's box smack in the middle of <br/>
SMU which may require much patience and stealth to retrieve or <br/>
replace. I know all boxes can't relate to their location (but I love <br/>
it when they do), but I am certainly happy when a box leads me to <br/>
discover a cool new location! I love it when that little voice in my <br/>
head says, "wow, I never knew this place existed!" What? Doesn't <br/>
everyone have a little voice in their head?<br/>

<p><span>A box placed in a great location, or taking me to someplace I
never would have discovered on my own – that is great.  But I can
also have a great day obsessively going from box to box.  Maybe when my F
count is up about 1000 I will be more discriminating and only choose boxes that
I think are going to be spectacular, or make boxing only incidental to my
exploration of the area, but for now I still get silly-happy to find every last
box.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I’ve never yet been disappointed by a stamp or log book or
location.  I still love the “I found it!” feeling.  I love
dragging out all my ink pads and markers and coloring the stamp in.  I
love looking through the logs books to see if my ever-widening circle of boxing
friends have been there before me and to “meet” the other boxers in
the area.  I like to look at the carvings and log books and get ideas for
a future box I may plant someday.   I like thinking about the person
who took the time to create and plant the letterbox and look forward to telling
them it is safe and in good shape.  Letterboxing.  What’s not
to love?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since most of my boxing is done with my 2 kids, we only do a few boxes<br/>
 at a time and usually pick boxes near to something we are going to<br/>
anyway. Or we pick a location with a couple of boxes and make a day of<br/>
it, so we are really mostly destination people. I COULD be a get a ton<br/>
at once person, but I think my kids help me slow down and enjoy places<br/>
more. We can't just find a box near a playground after all, we play<br/>
there for a while. <br/>
<br/>
Part of me worries that if I don't go find every box nearby a location<br/>
I won't get a chance to later. So I usually take clues to all the<br/>
boxes in an area "just in case". But that just means I always have<br/>
extra clues, which I keep in my bag in case we are back in an area.<br/>
I've found we are done after 3 boxes usually, if we even do that many<br/>
in a day. 1 box can be a ton of fun. I can do 6 if I'm by myself, but<br/>
that's the most I've ever done and both times I was TIRED of finding<br/>
boxes after that. <br/>
<br/>
So I guess I prefer "better", though I've never been disappointed by a<br/>
box really. (My kids like stamping their own stamp in their log books<br/>
as much as the stamps we find.) The thrill to them is the hunt, while<br/>
I enjoy the stamps more.<br/>

Heck, me and my little voice are best buddies!  And I do love when it gets to be excited about a new and interest place!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think for me it is both becuase I prefer quality but with gas and a <br/>
job I tend to go for quantity too.  Take today for example.  Got 3 boxes <br/>
after work. Two in Crockett. I have driven through Crockett at leat once <br/>
a month but I would have never stopped to see the attractions if not for <br/>
the letterboxes there.  And the last box of the day was in the middle of <br/>
nowhere, but that nowhere was between where I was and where I was going <br/>
(sort of) and went a ways out there to get it.  Beautiful area!  So <br/>
three boxes in 3 hours (including travel) but all for a quality reason.<br/>
