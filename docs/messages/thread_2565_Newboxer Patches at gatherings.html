                    <html><body><div>I want to remind everyone who will be attending that I'll have Newboxer patches on hand at the gathering.  They are $3 each, so if you have already spoken for patches or if you want to buy them then, please bring exact change so I don't have to turn Lightning upside down by his heels to shake change out of his pockets...He gets grumpy when I do that!

<div>Whatever I don't sell at Rusk, I'll go ahead and pay Mark for and I'll take the rest to Somerville  - so even if you won't be at Rusk, if you haven't already ordered your Newboxers patch from Mark, you'll have a chance in March too!
