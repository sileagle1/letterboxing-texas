<div>BUT - (and we've had this discussion before) - I really relate to the County approach on LBNA.  I was thinking about this on my way home from Denton last night as I crossed from Dallas County to Kaufman County.  It was funny because as I read the Kaufman County sign, I immediately got a little inventory in my head of the boxes in Kaufman County and a mental map of where the towns with letterboxes were in the county.  I also find I have a much easier time relating large areas together because in my mind I have towns placed in specific counties, so that all I have to do is know how the counties relate to the each other geographically - jigsaw puzzle style.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know much of this has to do with how people process information, so I'm once again reminded how glad I am we have both sites to use for those who process information in different ways.  I also wonder if this has to do with rural vs. urban?  Being a country girl, I have to think beyond the boundaries of my town and county sometimes to get what I need AND there is a lot less to remember in one county than there is in an urban area.

approaches.  I'm not a big person on having it all spoonfed (I don't<br/>
want hints on clues), but I do like to "see" where the town/park<br/>
is...especially when I travel.  This helps me decide whether a<br/>
particular box is do-able on a road trip.  There are a zillion Texas<br/>
counties, and I don't always know (like Lucy) off the top of my head<br/>
which ones are next to the others.  That information does not stay in<br/>
my brain (like why Rusk is in Cherokee County, not Rusk County--I<br/>
don't get that).<br/>
<br/>
I think part of my attitude is colored by where I live.  Houston has a<br/>
large surface area, and most of it is in Harris County.  If someone<br/>
were new or traveling, trying to figure out what box is where is just<br/>
an overwhelming &amp; daunting task.  For a box that is not a mystery, I<br/>
use the correct address as the location to help someone ease that<br/>
task.  Often, my clues are hard enough that I don't have to provide<br/>
the additional challenge of figuring out the streets too.<br/>
<br/>
I know some people like the mapping feature because they want to get<br/>
every box in an area--that's not me, I know I'm not going to be able<br/>
to detour that much, even if I wanted to the rest of the car would refuse.<br/>

<p>I think it's so interesting how there are so many different<br/>approaches. I'm not a big person on having it all spoonfed (I don't<br/>want hints on clues), but I do like to "see" where the town/park
<br/>is...especially when I travel. This helps me decide whether a<br/>particular box is do-able on a road trip. There are a zillion Texas<br/>counties, and I don't always know (like Lucy) off the top of my head<br/>which ones are next to the others. That information does not stay in
<br/>my brain (like why Rusk is in Cherokee County, not Rusk County--I<br/>don't get that).<br/><br/>I think part of my attitude is colored by where I live. Houston has a<br/>large surface area, and most of it is in Harris County. If someone
<br/>were new or traveling, trying to figure out what box is where is just<br/>an overwhelming &amp; daunting task. For a box that is not a mystery, I<br/>use the correct address as the location to help someone ease that<br/>
task. Often, my clues are hard enough that I don't have to provide<br/>the additional challenge of figuring out the streets too.<br/><br/>I know some people like the mapping feature because they want to get<br/>every box in an area--that's not me, I know I'm not going to be able
<br/>to detour that much, even if I wanted to the rest of the car would refuse.<br/><br/>Hello. My name is dewberry &amp; I am addicted to maps. Paper, Key Maps,<br/>Google Earth, Mapquest--I use them all every day. <br/><br/>dewberry

<div>Don't miss Silver Eagle's Salado letterbox.  It's right along the 
way!  Also in Austin, the Oakwood Cemetery is right next to I35, 
and it's a nice cool shady place, too, and that's a really cool box.  If 
you expand your range about 5 - 15 miles either direction from I35, there's a 
plethora of boxes out there to be found.  If you have time for a little 
hike, Georgetown has several boxes not far from the highway, but you'll have to 
make time to walk a ways to find them.  Still, it's a good break from the 
traffic.  Same is true in Austin - several good boxes not a long distance 
from I 35, but will require some time to walk to find them along the way, plus 
the additional time to wait for all the busy joggers, walkers, and others to 
pass by -- letterboxing stealth is an issue in Austin! </div>

Stargazer's box in West is very worth the stop, and the Czech Stop is<br/>
WONDERFUL!  Try the sausage and cheese kolaches as a snack, then take<br/>
a loaf of their beer bread home.  Serve it toasted, with butter and<br/>

Y'all've got to start putting food warnings on your posts. That sounds so good. There is nothing better than a fresh out of the oven kolache. And, if your lucky to get to the donut shop when they are coming out of the oven, even better. We used to go to a donut shop in Nampa, ID at 4 am (on my way home from the coffee shop we went to after working at Big Boy) and get cake donuts fresh out of the oven. I can still smell them. Oh, now I'm really hungry for donuts and kolaches.
