<br>
i'm a native who is back in the DFW area, though letterboxing is a <br>
very new hobby for me.  i started this past summer in north <br>
carolina, lost my log book after ~15 finds, and have since started <br>
over.  as some of you know, i indicate aubrey as my home, though <br>
technically the house is located in oak point.  these are areas ~10 <br>
miles east of denton (basically, take 380 east until you see the new <br>
communities).  so, since it's a bit of a drive to get down to the <br>
LB's in the DFW area, i try to make the most of my time while i'm <br>
there.  <br>
anyway, i wanted to share a couple pieces of info, for what they're <br>
worth:<br>
 - if y'all need someone to adopt the Day of the Dead stamp, it's a <br>
rather quick and painless drive for me to make (though pulling my <br>
own car up to the tree to look in was not so painless).<br>
 - Barefoot Lucy (and everyone else): i have carved and ready to go <br>
5 stamps to be placed up in this area, to include one in denton <br>
proper.  i haven't planted them yet, because i wanted to round out a <br>
series i'm making, which is 2 stamps away from being complete.  AND, <br>
i didn't want y'all to come all the way up here for just one or two <br>
stamps at a time, as opposed to the total of 7 i'll have ready <br>
relatively soon.  all that to say, if you can't get your daughter's <br>
boyfriend out to a LB somewhere else, i'll be bringing the LB's to <br>
him.<br>

cheers,<br>

<div>Welcome back to the DFW area p-quest and welcome to the Letterboxing Texas list. My sister, Viewfinder, and I were out letterboxing all day - quite close to your area it seems. We started in Greenville then worked our way back to Sister Grove in McKinney on 380. Beautiful day to be out boxing! Although I live down in the Mid-Cities area, my daughters both live in Collin County (Frisco) so I am in that area quite often and will be looking forward to your series in Denton! After four years in Connecticut, I returned to Texas last summer and this Texas letterboxing group is full of really special people! Welcome.</div>

Really though, I want to be sure to know when they hit<br>
the outdoors because, as I mentioned, my daughter's<br>
boyfriend lives right now in Denton and I'm just<br>
positive he would love letterboxing!<br>

P.S.  And welcome to our happy group!<br>
