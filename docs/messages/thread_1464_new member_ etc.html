<br/>
i'm a native who is back in the DFW area, though letterboxing is a <br/>
very new hobby for me.  i started this past summer in north <br/>
carolina, lost my log book after ~15 finds, and have since started <br/>
over.  as some of you know, i indicate aubrey as my home, though <br/>
technically the house is located in oak point.  these are areas ~10 <br/>
miles east of denton (basically, take 380 east until you see the new <br/>
communities).  so, since it's a bit of a drive to get down to the <br/>
LB's in the DFW area, i try to make the most of my time while i'm <br/>
there.  <br/>
anyway, i wanted to share a couple pieces of info, for what they're <br/>
worth:<br/>
 - if y'all need someone to adopt the Day of the Dead stamp, it's a <br/>
rather quick and painless drive for me to make (though pulling my <br/>
own car up to the tree to look in was not so painless).<br/>
 - Barefoot Lucy (and everyone else): i have carved and ready to go <br/>
5 stamps to be placed up in this area, to include one in denton <br/>
proper.  i haven't planted them yet, because i wanted to round out a <br/>
series i'm making, which is 2 stamps away from being complete.  AND, <br/>
i didn't want y'all to come all the way up here for just one or two <br/>
stamps at a time, as opposed to the total of 7 i'll have ready <br/>
relatively soon.  all that to say, if you can't get your daughter's <br/>
boyfriend out to a LB somewhere else, i'll be bringing the LB's to <br/>
him.<br/>
<br/>
cheers,<br/>

<div>Welcome back to the DFW area p-quest and welcome to the Letterboxing Texas list. My sister, Viewfinder, and I were out letterboxing all day - quite close to your area it seems. We started in Greenville then worked our way back to Sister Grove in McKinney on 380. Beautiful day to be out boxing! Although I live down in the Mid-Cities area, my daughters both live in Collin County (Frisco) so I am in that area quite often and will be looking forward to your series in Denton! After four years in Connecticut, I returned to Texas last summer and this Texas letterboxing group is full of really special people! Welcome.</div>

Really though, I want to be sure to know when they hit<br/>
the outdoors because, as I mentioned, my daughter's<br/>

positive he would love letterboxing!<br/>
