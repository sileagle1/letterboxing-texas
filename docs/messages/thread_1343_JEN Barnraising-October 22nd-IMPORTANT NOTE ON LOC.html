                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I've given up on a park in Waxahachie.  Dealing<br/>
with the Waxahachie Parks Department has been<br/>
frustrating and painfully slow and tedious.  They<br/>
can't seem to answer any questions right off the top<br/>
of their heads and they don't return phone calls,<br/>
emails, or carrier pigeons in even a remotely timely<br/>
manner, so I give up on them. I realized I was really<br/>
stressing out over this gathering solely because of<br/>
the location thing, so I knew it was time to find a<br/>
new solution.  Here it is, and if it causes anyone<br/>
heartburn, let me know and we'll figure out how we can<br/>
make it work for you (I really hope it doesn't kink up<br/>
anyone's plans though!).<br/>
<br/>
I've decided to move the gathering itself to Bardwell<br/>
Lake, and specifically to Waxahachie Creek Park.  It's<br/>
about 20 miles south of Waxahachie, and now not quite<br/>
central to the three counties (it only changes the<br/>
maximum distance East to West by about 5 or 6 miles,<br/>
so it's  close enough I think), and Dallas residents<br/>
will have to drive further by about 20 miles-sorry<br/>
about that!  I've rented an extra campsite next to my<br/>
own, so that we will have the two campsites to use for<br/>
the gathering (they have a group pavilion, but it's<br/>
for 200 people - figured the 30 or so of us would<br/>
rattle around in it!).  I've posted the link for<br/>
Bardwell before, but here it is again:<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
My scouter friends tell me it's pretty nice, so I feel<br/>
pretty sure it is.<br/>
<br/>
Here's what I have so far:<br/>
<br/>
RSVP's:<br/>
Here's the link to who has RSVP'd.  Check the list to<br/>
see if your name is there, otherwise, please go ahead<br/>
and give me a tentative RSVP now, even if you aren't<br/>
sure!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
PARTICIPATING, BUT NOT ATTENDING:<br/>
If you aren't attending, but you want to send a box,<br/>
now's the time to go ahead and do it.  Email me<br/>
offlist to get my snail mail address.  Same if you<br/>
want to send recipe cards.<br/>
<br/>
RECIPE EXCHANGE:<br/>
It's looking like 30 or so folks as it stands now.  If<br/>
you want to participate in the recipe exchange, plan<br/>
to prepare 30 cards with your recipe and your personal<br/>
stamp.  If you want to send recipe cards and have me<br/>
collect them and send them back to you, email me and<br/>
I'll send you my snail mail address.<br/>
<br/>
I'm going to send specific contact information and<br/>
location information to those who have RSVP'd<br/>
off-list.  That will probably go out tomorrow evening.<br/>
<br/>
Any questions, shoot!<br/>
Lucy<br/>
