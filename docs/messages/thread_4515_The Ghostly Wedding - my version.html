April 1, 2010<br/>
A large gathering of spirits and goblins decended on Telge Park today for the union of Ira Boxer and Oonie.   The festivities we hosted by Ira's parents, Youra &amp; Sheza Boxer, and lasted all day long.  The estranged Ima Boxer was out of the country at the time attending a funeral, and can not be reached for comment.   The proud couple is expecting a new addition this Halloween, so stay tuned for more details on this shocking story.<br/>
