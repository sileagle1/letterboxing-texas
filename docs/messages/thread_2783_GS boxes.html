                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi fellow GS letterboxers.  I'm busy planting away at GS camps too.  <br>
My girls love it and would love to have more boxes too find. In fact, <br>
at our bridging ceremony last week, many of them announced that <br>
letterboxing was their favorite activity from the past year.  It even <br>
beat horseback riding and learning to sew!<br>
<br>
If you are in the San Jacinto GS council, I would love for you to <br>
post your boxes to the files section of the new group I started right <br>
before the training in March.   <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingGSSJC/<br>
The council still hasn't made any progress toward putting the boxes <br>
on their website and I don't want to post them on LBNA since they are <br>
not available to anyone but scouts.   I thought this might be the <br>
best option (for the time being anyway).   And the message board is <br>
the easiest way to keep up with box status - like we do here.<br>
Spread the word to your fellow GS letterboxers too.<br>
<br>
ThimbleCat<br>
(who needs to actually schedule in more boxing activities because <br>
doing it in my free time (haha) just ain't happening these days)<br>
