                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi fellow GS letterboxers.  I'm busy planting away at GS camps too.  <br/>
My girls love it and would love to have more boxes too find. In fact, <br/>
at our bridging ceremony last week, many of them announced that <br/>
letterboxing was their favorite activity from the past year.  It even <br/>
beat horseback riding and learning to sew!<br/>
<br/>
If you are in the San Jacinto GS council, I would love for you to <br/>
post your boxes to the files section of the new group I started right <br/>
before the training in March.   <br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingGSSJC/<br/>
The council still hasn't made any progress toward putting the boxes <br/>
on their website and I don't want to post them on LBNA since they are <br/>
not available to anyone but scouts.   I thought this might be the <br/>
best option (for the time being anyway).   And the message board is <br/>
the easiest way to keep up with box status - like we do here.<br/>
Spread the word to your fellow GS letterboxers too.<br/>
<br/>

(who needs to actually schedule in more boxing activities because <br/>
doing it in my free time (haha) just ain't happening these days)<br/>

&gt; Hey Hoppers,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That is so cool that you learned about Letterboxing though Girl <br/>
&gt; Scouts, so did I.  I only planted 2, but they are in GS camps. I <br/>
&gt; have found about 15.  I will be in Galveston is weekend, planning <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; plant some and find some.  I will be planting on the Bolivar side <br/>
&gt; mostly.  I will be in Seabrook in early June, on the hunt for <br/>
yours. <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the IKEA info. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Hunting <br/>

&gt; &gt; Hello letterboxing friends,<br/>
&gt; &gt; My trail name is hoppers of seabrook, I travel with<br/>
&gt; &gt; helter-skelter and we have 2 little ones, Moona is 11<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Dittr is 6. We are neophyte boxers, but we've<br/>
&gt; &gt; planted about 8 boxes and found about 25 now. Moona<br/>
&gt; &gt; and I learned about letterboxing at girl scout camp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We are trying to put a letterbox in each of the parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; of seabrook because we think its a unique area and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; want other boxers to experience our local beauty. We<br/>
&gt; &gt; also get down to galveston fairly often and hope to<br/>
&gt; &gt; plant more down there for the boxing touristas that<br/>
&gt; &gt; come each summer.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Is Houston still letterboxing capital of NA? too cool,<br/>
&gt; &gt; good to be known for something besides obesity.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; BTW, IKEA today had these great little packs of<br/>
&gt; &gt; unlined spiral bound notebooks, about 4" x 3" and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are 99cents!! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>

<p>Hey ThimbleCat!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I thought I might throw out a little food for thought here.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you go ahead and list your scout camp boxes, the girls who like to log can still log their finds.<span>  </span>
You don't have to include the clues  just write a note to the effect that these boxes are on private property and are for the use of girl scouts only and encourage them to write you for further information.<span>
  </span>If they choose to write you, you can either tell them how to get to the yahoo group where the clues are or you can thank them for their interest but again emphasize that they are intended for GS use.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The other advantage to doing that is that you have a better chance of reaching GS folks who may not have heard of your yahoo group or of your planting endeavor.  As I'm sure you are well aware, it seems there is always a 
<span>stray leader or two who gets sidetracked and finally rejoins the tour after the vital information has been given.</span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just a thought or two, but with inflation these days</p>
<p>BarefootLucy</p>
<p>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"</p>
<p> </p>
<p>P.S.<span>  </span>Would you email me with your snail mail address?<span>  </span>I need to send you something!
