<br/>
Just got back from camping with the Cub Scout Pack and while there, <br/>
managed to do a little boxing.<br/>
<br/>
Found:  Silver Eagle's Enchanted Eagle Microbox.  Box was NOT in <br/>
correct location, but was visible to the naked eye as you approach the <br/>
correct location.  We stamped in (there are about 4 pages left in the <br/>
logbook) and then replaced box in the correct location.  The stamp is <br/>
beginning to crumble away on the edges, but otherwise, good image.  <br/>
Last documented find was April (I think?) 2004.  Maybe because box was <br/>
in wrong location?<br/>
<br/>
Attempted:  Eoghan's Enchanted Rock.  Am fairly certain that I was in <br/>
right spot, but could not find box after more than two hours searching <br/>
while on two separate occasions.<br/>
<br/>
Attempted:  Baby Bear's Yogi.  Again, am fairly certain that I was in <br/>
the right spot (esp. since that spot fit the clues for BOTH boxes), <br/>
but hate to report boxes missing unless it's so obvious that there is <br/>
absolutely NO WAY that I could be wrong.<br/>
<br/>
Planted:  Tiger Cubs Take Only Photos and Leave Only TRACKS!  Will <br/>
post clues shortly.<br/>
<br/>
The park was incredible...the bathroom facilities were the nicest I've <br/>
ever seen in a state park.  Great camping sites, too!  Enchanted Rock <br/>
is super cool and definitely worth the hike.  Do go in the AM before <br/>
the sun gets too high or you will pay, however!<br/>
<br/>
That's all for now...gotta go start unpacking and then repacking for <br/>
next weekend's camping trip!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks very much for finding and replacing my box where<br/>
it belongs.  I had given up hope on that one and had<br/>
even carved a new one for next time I'm out there.<br/>
Sorry you did not find any of the others, though.<br/>
<br/>
That park is great and is one of my favorites.  The<br/>
problem is that everyone else thinks so, too.  It is<br/>
very difficult to get a camping site and to even get<br/>
into the park on weekends, but well worth the effort.<br/>
Glad you had a good time!<br/>
