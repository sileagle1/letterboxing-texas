<br/>
A regular hitchhiker does have its own stamp and<br/>
logbook.<br/>
<br/>
But what about a parasite, the teeny tiny ones?  Are<br/>
they just a loose stamp that travels willy-nilly,<br/>
stamping as they pass by? Or, do they also have their<br/>
own separate log book?  We have only seen the evidence<br/>
of a parasite once or twice (the stamped image), so we<br/>
did not get to see if it had its own log book with it,<br/>
or not.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for your help.<br/>
<br/>
Ashby<br/>

                    <html><body><div>It's pretty much a given that if there is a stamp, there is also a logbook.  Possibly the only exception to this is a cootie - a funsy stamp that is handed about at a gathering, usually a kids' game of secretly infesting someone with the stamp, the lucky victim stamps it into their logbook and then has to pass it along slyly.
</div>

<div>A parasite is a HH that piggybacks with a HH.  If it only traveled with one HH for its entire life, I could see it wouldn't have to have a logbook, but some of the fun is removing it from one HH and planting it into another...and in that case, if I were its owner I would want it to have a logbook.  BUT - as with just about everything else to do with LB'ing, if YOU send a parasite off into the world and YOU don't want to send it with a logbook, it's yours and you can do with it as you please!
