<blockquote>I've chosen to permit my boxes; however, I believe planters should have the opportunity to take whatever action they feel appropriate with respect to permitting and they should be given the time to act upon it. My only purpose in making the comments I made is to remind finders that by being sloppy in letterboxing habits and not using stealth, they are forcing the hands of the placers and may jeopardize current or future placements. <br/>
<br/>Mike, you seem to have the best of it where you are, and I feel it is due in large part to a lot of hard work and diligence on your part to get park staff educated and on board. It ain't that way everywhere - yet, anyway! Folks have stories of trying for months to get boxes permitted, only to get juggled around from ranger to ranger, none of whom are familiar with stashing games and make it a low priority to learn or to stay in contact with placers who are trying to get or stay legal. And some parks take the stance of "don't worry about permits", which is well and good until their head ranger moves on and a new one comes in who wants to be hard-nosed about boxes (and presumably caches too). <br/>
<br/>I believe that the issues we in this half of the state are running into can be overcome with time and effort, just as you have with the far western parks. In the meantime, good practices by finders makes it a whole lot easier on placers, and really it isn't asking any more than should be asked of finders, even if every box were permitted and completely legal!<br/>
