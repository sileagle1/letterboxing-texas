                    <div class="plaintext-content">10 years ago today we were living in Sugar Land.  We went walking at Lost Creek Park every evening.  I wondered about that weirdo we saw sneaking around in the underbrush.  I wish I had known you guys then, I could have been a letterboxing pioneer!  It would be 2 1/2 years before we would find out about this great hobby.  I miss BL too.  I hope all is well with you.<br/>
