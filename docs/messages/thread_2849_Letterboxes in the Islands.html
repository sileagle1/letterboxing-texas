got back into the swing of working again (still on "Island Time").   I <br>
was able to place, and log the clues, for boxes on St Martin, Statia, <br>
St. Kitts, Nevis and Anguilla.   I was having so much fun on St. Barts <br>
that I forgot to place the "Cheeseburger in Paradise" box I carved for <br>
that island.   Oh well, we had a great time, and now have boxes on 5 <br>
new islands in the Carribean!  Now to start chasing all these new boxes <br>
in Texas.<br>
