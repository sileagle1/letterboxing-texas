                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found our first box almost exactly two years ago, so we certainly <br>
don't compare ourselves to pioneers like Silver Eagle and Barefoot <br>
Lucy, but even in those two years, letterboxing has changed <br>
somewhat.  It's not as intimate as it used to be when there were <br>
relatively few letterboxers.  I think it's just growing pains, and, <br>
as more people find out about it, the problems may only increase.  I <br>
think the main difference is that, like you, we tend to be more <br>
selective.  There are so many letterboxes in our area (sorry, Mike), <br>
that we realize we can't get them all, so we look for our favorite <br>
placers, knowing that we will find a good letterbox waiting for us.  <br>
Then, we look to see what other boxes are in the area and find them <br>
if we have time.  Sometimes, if we don't recognize the trail name, <br>
we may put that box off til later.  Sometimes, later never comes and <br>
the problem is, we may be missing some great boxes.  It's a Catch 22 <br>
situation.<br>

<div><font size="2">It's such a busy time of year that I'm sure that is contributing to our lack of "letterboxing excitement". I understand completely what Silver Eagle was saying about the abundance of boxes reducing the urge to rush right out and find every newly planted box. Weird that it has come to that, isn't it? I guess part of the thrill of life is the journey and not the destination. It was a slow road getting letterboxing going in Texas, but now that there has been an explosion, it seems like the fun of building the hobby has dissipated somewhat. On the bright side... I think once we get through the holidays and start planning our boxes and such for our FIFTH annual event, we'll all be enthusiastic again.</font></div>

<div> </div>
<div>Mike, when I was a kid, I was an only child, so the only kid I had to play games with was myself (although my mom, NacTrailCat, was usually willing to play games with me but I got a little tired of her destroying me at CandyLand, so I usually opted to play by myself).  I became very adept at playing two (or more) hands of a game so that I was competing against myself and doing it without cheating (I've always hated cheating and cheaters and as competitive as I am, I'd still rather lose honestly than win by cheating).  So here's what I have been thinking.  Maybe you should take a lesson from my only-childness and learn how to play both hider and finder.  I'd be glad to create a box or two and send them to you to hide, then you could promptly forget where you hid them so you could have the fun of finding them!

It was a slow road getting letterboxing going in Texas, but now that there has been an explosion, it seems like the fun of building the hobby has dissipated somewhat. On the bright side... I think once we get through the holidays and start planning our boxes and such for  our FIFTH annual event, we'll all be enthusiastic again.</font></div> <div><font size="2">Puddle Splasher</font></div> <div> </div> <div></div></div> <div> </div> <blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <div style="font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">----- Original Message ----- </div> <div style="background: rgb(228,

The <br/>usual soccer and scout activities are still going strong, but I'm  <br/>also coaching my daughter's basketball team. It is a labor of love, <br/>but quite time consuming. Also, my Dad is not doing well these days <br/>so I have been trying to spend more time visiting him across town. <br/>Now none of these things would normally stop me from letterboxing, <br/>but I have also grown somewhat cool toward our hobby.<br/><br/>Lately, I no longer feel the urge to rush out and find every new box<br/>that gets placed, and this might not be a bad thing. Maybe I'm <br/>finally ready to slow down and "smell the boxes". Part of
 this<br/>change in attitude is due to the overwhelming number of boxes now<br/>in the Houston area. I used to get excited whenever a new box was <br/>placed nearby, but now I don't even print the clues out right away.<br/>I'm not complaining about all the boxes, but I don't feel compelled<br/>to rush like before. Another factor is the natural progression of<br/>excitement loss for any new hobby. When you first discover something<br/>new, you  can't get enough of it, but eventually your ardor cools.<br/>The great thing about those of us still here after many years is that<br/>even though the newness wore off, we still enjoy letterboxing at some<br/>level and won't give it up. So I tip my hat to all of you that<br/>continue to pursue this hobby, through good times and bad, and here's<br/>hoping we all add a little spark to our letterboxing lives soon.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,

I don't Christmas <br/>shop <br/>&gt; anymore. I have not been letterboxing much lately either. We bought <br/>a <br/>&gt; double wide Moble home, late model but stripped of all ! applianc es <br/>and <br/>&gt; the floors need help. We have been replacing  and repairing it. We <br/>have <br/>&gt; not decided to rent it or move into it and sell our home. We are <br/>&gt; thinking seriously concidering the later. We are planing to travel <br/>&gt; quite a bit so we don't need the upkeep that this home requires and <br/>my <br/>&gt; husband is getting tired of raking leaves. <br/>&gt; Ok now it is your turn.
