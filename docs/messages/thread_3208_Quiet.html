don't compare ourselves to pioneers like Silver Eagle and Barefoot <br/>
Lucy, but even in those two years, letterboxing has changed <br/>
somewhat.  It's not as intimate as it used to be when there were <br/>
relatively few letterboxers.  I think it's just growing pains, and, <br/>
as more people find out about it, the problems may only increase.  I <br/>
think the main difference is that, like you, we tend to be more <br/>
selective.  There are so many letterboxes in our area (sorry, Mike), <br/>
that we realize we can't get them all, so we look for our favorite <br/>
placers, knowing that we will find a good letterbox waiting for us.  <br/>
Then, we look to see what other boxes are in the area and find them <br/>
if we have time.  Sometimes, if we don't recognize the trail name, <br/>
we may put that box off til later.  Sometimes, later never comes and <br/>
the problem is, we may be missing some great boxes.  It's a Catch 22 <br/>
situation.<br/>

<div>
<div>It's such a busy time of year that I'm sure that is contributing to our lack of "letterboxing excitement". I understand completely what Silver Eagle was saying about the abundance of boxes reducing the urge to rush right out and find every newly planted box. Weird that it has come to that, isn't it? I guess part of the thrill of life is the journey and not the destination. It was a slow road getting letterboxing going in Texas, but now that there has been an explosion, it seems like the fun of building the hobby has dissipated somewhat. On the bright side... I think once we get through the holidays and start planning our boxes and such for our FIFTH annual event, we'll all be enthusiastic again.</div>

<div>It sounds like several letterboxers have plans to vacation out your way pretty soon, so you can look forward to seeing some new stamps in your logbook and hopefully arrange for an exchange or two. Whoo Hoo!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>Mike, when I was a kid, I was an only child, so the only kid I had to play games with was myself (although my mom, NacTrailCat, was usually willing to play games with me but I got a little tired of her destroying me at CandyLand, so I usually opted to play by myself).  I became very adept at playing two (or more) hands of a game so that I was competing against myself and doing it without cheating (I've always hated cheating and cheaters and as competitive as I am, I'd still rather lose honestly than win by cheating).  So here's what I have been thinking.  Maybe you should take a lesson from my only-childness and learn how to play both hider and finder.  I'd be glad to create a box or two and send them to you to hide, then you could promptly forget where you hid them so you could have the fun of finding them!
