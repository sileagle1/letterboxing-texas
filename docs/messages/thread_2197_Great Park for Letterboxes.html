<div>I know lots of people 
are coming from out of Town for the gathering in October, and I know the number 
of boxes and size of Houston can be pretty overwhelming.  Dewberry is going 
to "show off" Memorial park on Sunday, a great place with lots of fantastic 
boxes.  Another great place to letterbox in Houston is Telge Park in 
Cypress, where the Terrors on Telge was held last October.  The park has 
many letterboxes, most with a Halloween theme.  This week I added "The 
Haunted Hotel", a five box series.  Dewberry has 2 new ones there, and 
Teamking has re hidden her Halloween box.  This is a great park to go with 
kids, and most of the boxes are right up kids alleys.  I just thought I'd 
point it out to anyone visiting and not sure where to go, and also to all the 
new Houston area boxers who may not be aware that Telge is "Haunted" with 
letterboxes!  When I don't have a mad baby trying to help me type I'll sit 
down and post a list of all the boxes that can be found in this park.  
Happy Hauntings...only 30 days until 
Halloween!!!!!MO5</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree.  I just found that one yesterday and it is a riot.  We <br/>
might have to get Baby Bear to start rating his boxes like movies:  <br/>
G, PG, R, etc.  I would rate this one PG.<br/>
