<br>
I just uploaded a file to our group which gives the information on the new<br>
TX patches, including prices (please check my math!). <br>
You may wonder why I haven't rounded up the prices to some sane figures!<br>
Well, I really do not want to be making even a few cents profit off our<br>
letterboxing group - but I'd like to toss out an idea for future discussion:<br>
next time we, as a group, decide to produce shirts, patches or whatever, it<br>
might be useful to round up the costs and throw the difference into a "pot"<br>
for reserving the group areas for gatherings. Or to buy prizes for games at<br>
gatherings - or drinks - or firewood - whatever!<br>
But for now, you guys will have to tolerate writing checks for odd numbers<br>
of dollars and cents!!!<br>

that we should specify that the money be directed<br>

number of us benefit from it.  <br>
