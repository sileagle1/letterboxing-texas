                    <html><body><div>I received an email from Lois today that she noticed "Posted" signs on the property where my GWP Series: Guadalupe Bass box was.  Needless to say, I didn't know it was private when I planted it, but I'm glad to find out before I got into trouble with the property owner!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>James grabbed the box and they took it with them and Lois will be sending it back to me.  I really appreciate their diligence on my behalf and I'm so glad they made the judgment call to go ahead and remove the box.  By no means would I ever care to give letterboxing a bad name, so I sure didn't want it to be on private property without permission.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have lots of new boxers right now, so I would like to point out that it is almost never, never okay to move or remove someone else's box.  The one primary occasion would be if the box is in jeopardy of being destroyed if something isn't done right away.  This situation is yet another when it would probably be best to do it, although if I didn't know the placer (as Lois and James and I know each other through several gatherings), I might prefer to contact them right away by email to let them know.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The reason letterboxing is as strong as it is in Texas is because we all look out for each other and our boxes.  I can tell you that fact is noticed well outside our boundaries too, and we should be proud that our lone star state of mind is strong and well in letterboxing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks again, James and Lois, for taking action - letterboxing wouldn't be the same without y'all!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
