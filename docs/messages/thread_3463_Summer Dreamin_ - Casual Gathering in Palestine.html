<div> </div>
<div>We've declared May 17th as Fantasy Vacation Day and Palestine as the designated vacation spot for us all.  Jim in Palestine assures us his crew is up for the challenge of having a bunch of letterboxers descend upon their quaint little East Texas town and I for one can't wait to plant another box or two over there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You are invited to share your vacation in any of a number of ways: make a box that reminds you of your dream vacation, bring food you would find on your vacation, dress the part, bring LTC's, make a special PT - just bring your vacation and let's have a great time!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you haven't noticed, Palestine is coming around nicely letterbox-wise - there are lots of great hiding places still empty, a nice collection of existing boxes, and a wonderful little town to boot (at least until football season, but that's another story).</div>
