It's Wes Garrison's logo mounted on a shape of the state of Texas. Wes<br>
has given his permission to use the logo for shirts, and I'm awaiting<br>
his response on use for events & website.<br>
I took a quick peek at your logo in the files, Silver Eagle, and it is<br>
absolutely charming - can't wait to find those stamps!!! It might,<br>
however, be difficult to do it justice on a T-shirt, since the<br>
individual images would be so tiny - and a lot of detail might be lost.<br>
Thanks for the inspiration! (Will I EVER be able to carve stamps that<br>
well??? My one attempt at carving an armadillo looked like a pig with<br>
problems...;-))<br>
