                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was a pretty perfect day to be out letterboxing in the DFW area. Actually I only looked for one box today, which is enough to satiate my appetite, and the rest of the day involved maintenance on my own boxes. I came to the realization that I have too many boxes to be able to maintain each of them properly, and I hate the idea of my boxes becoming litter. Therefore I decided to retire some of my boxes which were difficult for me to get to regularly. Some have been in place for quite a few years, so it was difficult for me to actually retire them, but now I feel like I can handle planting a few more closer to "home". So I spent most of my day in the Hurst, Bedford, Colleyville and Grapevine areas picking up old boxes and adding new logbooks and baggies to those I wanted to leave.<br>
I had the most amazing experience while checking on my Artist Series 2 in Grapevine, which I think most of you will want to hear about. I was sitting near the end of the trail waiting for a jogger to pass by so I could go return my last box safely to its hiding spot. The jogger was a beautiful young lady, with a contagious smile. As she ran passed me, she smiled and asked, "Are you a letterboxer"? I owned up and wondered what would cause her to ask. She ran on, and I returned my box, but as she came back by, I asked her if she also was a letterboxer. She said no but her mom was, and she stopped running and asked me my trail name. I told her Puddle Splasher, and she exclaimed, "My mom used to always talk about you. Your boxes were the first ones she found!" I asked who her mom is, and she said "she was Blooming Flowers." Of course my eyes immediately filled with tears. She told me she was training to run in a charity run to raise money for leukemia/lymphoma research in memory of her mom, and every time she runs down that trail where my boxes are, she thinks of how much her mom loved letterboxing. She told me that she and her little sister have shared her mom's stamps and LTCs because they were so special to her. I told her how much we all miss her mom on the Texas list, but what a great tribute it is to her mom that she made such a positive impact on so many people. She told me it was wonderful to have received all the nice comments and emails from letterboxers all over the country after her mom passed, and it really meant a lot to her family. I remembered how Blooming Flowers used to joke about having to trick her older daughter into going letterboxing, and it made me smile.<br>
Anyway, if any of you have clues printed out for any of my boxes, you might want to double check the status to make sure I didn't just retire them. The boxes I have not had a chance to do maintenance on as yet are the Moose Series, Kids Games and a few of my boxes in the McKinney area, but I will check on all of those in the next couple of weeks. Then all my boxes should be up to date on the list. Hopefully if they say they are active, they are, and are in good condition.<br>
