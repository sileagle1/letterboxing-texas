<div>You are amazing, Puddle Splasher!  I owe you another favor and I'm losing track of how many I owe you.  As I said, Wry Me left the box better than she found it.  Or maybe the Maine Ghost just borrowed it for a while, then put it back.  And thanks for the Baby Bear story, he was probably moving the box around on you, too.  By the way, no need to go check on Pass The Biscuits, Pappy, it's been reported by three different finders that the tree has been cut down, so it's bound to be true.  I'll have to make a trip to replace it some day soon.  I have a few new letterboxes that were made for the Metroplex and I need to get them out as well.  Thanks again, I appreciate your help.<br/>

&gt; Why U, Wry Me, but not Me? Why is it that I've been to Pecan Cemetery many times over the past five years, checking on our boxes there, but on your first visit, you get a visit from the Ghost of Maine and I never have? Not fair.<br/>
&gt; However, I am beyond happy to report that Boots Tex's Old Leathercoat is just where it's supposed to be waiting for its next visitor. In fact, Wry Me did such an outstanding job of rehiding it, at first I thought it wasn't there! I LOVE that! There were no markings on the trees as described by the last seeker, so I'm guessing she was at the wrong place. In fairness, they do have the main entrance to the Cemetery closed due to road construction (looks like it will open again within days), so you have to go around the corner to enter the cemetery, then work back to the Main Gate to start to follow the clues, however, that's LETTERBOXING, my friends!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Funny story: about five years ago, Baby Bear had hidden a box down by Trinity River in Irving (between Dallas and Ft Worth). Viewfinder and I also had boxes in that area, so we had a preconceived idea of just where it was. We drove out there and searched and searched the spot where we just KNEW it had to be, but no luck. In fact, we were pretty masterful in forcing his clues to match what we needed them to be. I got home that night, and re-read his clues and the light bulb went on: we were actually on the wrong trail. I went back the next morning and well, lets just say it's a lot easier to make sense of the clues when you're actually in the right place!<br/>
