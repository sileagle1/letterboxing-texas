<div>...and if you're on the west side of FW, there's a great zoo (on University 
Drive, south of I 30) and the Science Museum - great kids' museum, hands-on 
stuff, dinosaur digs, all that, on Montgomery, just across the parking lot from 
the WIll Rogers Coliseum, the Cowgirls Hall of Fame (also fun for kids - they 
can "ride" in a rodeo on video), and of course, the Kimbell and Amon Carter and 
Modern Art Museum -- if your kids like art, or for you if you do, and a great 
lawn for running and playing (and some of Kantexan's great LBs are there!) - and 
of course the Botanic Garden and Japanese Gardens (more Kantexan Letterboxes 
there, too!) and Log Cabin Village just across from the zoo on 
University, not far from TCU.  All great places to go with 
families!  (And University Village for some good shopping, tucked in 
between all those attractions, off University, south of I 30.)  Supposed to 
be a good airshow at Alliance this weekend, too - if the weather 
cooperates.  Or go to Cabela's Outfitters and look at the animal dioramas, 
just off I 35 at 170, close to Alliance Airport.  Enjoy your visit to FW, 
and hope you'll come back under better circumstances!  (or come on out 
toward Keller, Bedford, Colleyville,Southlake and Grapevine and find MY 
letterboxes!)  -- <em>Viewfinder</em></div></font></body></html>
