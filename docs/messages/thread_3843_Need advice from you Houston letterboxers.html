I was planning on boxing all day Tuesday at Memorial Park since it's right next to our hotel we'll be staying at, however I'm getting a bit overwhelmed with the number of boxes that are there. LOL I wondered if ya'll had some advice for me on what boxes to get or a specific route to take where I'll be able to get the most boxes easily in a days time. I started to print out every single clue, but it's just taking too long and I'm getting overwhelmed. So I thought I would turn to ya'll for advice on how to handle this. <br>
<br>
By the way, I'm at 91 finds right now. My goal is to hit 100 on this trip. So I need to find AT LEAST 9 boxes. :)<br>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I would split them up 
into two piles, one for the boxes that start at the mountain bike trails, and 
another for the boxes at the arboretum.  I think that would be the easiest 
way.  You won't be able to find them all in two days (heck, I live here and 
there are still a few I haven't found) but you should be able to hit 100 
boxes.  While hunting note that this area lost a lot of trees during Ike, 
so landmarks could be different from the clues.  Hope this helps,
