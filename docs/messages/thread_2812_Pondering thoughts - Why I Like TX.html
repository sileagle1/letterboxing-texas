                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good question and one that has made me think hard to answer.  I am a <br>
native, so for me the greatest thing about TX is being a Texan.  Not <br>
sure why, but Texans always seem to be a little more proud of their <br>
heritage, a little more rebelious in nature, and tough.  I'm probably <br>
prejudiced, but I feel these things and am proud to be a Texan.<br>
<br>
As far as the State itself, I can't think of many other states with <br>
as much diversity of people, climate and landscape as TX.  We have <br>
beaches, mountains, deserts, plains and woods.  We have dry heat over <br>
100 degrees to wet snow below freezing.  Some places might have one <br>
or two of these things better than us, but not all of them.  If I <br>
could live anywhere I wanted, I would still live in TX, just not <br>
Houston area.  My favorite area of TX is Davis Mts, and I need to get <br>
back that way soon.<br>

I agree with YALL, I love the diversity of our state.  I love the <br>
fact that I can drive all day from one side of the state to the <br>
other and still be in Texas.  Our long coast line, our raw desserts <br>
and mountains, our thick east Texas pines, our hills where the grass <br>
blows like waves and our quiet prairies; all make our state almost <br>
magic.  I even love the fact, that we are bordered with a whole <br>
other Country.   But the the people make this state great.  I hardly <br>
go anywhere in the state, and meet a stranger, at least their not <br>
strangers for long.  People here are just friendly, that's why our <br>
state motto is "Friendship".  I am so proud to be a Texan, of course <br>
that why I picked my trail name.  And if I can live anywhere, it <br>
would still be here in TEXAS!<br>

<div><span class="gmail_quote">Okay, I thought I'd get a response with the "lack of mountains"<br/>comment. I know that the southern end of the Rocky Mountains are in<br/>Texas. This is one place where my "non-native-ness" comes through. I
<br/>am from Colorado, so, to me, mountains are 14,j000 feet tall with snow<br/>on them year round.<br/></span></div>
<div><span class="gmail_quote">***************I can sure relate to this.  Although Fearless Fox is a native Texan and I'm a "Texan born out of state", we moved to California for several years after we got married.  While there, we fell in love with the ocean.  Probably the hardest thing for us in moving back to Texas was that we are landlocked.  Now folks say "But there's Galveston" or "South Padre" or...  And yes, there ARE those.  BUT - they are just nothing like the big ocean.  We were renting a house on the beach in Crystal Beach a few years ago when Hurricane Claudette rolled in, and in the last hours before she made landfall, Fearless Fox, SJZ, and I stayed in the water and body-surfed and rode waves like fools - and it was sure enough nice to be  in surf again!

<div><span class="gmail_quote">So yeah, there are waves and there are WAVES, and there are mountains and there are MOUNTAINS.</span></div>
