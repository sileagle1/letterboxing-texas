<div>Thanks, Barefoot Lucy, for taking care of my one and only East Texas box, 
Boxcar Willie.  The stamp was broken and the logbook was full, so I 
recarved the stamp and made a new logbook and Lucy replaced both for me, plus 
doing a little "box cleanup" on a box that's been in place since March 17, 
2006.  Isn't it wonderful how letterboxers look after each other's little 
treasures in the woods?  </div>
<div>    </div>
<div>Last week I replaced Bach's Box on the SMU Campus in Dallas, in the same 
place where it had been for just over two years.   Today I replaced 
logbooks for The Blues Brothers and Ornette Coleman, my two boxes in the Ft 
Worth Botanic Gardens, and noted that both are still happily well-hidden where 
they've been since Oct., 2006.    </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It really is satisfying to have a box you like, a stamp you're pleased 
with, and a location that visitors enjoy -- and have that box survives a long 
time with lots of visitors, because other letterboxers are taking such 
care!    </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks, all!  Happy letterboxing!  </div>

<div>I was glad to do it - before the gathering when you planted that box, there were so pitifully few boxes in East Texas that I was begging for folks to plant them and promising to take care of them if they would.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But how many times has someone put out an "All Call" on this list to ask for help with a distant box?  To my knowledge, not one of those calls went unanswered.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I truly believe that the reason letterboxing is so strong in Texas is because it's all about "we", not about "me".   I think we are all awesome!</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
