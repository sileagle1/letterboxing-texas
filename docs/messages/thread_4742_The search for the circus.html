&gt; The Rodgers 7 came to TALE 8, driving 3 hours and arriving at 5 pm, but looking for only 1 thing, The Circus Box. We'd planned to box til our hearts content and hoped to find several, make some new exchanges and enjoy the creativity of our fellow boxers expressed in event stamps. However, the circus was on the back of each of are minds at all times.<br/>
&gt;   The events of March 4, 2011 are understandable in light of our determination. We arrived at Frankie's already on the hunt for circus clues. Shortly after ordering our food WhizGee came to our group of tables to exchange stamps. With a heightened sensitivity to all things related to the big ring, Eaglemister of Rodgers 7 immediately noticed WhizGee's multi-color cap with spinner and circus pins. "It's a clue!!!" Spyker thought the same and began to take pictures of his hat and shirt. Eaglemister began to carefully listen to what WhizGee was saying. He over heard him mention that he shoveled Elephant dung for the Circus. "Another clue!!!" The members of the Rodgers 7 began to try to piece together what they'd learned. Eaglemister thought, "I've got to talk to him." WhizGee sat down at the table next to Eaglemister, who casually asked him, "So, you work for the circus?" He listened carefully, as WhizGee began to tell the story of two families who worked in the circus (a clue!) How WhizGee had been adopted into the circus family, "code for stamped in the box," Eaglemister thought. He listened to how WhizGee and Bell Motel had "visited the circus" in Phoenix where it had been an unseasonable 23 degrees and how the family who owned the circus had bought a new tent for $200,000. It was a fascinating, very detailed story but it smelled like cotton candy and sweaty clowns. As WhizGee talked, all Eaglemister could think was, this story is telling us how to get to the box, it's a narrative clue. He made mental notes of the story's main points. Later that night, lying awake, he began to piece things together, the road to the circus. First, the starting point, that was obvious, the Rodgers 7 had figured that out at the restaurant and had even stopped at the dump station to look for the box after supper since Elephant pooper scooper was a clear reference to the RV sewage disposal site. But where to go after that. The two families involved with the circus must have meant to look for two tombstones with those family names marked on it in the cemetery across from the dump stationh. And 23 degrees in Phoenix wasn't about the weather, it had to be a compass heading. So find the tombstones and find 23 degrees on the compass. Then $200,000 must have meant 200 paces. So walk 200 paces along 23 degrees. But then what? A piece of the puzzle was missing. <br/>
&gt; The next day, the Rodgers 7 was ready for anything. We watched for anything out of the ordinary. Eaglemister watched for a chance to interrogate WhizGee while PerkyP was on the look out for anything unusual. We wondered if anything in the raffle would help us. When PerkyP's number was called she walked to the front, hopeful there might be something there to help. Looking over the prize table at all of the empty, camouflaged containers, flashlights, electronics and other assorted prizes PerkyP noticed something strange, a bag of puzzle pieces with a note inside. Could this be the missing piece? She grabbed the bag and came back to the table. There she nervously opened the bag and began to assemble the puzzle. Quickly she noticed one piece said "circus" and another said "parked." She knew this was a clue. She hurriedly put the pieces back into the bag to keep others from seeing what she had. The Rodgers 7 could hardly wait for the raffle and group picture to be over so they could put the puzzle together and go to the circus. A few minutes after the lunch meetup was over the Rodgers 7 were back at their site celebrating the discovery of The Traveling Circus. <br/>

We had a great hunt at TALE8. I'm eager to carve exacto style.  I want<br/>
to plant 100 boxes!!  My girls are hooked on LB and they exchanged<br/>
more than I!!!<br/>

We did not find all the boxes but we had fun.  Thanks Rodgers!!!!<br/>

<div>Oh, my gosh!  This story just made our event!  We belong to the 
Circus Fans of America, and WhizGee’s propeller beanie is full of circus pins, 
but we never thought he’d be mistaken for a clue!  The funniest part was 
that all of WhizGee’s story was true!  Well, except for the part about him 
being the elephant poop scooper.  (Although, I did run the pony “sweep” 
(ride) for a week once, learning to shovel pony poop with one fell swoop!)  
I really do have “adopted” cousins – the Zoppe family -- who own their own 
circus, and we really did go out to visit them over the New Year’s weekend in 
Phoenix, and it really was 23 degrees (a record low), and their beautiful new 
tent really did cost $200,000!  WhizGee, who is perfectly capable of 
spinning a yarn, was telling the truth for once, and it turned out much funnier 
than if he had made something up!  </div>
<div>I am SO glad that the Rogers7 got the real clues to the Circus Train in the 
raffle, since they obviously worked the hardest to get the box!  When they 
stamp in, they will find a stamp of my cousin Nino Zoppe, and his half-brother, 
Tino Wallenda, as a further memento of all their hard work to decipher the 
“narrative” clue.  I think the Rogers7 have introduced a whole new level of 
creativity to this event!  I am still laughing!</div>
