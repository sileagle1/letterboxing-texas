19 more boxes (and a hitchhiker) that we didn't have time to find <br/>
yesterday.  I was a little surprised to find that many of the boxes <br/>
had only a few entries, Most of the ones on Walk 4 had only one entry <br/>
(Daisy and Onslow).  That was the "mystery journey" and if you missed <br/>
it, you missed some fantastic boxes and great stamps.  We loved the <br/>
felt-wrapped stamps (some of them even had hand-made felt pouches for <br/>
the stamps) and the imaginative log books.  The contributers obviously <br/>
put in a lot time on their boxes and I'd like to sincerely thank them <br/>
for that.  The stamp(s) for "A Series of Unfortunate Events" by Camp <br/>
Fire Lady from Washington was a work of art.  That was probably my <br/>
favorite box of the weekend.  A Big TEXAS THANKS from us for <br/>
generously sharing your talents with us.<br/>
