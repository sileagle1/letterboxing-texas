<br/>
As of this morning, we have 9 Texas Letterboxing T-shirts on order. When we<br/>
reach 20, I'll submit the order and then it's about 3 weeks before they're<br/>
ready.<br/>
<br/>
The Texas T-shirts are 100% cotton, "beefy T's", in desert-washed pigment<br/>
dyed colors of dusty blue or dusty green. On the upper left chest area is<br/>
the orange Texas state shape letterboxing logo (see the files). In the past,<br/>
these shirts have cost about $9.00 each. Sizes are YOUTH (S,M,L) or ADULT<br/>
(S,M,L,XL,XXL,XXXL) with the larger sizes costing a couple of dollars more.<br/>
If you would like to order T-shirts, please include the following<br/>
information in an email to us at:<br/>
<br/>
celticlions@comcast.net<br/>
<br/>
1. Your trailname<br/>
<br/>
2. Your "real name"!<br/>
<br/>
3. Your shipping address<br/>
<br/>
4. The number &amp; sizes of shirts<br/>
<br/>
5. The color (Blue or Green)<br/>
<br/>
We MetroBoxers are talking about a gathering or mini-gathering this fall,<br/>
but nothing is beyond "chatting" stage yet. If we are able to host<br/>
something, then of course everyone is welcome to pick up shirts at that<br/>
event. Barefoot Lucy will be hosting a "barn-raising" possibly in October,<br/>
so that may be another pick-up opportunity.<br/>
However, when you are estimating your cost, it would be better to assume you<br/>
may need to pay shipping (about $3-$4.00). Checks payable to me will be due<br/>
only when I can confirm to you the exact cost, which will happen when we<br/>
have 20 or so shirts ordered.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
