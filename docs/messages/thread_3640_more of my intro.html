it is just outside of Dallas.  As huge as it is, I can't seem to find <br>
any boxes here.  Appearently there had been a series along Duck Creek, <br>
but I don't think they exist anymore.  My friend and Co-Leader went to <br>
check one out in Richardson....but alas it was not there.  She said it <br>
looked like the city had been doing some repair work with the stones.  <br>
Anyway any ideas and suggestions are welcome.<br>
Thanks, Misty  <br>
