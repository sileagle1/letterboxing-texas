Eaglette, I carried my purse along with us (I'm very bad about <br/>
leaving it in the car), so I really appreciate the warning.  The <br/>
amusing thing was when Asterix had to carry it for bits.<br/>
<br/>
We found all three boxes.  The first one was really wedged into the <br/>
tree, so thanks to TeamKing for the warning.  I left a stick in the <br/>
tree hollow for others to use to get the box out.  <br/>

Now I have to go bathe in poison ivy scrub, a daily occurrence when <br/>
I try to go boxing these days.<br/>

Gosh, I hate this happened for y'all.  I guess this<br/>
didn't give your wife any warm fuzzies for<br/>
letterboxing, did it?  I wish I knew why some people<br/>
feel it necessary to intrude in the lives of others.  <br/>
<br/>
I hope someone does something unexpected and wonderful<br/>
for you soon to restore your faith in humanity.  I<br/>
really like to believe most people are fundamentally<br/>
good at heart.  I hope I'm not wrong.<br/>

<div>There are some parking areas along the Appalachian Trail  where they warn you on their website that these areas are particularly notorious for having cars broken into. I don't carry a purse in my car anymore when I'm planning to hike, but instead put my "necessary items" in my small backpack to carry with me. I always wore my pepper spray clipped to the front strap of my backpack where it would be in easy reach until a police officer told me to carry it in my pocket because the element of surprise is an important factor when needing to use it. Last fall, when my sister, Viewfinder, and I were having a little trip through New England, we drove up into Canada one afternoon and my pepper spray was confiscated at the border. They explained it was a felony to carry Pepper Spray in Canada. My bad!</div>
