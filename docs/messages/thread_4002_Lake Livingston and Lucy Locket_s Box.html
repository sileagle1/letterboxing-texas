<br>
Yes, the ranger at Lake Livingston contacted me several weeks ago and said that he'd found my LB in good shape, but that the trail was severely damaged and the signs on the trail were no longer legible due to Ike.  He suggested I do maintenance on the box.  <br>
<br>
As soon as I was able, I headed down to Lake Livingston.  When I got there, the trail was closed for maintenance, but I was rebellious and took a hike down it anyway and grabbed my box.  The trail was difficult to follow and trees were down everywhere.  The signs on the trail were basically useless now.  <br>
<br>
My intent was to re-hide the box in the same park, but most of the trails were closed, so I took it with me and retired it.  It was kind of a sentimental box anyway, because IRA Boxer had stamped in and proclaimed the Hank Hill box as his first find.  :-)  <br>
