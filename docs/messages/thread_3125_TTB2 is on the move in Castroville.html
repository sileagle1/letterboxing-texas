letterboxing.  We thought it would be a fun place to plant the tour<br/>
bus.  Here is the info:<br/>
<br/>
The park is located at:<br/>
816 Alsace Ave<br/>
Castroville, Texas<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
To find the Tour Bus:<br/>
<br/>
Park you car in the "Pool Parking" lot near the hiking/nature trail<br/>
head.  <br/>
<br/>
Upon entering the trail you will see a directional sign pointing to<br/>
the different trails.  Follow the "Cross Hill Trail."  <br/>
<br/>
Follow the path until you come to a second red bench.  This one was<br/>
donated by the Sharp Family.  You will go directly behind the bench<br/>
and there will be a tree with several small trunks, look near this<br/>
tree under several rocks and you will find the bus.<br/>
<br/>
Before you head out grab the clues to the Little Guys series and you<br/>
can pick up those boxes as well.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the hiking trails, there is a playground, a swimming pool<br/>
(I think it may be closed now) , a camping area, and places to picnic.<br/>
 It is a great place to spend the afternoon.  While you do not need<br/>
money to hike, it is $5.oo for a picnic table.<br/>
<br/>
So far the passengers on the bus all seem to be getting along.  We<br/>
have added a couple who are eager to tour and see some more of the<br/>
great state.<br/>
<br/>
Have Fun,<br/>
