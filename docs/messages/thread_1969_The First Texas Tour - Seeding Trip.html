<div>I wonder if you have always lived with trouble in your shadow???  A box confiscated by prison guards who feared it was a drug drop point?  And then there was the national park incident, and wasn't there also another brush with authorities over one of your boxes???

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess if you plant enough boxes something is going to go wrong at <br/>
some point.  At least I have not been bitten by anything yet.  I <br/>
forgot about the space shuttle explosion.  I sometimes wonder if a few <br/>
of my missing boxes were found by people searching for shuttle parts.  <br/>
I'm also surprised that Silver Eagle and I were not dragged into the <br/>
brig for hiding boxes at Fort Leavenworth, KS after 9/11.  That box <br/>
still makes me nervous.  Thank goodness it is not covered in camo tape!<br/>
