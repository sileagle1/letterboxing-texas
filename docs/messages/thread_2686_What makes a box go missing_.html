                    <html><body><div>I recently had someone ask me why boxes go missing.  They were bummed over the lost of their box, which they thought was well-hidden and would last forever. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't know about the rest of y'all, but when I have a box go missing, I can say things like "an animal must've gotten it" or "it was muggled" or "it wasn't rehidden well", but the long and short of it is sometimes (if I'm honest with myself) that I could've done a better job of hiding it in the first place.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Take as an example - Go Jacks.  I'm really bummed I lost that box.  But I'm frankly surprised it lasted as long as it did.  It was 1) in a high traffic area, 2) hidden under a rock that someone was eventually going to move, even if just for curiosity's sake, and 3) in a place that was very clean.  I think the only reason it lasted as long as it did was because I had to be emailed for clues so anyone who went and looked for it was keenly aware of the need to rehide well.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - what about y'all?  Have you ever visited a box and said "This one won't be here long" and sure enough it wasn't?  How did you know?  What were the tell-tale signs?  What are flags for you that a box won't live a long life?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hopefully all our answers will be helpful to new planters or planters who are having trouble with boxes that disappear!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>

                    <html><body><div>Yep.   I agree with that one.  I once came upon one of DrooP's like that - it looked like a funeral pyre in the middle of a tree.  I pared it down quite a bit, but even after I got rid of about half the stack, it still looked really obvious.  I hated to do any more because I didn't want it to be noticeably missing to anyone who might frequent the trail.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think there has to be a good balance between plenty of fodder in the area for hiding and overuse of fodder and sticks and rocks and such.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went out to my Killough Monument box today - I love the way that one hides.  I turn the rock over and find the box, then turn it back and it looks as though the rock hasn't been turned for months.  It's hard to find good hiding places like that.
