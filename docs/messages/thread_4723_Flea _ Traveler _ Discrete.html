Our texas events are cootie full and no one ever makes a big deal out of getting them. They just pass them along. My new event box cootie catcher is intended to help boxers get rid of unwanted cooties as well as being a supply area for boxers who need a few more cooties to distribute.  Children are more than welcome to raid the stach. I belive there are about 40 cooties in the box at the moment and it is packed full. I can't even fit the logbook and stamp in the box... My kids love to plant cooties and I will miss them at the event as well. There won't be anyone to rehide the cooties that get planted on me. It is there fathers weekend as well and that's why they are going to grandmamas house. She keeps them until he gets time to see them. He works long hours and doesn't have much time. <br/>Anyhow, I will see everyone next week. We have a camp site and will be there friday night-sunday. <br/>~ dawns glory ~<br/><br/><i><span>Connected by DROID on Verizon Wireless</span></i></div><br/><br/>-----Original message-----<br/><blockquote><div><b>From: </b>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;<b><br/>To: </b>letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<b><br/>Sent: </b>Sun, Feb 27, 2011 06:02:48 GMT+00:00<b><br/>Subject: </b>Re: [letterboxingtexas] Flea &amp; Traveler &amp; Discrete<br/><br/></div><div>

<div>Cooties!  After TALE last year, I was finding cooties in my car for weeks afterward, even one managed to go undetected for a couple of months!  They did make me smile, though... guess that's what you ask for when you park a top-down convertible near the gathering all day.  Sorry to say that neither I nor my cootie-invitational little Miata will make it to this year's TALE because of a conflict.  However, I have two boxes already in that park just awaiting your visits, so I hope everyone has fun.  Maybe next year...</div>

<div>I like fleas and cooties and hitchhikers but not everyone will agree that they are fun... Spoil sports. I love carving them and letting my kids hide the cooties and fleas. I just finished 30 new cooties for tale8. But my kids just informed me that they dont want to go camping, they would rather go to grandmamas house for the weekend. Oh well, I guess that means more for my new cootie catcher event box. <br/>If someone is curious while I'm on the trail then I tell them I'm on a scavenger hunt. Lol I need to find some certain plant, or something to that effect. If I'm ot planting then I tell them I'm preparing a scout hiking day. Taking notes on where to leave trail markers for the scouts and planting scavenger items for them to find during the hike. That makes people less interested in following you and asking more questions than you want to answer. I've known boxers to wait to replant for over 45
 minutes. I'm glad you were in the clear after he left. If worse comes to worst then taking it with you to replant would normally be fine as long as you let the placer know you are doing it so if someone goes for it and it's missing everyone knows what happened and they can try again after you replace it asap. <br/>Can't wait to meet you at tale and get your traveler!<br/><br/>~dawns glory~<br/><br/><i><span>Connected by DROID on Verizon Wireless</span></i></div><br/><br/>-----Original message-----<br/>
