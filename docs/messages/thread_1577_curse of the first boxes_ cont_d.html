                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, the kids and I were checking on our first ever box, Rabbit<br>
House, placed a little over a year ago (12/31/04).  Its condition can<br>
only be described as weird.<br>
<br>
On top, inside the box was a hitchhiker, that must have been there for<br>
months--as Runs for Chocolate left it back in the summer (July).  <br>
<br>
Below the hitchhiker was a baggie with the soaked logbook for Rabbit<br>
House, but no stamp.   Huh????  Below that was a pen.  The inside of<br>
the box was dry, but dirty.<br>
<br>
This box had a bonus stamp, and it was also missing, but rooting<br>
around, we found the lid to the bonus box and the stamp, but could not<br>
find the original rabbit house stamp.<br>
<br>
This one I will recarve, because the box was intact.  I just think a<br>
careless boxer accidentally took the stamp, plus didn't seal either<br>
the baggie or the box well (either that or a geocacher found it, but<br>
there was no corresponding trinket, so that's less likely--and the<br>
geocache that was in this park went missing back in the early fall). <br>
This carving was crude, but it was our first ever, so I never recarved<br>
it primarily so other boxers could see what first carvings look bad<br>
for everyone!  Now, it'll look better after I recarve it, but I'm<br>
still sorta sad about it.  Some cool boxers and hitchhikers have been<br>
through there, and the logbook is hard to read.  Sigh.<br>
<br>
And I do feel bad about that hitchhiker that has been sitting there<br>
for 8 months--maybe I'll get that one going somewhere with more<br>
action.  Note to hitchhiker placers:  Make sure your email address is<br>
on the logbook too, not just the outside of the baggie, because the<br>
host box may get wet!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How odd!  I hope you eventually learn the story of<br>
what happened!<br>
<br>
I know what you mean about liking to leave those first<br>
rough carvings out there.  Our first Killough Monument<br>
stamp was - crude would be a compliment, but it was<br>
our first!  I have one imprint only of it, and to my<br>
knowledge it was never found before it went missing. <br>
We really didn't intend on replacing it, but when Ruby<br>
Tuesday asked very nicely if we would, we realized the<br>
time was right to do it.  The new carving is much<br>
prettier and shows a better command of the tools, so<br>
for those who like to go for good stamps, they'll like<br>
the new one better.<br>
<br>
Even though the first Killough Monument wasn't as nice<br>
as some of our later stamps, I would've left it in the<br>
wild forever if I had a choice.  That first box - that<br>
first stamp - have a little symbolism in my mind. <br>
They represent us stepping out on a limb and diving<br>
headfirst into something new and different - making a<br>
commitment.  <br>
<br>
And as you mentioned - in encourages new boxers to go<br>
ahead and place their first because we all started<br>
somewhere!<br>
<br>
Bummer for lost boxes - especially our firsts!<br>
