                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bum-MER!  First time I looked for Kantexan's Lake Chase series, I found <br>
#1 and #3, but #2 was missing.  First time I found Kantexan's mystery <br>
box A Sunny Day, it had been vandalized.  Since both had since been <br>
replaced, today my Refinding and Stamping day. Found Lake Chase #1, <br>
restamped, went on to find #2 -- not there, and not only am I sure I'd <br>
followed those clues exactly, my husband (who always finds things I <br>
can't find) searched with me and no luck. So we had to abandon that <br>
series yet again.  HOWEVER, we did find A Sunny Day in its new <br>
location.  This one is a sort of hard to find box even after you figure <br>
out the mystery location, but the clues ARE exactly right.  Next time, <br>
though, I'll pay better attention to the warning about thorns and dress <br>
appropriately.  Open-toe sandals are NOT good footwear for letterboxing <br>
if thorns are involved!  Thanks, Kantexan, for rehiding it.  AND, I'm <br>
not giving up on the Lake Chase series.  I really want to do that <br>
complete lake picture!  <br>
