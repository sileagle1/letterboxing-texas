changed conversations at family gatherings since we<br>
got involved in letterboxing.  You know - when you get<br>
together with family and they ask what you've been up<br>
to?  I say "Well, you see, there's this new hobby<br>
we've taken up..." and after I finish talking about a<br>
recent excursion, they say "Uhhhh....yeah.  How's the<br>
new job going?" and I say "Well you know I sell<br>
steeples now..." and they head to the bathroom because<br>
they don't know what to say about that either. <br>
Fortunately, we take it in stride (we've always been<br>
considered the weirdos of the family!) and laugh about<br>
it later.<br>
<br>
Well, surprisingly, my brother-in-law was mentioning<br>
letterboxing to his wife, and she was very<br>
enthusiastic about trying it!  She loves the idea of<br>
carving stamps, hiding them, finding them - the whole<br>
9 yards.  Bear in mind, this is the last woman on<br>
earth I would've expected to perk her ears up at the<br>
idea, but she has surprised me before, so I realize I<br>
shouldn't underestimate her.  Well, needless to say,<br>
she now wants to go on an outing.  Problem is, she<br>
(even more than I) is in a dead zone - Corsicana<br>
(Johnson-Ellis-Navarro counties area).  I want to make<br>
sure her first trip out is a lot of fun.  She could<br>
come to Jacksonville and I could take her to get the<br>
stamps we've already found, but I'm thinking I would<br>
like to find some new ones too.  I'm thinking possibly<br>
going to Mexia and then to Waco from her house.  <br>
<br>
Soooo....I see on the map that Baby Bear and Silver<br>
Eagle are the only ones who have placed any stamps in<br>
that area, and I also see that most of them have been<br>
recently checked (and I noticed that Jr. Texas Ranger<br>
is missing as of yesterday).  Has anyone else gone and<br>
found the Waco/Mexia stamps?  What is the one or two<br>
"must finds" in that area?  Would it be possible to<br>
get all of them in one day, bearing in mind we may<br>
have four adults and five kids in tow (two of which<br>
probably won't be much into it?)  May leave the guys<br>
behind with whatever kids don't want to go...<br>
<br>
I'm thinking we'll go in about three weeks, unless she<br>
really wants to hurry up and go, in which case it'll<br>
for sure be a one day trip.  Otherwise, we may camp<br>
and take a couple of days.<br>
<br>
Thoughts are appreciated!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know what you mean about family or friends looking<br>
at you like you are crazy when talking about letterboxing.<br>
Other than my brother Baby Bear, nobody has shown enough<br>
interest to try it, though they will at least tolerate <br>
my indulgence.<br>
As far as your trip, I think you could do several in<br>
one day and still spend some time enjoying the places<br>
they take you.  It is too bad that several of Baby Bear's<br>
boxes are now missing in that area (Comanche at Old Fort<br>
Parker SP & Val Verde Canon at Confederate Reunion Grounds SP)<br>
but most of mine are still there as reported to me just a <br>
few days ago.  If you start from Corsicana early, you could <br>
go south to Confederate Reunion Grounds SP for my Confederate <br>
Flag box and enjoy an easy hike while learning a little <br>
history.  I would allow about 1 hour to not rush.  Next head <br>
west to Waco for my Texas Ranger box.  The box will only take <br>
about 15 minutes to find and return, but if you want to see <br>
the Ranger Museum, allow at least another hour.  Next drive <br>
to the Old Suspension Bridge to look for Baby Bear's Don't <br>
Mess With TX box.  It won't take long to find his box but <br>
this would be a great place to eat a picnic lunch so allow <br>
another hour or so.  Next in Waco, drive to Cameron Park and <br>
look for Baby Bear's Baylor Bear box.  The box will take <br>
about 30 minutes but you might want to allow more to explore <br>
the park.  My Jr. Texas Ranger box was just reported missing<br>
its stamp & logbook so if you have time maybe you could<br>
verify that for me.  If it is true I would appreciate if<br>
you could collect the box for me since I don't intend to <br>
replace it and right now it is just trash.  The other box<br>
in this park (Liberty Bell) has also been reported missing<br>
but you might want to verify that, too.<br>
Now if you have time and energy you could make one more<br>
stop on your way back to Corsicana.  Go north to Lake<br>
Whitney SP for the Gone Fishin box.  I have not gotten<br>
this one yet or heard anything about it since it is fairly new.<br>
If you are camping, this might be a good spot, too.  Then<br>
you could go further north the next day to Dinosaur Valley SP<br>
for the 2 boxes there.<br>
A future trip could be to Dallas area for my Texas Star box<br>
and the three others in the area (Stampbook box, Spider's Lair<br>
& Halloween).  Hope this helps and that you have a fun enough<br>
trip to "hook" the future letterboxers!<br>
