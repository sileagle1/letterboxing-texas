                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to hear there is going to be a gathering close to home and look <br/>
forward to meeting these new boxers here in East Texas! You know you <br/>
can count us in! There are a lot of new boxes in the area that we need <br/>
to get, and that will be a great oppertunity for us.<br/>
    Also, I replaced the Flowers, Leaves Birds and Trees Box today. I <br/>
searched high and low for another spot, but could not feel comfortable <br/>
with anything, so since the box did last over a year, I put it back in <br/>
the same place basically. I put it closer to the wall away from the <br/>
sprinklers hoping it will stay there. It's the same stamp.  Lucy <br/>
Locket and I are planning a boxing marathon in a couple of weeks so I <br/>
may go back and try to find another spot.<br/>

<div>I was there last year while they were planting the daffodiles. I couldn't believe the size of their bulbs - huge! All last winter I kept thinking about those bulbs and couldn't wait to come back in the spring. I wasn't disappointed! Now you've got me excited for NEXT spring - which isn't that far away now.</div>
