refresh and renew, will be in Tyler for April 19-26. Planning to l'box <br>
Tyler and surrounding area, on to Jacksonville and Rusk. <br>
Recommendations for boxes? Late breaking news? Also planning to plant <br>
something in area for LA initiative.<br>
And we'd love to meet some of you to exchange. Probably Mon-Thurs are <br>
our best days.<br>
Will have lap top in hand, or rather on lap, but will need to find a <br>

<br>
I am so sorry that I am going to miss you while you're visiting Tyler.  <br>
I am currently in California taking care of "MOM" business.  I return <br>
home to Tyler on Wednesday, April 23rd for 1 1/2 days and I leave again <br>
on Friday, April 25th to Lubbock for a bowling tournament.  I plan on <br>
doing some letterboxing in the Lubbock area while I'm there.  <br>
<br>
As far as letterboxes in Tyler, there are 3 in Rose Rudman Park. "How <br>
Hot is it East Texas?" (puzzle to solve first), "Ring the Bell", and a <br>
new one by Blue Butterfly called "America's Rose Grower".<br>
<br>
Also, JB Kokopelli's "September Holiday Series" in Whitehouse is very <br>
nice and is about 5 miles from Tyler.  "The Planetarium" and "Soccer <br>
Rules" by JKC is good, and "Children's Park" is nice.  There are many <br>
more that you may want to check out on Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
Have fun and good hunting.<br>
<br>
