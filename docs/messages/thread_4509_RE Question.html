Thank you for the replies!  I didn't think this was the right thing to do. My lb partner and I have been on the trails for right at a year with around 500 finds. Our carves are simple, but our clues and logbooks are great.  We also make sure we take care of all the boxes we find.  I have 20 plants at Disney and quite a few in Austin. Some I have retired. She has over 20 plants. I hope to meet more boxers soon!<br>
