Perhaps next time you could write to the box-owner privately before you<br/>
discuss this much information about the box on the list?<br/>
Two groups found it easily very recently, but one other person had<br/>
trouble finding it, so I'm pulling the clues until I have time to make<br/>
sure the box is still there.<br/>
There was no poison ivy anywhere near the box, so I'm guessing you were<br/>
way off, and I'm guessing from the rest of your post that you may not<br/>
have read the beginning of the clues carefully enough.<br/>
But please remember that sometimes boxes ARE hard to find, and sometimes<br/>
they DO go missing.<br/>
When you begin to plant boxes yourself, you may be a bit more<br/>
empathetic;-)!<br/>

<div>Please accept my apologies. Please chalk it up to my sneezing, itchy, hot body.  If you are nowhere near poison Ivy, which I was sure you wouldn't have done, I was way off in more ways than one.  Sorry for my misdirected comments, well at least I have my almost 10 year old eager to clean her room when my other daughter and I leave for our next search.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for the tips and all of the time you put into this. </div>
