                    <div class="plaintext-content">The coolest thing happened last night!  We had our<br/>
monthly district-wide leader training meeting and one<br/>
of the topics of conversation is getting the boys<br/>
outside and doing outdoor requirements and so forth. <br/>
As we were closing the topics, one lady mentioned an<br/>
event coming up at Texas State Railroad (TSR) in June<br/>
that will feature geocaching.  I started suggesting<br/>
that she go take her Webelos to find my scout series,<br/>
and she told me she had already been to them with her<br/>
grandkils.  I had no idea anyone in the local scouting<br/>
community had shown an interest yet!  I had<br/>
distributed clues on our talk list, but no one ever<br/>
said a thing about them. <br/>
<br/>
She went on to tell me that she told the grandkids<br/>
they were going to hunt leprechauns and she proved to<br/>
them the existence of leprechauns by showing them the<br/>
"leprechaun mailboxes".  I can only imagine...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, she got interested and went and found one of<br/>
them at TSR, but was too tired after the 2.5 mile hike<br/>
at Jim Hogg to look for any but the closest...and she<br/>
said she didn't sign in because she didn't have a<br/>
stamp.  <br/>
<br/>
I was just so stoked when I left the meeting, and I<br/>
invited her to the gathering - who knows, maybe she'll<br/>
show up.  <br/>
