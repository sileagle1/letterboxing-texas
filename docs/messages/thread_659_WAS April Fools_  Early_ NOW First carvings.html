&lt;&lt; I wonder how others feel about their first carvings?&gt;&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Funny you would write that today. <br/>
CactusLicker is home sick from school and he is determined to carve a new<br/>
Celticlions stamp! <br/>
When he carved the first one a year ago we all thought it was great! By<br/>
August he had grown so much better at carving that he redid a much more<br/>
polished version. Well I still love that stamp - and I'm not sure I'm ready<br/>
to move on...<br/>
<br/>
I recently retrieved the first HH I carved - with an Xacto knife. It is<br/>
actually slightly better than I remembered - but that's not saying much!<br/>
