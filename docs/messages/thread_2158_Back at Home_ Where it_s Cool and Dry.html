<br>
LOL!  I feel your pain!<br>
<br>
My husband is convinced that it's not *real* camping unless you're <br>
in a tent.  But it seems that every time we get a new tent, we put <br>
it up for the first time in the dark.  I personally think that is <br>
grounds for divorce!  Tent or no, we can't stand the heat either.  <br>
His solution... a window A/C unit set on a wooden frame in the door <br>
of the tent.  I guess that's why I've kept him around.  :)<br>
<br>
Hope your next camping trip is less eventful.  If I were closer to <br>
you, I'd be there in a minute!<br>

                    <html><body><div>In my very short career as a Girl Scout, I convinced my troop leader that she should take us girls camping.  Looking back, I'm pretty sure it wasn't her idea of a good time, but to her credit, she put a campout together.  She and her husband, and another leader and her husband (none of whom had ever camped), and my parents (who were veteran campers) ventured out to the woods with about 8 girls, of whom I was the only one who had been camping.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We no sooner got out there and got set up than it began to rain.  Rather than let us girls play in the rain (it wasn't THAT bad), the leaders insisted we all get into one tent to stay dry.  Being the smart camper that I was, I knew that you should NEVER touch the sides of a tent during rain or it would kill the waterproofing.  I proceeded to tell the other girls and even felt compelled to demonstrate in one little place.  Well of course, each girl also felt she needed to see for herself, so seven more little fingers reached out to the canvas and touched - and seven little places began seeping.  To get out of the way of the leaks, girls began jumping and squirming and jerking away from the incoming water, causing even more leaks, until the entire tent was sloshing and I'm sure it looked like a bag of jumping beans from the outside.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That was my last meeting with Girl Scouts, and I've never been quite sure if my parents felt it would be for the best to find something else for me, or if the leaders made that suggestion.<br/><br/> </div>

</p><div>Well, I had my first Texas camping experience. First, it was hot as Hades. At 6pm, I was sure that I was going to melt and evaporate into the atmosphere. But, the tent was up and I had lots of water bottles. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Strawberry and I exchanged stamps. She showed me her logbook, which was really cool. Up till now, other letterboxers were only in my computer. Kind of like Bigfoot, you've heard of him, but never seen him. Is it real or imagination. So, that was neat. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She have me a demonstration. She traced, transferred and carved a stamp within minutes. She used a technique that I hadn't read about. I was in awe. She made it look so simple. I can't wait to try it. But, I will have to wait till I can get to a hobby store. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I decided I was going to wait until morning to do any hunting and/or planting. I wanted to move as little as possible, hiding from the heat.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By this time Cassie has decided that camping is not her thing. She had nothing to do, no one to play with and wanted her Granny. I think by the time we were done with the camping trip I had grounded her at least 8 times (all for the same week of course). 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By 2:30 am those ceiling fans for tents (the ones I laughed hysterically at when I saw them in Walmart) didn't sound like the most ridiculous thing I had ever heard of. I would've gladly traded all my earthly possessions for one. Seriously, I could hear the wind blowing in the trees. Why could I not feel it? 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A few minutes after that, I felt a couple of rain drops. I frantically woke my husband, we had to get the rain fly on. So, with me holding the flashlight, he got the rain fly on. I now know what the Indians felt like in their sweat houses. After the first few drops, the 'rain' stopped. So, Gary got out of the tent and took the rain fly off. An hour or so later, we went through the whole process again. Rain fly on, rain fly off. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of hours later, it really started raining. It wasn't a drizzle, a sprinkle, it was rain. I said, I'm staying up. I started putting things I knew we wouldn't need in the car. I almost took the dog and put him in the car, but decided to wait. 
D.O.G., the dog, spent the night in a crate under the trees, till the rain came. Then, he moved to under the table. He was not a happy camper either. There were trees that needed marking, even with the rope attached to the lease, he couldn't reach them. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By daylight, we had everything but the tent, coolers, Cassie and D.O.G. in the car. Strawberry and her husband were up and packed within minutes (I think they've done this a few times more than us).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I, being the helpful wife thought that I would would stack the coolers and D.O.G. together and take them to the car. Meanwhile, Gary was trying to fit a tent the size of DFW airport into a bag the size of a twinkie. I thought I was pretty resourceful making three trips into one. Strutting my way down the path with my two coolers and 
D.O.G. (in the crate), I hear a clunk, clunk, clunk. D.O.G. was rolling down the sidewalk. I just know someone has called the SPCA on me. They are going to take my dog away. He is traumatized for life. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we are putting the last of the items in the car, the torrential downpour started. It didn't let up till we were a few blocks from home. D.O.G. wouldn't come out from under the couch till Granny got there for dinner. She cooked for us, she was so glad that we got home alive. She was sure that we were going to be kidnapped, at the least. All it would take is for an hour with Cassie, the poster child for birth control and 
D.O.G. the ankle biter and they'd be paying the ransom to give us back.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, that was my weekend. The box I wanted to find will still be there next trip, the stamp I was going to carve will be a couple of days later and the box I was going to plant will just be planted elsewhere.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyone want to go camping this weekend?</div>
