letterboxing, I've had some time to take a look back<br/>
and see that the last year has been good to me<br/>
letterboxing-wise.<br/>
<br/>
When I started boxing in September 2003, there was a<br/>
scant few boxes to be found in our area.  But we found<br/>
them, and we fed ourselves by going to the first<br/>
gathering in Bastrop, and finally we got up the<br/>
gumption to place a few.  By the end of 2004 which was<br/>
a little more than 1 year in the game, our PFX count<br/>
was a whopping P5 F9 X23.  Throw in a Postal box or<br/>
two (not my thing I learned - I can't depend on myself<br/>
to get them mailed out quickly enough to suit everyone<br/>
else) and a couple Virtuals (okay in a pinch, but too<br/>
- still - for me to really enjoy).  I have to admit, I<br/>
was a little discouraged at that time because<br/>
letterboxing, while it was a lot of fun, was a whole<br/>
lot of work to get not much payout.<br/>
<br/>
We had planted our first box in February 2004 and it<br/>
disappeared within 3 months or so.  We planted another<br/>
shortly after that and it too was sucked into a black<br/>
hole.  Our next box was Oh Deer! at Fairfield, planted<br/>
on May 22, 2004, and thankfully it has stuck around.  <br/>
<br/>
It was right at the end of 2004 that I finally had a<br/>
hit on one of my boxes, and as it turned out, I found<br/>
THREE hits when I checked it - GG was first, followed<br/>
by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear on their epic<br/>
letterboxing adventure last December.  Finding those<br/>
log entries was exactly what I needed to keep the<br/>
faith and keep on letterboxing!  <br/>
<br/>
At the beginning of 2005 I was determined to seriously<br/>
up my F count but I realized it was going to mean some<br/>
serious traveling because there still were very, very<br/>
few boxes around my area and the only new ones were<br/>
ones I had planted.  <br/>
<br/>
A windfall hit in the form of an article in the local<br/>
paper and another article in Family Fun (I think that<br/>
was the one) and boxes and boxers began popping up<br/>
around me.  I suddenly found lots of opportunity<br/>
(relatively speaking) to find boxes and it was like a<br/>
breath of fresh air!  Eventually though, the pace<br/>
slowed down and about the only ones I haven't yet<br/>
found in my area are one box by TexasLuvBug right here<br/>
in my town that I guess I'm saving for a rainy day,<br/>
and the ones that Lucy Locket takes pleasure in<br/>
placing immediately after I've finished an area. <br/>
Still though, nice to be surrounded by boxes these<br/>
days, knowing that if I just need a fix, I could go<br/>
find one of those again just for kicks.<br/>
<br/>
At the first of the year, I focused quite a bit on<br/>
placing instead of finding, and what I discovered with<br/>
that is that you then have to check them regularly if<br/>
you want to feel like letterboxing CAN live<br/>
harmoniously with Leave No Trace principles.  And<br/>
actually, having boxes in the wild is pretty addictive<br/>
in itself.  You pass close to an area and you wonder<br/>
how your box is doing, so you swing in to check up on<br/>
it.  You suddenly realize you haven't heard anything<br/>
of a particular box in awhile, so you feel compelled<br/>
to go visit it.  You want to read those logbooks.  So<br/>
next thing I knew, my boxing time was occupied in part<br/>
with checking my plants, but I realized that was<br/>
perfectly okay with me because I enjoyed checking up<br/>
on them!<br/>
<br/>
Toward the end of the year, I suddenly realized I<br/>
really hadn't done much for my F count.  Even at the<br/>
gathering, I had been lazy in getting out and finding<br/>
boxes there.  So I felt the urge to go on mad boxing<br/>
binges to get the count up.  It's a lot harder to up<br/>
your count than you would think, especially if you are<br/>
trying so hard to do just that!<br/>
<br/>
Finally, today as we were sitting at Confederate<br/>
Reunion Grounds, just kicking back and enjoying the<br/>
surroundings, I realized that when I was worrying<br/>
about counts and not about experiencing the world<br/>
around me, I wasn't enjoying letterboxing as much as I<br/>
could have been.  Yes, it's nice to have a fatter<br/>
logbook, but not nearly as nice as knowing that I<br/>
walked the whole trail for every stamp I ever got<br/>
instead of bailing off the trail as soon as I got what<br/>
I came for.  And not as nice as breathing deep the air<br/>
around me as we go hunting.  And not as nice as those<br/>
odd little conversations that come up with my kids<br/>
especially when we're out in the woods - like "imagine<br/>
what the world must look like to an ant.  Do they even<br/>
know we're here because we are so big and they are so<br/>
small? And is there a world around us much bigger than<br/>
we are that we are oblivious of because we are so<br/>
small and it is so big?"<br/>
<br/>
Those wild trips in search of lots of boxes are loads<br/>
of fun, but for me, they aren't the meat of<br/>
letterboxing, and I'm glad I've tried a few of them so<br/>
I can realize that.  And I'll probably indulge myself<br/>
from time to time again, but I won't forget that the<br/>
slow easy trips are something special to savor.  <br/>
<br/>
My letterboxing year has indeed been good to me, not<br/>
as much in quantity as I had hoped, but much, much<br/>
more in quality than I had bargained for!<br/>
<br/>

<div>Thank you Lucy for sharing your past letterboxing experiences with us! I so enjoy reading other folks approach to this adventure we share! Although I sometimes think of letterboxing as something that can be done alone (searching for a box) - the truth is, we are not at all alone in this endeavor! When I first started letterboxing, I was more aware of my hike, finding the box, stamping in, etc. with little thought about the folks out there that made those boxes available. After getting acquainted with so many great letterboxers in person or through their participation in our website, I am very aware that each box represents a lot of time, creativity and thought of some pretty interesting people. That added dimension makes this a very personal and special activity for me. I actually try not to count my PFXs because I've found in the past when I paid too much attention to my count, it would result in my trying to find as many boxes as possible as fast as I could, and it took away from the enjoyment and excitement of my experience. (I refer to this as my personal character flaw.) But every once in awhile curiosity gets the best of me and I do count the entries in my journal! Doing so just confirms my suspicion - I love letterboxing and all that it involves. So.... thank you to all you great boxers out there who participate by carving stamps, hiding boxes, writing clues, searching for each others boxes and encouraging each other. I can't wait to meet a big 'ol bunch of you at our gathering in March!</div>
