Okay...this one I've definitely got $0.02 cents to toss around.  A WOM <br/>
box is, as Janet guessed, a Word of Mouth box.  <br/>
<br/>
IMHO, these boxes are usually boxes that the placer has put a ginormous <br/>
amount of time and effort into and does not want them to go missing.  <br/>
It may also be a box that is in a more delicate environmental area and <br/>
the placer doesn't want the most casual of boxers to go trampling <br/>
through the area.  They seem to be boxes that are placed for only the <br/>
most experienced of boxers (assuming that experienced boxers are more <br/>
stealthy, environmentally aware and always careful to RECOVER WELL!)<br/>
<br/>
In my case, when I did my Cookie Caper series in the Spring, my boxes <br/>
were all part of a series and you had to find them ALL to win the prize <br/>
(a box of GS cookies).  I didn't want casual boxers to hunt for them <br/>
and risk one of them being discovered and "lost", and then compromise <br/>
the series for those boxers that might come after them.  Therefore, I <br/>
only made the email link available to those boxers who took the time <br/>
and trouble to email me first and request the clues.  Though perhaps <br/>
not TECHNICALLY a WOM box...the clues were NOT made public to just any <br/>
Johnny or Susie boxer.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, the series went well and all boxes stayed safely hidden through <br/>
the end of the "cookie season".  (I do plan to repeat the series again <br/>
this year, but to get the clue link...you'll have to answer a riddle <br/>
a'la the BusyBeesFamily's Personal Traveler!)<br/>
<br/>
As far as sharing WOM clues...I think it's a definite "no-no" unless <br/>
you specifically ask the placer for permission.  I kinda think of WOM <br/>
clues as a "secret knock" to let you into the "secret club", and other <br/>
boxers should be invited by the placer.<br/>
<br/>
If you need hints (as I did once), I do think it's okay to ask other <br/>
boxers that you KNOW have had the clues before you.  However, when I <br/>
asked for hints (via the Txletterboxers group)...I tried to do so <br/>
subtly...without listing the WOM clues directly and without listing the <br/>
placer's name.  (I am still working on those clues, by the way! Pretty <br/>
much got them figured out, just need to set out on a trip!)<br/>
<br/>
That's all I've got on WOM boxes.  Anybody else?<br/>

I do have some WOM boxes.  I also have some that would be considered<br/>
"Hidden Clues."  Your imagination is free to take flight on what that<br/>
means.  You never know where a clue might be lurking. . .it's one of<br/>
my goals to really explore this idea and continue to add complexity to<br/>
my clue-ing.<br/>
<br/>
For instance, I really want to do a Flame War box, and if you were the<br/>
innocent recipient of a big ole Internet Flame, the clue would just<br/>
drop in your email inbox.  Kind of like a heal your wounds WOM box. <br/>
Doesn't that sound fun?  And a good way to poke fun at the whole<br/>
touchiness of people on Internet chat lists?<br/>
<br/>
Clearly, I personally love the tricky clues.  To me an obscured clue<br/>
is part of the fun--like having a present arrive unexpectedly, not for<br/>
your birthday or Valentines' or some Hallmark-created holiday, but<br/>
because it's Thursday and the giver was simply thinking of you.  When<br/>
you look at something and you realize there's another way to see,<br/>
well, to me that's amazing.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, when I distribute clues, I may mention that you are free to<br/>
share the clue with others who might appreciate it.  I personally do<br/>
not like it if without permission you share WOM clues or hidden clues<br/>
or the answers to my mystery boxes with others.  I won't publicly flay<br/>
you, but I will be much less likely to make you the recipient of the<br/>
next one.  <br/>
<br/>

<div>On behalf of my overworked brain- NOOOOOOOOO  DEWBERRY!!!!!!!!!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please don't make things harder!!!  There are many nights ( mostly 
during the summer when I don't have to get up early the next day!) that I will 
stay up all hours trying to solve those clues of yours!  And I LOVE it when 
I solve the puzzle and even want to go find the box- who cares if it is 2:00 in 
the morning?  :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the other hand, solving your puzzles gives a sense of accomplishment, 
letterboxing style!  Keep those puzzle/mystery boxes coming but the level 
of difficulty doesn't need to increase.  One of these days I am going to 
put a box out there and make you RUN a 25K to find it!  Instead of an 
overworked brain, you will have overworked feet!  </div>

<div>I LOVE the idea of your Flame War box! How fun. It is sometimes so hard for me not to put in my two cents worth when those flames are flashing, but I figure anything a person says can be misinterpreted and further fan the flames, so I generally just sit on my hands. I can't believe we are so fortunate on our Texas site that everyone is so considerate of each other. I hope you think of me when you drop an email into a box regarding your Flame War box!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm off to Connecticut tomorrow morning to pack our apartment up there. It is my intention to reward my hard work each day with at least one little local LB!</div>

<div>I once worked for a company whose owner was notoriously hot-tempered and moody.  When his car pulled into the parking lot you could almost hear the collective gasp throughout the company while everyone wondered what sort of mood he might be in and if it wasn't good, whose turn it would be to be on the hot seat.  Remarkably, he and I got along fine with rare exception and I was the only person in the history of the company to give notice and be allowed to serve it out - the normal MO was that if you were going in to quit, you had better pack your desk and carry the contents out to your car BEFORE you did the deed.  They threw an unauthorized going away party for me after my last day and imagine my surprise to see a host of former employees at the party and they inducted me into the ex-XYZ Company Survivor's Club.   I always imagined there was a cemetery somewhere of decapitated bodies of ex-employees, but I guess I was wrong.

All in all, I thought that was a reasonable, and interesting,<br/>
discussion about a new feature (the ranking system).  People feel<br/>
passionately one way or the other and that's a good thing.  It didn't<br/>
get all that personal.  There's one personality there who came close,<br/>

thank some older members for sticking up for us newbies though.<br/>

remembered a few locals who said they couldn't wait to have a new box<br/>
to find and to not worry about the carving, to make up for it in the<br/>
book or clues. I'm getting closer to actually jumping in feet first.<br/>

&gt;           Okay, I've got some cents to throw around on this. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I do have some WOM boxes. I also have some that would be considered<br/>
&gt; "Hidden Clues." Your imagination is free to take flight on what that<br/>
&gt; means. You never know where a clue might be lurking. . .it's one of<br/>
&gt; my goals to really explore this idea and continue to add complexity to<br/>
&gt; my clue-ing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For instance, I really want to do a Flame War box, and if you were the<br/>
&gt; innocent recipient of a big ole Internet Flame, the clue would just<br/>
&gt; drop in your email inbox. Kind of like a heal your wounds WOM box. <br/>
&gt; Doesn't that sound fun? And a good way to poke fun at the whole<br/>
&gt; touchiness of people on Internet chat lists?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Clearly, I personally love the tricky clues. To me an obscured clue<br/>
&gt; is part of the fun--like having a present arrive unexpectedly, not for<br/>
&gt; your birthday or Valentines' or some Hallmark-created holiday, but<br/>
&gt; because it's Thursday and the giver was simply thinking of you. When<br/>
&gt; you look at something and you realize there's another way to see,<br/>
&gt; well, to me that's amazing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, when I distribute clues, I may mention that you are free to<br/>
&gt; share the clue with others who might appreciate it. I personally do<br/>
&gt; not like it if without permission you share WOM clues or hidden clues<br/>
&gt; or the answers to my mystery boxes with others. I won't publicly flay<br/>
&gt; you, but I will be much less likely to make you the recipient of the<br/>
&gt; next one. <br/>
