<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="815361811-03112007">I find that my stamp ideas are easy.  TIME is my 
biggest enemy.  I don't have time to carve a stamp.  I don't have time 
to learn the skills needed to carve a stamp.  Some will say my letterboxes 
are not as good because I design the stamp on my computer, then pay to have it 
made and mailed to me.  I won't get into why I am so busy.  All I will 
say it that for those who don't like it, don't hunt my letterboxes.  The 
alternative would be NO LETTERBOXES in El Paso.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="815361811-03112007">When I pick a place for a letterbox, usually there is 
something there that is a prominent feature.  I have one box on top N. 
Franklin Mountain.  The stamp is a hiker, with a mountain in the 
distance.  One box used to be hidden under a fake cactus.  The stamp 
is of a cactus scene.  But the plastic cactus didn't hold up in the 
sunlight.  It is hidden differently now, but the stamp is still a 
cactus.  One is near an old Butterfield Stage station.  The stamp is a 
stagecoach and horses.  There is only one box so far that I didn't come up 
with the stamp for.  That is Hueco Tanks #1.  I copied the original 
stamp.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="815361811-03112007">I usually pick the place for the box or Geocache first 
(GASP - he said the G-word again!).  Then I build around the 
location.  But there are times when I can see a THEME letterbox being done, 
then a place for it being found afterward.  (Like the one Lucy did just for 
my son - Thanks Lucy - btw - he is not taking his letterboxing kit to 
Iraq.  He has no time either).</span></div>

I didn't know what to carve. So, I started looking at things in my life that I was already interested in, like astronomy, Fort Worth history, holidays, etc. Christmas is coming. You could do a Holiday series. It's really fun (and easy) to get those Christmas erasers that are shaped like Santa, Snowman, etc, and have your kids carve out the details on them. They make great stamps, and they are cheap.</div></span></blockquote><div><br/></div>Are there any books that you love? Favorite foods, restaurants, movies? Do you have any pets that you want to honor? Sports?</div><div><br/></div><div>The ideas will come, and eventually you'll have TOO many. You'll want to carve a stamp for every little thing that happens to you. Your life's story will be written in stamp images! ;-) -Stargazer</div><div><br/></div><div><br/><br/><br/><blockquote type="cite"><span class="Apple-style-span"><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><p><span class="Apple-style-span"></span></p></div></div></div><span><span class="Apple-style-span"></span></span></span></blockquote></div><br/></body></html>
