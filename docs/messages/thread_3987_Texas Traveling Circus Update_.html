                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mere minutes after TALE6 started, I saw a poster advertising tickets to<br/>
the Traveling Texas Circus.  Before I could figure it out, I heard a<br/>
commotion and ran to the parking lot.  To my surprise, the entire circus<br/>
was all there, hanging out in the bed of Boots Tex's DODGE truck- I knew<br/>
it was his from the license plate number.  They were having a loud<br/>
argument- something about figuring out who's the real ringmaster and a<br/>
surprise performance in Austin.  With Dee Pirate's help (I was a little<br/>
short to help them all out of the truck on my own), we wrangled all the<br/>
acts into the back of my Jetta.  Luckily, they had a lot of experience<br/>
cramming many people into a small car.  After a riotous drive home with<br/>
Dee Pirate, nrgkat and myself, the circus is laying low in my backyard. <br/>
They're groaning about the lack of cinnamon rolls- I think they've been<br/>
spoiled!  I'll keep y'all posted on who the real ringmaster is and all<br/>
the details on the surprise Austin performance.  I know we Austinites<br/>
have been dying for the TTC to come to town!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the fun at TALE6, everyone!<br/>
