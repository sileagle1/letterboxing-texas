We are planning on camping hiking letterboxing and water playing if the weather permits. Info on the park and on the letterboxes in/around would be greatly appreciated. Thanks in advance!</div>

                    <html><body><p>We camped there last Spring Break and it was a great time.  There are lots of letterboxes, some of them are missing, though we haven't found all of them yet.  There are many!  The trails are nicely kept and if you plan on fishing, bring your own bate.  They have reels and a tackle box you can check out, but no bate for sale.  Do be sure to drive down to see the fort (extra fee of $2/person I believe)  <br/>If you have young kids, they have an activity packet available.  And they have the Jr. Ranger explore packs to check out as well.  <br/><br/>Enjoy your time! </p></body></html>
