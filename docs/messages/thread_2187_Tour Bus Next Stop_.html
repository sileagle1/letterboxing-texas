I could get it to Dallas late today for Mike maybe????? My husband <br/>
hunts in Cisco and he could take it in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Those with experiencewhat should I do. BTW, I am ten min from First <br/>
Monday grounds in Canton and that would be a fabulous place and this <br/>
is first Monday weekend but I want to get it someplace those really <br/>
desiring it can have access before it is separated. The passengers <br/>
are amazing!<br/>

Well...of course, my vote is closer to Central Texas.  Hill Country.  <br/>
Capital...Austin.  Hint, hint, hint.<br/>
<br/>
I'm also not sure I would recommend Canton if it is a really busy <br/>
place.  From what I've heard (taking into account that I've never laid <br/>
eyes on the bus!) it's rather large, harder to hide in a really safe <br/>
location and it's most definitely very valuable after all the effort <br/>
everyone has put into it!  I'm sure you wouldn't want it to be <br/>
discovered.  <br/>
<br/>
Wherever you decide to place it...I'd choose an out-of-the-way <br/>
location and search, search, search until you find the perfect home <br/>
for it.<br/>
<br/>
Waco would be halfway between the Dallas area and Austin...hint, <br/>
hint.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Batty B  :-)<br/>

<div>I really have to agree with this - finding a good place 
for that Tour Bus is essential!  The advantage is, you can expect it won't 
remain in its hiding place long, but you do want to be sure it's 
really concealed and away from any possible accidental finders!  The main 
thing is to keep it travelling, on the road, where the next eager finder can 
rush in and swoop it up swiftly and keep it travellin' Texas!  And finding 
it is a big responsibility; it's so full of exciting passengers that it takes 
half a day to read the logbook and stamp them all, plus creating your own new 
stamp-passenger to add, so it's a big deal!  I know I've been lucky enough 
to have it twice, and hope sometime in the next year to be able to encounter it 
again and discover more new passengers, but the main thing with a big bus is - 
Safety for the bus and its important passengers!  Wherever it rejoins 
the road to continue its tour, I'm sure there will be eager finders with their 
gas tanks full ready to go after it!  </div>

&gt; I know Batty B really wants the Tour BUS box. I know it would be <br/>
&gt; nice to get it to Houston ?I will be in the area then but don't <br/>
&gt; think yall want me to hold on that long.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I could get it to Dallas late today for Mike maybe????? <br/>
<br/>
Thanks.  But I am at Ft. Hood as I type this.   By the time this gets <br/>
to the system, I will be approaching Austin.  By the time I can check <br/>
E-mail again I will be in San Antonio.  Dallas was my best chance, <br/>
unless someone is chaising me down.<br/>
<br/>
CU-all later.  Two boxes on the list today - 3d Cavalry and 4th ID.  <br/>
Maybe more if the in-laws think it is fun -  I hope - I hope - I hope -<br/>
 I hope - .........<br/>
<br/>
Mike.<br/>
