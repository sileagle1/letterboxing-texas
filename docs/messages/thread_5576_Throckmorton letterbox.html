                    <html><body><p>I remember when Baby Bear and I found that box back in 2012 it already had several notes from friends of the owners and we thought it was so cool they had embraced it. Even though only 3 or 4 letterboxers have logged the find, who knows how many potential boxers have found it over the years. At a time when most emails about boxes are bad news, this is quite refreshing!<br/><br/>This does bring up an interesting point I have noticed about letterboxing interest declining. It appears not as many people are boxing these days based on logged finds, which I realize is not a true indicator. Not sure if it is because few new people are joining the ranks or seasoned boxers are just too busy. For my own boxes I notice the same few people find everything I place, but other boxes in the same parks get much more visits (e.g. one of my Game boxes at Wild Basin has had only 2 finders since 2012 while other newer boxes have much more visits). Maybe it is because that game is harder to solve or that my clues are only on LBNA, but I am thankful for those of you still out there boxing. I also love hearing stories like this and would love to hear more.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>

Regardless,  I love letterboxing and I am doing what I can to plant and find as much as possible in the Austin area. I do worry about over-saturating this area with boxes from just me - but hey, if no one is complaining.... :)</div><div><br/></div><div> From the finder perspective, given I have very limited free time, I generally focus on drive-bys, or ones that require less than a couple of miles to reach. I also prioritize boxes that have been found recently, so that chances are better for a find.  And I tend to search AQ more than LBNA, since the interface is easier.  I do think it is true that people often don't log, so that the logging stats can be deceiving.  When I check on my logbooks, I often find that at least have of the finders never logged.</div><div><br/></div><div>Just some random thoughts.  Origami Hen</div></body></html>

Regardless,  I love letterboxing and I am doing what I can to plant and find as much as possible in the Austin area. I do worry about over-saturating this area with boxes from just me - but hey, if no one is complaining.... :)</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481516332539_21387"><br clear="none"/></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481516332539_21386"> From the finder perspective, given I have very limited free time, I generally focus on drive-bys, or ones that require less than a couple of miles to reach. I also prioritize boxes that have been found recently, so that chances are better for a find.  And I tend to search AQ more than LBNA, since the interface is easier.  I do think it is true that people often don't log, so that the logging stats can be deceiving.  When I check on my logbooks, I often find that at least have of the finders never logged.</div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481516332539_21385"><br clear="none"/></div><div id="yui_3_16_0_ym19_1_1481516332539_21384">Just some random thoughts.  Origami Hen</div>

    Wow! That area has changed a lot since I planted that box.  I'm
    going to have to go back and see that myself.  I plant boxes to give
    people a chance to stretch their legs and hike a bit - not to crawl
    thru underbrush and cactus!<br/>

    Wow! That area has changed a lot since I planted that box.  I'm
    going to have to go back and see that myself.  I plant boxes to give
    people a chance to stretch their legs and hike a bit - not to crawl
    thru underbrush and cactus!<br clear="none"/>
