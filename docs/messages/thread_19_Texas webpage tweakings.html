Thanks! Yeah, Wes has a "real" job now but says that he'll have some <br>
time in a week or two to get to these things. Unfortunately, I'm not <br>
smart enought to figure the database out and help him. I forwarded <br>
your note and will keep an eye out to make sure these boxes don't get <br>
forgotten.<br>
