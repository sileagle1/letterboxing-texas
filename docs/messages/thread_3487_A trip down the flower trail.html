daffodil, which seems to have had a hard time keeping roots down on the <br/>

it. The clue has been updated.<br/>
Happy boxing!<br/>

Hi, I guess we were right behind you at Martin Creek Lake SP. We <br/>
noticed that the logbooks were replaced on 4/12 and that was the date <br/>
we were finding your boxes there. We also went to Tatum and could not <br/>
make heads or tales out of the clues to the box in the park as there <br/>
was so much construction going on. I said, at the time, that I would <br/>
have to inform the owner of this box of the construction so they could <br/>
remove the box until the construction was finished. Glad you were ahead <br/>
of us there too. <br/>
<br/>
Barefoot Lucy, your box in Henderson was so soaked and rusty that we <br/>
took it to our RV for a few days and I reworked it, dryed it and made a <br/>
new logbook and a new box for it. The box lid was damaged so that it <br/>
would not close tightly and it let water in. I put the dried logbook <br/>
back in the box also. We replaced it 4/13 in the afternoon. You may <br/>
want to check on it but I think it will be ok.<br/>
