I have been saying I plan to plant some boxes for a year now and still haven't done it.  The reason-carving.  I have not attempted to carve a stamp at all, and just don't have a desire to.  I know that everyone says how simple it is, but at this point it doesn't interest me-maybe if I wasn't tied down to work 50 hours a week, plus all my other stuff I have going on I would care to venture there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, on I babble.  Is it worth it to use a store-bought stamp?  How many lb'ers would actually not search for the box because it isn't hand carved?  Or are there carvers out there that have too many stamps that they are willing to let go of a few for someone in my situation?<br/>

<div>I completely understand your dilemma.  I’ve not planted one in forever 
(well, I actually planted one over a month ago, but I haven’t even listed it 
because I forgot an important step and I need to fix that before making it 
public and I haven’t had time to go back to the box) because I don’t have time 
to carve.  I average a 55-60 hour week too and have no desire to carve when 
I get home at night.  To answer your question from our point of view, we 
love hand-carved stamps.  I love the intricacy and the pure 
stamp-carving-talent we have here in Texas.  However, in searching for and 
finding letterboxes, the thrill for me is in the location and the clues.  I 
love history and adore the boxes that remind me about the history of a 
person/location or teach me something new.  If the location is great and 
the clues are interesting, a store bought stamp that coordinates with the box is 
just fine with me.</div>

<p>Store bought stamps aren't that bad as long as you look for unusual ones and avoid ones that everybody in the world buys as their first stamp. Take time to search out just the right stamp for your box.<br/>
_<br/>
BUT-if you are going to plant a storebought, make other aspects of the box really special. Great location. Well written clues. Maybe make it a mystery. Tell a story.</p>
<p>Do put in your clues that its a storebought for those "all about the stamp" folks. It might deter a few of them, but most folks wouldn't care if the box sounds interesting. </p>
<p>I personally do feel really strongly that we should carve instead of buy, but I'm of the "all about the journey" group so the stamp is only one element of the whole experience.</p>

I think there should be another category for personally-designed stamps<br/>
because, to my way of thinking, they are equal to hand carved stamps in<br/>
creativity and take as much talent, and are far superior to store-bought<br/>
stamps, like those you would pick up at Michaels.  Also, hand-carved stamps<br/>

<p>Good evening,<br/>
<br/>
I have been saying I plan to plant some boxes for a year now and still haven't done it.  The reason-carving.  I have not attempted to carve a stamp at all, and just don't have a desire to.  I know that everyone says how simple it is, but at this point it doesn't interest me-maybe if I wasn't tied down to work 50 hours a week, plus all my other stuff I have going on I would care to venture there.<br/>
<br/>
Anyhow, on I babble.  Is it worth it to use a store-bought stamp?  How many lb'ers would actually not search for the box because it isn't hand carved?  Or are there carvers out there that have too many stamps that they are willing to let go of a few for someone in my situation?<br/>

<br/>
I would plant a lot of boxes if people hadn't made me feel that storebought stamps were a no-no. One of my plants is hand carved. One is one I designed and had made....the rest are storebought. I admire those who can carve. Right now I just don't have the time and in between packing to move, geocaching is a lot easier. Like I said earlier I have to drive an hour now to even get to any letterboxes I haven't found. We tried to do the mission series in El Paso back last year and couldn't find the first 3 or 4 so we quit. For me the postals are great...just got 2 this week and I am happy to pay the postage to see these. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to carve for me I would plant more in this area. Going to check out that simon stamps....<br/>

I would plant a lot of boxes if people hadn't made me feel that storebought stamps were a no-no. One of my plants is hand carved. One is one I designed and had made....the rest are storebought. I admire those who can carve. Right now I just don't have the time and in between packing to move, geocaching is a lot easier. Like I said earlier I have to drive an hour now to even get to any letterboxes I haven't found. We tried to do the mission series in El Paso back last year and couldn't find the first 3 or 4 so we quit. For me the postals are great...just got 2 this week and I am happy to pay the postage to see these. <br/>
<br/>
If anyone wants to carve for me I would plant more in this area. Going to check out that simon stamps....<br/>

<p><span>This
weekend we went after and found two of the O-Knots series boxes planted by Eoghan
in 2001.  This is a challenging series to find and I was very surprised to
find both boxes alive and well.  One of the boxes hadn’t been found
since 2005! (It was actually in the wrong place and my son managed to spot it
so he was bragging all day. )  Because of this history and the challenge
it was a thrilling find, and I’m so very glad to have these stamps in my
book…..and the reason this relates is that they are not hand carved
stamps.  So get out there and plant!  You never know who’s day
you might make!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>Wow-thank you all for your
  responses!  I got a lot of great ideas.  I think before I sent my
  message I had some sort of an (apparently misguided) opinion that no one
  would ever want to search for my box if I used a store-bought stamp.  I
  love Barefoot Lucy's advice (Store bought stamps aren't that bad as long as
  you look for unusual ones and avoid ones that everybody in the world buys as
  their first stamp.  Take time to search out just the right stamp for
  your box.)  which I hadn't considered before.  I do understand that
  there will be those who choose not to seek out my boxes, and that's okay-I
  have learned to live life by the "You can't please all the people all
  the time" rule.  To that effect, I appreciate Team K9's advice
  (Don't let those who's personal rules prohibit them from looking for
  storebought stamps, keep you from playing the game either.)<br/>
<br/>
  I originally asked about carvers who would consider carving for me, and
  allowing me to plant.  Now, with more thought, I feel that I would
  rather use store-bought for this reason: I have evaluated my location choice
  for my plants.  Seeing how I don't have a lot of free time in my
  schedule, long hikes will not be a great choice when considering box
  maintenance (I certainly don't want to contribute to what has been coined
  "litterboxing").  Also, I love to go on long trips, and so I
  appreciate drive-bys as a traveler-it gives me a short time to stretch my
  legs, but yet keep me on schedule, too.   I would feel bad if my
  choice of a possibly too busy location caused someone else's work to go
  missing.<br/>
<br/>
  Boots Tex posed a question for me (May I ask why, if you are not interested
  in carving, you feel the need to place a letterbox)?  Wow-thought
  provoking.  As a whole, I feel like my efforts  to contribute to
  the sport in the manner I choose are being encouraged; however, this question
  I feel partially discourages me to contribute at all.  I feel like up
  until now I have only "taken" from the sport-I have used everyone
  else's effort of planting, and used it to my benefit, to create a masterpiece
  of a book that shows a record of all I have found.  But, I have not
  given back to encourage others in the sport.  It's my turn to give
  back-that is why I feel the need to plant.  I don't feel like geocaching
  would be for me (although I haven't tried it), because I like my logbook as a
  reminder of the great hikes and trips I have taken.<br/>
<br/>
  Thank you all for helping me view this from a different perspective!  I
  feel much more prepared to plant now!<br/>

   Is it worth it to use a store-bought stamp? How many lb'ers would

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Wow-thank you all for your responses!  I got a lot of great ideas.  I think<br/>
&gt; before I sent my message I had some sort of an (apparently misguided)<br/>
&gt; opinion that no one would ever want to search for my box if I used a<br/>
&gt; store-bought stamp.  I love Barefoot Lucy's advice (Store bought stamps<br/>
&gt; aren't that bad as long as you look for unusual ones and avoid ones that<br/>
&gt; everybody in the world buys as their first stamp.  Take time to search out<br/>
&gt; just the right stamp for your box.)  which I hadn't considered before.  I do<br/>
&gt; understand that there will be those who choose not to seek out my boxes, and<br/>
&gt; that's okay-I have learned to live life by the "You can't please all the<br/>
&gt; people all the time" rule.  To that effect, I appreciate Team K9's advice<br/>
&gt; (Don't let those who's personal rules prohibit them from looking for<br/>
&gt; storebought stamps, keep you from playing the game either.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I originally asked about carvers who would consider carving for me, and<br/>
&gt; allowing me to plant.  Now, with more thought, I feel that I would rather<br/>
&gt; use store-bought for this reason: I have evaluated my location choice for my<br/>
&gt; plants.  Seeing how I don't have a lot of free time in my schedule, long<br/>
&gt; hikes will not be a great choice when considering box maintenance (I<br/>
&gt; certainly don't want to contribute to what has been coined "litterboxing").<br/>
&gt; Also, I love to go on long trips, and so I appreciate drive-bys as a<br/>
&gt; traveler-it gives me a short time to stretch my legs, but yet keep me on<br/>
&gt; schedule, too.   I would feel bad if my choice of a possibly too busy<br/>
&gt; location caused someone else's work to go missing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boots Tex posed a question for me (May I ask why, if you are not interested<br/>
&gt; in carving, you feel the need to place a letterbox)?  Wow-thought provoking.<br/>
&gt; As a whole, I feel like my efforts  to contribute to the sport in the manner<br/>
&gt; I choose are being encouraged; however, this question I feel partially<br/>
&gt; discourages me to contribute at all.  I feel like up until now I have only<br/>
&gt; "taken" from the sport-I have used everyone else's effort of planting, and<br/>
&gt; used it to my benefit, to create a masterpiece of a book that shows a record<br/>
&gt; of all I have found.  But, I have not given back to encourage others in the<br/>
&gt; sport.  It's my turn to give back-that is why I feel the need to plant.  I<br/>
&gt; don't feel like geocaching would be for me (although I haven't tried it),<br/>
&gt; because I like my logbook as a reminder of the great hikes and trips I have<br/>
&gt; taken.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you all for helping me view this from a different perspective!  I feel<br/>
&gt; much more prepared to plant now!<br/>

Now, with more thought, I feel that I would rather<br/>&gt; &gt; use store-bought for this reason: I have evaluated my location choice for my<br/>&gt; &gt; plants. Seeing how I don't have a lot of free time in my schedule, long<br/>&gt; &gt; hikes will not be a great choice when considering box maintenance (I<br/>&gt; &gt; certainly don't want to contribute to what has been coined "litterboxing").<br/>&gt; &gt; Also, I love to go on long trips, and so I appreciate drive-bys as a<br/>&gt; &gt; traveler-it gives me a short time to stretch my legs, but yet keep me on<br/>&gt; &gt; schedule, too. I would feel bad if my choice of a possibly too busy<br/>&gt; &gt; location caused someone else's work to go missing.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex posed a question for me (May I ask why, if you are not interested<br/>&gt; &gt; in carving, you feel the need to place a letterbox)?

I feel like up until now I have only<br/>&gt; &gt; "taken" from the sport-I have used everyone else's effort of planting, and<br/>&gt; &gt; used it to my benefit, to create a masterpiece of a book that shows a record<br/>&gt; &gt; of all I have found. But, I have not given back to encourage others in the<br/>&gt; &gt; sport. It's my turn to give back-that is why I feel the need to plant. I<br/>&gt; &gt; don't feel like geocaching would be for me (although I haven't tried it),<br/>&gt; &gt; because I like my logbook as a reminder of the great hikes and trips I have<br/>&gt; &gt; taken.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you all for helping me view this from a different perspective!

&gt; I am just the opposite. I enjoy carving (even though I am not very good at it), but stink at planting. I am just not that creative in finding places and creating clues. My one attempt at planting disappeared without ever being found. I would be happy to carve for you if you promise not to give me too hard of a time about my attempts.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I would be happy to plant one of your stamps. Do you have any ready or should we decide what kind? The one thing I like about letterboxing and geoaching is creating the logbook to go along with the stamp and using creative containers. E-mail me privately and let's do it! <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Boots Tex posed a question for me (May I ask why, if you are not interested<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in carving, you feel the need to place a letterbox)? Wow-thought provoking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; As a whole, I feel like my efforts to contribute to the sport in the manner<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I choose are being encouraged; however, this question I feel partially<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discourages me to contribute at all. I feel like up until now I have only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "taken" from the sport-I have used everyone else's effort of planting, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; used it to my benefit, to create a masterpiece of a book that shows a record<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of all I have found. But, I have not given back to encourage others in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sport. It's my turn to give back-that is why I feel the need to plant. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't feel like geocaching would be for me (although I haven't tried it),<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because I like my logbook as a reminder of the great hikes and trips I have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; taken.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you all for helping me view this from a different perspective! I feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much more prepared to plant now!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Happy Easter to all!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Is it worth it to use a store-bought stamp? How many lb'ers would actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not search for the box because it isn't hand carved? Or are there carvers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out there that have too many stamps that they are willing to let go of a few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for someone in my situation?<br/>

<div>I have found at least one of your boxes-it was a mystery box with a store-bought stamp.  I LOVED the search, and the best part for me was, it was in a city that I happened to be in that particular day.  I was able to solve the clues with relative ease.  I have noticed that some of the other mystery boxes that you planted (also with store-bought stamps), I was unable to solve the clue, so I did not seek them out.  Could this be part of the reason?  Or are you referring to traditional boxes?  I'm trying to draw the appropriate conclusion ;)<br/><br/></div>

<p>I agree. These 4 boxes are tough to get, and
well worth it (and they are even not hand carved!). Great finds!! <br/>
<br/>
In the end the stamp doesn't matter, it is the effort and enjoyment that does.
I personally enjoy carving, though at the beginning I did not. Go at your own
pace and do what makes you happy, but I'm betting you eventually will be
carving your own also! If a ghost and a clown can do it, you can!!!<br/>

<br/>
I agree with Lucy that if you are going to place a store bought stamp, please make it interesting and a fun stamp. Here's an example of what happened to me. I drove about 35-40 miles round trip out of my way for a box placed by someone I did not know here in East Texas. The stamp simply said "Thank-you", there weren't any historical markers or anything of interest near that location. So you see the point some are trying to make, at least make it a nice stamp and good location. <br/>
<br/>
I don't care for the restricted boxes either, and even though that person who is able to see the clue has lots of finds, does NOT mean they are going to treat that box with stealth and care. I think of it this way, whoever planted the box (with restrictions)  is missing out on my image in their logbook...their loss :)<br/>

&gt; Good evening,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been saying I plan to plant some boxes for a year now and still haven't done it.  The reason-carving.  I have not attempted to carve a stamp at all, and just don't have a desire to.  I know that everyone says how simple it is, but at this point it doesn't interest me-maybe if I wasn't tied down to work 50 hours a week, plus all my other stuff I have going on I would care to venture there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyhow, on I babble.  Is it worth it to use a store-bought stamp?  How many lb'ers would actually not search for the box because it isn't hand carved?  Or are there carvers out there that have too many stamps that they are willing to let go of a few for someone in my situation?<br/>
