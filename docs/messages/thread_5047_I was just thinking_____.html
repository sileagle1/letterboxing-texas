I was remembering how "in the beginning", it was so weird to my hears to hear people calling me Puddle Splasher, but now, 8 years later, it's who I am. Heck, I may even request that name for my tombstone (in the far, far off future). I think you're right though, Boots. There's so many boxes now, I don't feel the same urgency to rush out and find them as quickly as I used to. I've also been extremely remiss in entering my finds for the past couple of years. Honestly, I think my style of letterboxing is way too laid back. It's just not as important to me to get credit for my finds, like it once was. However, I love getting feedback on my plants, so I will make it my priority over the next couple of hot summer months to spend more time at my computer logging finds! I'm planning to come down to the Double Lake area this fall to do some day hikes, so I'll definitely be hoping to find some LSQ and Boots boxes.<br/>Puddle Splasher<br/><br/><br/></font></font></font><blockquote style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid">-----Original Message-----

Thanks for your wonderful carves, our kids needed some activity after being cooped up in the car, the hike wore them out sufficiently to complete the drive, AND they were ready for a swim when we got to GWL. That was a beautiful park for picnicking. I do think the overgrowth might contribute to making it a tougher than average box. We stepped off the clues from the wrong marker about 5 times and almost gave up when we found the right marker. Maybe others had searched and not found it, I know I usually don't send any notice to boxers when I cant find their plants. Feels like I am complaining to them because I am dumber than I want to be. The game has changed over just a few years, but still some really creative thinking going on! I have to say with a 2 and 4 yr old, we are trying to plant more because we don't have time to plan finding trips. I wonder how much of an impact LTCs have had? </div><div><br/></div><div>We found Boots and LSQs boxes which don't get a lot of visitors but we totally struck out on the artist series boxes in flower mound which apparently are pretty popular, just never got our bearings I guess. That's how it goes, sometimes you get the box, sometimes it gets you.  . . .

<div><font style="background-color: transparent;">I've just returned from a wonderful two-week road trip driving through Colorado and Wyoming to Jackson Hole and on up into Yellowstone, and found some wonderful letterboxes up in the mountains and left three new ones of my own.  I will be posting these clues just as soon as I've reread the notes to be sure they make sense, but they were long-planned letterboxes in beautiful places in Jackson Hole and Colorado (no, none are in National Parks!).  We found about 13 letterboxes, almost all of which were beautiful hand-carved stamps in great locations on scenic trails or overlooks or places of interest -- and I love those scenic views!  As for local letterboxing, I think someone else said it: I've already found the interesting and exciting ones around my locality and discovered the trails and parks and scenic places in the immediate area.  Still willing to pursue a new box in an interesting location, though, especially if it appears to offer a new discovery along the way!  </font></div>

<p>Puddle Splasher, this week would have been a perfect time to visit Double Lake.  Because of the rains, the lake is full, everything is green, the temperatures have been unusually cool (or  at least less hot) for July.  We took our grandkids over there Monday and didn't see a single other person.  Also, they tore down the old concession building and restrooms and built brand new ones.  It might be a good place for another mini-meet in the fall.<br/>

I have also wondered why the number of new boxers seems to be slowing down. To me, that is the main reason many boxes don't get instant visitors. New letterboxers are still excited about getting all the boxes they can whereas boxers that have been around awhile will usually wait until an opportune time to go looking, as PI Joe said.<br/><br/>I have also noticed that many long-time boxers no longer find or place boxes, but do participate on the Talk List and attend Events. Maybe this is the natural progression of most letterboxers, assuming they don't quit entirely. I guess those of us that still actively participate are the exception, but even I don't have quite the desire to find boxes that I used to. However, my desire to place boxes is stronger than ever, and hopefully that won't change. My hearty thanks to those of you that still participate, even if a little less enthusiastically!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Boots Tex" &lt;<a href="mailto:redbarn@...">redbarn@...</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I was just thinking about how letterboxing has changed in the nearly seven years that we have been involved..

Now I tend to print the clues and but in location binders, so if I'm in an area and have time to search I get those boxes.   Still love the hobby, and enjoy finding the boxes, but the heat is a detraction for the summer, and earning a living seems to get in the way more now.  Plus spending a lot of time on project or TALE 10.  I do still love to carve and place boxes, especially historic ones, and will be adding a few in Montana in a few weeks. <br>

<br>
I think you have summed up what many of us are feeling.  I'm sorry that you didn't find my box in Blessing.  We, too, miss seeing those who were active when we first started but, who, for one reason or another, are no longer involved in placing or finding, which I completely understand.  Life gets in the way sometimes.  I did see a post by dewberry on the Gulf Coast Letterboxing site where she said that she and MO5 might be placing some boxes soon, so that's encouraging.  I'm thankful for the TALE events and look forward every year to seeing "old" friends.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You make a lot  of good points, Open Space.  Box density is a problem which makes for long trips to find a few boxes.  I dare say there are many more boxes per square mile in MA than there are in Texas.  For example, an El Paso letterboxer posted a comment last March about not being able to attend the TALE event at Brazos Bend, and said she was thinking about attending an event in San Diego.  As it turns out, San Diego is closer to her than Houston is.  There are some new boxers out there.  I'm getting find reports all the time from boxers I don't know.  I look at their profile on AQ and find that they have fewer than 20 finds or 50 finds, and usually no plants.  I don't know how we invite them into our community.  It's something to think about.<br>

<div>Well, I have carved at least 22 signature stamps for friends, given them 
new logbooks and Marvy Markers, and taken them out boxing – but none of them has 
fallen in love with this game the way I have.  This year, I also personally 
emailed Texans who found one of my boxes, who I thought might not know about the 
TALE events, to make sure they knew about TALE9.  Most of them emailed back 
and thanked me, but none of them attended the event.  So, I’m trying!

 are three major differences between letterboxing in New England and in 
Texas: summer climate, hiking trails, and geography. I could drive from 
the eastern boundary of Connecticut to the west boundary in the time it 
takes me to drive from the DFW area to Tyler! However in the six CT 
counties, there are more than 30 state forests filled with gorgeous and 
diverse hiking trails plus my favorite American trail, the Appalachian 
runs through the state as well. I could hike everyday in the summer and 
not even begin to cover all the trails within a two hour drive from my 
house (not to mention upstate NY which was 18 miles away). Many of the 
trails could be very challenging, yet many were easy - something for 
everyone. My biggest challenge was winter hiking when snow covered the 
trails - and if you've ever letterboxed in the snow, you know that 
finding the landmarks can be another adventure when there's a bunch of 
snow covering everythingl. I used to take a hand shovel with me to dig in the snow for
 a box! New Englanders HIKE! Maybe it's the long, harsh winters, but 
come springtime, everyone gets out on the trails which are beautifully 
maintained. I was hiking for several years up there before I'd ever heard of letterboxing, and once I started letterboxing, I was surprised by how many people didn't know about it. By the time I left Connecticut, I'd introduced my doctor, dentist, antique dealers, etc etc to letterboxing and some of them are still going strong. It's a lot harder in Texas to be motivated to leave an air conditioned home when it's 100+ degrees outside and go hike on a hot, parched trail. However, winter hiking? That's the ticket!<br/>Puddle Splasher<br/><br/><br/></font></font></font><blockquote style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid">-----Original Message-----

<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">It seems that there is consensus about how and why letterboxers interests change over time.  Over time the need to find every box diminishes and those who stay interested do so because their interest broadens into other aspects of the hobby.  Carving stamps, planting, LTCs, attending events etc.  But question from this thread hasn’t been discussed.  Where are the new boxers?<o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">So in light of this discussion I’ve been thinking about a few thingss…<o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">Most of the newer boxers I know are not on the yahoo group (either don’t know about it, don’t care for the format of the email group, or are just not comfortable posting)<o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">There is very little activity on the Texas board on AQ – basically we just answer the random questions that come up<o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">We have very few events compared to areas where boxing is more popular (and I suspect compared to a few years ago in TX)<o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">I had the chance to attend an event in MA last weekend and I was impressed with the vibrancy of their letterboxing community.  The event had a great mix of old and new boxers, not to mention some incredibly creative series that everyone raved about.  It’s also pretty well known that letterboxing there is incredibly popular with plenty of new boxers to replace older boxers who slow down.  If you look at boxes in the area they tend to have dozens of finds.  There are also lots of events – people were talking about the various ones and who was hosting/attending etc.  <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">So as I ask myself what is different it comes down to community.  I think for a new boxer in Texas it is fairly difficult to get a sense of the Texas community. You pretty much have to go to TALE or you don’t get it.  Until you go, half of the discussions and references on this board don’t even make sense LOL!  <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">Texas should be able to support many more boxers and we could easily have a couple of events a year in each major area.  That would let people get to know each other and help with the driving and traveling issue. <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">So my thought is that we need more opportunities for letterboxers in Texas to meet and communicate.  We also need ways to include and welcome new boxers.    What do you think?<o></o></span></p><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><p>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Boots Tex" &lt;redbarn@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I was just thinking about how letterboxing has changed in the nearly seven years that we have been involved.. This week, The Hoppers found my box called Capt. Davis Boots at Fort Boggy State Park. This box was placed in May 2011 at a nice little park maybe a mile from Interstate 45 and yet they were first finders. Not a mystery, not a long hike. The only problem with finding it may be the fact that some of the landmarks used in the clues were overgrown from lack of use and the recent rains. I can remember when a box, any box, placed under those circumstances probably wouldn't go a week without someone finding it, even if they had to drive all the way from Evant, or Johnson County, or even Coryell County, or wherever. (not picking on anyone, just saying) Why do you think that is? I know we don't get out as much as we used to, and that there are so many boxes available that you can't get them all, so maybe that explains it, but I wondered what your thoughts are?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<o></o></p></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:white;"><o></o></span></p></div></div></div></div><p></p>

> AWWW, Blue Butterfly, thanks for the nice comment.  I do miss seeing you and Lucy Lockett along the trails -- not that we ever crossed paths that often except at events, living in different parts of this state as we do, but still, whenever I am in an area that has a BB or LL box, it is a definite for me to look for!   The two of you have always exemplified the best in letterboxing as far as I'm concerned:  fun letterboxes in good locations and very kind, thoughtful, considerate people.  And that goes for those others you mentioned, too -- well, not so sure about that PuddlePerson (just kidding!!!) -- Viewfinder<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lots of good stuff to think about here. I would agree that the extreme heat in the summer (when perhaps many of the letterboxers might have more time to devote to the LBing?) combined with the lower density of good hiking (compared to other parts of the country) and  lower box density, all contribute. I know for us, our kids are at ages where LBing can be hit or miss- sometimes fun for them, sometimes a disaster for all of us! ;-)  I know we've done a lot more letterboxing on trips away from Texas (and away from our kids!) ;-) than we've done "at home."  Our letterboxing activity certainly ebbs and flows - not because interest wavers, but just because of everything else in life vying for time and energy.<br>
<br>
as one who most often lurks on this list, i want you all to know that this list goes a long way to keep LBing in the forefront of the mind and reminds us to make time for an activity that we really love, even if we're not out doing it every weekend or even if there are seasons that fly by without any LBing love. <br>

 time away from him.  When he takes trips out of the country (about twice a year), my boys and I letterbox almost everyday-even if just for a handful of hours.  We pray it doesn't rain while he is gone!  This is also why we don't attend events.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>As far as noticing a new letterbox pop up-if it's within a short distance from my house, and I can fit it into my schedule, I do try to get to it quickly-but longer distances have to be planned out a little more in advance for me due to our busy schedules.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>The first 2 years I boxed I did not plant any-I felt inadequate.  But then I convinced myself that even the best didn't start out the best, and I should do my part to contribute to the sport-and I am glad I started planting!  I have several more plants in the works-perhaps if I cover Ellis County, it will be enough (some day!) to "bait
 and hook" a new boxer.  Perhaps the less letterbox-populated areas don't have enough boxes to completely "hook" new boxers-they just need more "bait"?  While I don't mind driving to Tarrant or Dallas County to letterbox, some people may.</span></div><div><span><br/></span></div><div><span>Just my two cents...</span></div><div> </div><div>God bless,</div> <div><i><font color="#ff7f00"><span class="yui_3_2_0_18_1342973287962131" style="font-family:comic sans ms;">Elwood Fan </span><br/></font></i></div><div><br/></div> <div style="font-family: 'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif; font-size: 12pt; "> <div style="font-family: 'times new roman', 'new york', times, serif; font-size: 12pt; "> <div dir="ltr"> <font face="Arial" size="2"> <hr size="1"/> <b><span style="font-weight:bold;">From:</span></b> Christine Borgfeld &lt;christine@borgfeld.net&gt;<br/> <b><span style="font-weight: bold;">To:</span></b>

 climate is a big plus.  The other thing that crosses my mind is that geocaching is popular here despite the heat so I don’t think the climate makes it hopeless!  We have 9 months of the year to box!  We just need to find something else to do in the summer.  </span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">  </span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">Our little mini meet last month worked fairly well.  We had two new boxing families show up and one of them was pretty well hooked.  We ended up meeting at a library (which was free!)  and we had room to carve stamps and make logbooks.  It was out of the heat and the local boxers liked having a chance to meet up and hang out also.  Since it was small and close by I’m hoping it wasn’t as intimidating as a big event, and we had time to answer questions
 without being in a rush to go out and hit the trails.  Probably a good low stress environment for a beginner.  Everyone was enthusiastic about doing it again so we plan to keep it up – maybe once every couple of months.</span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">  </span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">FYI – one of the families learned about it through girl scouts.  </span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">  </span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">Open Space</span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">  </span></div><div class="yiv1823813815MsoNormal"><a href="" name="_MailEndCompose" rel="nofollow"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">

I was disappointed that the box wasn't there, but the location was a cemetery which was one of my favorite spots for a box, and the story behind the stamp was a history lesson. Thanks to all of you who go to the "far off corners" of Texas to place a box. You just never know when someone will get a chance to stamp in your logbooks.<br>

We, too, miss seeing those who were active when we first started but, who, for one reason or another, are no longer involved in placing or finding, which I completely understand.  Life gets in the way sometimes.  I did see a post by dewberry on the Gulf Coast Letterboxing site where she said that she and MO5 might be placing some boxes soon, so that's encouraging.  I'm thankful for the TALE events and look forward every year to seeing "old" friends.<br>

LL and I always scheduled two big trips a year, but the cost of those trips have gone up quite a bit since we started boxing. I have to drive about two hours one way to stamp in a box now,and that alone is costly. I did make a trip recently to South Texas, but was not able to do much boxing while I was there. I budget and save for TALE every year, so that we are able to attend the event. The love of letterboxing has not diminished by any means,but I do miss those who in the beginning were so much a part of our Texas Letterboxing, Dewberry, Mother of Five, Puddle Splasher and Viewfinder and others aren't able to attend the event, and I miss them so much!!! <br>

> > > I was just thinking about how letterboxing has changed in the nearly seven years that we have been involved..  This week, The Hoppers found my box called Capt. Davis Boots at Fort Boggy State Park.  This box was placed in May 2011 at a nice little park maybe a mile from Interstate 45 and yet they were first finders.  Not a mystery, not a long hike.  The only problem with finding it may be the fact that some of the landmarks used in the clues were overgrown from lack of use and the recent rains.  I can remember when a box, any box, placed under those circumstances probably wouldn't go a week without someone finding it, even if they had to drive all the way from Evant, or Johnson County, or even Coryell County, or wherever.  (not picking on anyone, just saying) Why do you think that is?  I know we don't get out as much as we used to, and that there are so many boxes available that you can't get them all, so maybe that explains it, but I wondered what your thoughts are?<br>

After what happened to me on AQ I won't even post there anymore and in order to try to promote the hobby I am planting letterbox hybrids or stamps made by others. I do have almost 100 finds, lots of postal finds and 1 plant that I did carve but I just don't have time to carve right now. I have mini-geo events as well as 1 bigger one and some of us are both letterboxers and geocachers. If I am travelling to an area where letterboxes are I do go after them. I actually made a special trip to go get one a few weeks ago...and was the FTF! It's just hard to get past being flamed on a public forum, called names, being banned from seeing boxes in my own town and and someone who wouldn't accept an apology holding a grudge forever. <br>

I do not participate in boxing much anymore.  I still consider you-all<br>
friends.  But you are most welcome to visit El Paso, anytime.  We will be<br>
happy to see you, and if I am not on night shift (the new job has some<br>
nights to it) perhaps we can gather at a restaurant and swap stamps.<br>
<br>
Many of my boxes are letterbox-hybrids, in conjunction with Geocaches.  I<br>
was hoping to get Geocachers to see the other side.  It wasn't very<br>
successful.  Most of our letterboxing was done on the road - and we really<br>
haven't been on the road in nearly 3 years.<br>
<br>
Last year we were in Germany.  The problem with having family and lots of<br>
old friends there is that I never had a chance to even think of<br>
letterboxing.  All or our friends there (and a number of relatives too) are<br>
ham radio operators (as I and the wife are) so a lot of our time was spent<br>
doing ham radio stuff.  I didn't mind it, really, it was great to see them<br>
again.  The condition of the sun keeps us from talking directly.  But I<br>
digress.<br>
<br>
Come to El Paso - all the boxers here are friendly.  Both of us <grin>.<br>
<br>
Mike.<br>

<body style="background-color: #fff;"><p>Yeah I don't post on AQ either after a big ugly mess when someone was taking advantage of others and I tried to be the voice of reason.  I finally posted over there this week for the first time in about five years, except for possibly a couple of posts to the scout board.  I sat back and waited to get blasted, but I didn't so I guess all things pass.  Thankfully.   I think all the tricks for limiting who can view clues has created a means to take online vendettas out on the trail.  An immature person or two can make what is intended to be a good thing into a nightmare.  Crazy.<br/>

husband planted a series of six letterboxes for me for Valentine's Day,
and each box was placed at a place of importance for us. I was the
only intended finder, so if I were inclined to log finds online, this
would have been a good option because I could have logged my finds and
the boxes would have been immediately retired. I know folks do similar
series from time to time, so I'm sure that's the sort of thing they had
in mind in creating that feature. Seems like over-management to me,
but I also only use the websites to get clues.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I email anyone on AQ who shows up in online or physical logbooks locally and whose profiles or planting/finding habits suggest they are from our area. I send them a long email telling them about TALE, Yahoo, LbNA, the TX AQ board, how to save event searches so they're always notified of TX events and anything happening locally. Also, considering the economy, a big consideration when I was checking out events for a mini-meet for the SE area Open Space was hosting was expense--either to plan or to participate--and whether or not it was family friendly.  We had it in the conference room of the local libray, with wi-fi, tables, fridge/microwave, large tables, etc. and plenty for the kids to do, LB related or not.  Free for the whole day.  We brought our own food.  We're currently scoping out some other free/low-cost (cup of coffee) places for future meets. (Although I accidentally outed myself wearing my Wry Me nametag when I went to the service desk for help. Sure hope they don't make that connection when they find the letterbox I hid there!) One of the things that impressed me about TX boxers was y/our habit of hosting people from out of town, either hosting mini-meets or lb outings.  I think y'all raised me up right.<br>
