                    <div class="plaintext-content">For over a month now I have been teaching myself Javascript so I can program more interesting letterbox clues for my new Games Series of boxes.  I was able to get some things to work on my website, but getting them to work on LBNA where my clues now reside has been a challenge.  I was finally able to get it to work and placed three Risk Game letterboxes in Memorial Park today.  To get the clues you have to play a simplified version of a Risk game battle and win.  Hopefully it will be a fun way to determine where the boxes are and I hope to create more complicated games in the future.  Enjoy!<br>
