                    <html><body><p>I hear ya Boots, and you are not alone in this obsession, though I am not as obsessed as I used to be about replacing missing boxes.  When I first started letterboxing I was devastated whenever one of my boxes would go missing, mainly because there were so few in Texas and I didn't want people driving for miles just to be disappointed when they found no box.  So I replaced almost every one within a few hundred miles.  This lasted for about 3 years until I no longer had time since I was creating lots of new boxes.  My biggest regret was that once archived, the clues would no longer be seen, and that meant all the history and interesting people that were the purpose of the boxes would be lost.  Even now I hate to archive some boxes, like my games, since I want people to still be able to solve the puzzles or play the games even if the box isn't there.  Many times I just put a status of Missing in the clues but don't archive, even though this isn't a great solution.<br/><br/>In your case, replacing boxes is a bigger deal because your stamps are so great and locations so compelling that we would all mourn their loss.  I know losing stamps is more prevalent than ever because of Geocachers, but I hope you continue to replace your precious stamps so future letterboxers will know the joy of finding a "Boots Box".<br/><br/>Silver Eagle  </p></body></html>

My entry to letterboxing was fraught with failed searches. Some were because I was in El Paso, where apparently all the boxes are extinct; I nearly gave up on the hobby. We moved, and some of my early searches here in Central Texas were poorly planned, because I didn't realize that you could check the box status before heading out, and I was searching for a box that was gone.  Whoops.  But the first box we actually found was so exciting!  It was Silver Eagle's St Cyril and Methodius box.  I've really come to love the little snippets of local history that you Texas letterboxers reveal, even though I don't consider myself a history person.  <br>
<br>
I don't have any boxes old enough to need new stamps, yet, but I have a question for if I get to that point one day.  Do you try to recarve the exact same stamp if your carving skills are drastically improved?  <br>

<p>I agree that it is tough retiring a box.  While it is tempting to replant, I prefer planting a new box for a number of reasons.  From my perspective, if I am going to all the trouble of re-carving and replanting, I feel like I should get credit for the new
 box.  I know it is "not about the numbers," but it is still fun to see my plant count climb!  From the finder's perspective, there is a new box to find.  Those who have already found my old box have another one to find.  Those who haven't yet found it can
 find the new one and not even miss the old one.  Now, as for the old lost box, I am not excited about planting something in the same place because there must have been something wrong with it for it to have gone missing.  And finally, I am just too lazy to
 remember what used to be there most of the time.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>That said, I am going to replant one of my boxes in downtown San Antonio just because I like it so well. And I don't mind because it isn't too far away. I just gotta get around to it. And once planted, if you'd like for me to look for it with you, it would
 be my pleasure!</p>

the tree.<span style="">  </span>And get a promising hollow
thump.<span style="">  </span>Is that a bit of camo duct
tape?<span style="">  </span>The box is seriously wedged,
damnit.<span style="">  </span>It clearly has been awhile since
this was planted, my friends, and I find that the tree has grown around the
box, trapping it inside its hiding spot.<span style=""> 
</span>Just how long has it been? I do a happy dance.<span style="">  </span>Because I found the box? <span style=""> </span>Um, sure.<span style=""> 
</span>Also, because. . .ants.<span style="">  </span></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="">     U</span></font></font><font size="3"><font face="Times New Roman">sually, they get riled up, then vacate the area and I can
get the box.<span style="">  </span>I am patient that way.<span style="">  </span>Plus, I am waiting for the muggles to finish
their hole, so I won’t have to worry about making noise.<span style="">  </span>They are taking forever.<span style="">  </span>I contemplate toughing it out and just
pulling and pulling and puling, until I imagine the ants heading for the
tenderest regions of my armpits.<span style="">  </span>I
consider that maybe hopping around, stripping off my shirt to slap the ants off
while simultaneously screaming might blow my cover.<span style="">  </span></font></font></p><p class="MsoNormal" style="margin:0in 0in 10pt;"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">        I release the box.<span style="">

faster than I can grip.<span style="">  </span>This continues
for awhile until I realize that sucker is seriously wedged in there.<span style="">  </span>I try another approach.<span style="">  </span>Literally.<span style=""> 
</span>Amazingly, the situation looks exactly the same from the other
side.<span style="">  </span>I think maybe I can grab the
branch further up and use some leverage to pull it apart lower down.<span style="">  </span>Alas, it’s not really a branch, more like a
TRUNK.<span style="">  </span>I take a thin stick and scrape
away debris from around the box to try to get some wiggle room.<span style="">  </span>Brush ants.<span style=""> 
</span>Yay!<span style="">  </span>It now slides up and down!
But it can’t be turned toward an opening.<span style="">

cutting down a tree preventing him from an easier shot at the goal.<span style="">  </span>I wish I were kidding.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"><span class="tab">        </span>When I finally bullied the box free

the box.<span style="">  </span>No, I’m like a fat chick with a
cookie trap.<span style="">  </span>(Which they haven’t
invented, yet, but if they had, it would have been just like that.)<span style="">  </span>I’m still not really sure how it came
out.<span style="">  </span>It was actually squashed from the
pressure of the tree growing. When I opened the box, I figure out why the ants
just kept coming.<span style="">  </span>They were INSIDE the
box.<span style="">  </span>They were INSIDE the baggie with
the logbook.<span style="">  </span>They were INSIDE the logbook.<span style="">  </span>They were UNDER the duct tape camo on the
box.</font><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">         When I got home to log the find, I notice the last find was
