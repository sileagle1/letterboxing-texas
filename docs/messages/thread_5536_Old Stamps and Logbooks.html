                    <html><body><p>I hear ya Boots, and you are not alone in this obsession, though I am not as obsessed as I used to be about replacing missing boxes.  When I first started letterboxing I was devastated whenever one of my boxes would go missing, mainly because there were so few in Texas and I didn't want people driving for miles just to be disappointed when they found no box.  So I replaced almost every one within a few hundred miles.  This lasted for about 3 years until I no longer had time since I was creating lots of new boxes.  My biggest regret was that once archived, the clues would no longer be seen, and that meant all the history and interesting people that were the purpose of the boxes would be lost.  Even now I hate to archive some boxes, like my games, since I want people to still be able to solve the puzzles or play the games even if the box isn't there.  Many times I just put a status of Missing in the clues but don't archive, even though this isn't a great solution.<br/><br/>In your case, replacing boxes is a bigger deal because your stamps are so great and locations so compelling that we would all mourn their loss.  I know losing stamps is more prevalent than ever because of Geocachers, but I hope you continue to replace your precious stamps so future letterboxers will know the joy of finding a "Boots Box".<br/><br/>Silver Eagle  </p></body></html>

My entry to letterboxing was fraught with failed searches. Some were because I was in El Paso, where apparently all the boxes are extinct; I nearly gave up on the hobby. We moved, and some of my early searches here in Central Texas were poorly planned, because I didn't realize that you could check the box status before heading out, and I was searching for a box that was gone.  Whoops.  But the first box we actually found was so exciting!  It was Silver Eagle's St Cyril and Methodius box.  I've really come to love the little snippets of local history that you Texas letterboxers reveal, even though I don't consider myself a history person.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't have any boxes old enough to need new stamps, yet, but I have a question for if I get to that point one day.  Do you try to recarve the exact same stamp if your carving skills are drastically improved?  <br/>

<p>I agree that it is tough retiring a box.  While it is tempting to replant, I prefer planting a new box for a number of reasons.  From my perspective, if I am going to all the trouble of re-carving and replanting, I feel like I should get credit for the new
 box.  I know it is "not about the numbers," but it is still fun to see my plant count climb!  From the finder's perspective, there is a new box to find.  Those who have already found my old box have another one to find.  Those who haven't yet found it can
 find the new one and not even miss the old one.  Now, as for the old lost box, I am not excited about planting something in the same place because there must have been something wrong with it for it to have gone missing.  And finally, I am just too lazy to
 remember what used to be there most of the time.</p>
<p><br/>
</p>
<p>That said, I am going to replant one of my boxes in downtown San Antonio just because I like it so well. And I don't mind because it isn't too far away. I just gotta get around to it. And once planted, if you'd like for me to look for it with you, it would
 be my pleasure!</p>

                    <html><body><p>How timely.  Here's about my day, including one tidbit relevant to the discussion at hand.</p><p>        I’m out doing long-delayed maintenance and picking up a
couple missed boxes in Jack Brooks Park.<span> 
</span>My first “find” of the day is a vandalized plant I missed from the
event, reduced to a trail-encrusted felt square and a baggie.<span>  </span>My first maintenance effort is also
vandalized.<span>  </span>Ed Gorey’s Cat has the top
of the l’n’l intentionally smashed, separated from the box, and tossed on the
ground at the hide site next to the baggie.<span> 
</span>No stamp or logbook in sight.</p><p>          My next maintenance box, also vandalized, was Schrodinger’s
Cat, and was even more distressing because I find the idea of a cat in a box
(or not) hysterically funny.<span>  </span>This one
stings.<span>  </span>The stamp is lying on the
ground, but at least they left the felt for me. <span> </span>I found 3 insect-perfected holes bored clean
through the stamp.<span>  </span>Fortunately, 2 are in
the negative space.<span>  </span>But one is not.</p><p>          In case one tires of venting ire on geocachers, I propose a new common enemy: Frisbee golfers. I
personally think the stoners take revenge on the boxes to mitigate the
disappointment they feel when they realize the special little prizes they just
found next to their flicked-away Marlboro butts in the woods are not, in fact,
a drug drop or someone’s dope stash.<span>  ("Aw, man.  WTH?")  T</span>he
park on the frisbee golf side has more beer cans littering it than a parking
lot on prom night.</p><p>           Next up, Ziggy Rain, a 2005 Baby Bear box from LbNA. <span> </span>It seems like a long shot, and that was before
I got home to log it and noticed a prior attempt.<span>  </span>Of course, I left the clues at work.<span>  </span>I have no idea how long it’s been between
finds, or how much to expect the terrain to have changed.<span>  </span>I’m wondering if I should expect the clues to
match.<span>  </span>Since I’m not sure, I figure I’ll
just bully my way to the #5 basket as a shortcut, using the clue from Box Radar.<span>  </span>Um, nope. </p><p>          Anyway, I finally resort to following the clues, which work
just fine.<span>  </span>Imagine that.<span>  </span>I find what I think is the tree, straight-led
by the clues to a cedar with multiple branches meeting about 3 feet up.<span>  </span></p><p><span>          </span>There are muggles playing a hole of Frisbee golf nearby, but
no matter.<span>  </span>I have enough cover here,
even though they are only 20 feet away.<span>  </span>There
is no way the most likely tree could support a pile of sticks the clues say I’m
supposed to be putting back,<span>  </span>A stick,
maybe.<span>  </span>Two sticks?<span>  </span>Possibly.<span> 
</span>But SPOR?<span>  </span>No way. But it’s the
only tree that works with the clues, which so far have been accurate.<span>  </span></p><p>     Nonetheless, I poke gingerly around the wooly netherbits of
the tree.<span>  </span>And get a promising hollow
thump.<span>  </span>Is that a bit of camo duct
tape?<span>  </span>The box is seriously wedged,
damnit.<span>  </span>It clearly has been awhile since
this was planted, my friends, and I find that the tree has grown around the
box, trapping it inside its hiding spot.<span> 
</span>Just how long has it been? I do a happy dance.<span>  </span>Because I found the box? <span> </span>Um, sure.<span> 
</span>Also, because. . .ants.<span>  </span></p><p><span>     U</span>sually, they get riled up, then vacate the area and I can
get the box.<span>  </span>I am patient that way.<span>  </span>Plus, I am waiting for the muggles to finish
their hole, so I won’t have to worry about making noise.<span>  </span>They are taking forever.<span>  </span>I contemplate toughing it out and just
pulling and pulling and puling, until I imagine the ants heading for the
tenderest regions of my armpits.<span>  </span>I
consider that maybe hopping around, stripping off my shirt to slap the ants off
while simultaneously screaming might blow my cover.<span>  </span></p><p>        I release the box.<span> 
</span>Brush off ants.<span>  </span>Have another
go.<span>  </span>Brush off ants.<span>  </span>Reach.<span> 
</span>Brush.<span>  </span>Reach.<span>  </span>I really need to cough. The ants can move
faster than I can grip.<span>  </span>This continues
for awhile until I realize that sucker is seriously wedged in there.<span>  </span>I try another approach.<span>  </span>Literally.<span> 
</span>Amazingly, the situation looks exactly the same from the other
side.<span>  </span>I think maybe I can grab the
branch further up and use some leverage to pull it apart lower down.<span>  </span>Alas, it’s not really a branch, more like a
TRUNK.<span>  </span>I take a thin stick and scrape
away debris from around the box to try to get some wiggle room.<span>  </span>Brush ants.<span> 
</span>Yay!<span>  </span>It now slides up and down!
But it can’t be turned toward an opening.<span> 
</span>If only I had a SAW in my backpack like the a-hole Frisbee player who is
cutting down a tree preventing him from an easier shot at the goal.<span>  </span>I wish I were kidding.<span class="tab">        </span>When I finally bullied the box free
(oh, yes.<span>  </span>Did you really have doubts
that would be the final outcome?) WITHOUT, I might add, resorting to breaking
the box.<span>  </span>No, I’m like a fat chick with a
cookie trap.<span>  </span>(Which they haven’t
invented, yet, but if they had, it would have been just like that.)<span>  </span>I’m still not really sure how it came
out.<span>  </span>It was actually squashed from the
pressure of the tree growing. When I opened the box, I figure out why the ants
just kept coming.<span>  </span>They were INSIDE the
box.<span>  </span>They were INSIDE the baggie with
the logbook.<span>  </span>They were INSIDE the logbook.<span>  </span>They were UNDER the duct tape camo on the
box.         When I got home to log the find, I notice the last find was
an attempt logged in 2005.<span>  </span>Coup! I got
not a single ant bite.<span>  </span>I am the bomb,
diggity.  It definitely made having to retire 2 of my boxes a little less traumatic.</p><p>
