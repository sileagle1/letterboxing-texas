the Cape for a little cooler seascape...<br>
Stillwater, Vandal & I spent the weekend driving around East Texas in the<br>
Jacksonville-Rusk area and you know what? I don't think the Bahamas or Cape<br>
Cod can outdo that area for absolute charm. (Or maybe it's just that the<br>
letterboxers and their boxes are charming and it swayed our judgment???)<br>
<br>
About a year ago when we were very new to letterboxing, I read the clues to<br>
barefoot Lucy's "Killough Monument" box - the story just hooked me - I<br>
couldn't wait to go looking for it. And then it went missing, and I've been<br>
checking on it from time to time ever since. So when I knew we were going to<br>
be in the area, I wrote to Barefoot Lucy to ask if she had by any chance<br>
replaced it yet...oh, okay...and I shamelessly hinted how cool it would be<br>
if we could find it on Saturday!!! <br>
Well, she did indeed replace it for us (and I can only imagine what she had<br>
to shuffle in her schedule to do that - 8:00 am on a Saturday morning). It<br>
was awesome in the literal sense of the word. Her story clues came alive for<br>
me and I could picture everything that happened there. This is no ordinary<br>
monument, in my opinion. The stamp, of course, was great - Lucy's always are<br>
- and every time I look at that image, the poignant feelings of admiration<br>
and grief for those settlers will come rushing back. <br>
Another of the Footwear Philosopher's boxes has become Stillwater's absolute<br>
favorite box - and he's pretty stingy with superlatives. This was "Spring<br>
Hope", and he was STILL talking about it later that night when we had the<br>
great good fortune to have a coffee & chat with Lucy at a new coffeehouse in<br>
Jacksonville. Great coffee drinks, terrific live music and of course, the<br>
company couldn't have been better! Makes me look forward to the Barn Raising<br>
even more!<br>
The following day we drove down to Rusk and found Lucy's "Starry, Starry<br>
Night" - very lovely stamp & interesting spot. We spotted a HUGE toad and<br>
gigantic butterflies along the trail. <br>
<br>
Our plan had been to drive back home through Jacksonville because we had a<br>
special box to plant in Barefoot Lucy's honor - and by that time we figured<br>
we might have driven around enough locations to find an appropriate<br>
spot...just as we were driving around the lake, a really terrifying storm<br>
whipped up out of nowhere - I truly thought there might be tornadoes forming<br>
- and the rain began pouring down in sheets. We couldn't afford to wait<br>
around for the storm to pass because we had to get home to our youngest.<br>
<br>
We could hardly believe that we had to bring Barefoot Lucy's box all the way<br>
home again! So...we're hoping we can beg a favor of another Jacksonville<br>
boxer to allow us to mail the box to her to place for us! <br>

You are far too kind in your comments!<br>
<br>
It was a pleasure having you and Stillwater in our<br>
neck of the woods this weekend and so much fun getting<br>
to visit with y'all Saturday evening.  I absolutely<br>
CANNOT wait to get to Dallas to hunt boxes up there!<br>
<br>
Thank y'all for coming down, and I'm so glad you<br>
enjoyed yourselves.<br>
<br>
