the Cape for a little cooler seascape...<br/>
Stillwater, Vandal &amp; I spent the weekend driving around East Texas in the<br/>
Jacksonville-Rusk area and you know what? I don't think the Bahamas or Cape<br/>
Cod can outdo that area for absolute charm. (Or maybe it's just that the<br/>
letterboxers and their boxes are charming and it swayed our judgment???)<br/>
<br/>
About a year ago when we were very new to letterboxing, I read the clues to<br/>
barefoot Lucy's "Killough Monument" box - the story just hooked me - I<br/>
couldn't wait to go looking for it. And then it went missing, and I've been<br/>
checking on it from time to time ever since. So when I knew we were going to<br/>
be in the area, I wrote to Barefoot Lucy to ask if she had by any chance<br/>
replaced it yet...oh, okay...and I shamelessly hinted how cool it would be<br/>
if we could find it on Saturday!!! <br/>
Well, she did indeed replace it for us (and I can only imagine what she had<br/>
to shuffle in her schedule to do that - 8:00 am on a Saturday morning). It<br/>
was awesome in the literal sense of the word. Her story clues came alive for<br/>
me and I could picture everything that happened there. This is no ordinary<br/>
monument, in my opinion. The stamp, of course, was great - Lucy's always are<br/>
- and every time I look at that image, the poignant feelings of admiration<br/>
and grief for those settlers will come rushing back. <br/>
Another of the Footwear Philosopher's boxes has become Stillwater's absolute<br/>
favorite box - and he's pretty stingy with superlatives. This was "Spring<br/>
Hope", and he was STILL talking about it later that night when we had the<br/>
great good fortune to have a coffee &amp; chat with Lucy at a new coffeehouse in<br/>
Jacksonville. Great coffee drinks, terrific live music and of course, the<br/>
company couldn't have been better! Makes me look forward to the Barn Raising<br/>
even more!<br/>
The following day we drove down to Rusk and found Lucy's "Starry, Starry<br/>
Night" - very lovely stamp &amp; interesting spot. We spotted a HUGE toad and<br/>
gigantic butterflies along the trail. <br/>
<br/>
Our plan had been to drive back home through Jacksonville because we had a<br/>
special box to plant in Barefoot Lucy's honor - and by that time we figured<br/>
we might have driven around enough locations to find an appropriate<br/>
spot...just as we were driving around the lake, a really terrifying storm<br/>
whipped up out of nowhere - I truly thought there might be tornadoes forming<br/>
- and the rain began pouring down in sheets. We couldn't afford to wait<br/>
around for the storm to pass because we had to get home to our youngest.<br/>
<br/>
We could hardly believe that we had to bring Barefoot Lucy's box all the way<br/>
home again! So...we're hoping we can beg a favor of another Jacksonville<br/>
boxer to allow us to mail the box to her to place for us! <br/>

You are far too kind in your comments!<br/>
<br/>
It was a pleasure having you and Stillwater in our<br/>
neck of the woods this weekend and so much fun getting<br/>
to visit with y'all Saturday evening.  I absolutely<br/>
CANNOT wait to get to Dallas to hunt boxes up there!<br/>
<br/>
Thank y'all for coming down, and I'm so glad you<br/>
enjoyed yourselves.<br/>
