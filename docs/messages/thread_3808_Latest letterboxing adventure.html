                    <div class="plaintext-content">One of our favorite bands, The Flatlanders, played Gruene Hall Friday <br>
night.  We stayed overnight in New Braunfels to letterbox Saturday <br>
morning and got five with two MIA.  While we were hanging out near <br>
Gruene Hall waiting for the "coast to clear" and the sun to rise, we <br>
came up with a codeword for a letterbox:  "Molly's bracelet".  I'm <br>
curious, do other letterboxing teams have their own codewords?  <br>
<br>
On the downside, I have a box ready to plant in a town just off Hwy. 90 <br>
and I left it at home!  I first put it in the bag with our changes of <br>
clothes, then decided to put it in my Pooh (Winnie the Pooh) backpack <br>
and must have got distracted during the transfer and left it sitting on <br>
the kitchen table.  That's what I get for trying to make decisions at <br>
4:30 am!  (BRC works in San Antonio and I went to work with him and <br>
hung out all day Friday.  He leaves the house in Uvalde at 5:15 am.) <br>
<br>
He promises me that we will go out next weekend and make a special trip <br>
to plant it.<br>
