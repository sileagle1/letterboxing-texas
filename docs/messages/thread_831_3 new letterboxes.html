I planted 3 new letterboxes this afternoon in two very pretty parks in <br>
NE Tarrant Co.  One is at the Bedford Boys Ranch in Bedford, near the <br>
little lake, a favorite place to feed the ducks and so the perfect <br>
place for "At the Pond: Allie's Duck."  The other two are in Grapevine <br>
at the lovely Heritage Park - "In the Creek: Lauren's Turtle" and "In <br>
the Tree: Meghan's Bird."  These are really pretty parks, especially <br>
