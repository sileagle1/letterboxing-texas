about letterboxing from a fellow homeschooler and thought it sounded <br/>
like a great activity to get our family into. I read up on it a bit and <br/>
shared the info with my husband and children and they are all very <br/>
excited to get started. We are still trying to come up with a trail <br/>
name and such. I don't know how much letterboxing we will get to do <br/>
since I noticed on the website that there are only two boxes in our area<br/>
(Abilene), but hopefully if we go out of town we can hunt down some of <br/>
the others. We are very excited to get started and plan on scouting out <br/>
some potential hiding spots this weekend. Nice to meet you all! :)<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Hi Mandeigh and Family,</div> <div> </div> <div>This is a great hobby/sport for the whole family (4 legged ones if you got those too). Maybe you can be the trailblazer in the Abilene area, that'd be something, wouldn't it? You might be interested in Postal letterboxing too. That's where you send and receive boxes in the mail. I'm fixin' to send out my first one. I'm late, but it's finished, whew. How scary. I can't wait to start receiving them. You can look in Atlasquest to find info on postals.</div> <div> </div> <div>Good luck,</div> <div>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Mandeigh &lt;TiMandi2@aol.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hello yall!
