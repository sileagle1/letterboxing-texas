Bomber LB is located.  Once when my wife and I were there<br>
birdwatching, he came over and warned us to move further away<br>
from the Coast Guard entrance since we had binoculers!<br>
As far as stamping discreetly, it is a challenge, especially<br>
with kids.  I try to do the actual stamping when nobody is<br>
looking, but don't worry too much about all the stuff spread<br>
all over.  If somebody asks what I am doing (and most don't),<br>
I just say I am making notes about birds or plants and they<br>
usually let it go at that.  It did backfire on me once when<br>
a lady turned out to be an avid birdwatcher and started asking<br>
me all kinds of questions about what I had seen.  Hope I'm<br>
not punished for the whoppers I told that day!  Sometimes I<br>
debate whether to just tell the truth and introduce people<br>
to the hobby, but it just doesn't feel right.  <br>
Another thing I say if I am with my kids is that we are<br>
playing a treasure hunt game, which isn't too far from the truth.<br>
I wouldn't worry too much about being seen while stamping in,<br>
but I would take care not to be seen finding and replacing the<br>
box.  That seems more important to me.  Have fun and maybe<br>
start thinking about placing some of your own.<br>

out with your letterbox stuff...a map, a notebook,<br>
lunch, whatever and to know what you will say or do if<br>
you have to deal with strangers.<br>
<br>
It seems like we've gotten better at doing our<br>
business quickly and keeping things compact as we've<br>
done a few boxes though.  I hadn't really thought<br>
about it until you posed the question, but one habit<br>
we've fallen into is that we each have a job we do.  I<br>
open the box up and take out the stamp and book while<br>
my daughter gets our own log book ready and my son<br>
gets our stamps out and lines them up.  Whichever of<br>
us is done first gets the stamps out and gets ready to<br>
stamp in.  My husband watches out and creates a cover<br>
if we need it.  After we've stamped in, we do the<br>
whole process in reverse.<br>
<br>
Unless we know we are on a secluded trail, we take the<br>
box away from its hiding place to stamp in, and even<br>
in a secluded spot we have a cover ready.  Once we<br>
find a good place to sit and stamp in, we spread the<br>
box out, along with anything else that might create<br>
cover.  I figure that even if I have an interstate map<br>
lying out and over the stamp stuff, if we are away<br>
from the hiding place and the letterbox and stamps are<br>
covered, anyone who wanders by will probably not stop<br>
and inquire, so they won't possibly see what we're<br>
really doing, and at worst, we've made them wonder<br>
what kind of nuts look at an interstate map in the<br>
middle of the woods!<br>
<br>
Sometimes people do stop to see what's going on<br>
though.  The other day my kids and I (hubby was<br>
elsewhere) were planting a box.  We had our stuff<br>
spread out, and I had laid a compass close by for a<br>
quick cover.  We had good visibility up and down the<br>
trail, so we didn't worry about having something to<br>
lay over the box stuff.  A group of teenagers<br>
approached from up the trail, so the kids quickly<br>
grabbed the box stuff and dropped it in my backpack<br>
and I stood up and started playing with the compass. <br>
By the time the teenagers got close enough, we were<br>
all engrossed in a compass lesson.  My kids were so<br>
"interested" in what I was doing that these kids<br>
stopped to see what we had going on (it didn't help<br>
that these were mostly boys and I was standing in the<br>
middle of the woods with a pretty 16 year old girl). <br>
I wound up giving them a compass lesson also, all the<br>
while my kids were glancing at me and obviously<br>
wondering how we were going to get rid of the group. <br>
They suddenly remembered they had to get back to their<br>
campsite and took off, and we were able to get back to<br>
our business.<br>
<br>
I think, if you have a plan in case you have to deal<br>
with strangers, then keep your head about you if you<br>
encounter someone, all will be fine, but I think part<br>
of the fun of letterboxing is the sneakiness!<br>

Thanks for the ideas, guys!  I was thinking last night that taking a <br>
blanket that I already carry in my car and having the kids spread it <br>
out while I'm retrieving the box would probably be a good idea, then <br>
we can make it look like we are picnicing or I can pass it off as <br>
something similar to that.  <br>
<br>
My son already wants to plant some letterboxes of our own, so I'm <br>
sure it won't be long until we do.  I told him I wanted to find a few <br>
first and get an idea of what they usually look like and where they <br>
are hidden and stuff.  We don't do much state parks and the like so I <br>
have no idea where to hide one, but we'll figure out something.<br>
<br>
Thanks again,<br>

I realized after I reread my post and remembered I had<br>
referred to having "lunch" spread out while stamping<br>
in -  I should have mentioned one caveat to spreading<br>
food about when you are letterboxing.  Be diligent in<br>
keeping your hands clean while you are handling the<br>
box.  Even slight food smells may attract animals, and<br>
especially animals like raccoons that are not only<br>
sensitive to smell but are curious and dextrous - a<br>
recipe for disaster for an otherwise well-hidden<br>
letterbox!  I take a vinegar-soaked paper towel in a<br>
baggie with me to wipe down anything I may need to<br>
wipe before replacing a box.  Vinegar isn't a pleasant<br>
smell for animals and neutralizes most smells.  Other<br>
folks have other ideas which, I'm sure, work just as<br>
well.<br>
