                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Gang.  We took a little camping trip out to Bay City and found <br/>
Silver Eagle's Bird Superbowl Letterbox.  Some "creature" built a <br/>
nest where it was hidden and dislodged the microbox.  But looking <br/>
around in the weeds and tall grass, we did manage to find it.  <br/>
Evidently, we were the first to find it, as there were no other <br/>
stamps in the book.  We re-hid it, again and hopefully no other <br/>
critters will get to it.<br/>
<br/>
The two ladies at the Kiosk, were very excited about having a <br/>
letterbox at the bird sanctuary, and became very enthusiastic about <br/>
letterboxing in general.  We may have a couple of new converts.<br/>
<br/>
When are we going to have another "event"?<br/>
<br/>
Warm Regardes to all<br/>
