If this box looks new it could be the same thing, otherwise it is doomed to remain obscure unless someone claims it.  I guess LSQ could mention it in her clues so others will know it exists nearby.<br>

"The Plumed Serpent" was placed by Mother of Five at the Great Book Adventure event in October 2006.  It was recently found by Mosaic Butterfly while looking for LSQ's box "Elm Creek Quilts", which was placed at the same event and which you reported finding on May 26.  Obviously, they are very close to the same spot.  It sounds like MO5's box was moved at one time.  Since it's no longer listed, maybe she thinks it's missing.  Did you really find LSQ's box, which would be a quilt block design stamp, or did you think the Plumed Serpent was her box?  Either they are both there, very close together, and finders find one or the other, or MO5's box is there, maybe in the wrong place, and LSQ's box is missing.  You can't log a box that is not listed on LbNA and you can only do so on AQ if you are a premium member.  So, how many boxes do we have, one or two?  Maybe MO5 will weigh in on the subject.<br>

&gt; &gt; Boots, I was told by Nomad that he found it when he was looking for a LSQ box. It was still there when I went so I guess it was found accidentally. Nomad isnt a member of AQ so he can't log it. I didn't know if maybe it might be a word of mouth box.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ã‚Â  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Pubcrawler, can you be more specific?  Are these boxes that you found accidentally? I'm not sure I understand how you came about them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Can any one tell me the purpose of boxes that have no clues or owner. At least I couldn't find them or either LBNA or AQ.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Also how do you log them?<br/>

> "The Plumed Serpent" was placed by Mother of Five at the Great Book Adventure event in October 2006.  It was recently found by Mosaic Butterfly while looking for LSQ's box "Elm Creek Quilts", which was placed at the same event and which you reported finding on May 26.  Obviously, they are very close to the same spot.  It sounds like MO5's box was moved at one time.  Since it's no longer listed, maybe she thinks it's missing.  Did you really find LSQ's box, which would be a quilt block design stamp, or did you think the Plumed Serpent was her box?  Either they are both there, very close together, and finders find one or the other, or MO5's box is there, maybe in the wrong place, and LSQ's box is missing.  You can't log a box that is not listed on LbNA and you can only do so on AQ if you are a premium member.  So, how many boxes do we have, one or two?  Maybe MO5 will weigh in on the subject.<br>
