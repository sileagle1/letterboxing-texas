<br>
Wow!  I think that is the most responses I have ever<br>
had to any post in my whole life!  : )<br>
<br>
I guess we are all friends here, huh?  So I'll just<br>
tell all I know, and hope that's okay.<br>
<br>
As far as printing the clues, I did not think it was<br>
necessary to print them, actually.  Although the web<br>
page clue is certainly beautiful and nicely done with<br>
the photos and all, the actual "how to find it" clues<br>
are only about three lines long -- I just copied them<br>
down on a sheet of paper and took it with me in my<br>
pocket and it was fine.<br>
<br>
As far as the box goes, the clues were perfect, box<br>
was exactly there and in good shape.<br>
<br>
Sadly, though, the wonderful logbook was damaged<br>
beyond repair, nearly destroyed by water INSIDE the<br>
bags.<br>
<br>
First Aid that I provided was this: <br>
<br>
I brought home the soggy logbook (and the soggy stamp<br>
pad, too) and managed to salvage more than I expected<br>
to be able to, but it is still a sad sad loss.  I have<br>
it all dried out now and ready to return to Fugichip,<br>
if possible.<br>
<br>
I also started a new logbook, doublebagged, and left<br>
it there with the stamp itself, which was still okay<br>
(but no pad anymore, so bring your own).  After I was<br>
home, I had the idea that I could have put everything<br>
in a plastic box, in the official box, (I think it<br>
woudl fit) but I didn't think of that quickly enough. <br>
So right now things are in bags in a box, but if I can<br>
get back over there sometime, I'll put the bags in a<br>
box in the box.  I don't go to Lufkin often, though,<br>
so if someone else (or Fugichip) wants to do that,<br>
don't wait on me.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, I did send an email to the address listed<br>
on the clues and have not heard from Fugichip so far. <br>
Since the box was in Lufkin, I figured this list was<br>
the next best place to try to find Fugichip (him? her?<br>
co? i dunno.)<br>
<br>
And that's the scoop!<br>
<br>
Happy seasonal holiday of your choice to everyone!<br>
<br>
Ashby<br>
