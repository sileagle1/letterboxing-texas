pretty cool.  It's hidden in an abandoned castle on top of a mountain <br>

Gaiole in Chianti, which is the Tuscany region.  It was only about 20 <br>
minutes from the farm where we stayed and had Thanksgiving dinner with <br>

Austin.  We'll be back home next weekend and maybe I can post some <br>
