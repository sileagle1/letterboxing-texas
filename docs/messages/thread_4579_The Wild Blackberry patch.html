I planted a new box yesterday called The Wild Blackberry Patch. I welcome all to come find it. I have two more ready to go and one I need to make a log book for. Thry will be out soon.<br/>
Here are the clues for The Wild Blackberry Patck.<br/>
 <br/>
Suggested colors: Two different greens, and a black.<br/><br/>Pollard Park is located at the intersection of New Copeland Road and East Amherst Street, near Andy Woods Elementary School. The park features picnic areas, pavilion, restrooms, playground, tennis courts, soccer and football fields<br/><br/>To the box: Make your way to Pollard Park. Park in the parking lot at the corner of New Copeland Rd. and Hudnall Dr. Walk through the gate and onto the sidewalk. Walk toward the "Kid's Kingdom," and up onto the ramp of the wood structure. Continue walking forward. If you would like, stop and play on the play ground. Go to the blue bench closest to the bathrooms. Walk to the back of the bathrooms. From the edge of the bathrooms, walk to the small tree straight ahead. From the tree go 13 steps toward the tennis courts. Look to the right and you should see a chain link fence. On the other side of the fence there is a small mimosa tree. Walk through the blackberry patch to it. On your side of the fence under the two medium sized rocks the box is hidden.<br/><br/>This is a heavly used park, so please watch for other people and rehide well. Thanks!<br/><br/>
