<div>While walking the Bear Creek trail In Keller today, I checked on my 4 
letterboxes there and discovered 3 of the 4 poorly rehidden, clearly visible to 
anyone who took those little trails off the main trail, which walkers and kids 
playing in those woods often do!  I recovered two of them and left them in 
place, but I removed Autumn Gift to find it a better placement.  It was 
sitting right out on top of the pile of leaves behind the Eastern Red Cedar 
tree, clearly in sight and ready to be discovered, and the big rock and 
bark that had previoiusly covered it and marked its location were completely 
missing.  Since those 4 boxes were my first to place, and the Autumn Gift 
stamp was the best of the 4, I don't want to risk leaving it in a vulnerable 
place.  I will rehide it as soon as a new location presents itself.  
Sorry for any inconvenience to anyone who intended looking for it today, but it 
will be out there again soon and hopefully, finders will be very careful to 
replace all of these and other boxes carefully, and RECOVER WELL.  
Thanks,  Viewfinder</div></body></html>
