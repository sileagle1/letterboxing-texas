had a great time and saw parts of Austin we have never seen before! <br>
Thanks for the tip about St Ed's park. We will try that again next <br>
time. Did successfully find one of the Barton Creek Greenbelt boxes <br>
yesterday. I must lament that there was no water to be found <br>
anywhere for a dip to cool off. Creek was completely dry. We saw <br>
where the other box is supposed to be but trail was really overgrown <br>
and we wanted to save it for a month we can wear jeans to get to it.<br>
<br>
More on our next trip!<br>
