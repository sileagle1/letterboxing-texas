I woke up Friday morning to sleet hitting my window at 7am. Sleet! Yes on the day I planed to box and all! Its ok though, it only lasted about 20 minutes and after that the strong winds pushed away the cloud. We bundled up, made hot coco and headed out the door for our long drive to Lake Somerville. Since I had my two young daughters with me I figured we would start with the longest hike, a Silver Eagle 20 questions game box that was 2 miles to get to the box. So a round trip of 4 miles. There were a few other boxes on the same trail and we found them all. After the first mile of hiking my oldest daughter (9) started complaining about being tired. OMG already! She
 was fine after a little brake. My youngest daughter (7) started getting tired after 3 miles and Dreamwalker had to carry her for about half a mile. Poor guy. All the other boxes were on fairly short trails and there wasn't much more complaining after that. We ended up finding 16 boxes of the 21 we went to find. Sadly Runsforchocolate's box had been chopped down by the park rangers as they were clear cutting an area for electric poles. We found pieces of her box and camo tape and ripped up baggies but no logbook or stamp. I searched around the tree and mulch for quite a while hoping to unearth the stamp but came up empty handed. It was a very windy chilly day and we hiked over 6 miles. I had plans to box in near by cities but we hadn't eaten all day, and night falls so fast now, that we stopped after we were done with Lake Somerville. </p>
<p>On Saturday we woke up early once again and headed out to do more boxing, this time without the girls. We went to La Grange, Fayettville, Round Top, Burton, and Giddings. There are two new boxers near Round Top who have been planting around the area and I was happy to find some of their boxes. I also planted a box in Round Top to thank the local boxers for planting. All in all we found 20 boxes and hiked another 4 miles Saturday. </p>
<p>I was given some clues Friday for a series of boxes that were not yet listed as a sort of Birthday present and sort of a "can you check this out and tell me what needs to be fixed" kind of thing. So on my birthday, today, I went to follow the clues. It is a five box series that warned me not to bring small children or dogs along. For the first three boxes I had every intention of letting the placer know that it was fine for kids and pets alike, but then the last 2 boxes changed my mind. The trail is so hard to spot and the climbs and terrain were very rough even on me. I did find the last boxes and was awed at the wonderful view at the end. The stamps themselves were wonderful and well worth the long and hard trail. I got lost hiking back out. I lost the trail twice but I knew the direction I should be going and quickly found the trail again. Using my pedometer it clocked me in at almost 3.5 miles. Then I went
 for one more box at Emma Long that PIJoe planted yesterday, another 2.7 mile hike. As I was leaving Emma Long PIJoe called me and I let him know I was first finder on his new box and it was a great birthday thanks to him. He informed me that I missed a Silver Eagle box that had just been planted on the same trail! Well I guess that gives me something to do next weekend. I had a busy day planed for my birthday and had no intention of hiking another 3 miles. My poor legs are sore as it is. </p>
<p>We went and ate at Matts El Ranch for lunch. Drove to go get my girls and took them to go get a Christmas tree. We have never had a real Christmas tree and this was every-ones first time at a Christmas tree farm. They take you in a hay ride out to the trees and you walk around in a short forest looking for just the right tree. Then you cut it down, and drag it back to the road. The wagon comes around and picks you back up and loads your tree in the back. Once back at the barn they put your tree on a vibrator and it shakes loose all the dead stuff. Then they bag your tree, size it up and you get in line with your tree to go pay. They had fun stuff for kids to do and we all went through a crazy maze. It was so much fun. I hope my girls remember it always. Once we got home with our tree we were off to the store to buy lights and ornaments. Then home to set up and decorate. The day is over and I don't feel any older except for my muscles in my legs
 killing me after a 16 mile weekend. lol:)</p>

&gt; We went and ate at Matts El Ranch for lunch. Drove to go get my girls and took <br/>
&gt; them to go get a Christmas tree. We have never had a real Christmas tree and <br/>
&gt; this was every-ones first time at a Christmas tree farm. They take you in a hay <br/>
&gt; ride out to the trees and you walk around in a short forest looking for just the <br/>
&gt; right tree. Then you cut it down, and drag it back to the road. The wagon comes <br/>
&gt; around and picks you back up and loads your tree in the back. Once back at the <br/>
&gt; barn they put your tree on a vibrator and it shakes loose all the dead stuff. <br/>
&gt; Then they bag your tree, size it up and you get in line with your tree to go <br/>
&gt; pay. They had fun stuff for kids to do and we all went through a crazy maze. It <br/>
&gt; was so much fun. I hope my girls remember it always. Once we got home with our <br/>
&gt; tree we were off to the store to buy lights and ornaments. Then home to set up <br/>
&gt; and decorate. The day is over and I don't feel any older except for my muscles <br/>
&gt; in my legs killing me after a 16 mile weekend. lol:)<br/>

<p>Sounds like you are well on your way to a LB hiking tag. Thanks for sharing and Happy Birthday.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" ymailto="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, Jenifer Barbee &lt;jaydawnlove@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Instead of fighting the shopping crowds Friday, I figured I would get out and <br/>&gt; box in this wonderful fall weather. I woke up Friday morning to sleet hitting my <br/>&gt; window at 7am. Sleet! Yes on the day I planed to box and all! Its ok though, it <br/>&gt; only lasted about 20 minutes and after that the strong winds pushed away the <br/>&gt; cloud. We bundled up, made hot coco and headed out the door for our long drive <br/>&gt; to Lake Somerville. Since I had my two young daughters with me I figured we <br/>&gt; would start with the longest hike, a Silver Eagle 20
 questions game box that was <br/>&gt; 2 miles to get to the box. So a round trip of 4 miles. There were a few other <br/>&gt; boxes on the same trail and we found them all. After the first mile of hiking my <br/>&gt; oldest daughter (9) started complaining about being tired. OMG already! She was <br/>&gt; fine after a little brake. My youngest daughter (7) started getting tired after <br/>&gt; 3 miles and Dreamwalker had to carry her for about half a mile. Poor guy. All <br/>&gt; the other boxes were on fairly short trails and there wasn't much more <br/>&gt; complaining after that. We ended up finding 16 boxes of the 21 we went to <br/>&gt; find. Sadly Runsforchocolate's box had been chopped down by the park rangers as <br/>&gt; they were clear cutting an area for electric poles. We found pieces of her box <br/>&gt; and camo tape and ripped up baggies but no logbook or stamp. I searched around <br/>&gt; the tree and mulch for quite a while
 hoping to unearth the stamp but came up <br/>&gt; empty handed. It was a very windy chilly day and we hiked over 6 miles. I had <br/>&gt; plans to box in near by cities but we hadn't eaten all day, and night falls so <br/>&gt; fast now, that we stopped after we were done with Lake Somerville. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; On Saturday we woke up early once again and headed out to do more boxing, this <br/>&gt; time without the girls. We went to La Grange, Fayettville, Round Top, Burton, <br/>&gt; and Giddings. There are two new boxers near Round Top who have been planting <br/>&gt; around the area and I was happy to find some of their boxes. I also planted a <br/>&gt; box in Round Top to thank the local boxers for planting. All in all we found 20 <br/>&gt; boxes and hiked another 4 miles Saturday. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I was given some clues Friday for a series of boxes that were not yet listed as <br/>&gt; a sort of Birthday present and sort of a "can you check
 this out and tell me <br/>&gt; what needs to be fixed" kind of thing. So on my birthday, today, I went to <br/>&gt; follow the clues. It is a five box series that warned me not to bring small <br/>&gt; children or dogs along. For the first three boxes I had every intention of <br/>&gt; letting the placer know that it was fine for kids and pets alike, but then <br/>&gt; the last 2 boxes changed my mind. The trail is so hard to spot and the climbs <br/>&gt; and terrain were very rough even on me. I did find the last boxes and was awed <br/>&gt; at the wonderful view at the end. The stamps themselves were wonderful and well <br/>&gt; worth the long and hard trail. I got lost hiking back out. I lost the trail <br/>&gt; twice but I knew the direction I should be going and quickly found the trail <br/>&gt; again. Using my pedometer it clocked me in at almost 3.5 miles. Then I went for <br/>&gt; one more box at Emma Long that PIJoe planted
 yesterday, another 2.7 mile hike. <br/>&gt; As I was leaving Emma Long PIJoe called me and I let him know I was first finder <br/>&gt; on his new box and it was a great birthday thanks to him. He informed me that I <br/>&gt; missed a Silver Eagle box that had just been planted on the same trail! Well I <br/>&gt; guess that gives me something to do next weekend. I had a busy day planed for my <br/>&gt; birthday and had no intention of hiking another 3 miles. My poor legs are sore <br/>&gt; as it is. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We went and ate at Matts El Ranch for lunch. Drove to go get my girls and took <br/>&gt; them to go get a Christmas tree. We have never had a real Christmas tree and <br/>&gt; this was every-ones first time at a Christmas tree farm.

<p><span>Instead of
fighting the shopping crowds Friday, I figured I would get out and box in
this wonderful fall weather. I woke up Friday morning to sleet hitting my
window at 7am. Sleet! Yes on the day I planed to box and all! Its ok
though, it only lasted about 20 minutes and after that the strong winds pushed
away the cloud. We bundled up, made hot coco and headed out the door for our
long drive to Lake Somerville. Since I had my two young daughters with me
I figured we would start with the longest hike, a Silver Eagle 20 questions
game box that was 2 miles to get to the box. So a round trip of 4 miles. There
were a few other boxes on the same trail and we found them all. After the first
mile of hiking my oldest daughter (9) started complaining about being
tired. OMG already! She was fine after a little brake. My youngest daughter (7)
started getting tired after 3 miles and Dreamwalker had to carry her for
about half a mile. Poor guy. All the other boxes were on fairly short trails
and there wasn't much more complaining after that. We ended up finding 16
boxes of the 21 we went to find. Sadly Runsforchocolate's box had been
chopped down by the park rangers as they were clear cutting an area for
electric poles. We found pieces of her box and camo tape and ripped up baggies
but no logbook or stamp. I searched around the tree and mulch for quite a while
hoping to unearth the stamp but came up empty handed. It was a very windy
chilly day and we hiked over 6 miles. I had plans to box in near by cities but
we hadn't eaten all day, and night falls so fast now, that we stopped after we
were done with Lake Somerville. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>On Saturday
we woke up early once again and headed out to do more boxing, this time without
the girls. We went to La Grange, Fayettville, Round Top, Burton, and Giddings.
There are two new boxers near Round Top who have been planting around the area
and I was happy to find some of their boxes. I also planted a box in Round Top
to thank the local boxers for planting. All in all we found 20 boxes and hiked
another 4 miles Saturday. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I was given
some clues Friday for a series of boxes that were not yet listed as a
sort of Birthday present and sort of a "can you check this out and
tell me what needs to be fixed" kind of thing. So on my birthday,
today, I went to follow the clues. It is a five box series that warned me
not to bring small children or dogs along. For the first three boxes I had
every intention of letting the placer know that it was fine for kids and
pets alike, but then the last 2 boxes changed my mind. The trail is so
hard to spot and the climbs and terrain were very rough even on me. I did find
the last boxes and was awed at the wonderful view at the end. The stamps
themselves were wonderful and well worth the long and hard trail. I got lost
hiking back out. I lost the trail twice but I knew the direction I should be
going and quickly found the trail again. Using my pedometer it clocked me
in at almost 3.5 miles. Then I went for one more box at Emma Long that
PIJoe planted yesterday, another 2.7 mile hike. As I was leaving Emma Long
PIJoe called me and I let him know I was first finder on his new box and it was
a great birthday thanks to him. He informed me that I missed a Silver Eagle box
that had just been planted on the same trail! Well I guess that gives me
something to do next weekend. I had a busy day planed for my birthday and had
no intention of hiking another 3 miles. My poor legs are sore as it is. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>We went and
ate at Matts El Ranch for lunch. Drove to go get my girls and took them to go
get a Christmas tree. We have never had a real Christmas tree and this was
every-ones first time at a Christmas tree farm. They take you in a hay ride out
to the trees and you walk around in a short forest looking for just the right
tree. Then you cut it down, and drag it back to the road. The wagon comes around
and picks you back up and loads your tree in the back. Once back at the barn
they put your tree on a vibrator and it shakes loose all the dead stuff. Then
they bag your tree, size it up and you get in line with your tree to go pay.
They had fun stuff for kids to do and we all went through a crazy maze. It was
so much fun. I hope my girls remember it always. Once we got home with our tree
we were off to the store to buy lights and ornaments. Then home to set up and
decorate. The day is over and I don't feel any older except for my muscles in
my legs killing me after a 16 mile weekend. lol:)<o:p></o:p></span></p>

&gt; follow the clues.It is a five box series that warned me not to bring small <br/>
&gt; children or dogs along. For the first three boxes I had every intention of <br/>
&gt; letting the placer know thatit was fine for kids and pets alike, but then <br/>
&gt; thelast 2 boxes changed my mind. The trail is so hard to spot and the climbs <br/>
&gt; and terrain were very rough even on me. I did find the last boxes and was awed <br/>
&gt; at the wonderful view at the end. The stamps themselves were wonderful and well <br/>
&gt; worth the long and hard trail. I got lost hiking back out. I lost the trail <br/>
&gt; twice but I knew the direction I should be going and quickly found the trail <br/>
&gt; again.Using my pedometer it clocked me in at almost3.5 miles. Then I went for <br/>
&gt; one more box at Emma Long that PIJoe planted yesterday, another 2.7 mile hike. <br/>
&gt; As I was leaving Emma Long PIJoe called me and I let him know I was first finder <br/>
&gt; on his new box and it was a great birthday thanks to him. He informed me that I <br/>
&gt; missed a Silver Eagle box that had just been planted on the same trail! Well I <br/>
&gt; guess that gives me something to do next weekend. I had a busy day planed for my <br/>
&gt; birthday and had no intention of hiking another 3 miles. My poor legs are sore <br/>
&gt; as it is. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We went and ate at Matts El Ranch for lunch. Drove to go get my girls and took <br/>
&gt; them to go get a Christmas tree. We have never had a real Christmas tree and <br/>
&gt; this was every-ones first time at a Christmas tree farm. They take you in a hay <br/>
&gt; ride out to the trees and you walk around in a short forest looking for just the <br/>
&gt; right tree. Then you cut it down, and drag it back to the road. The wagon comes <br/>
&gt; around and picks you back up and loads your tree in the back. Once back at the <br/>
&gt; barn they put your tree on a vibrator and it shakes loose all the dead stuff. <br/>
&gt; Then they bag your tree, size it up and you get in line with your tree to go <br/>
&gt; pay. They had fun stuff for kids to do and we all went through a crazy maze. It <br/>
&gt; was so much fun. I hope my girls remember it always. Once we got home with our <br/>
&gt; tree we were off to the store to buy lights and ornaments. Then home to set up <br/>
&gt; and decorate. The day is over and I don't feel any older except for my muscles <br/>
&gt; in my legs killing me after a 16 mile weekend. lol:)<br/>
