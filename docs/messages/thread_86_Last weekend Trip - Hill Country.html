We camped at Kerrville State Park and made a day trip Saturday to <br>
multiple places, mainly wineries!!!   Along the way we found and hid <br>
some letterboxes.  Here is the list and status.   <br>
<br>
Enchanted Eagle - Alive and well (had to be careful due to large <br>
crowd)<br>
Enchanted Rock - Alive and Well<br>
Hid new box ("Yogi") at Enchanted Rock SNA<br>
Hid new box ("Littel Phoexiz") at Fall Creek winery near Llano.<br>
Found Lost Marble & Sweet Berry - both alive and well.<br>
Hid new box ("Park Ranger") at Kerrville-Shreiner State Park.<br>
Replaced Dino Tracks box at Natural Bridge Caverns.<br>
Replaced Texas Jackalope at Lockhart State Park.<br>
Had some great BBQ in Lockhart!!!<br>
<br>
Great weekend!!  Suggest you if you like wine you make the trip up <br>
that way.  We visited 7 wineries in one day saturday, and was worth <br>
the effort.  <br>
