                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just thought I would remind the newer letterboxers who plan to attend the event this weekend that you should check LbNA as well as Atlas Quest for clues to letterboxes.  Sometimes boxes are listed on only one of the sites and not both.  In fact, a large percentage of Texas letterboxes are not listed on Atlas Quest.<br>
<br>
I have a new ap for my IPad called "Clue Tracker" that I really like.  It allows you to find boxes by location or it can locate you by satellite and give you the boxes closest to where you happen to be at the moment.  It also lists AQ boxes and LbNA boxes and you can toggle between the two.  This came in handy recently when I was checking on some of our boxes at Washington-on-the-Brazos.  At one of the box locations I found another box and recognized it as a box I had found a long time ago.  I knew it didn't belong where I found it, but didn't remember exactly where it should be.  Luckily, I had my IPad and I looked up the box on LbNA and was able to replace it right where it needed to be.  I thought that was cool.  We also used it on our trip to Alabama in August.  We would stop at every roadside park or rest area and check for nearby boxes.  Many of the rest areas have letterboxes.<br>
