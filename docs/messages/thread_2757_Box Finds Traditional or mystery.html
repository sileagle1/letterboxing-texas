<div>You can post the second box so that people can log it if you are so inclined, but post it without clues.  Personally, I wouldn't post the second one at all so that it is a complete surprise when someone finds it - but that's just me.

<div>Lightning, Texas Flutterby, and I found a bonus box about a year ago and it was great fun to get.  We enjoyed getting the first box quite a bit as it was, and as we were buttoning up the box we happened across the way to get the second box.  Not everyone who got the first one noticed the bonus opportunity (I could tell because there weren't nearly as many log entries) so we were very pleased with ourselves!
