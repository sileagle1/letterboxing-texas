                    <div class="plaintext-content">This just in...a busload of rowdy Texans was apprehended this <br>
afternoon at an overlook on Hwy 69.  Authorities said that the <br>
suspects were attempting to go bungee jumping off of the tower at the <br>
overlook.  The bus riders were apprehended without any harm and they <br>
were taken to the county courthouse to determine their fate.  The <br>
judge could order them to the county jail, the state hospital, or he <br>
could set them free.  The officer at the scene said that they would <br>
probably be analyzed by someone from the state hospital before the <br>
judge ruled.  Stay tuned to this station for more info on this <br>
situation.<br>
