Here's a little info from a Texas Co-Op story on the Chaparral <br>
Trail...<br>
<br>
http://www.texas-<br>
ec.org/publications/texascooppower/archive/300train.aspx<br>
<br>
Excerpt: The Chaparral Rail Trail, a nonprofit corporation, sought <br>
government grants to develop a hike-and-bike from Farmersville to <br>
Paris, but opposition in Pecan Gap blocked the funding. The town's <br>
aging citizenry feared liability risks and thought maintenance costs <br>
would outweigh benefits. "These people aren't going to ride a <br>
bicycle," Cheney observes. "We figured it was a lot of expense for a <br>
few to enjoy." The nonprofit group is taking a piecemeal approach to <br>
developing 56 miles of right of way as funds become available.<br>
<br>
Rail trail projects have expanded nationally since 1983 when Congress <br>
created a railbanking program. Railbanking prevents rights of way <br>
from reverting to pre-railroad owners or otherwise being sold or <br>
broken up. Communities use the routes as interim recreational trails, <br>
hoping that someday another railroad might replace lost tracks. The <br>
chances of that actually happening are extremely remote, experts <br>
agree.<br>

<div><font size="2">Well, I thought it was funny! Anyway, you know if you plant them, I will come. I've never gone looking for a GC (actually I've purposefully found GC/LB hybrids), but have happened upon quite a few. That usually happens when I'm looking for a great place to hide a LB and find that a GCer got there before me and had the same idea. As long as they are practicing LNT and trying to place their boxes in interesting places, we're sure to be bumping into each other's spots along the trails. I hope your GCer friend gives you a favorable report and you do hide us some treasures along that trail. I like to use LBing as my motivation for choosing a hiking trail and now you've peaked my curiosity.</font></div>

<div><font size="2">Why am I laughing at this question, Lucy? Again, it brings to mind what makes a good hiding place for a letterbox. I am looking forward to this discussion at the Tx Event because I can't wait to hear the input. I just can't imagine that at least fourteen miles of trails couldn't yield some really interesting hiding spots. My suggestion: Barefoot Lucy, get up there and hide some boxes, and we'll figure it out soon enough as we go looking for them! This is pretty close to my stomping grounds too! </font></div>
