                    <div class="plaintext-content">My Texas Star letterbox at Fair Park in Dallas was reported<br/>
missing a while back, so I created a new one, but would not<br/>
have been back to that area for quite a while.  Luckily a<br/>
fellow letterboxer from Pennsylvania, Raindear, volunteered<br/>
to help me out while in Dallas on business.  So I mailed the <br/>
microbox and it was replaced yesterday.  The letterbox is<br/>
now a microbox, but it is in the same general area.  The<br/>
clues have been modified so reprint them before searching.<br/>
Thanks again, Raindear! <br/>
