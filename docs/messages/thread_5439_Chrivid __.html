                    <html><body><p>So somebody asked how I started letterboxing.  So here is my tale, may it be tall, but not too tall.<br/>First off, let me be clear Chrivid is two people who act as one at times (sometimes we act as if we were 3 or 4 poeple, but that is another tale).   A combination of souls to play a game and enjoy our time. Christy is the first part, David is the second.   <br/>I, the second half of Chrivid, have know about letterboxing for many years, just could not find an active partner to walk around the woods or cities following clues looking for mysteries.   I have been geocaching on and off since 2001, and love being outside, and I love small challenges.  I even carved a stamp many years ago, but never got around to using it.<br/>So a few years ago, I met somebody who enjoys the creativity of these kind of games, as well as the creativity of nature in general (as well as the creativity of me too !!)<br/>A few months ago, we were geocaching the Brenham geotour, and one of the geocaches was at Kohl's settlement (West of Independance, Texas).  While searching, we found the letterbox "Flower Power" by gramatrick.   This was Chri's first ever introduction to letterboxing.  I explained the way to play, we signed the log (no stamp with us), and continued caching.  <br/>The next day we went to find a cache at a waterfall (after big rains anyway) in Lake Somerville State Park.   The hike was fun, the location was awesome, but alas, no waterfall.  Still a great spot in the woods, that we was so glad somebody led me to.   However to our surprise, inside the geocache was a letterbox - Sometimes a Waterfall by NativTxn.    <br/>Two days, two stamps.  So we decided the signs were pointing us to a new hobby.  We promised ourselves to come back to both of these creations, and give them our stamp !<br/>We went home, and I found my old stamp I had carved many years ago; it looks like a fish, and somehow we came up the name Chrivid, which does fit a fish.  So we began (one of) our legacies.<br/>And now we are letterboxers.   IIRC, our first letterbox we found and stamped was "Mother of Texas 2" in Richmond, Tx by Silver Eagle  on November 27, 2014.  It took a few months but we have finally stamped both of the two letterboxes that really got us started, plus a few more.  And we have not found a few also, but that is part of the fun.  The creativity in the clues, and the stamp carvings are inspirational, so we hid our own box at the beginning of 2015 in Brenham.  I also recarved our Chrivid stamp (the first was quite  small and was in danger of breaking). <br/>We have since 'boxed in a few states, and are looking forward to much more in the future, both placing and seeking.  We are also planning a series based on a letterbox we found in Arkansas, and we are working on getting a box ready to plant, possibly later this month.<br/><br/>As far as TALE XII, I am afraid I have other obligations that will probably prevent me from attending - that weekend is the beginning of the "Texas Welcome Home Run" which is a veterans memorial motorcycle ride across Texas from the top (Perryton) to the Bottom (Brownsville) along Highway 83 ( the <b>Texas Vietnam Veterans Memorial Highway)</b>.  This will be my second year to ride if I can make it, and I hope I do.  While not a veteran, I am so appreciative of those who served, and of those who go before me.<br/></p><p><br/><span></span></p><p><span>Later<br/></span></p><p><span>Chrivid (actually the second half of Chrivid with the first half's permission :)<br class="yui-cursor"/></span></p></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>Great story and thanks for sharing.  Interesting that a geocache/letterbox hybrid helped guide you to letterboxing.  As you probably know, the two hobbies don't always go well together because geocachers sometimes find letterboxes by mistake and, thinking they are geocaches, take the stamp.  Glad it worked out well for you and that box.<br/><br/>BTW, for any newbie who wants to read about some letterbox memories that will help you feel included when we talk of things from our past, go to the Files section of this group and look at Letterboxing Memories:<br/><br/><a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/files/Letterboxing%20Memories/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/files/Letterboxing%20Memories/</a><br/></p><p>  </p> Silver Eagle<br/>(Just trying to be welcoming)</body></html>

I like to ask folks when I meet them at an event. A few TALES ago, we were encouraged to plant a box about our first find. It was great fun. </p><div>Sorry you can't make TALE this year, but hope to meet you another time.</div><div>Bloomin Gramma Jo with Bird Dog</div></body></html>
