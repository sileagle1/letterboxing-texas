We've reached a grand total of 22 Texas LetterBoxing T-shirts - so within a<br/>
week or thereabouts, I'll give the printer a call and place our order. Since<br/>
our order is tiny compared to her back-to-school business for area teams and<br/>
high schools, I'm guessing it could be as much as 3-4 weeks turnaround time.<br/>
<br/>
By the way, there isn't any profit in this for us - I just shopped around to<br/>
find the least expensive most convenient place I could. As soon as I place<br/>
the order, I'll confirm the exact total to each person who ordered shirts -<br/>
with or without the shipping costs, depending on whether you'll be attending<br/>
the Waxahachie Barn Raising!<br/>
<br/>
Cheers!<br/>

<div>Catpawz would like 2 green shirts (because the blue ones are sooooo comfortable.  We would like a L and an XL, and we'll be at the barn raising in Oct.  (unless we decide we can't wait and have to meet you in DFW before then!).  Thanks for ordering these!</div>
