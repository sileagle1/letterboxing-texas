<div>Hello All - I am a new letterboxer!!  My oldest daughter (she is almost 7) and I got into this last summer after a friend told me about it.  We went to Denver, CO for vacation and I dragged my mom, brother, niece and nephew and my daughters out for a day of adventure.  We found 5 boxes that day and caught the bug.  Came back to Texas only to discover that there weren't many boxes to be found so I kinda lost interest for awhile.  Memorial Day weekend we were heading to my dad's lake house in East Texas and I got on the website again to see if there were any boxes around his house and we not only found boxes in Jasper, TX but also discovered there were a ton more boxes in our area (Plano, Richardson, Carrollton, McKinney, etc).  We found 3 of 5 boxes in Jasper.  Went out last weekend to find some in Plano but had no luck so will need to try again.  My daughter and I want to plant the first letterbox in Frisco which is where we live.  My dad is taking my daughter letterboxing in the next couple weeks around his house in Brenham.  Any advice for them?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's our story.  Heard about this group and wanted to join so we can get better about finding boxes (very disappointing to a 7 year old when you can't find them) and learn more about this hobby.  We also enjoy soccer and reading and love Golden Retrievers.  Our first box will be named Goldenboy, hopefully we will plant this summer.</div>

<br>
You must've felt a little like Rip van Winkle - went<br>
to sleep for a little while and the whole Texas<br>
letterboxing scene had changed when you woke up!  <br>
<br>
My family has enjoyed soccer for a number of years<br>
also - my daughter (17) has played for 12 years and my<br>
son (9) has played for 4, my daughter and I have both<br>
coached and refereed as well.  Alas, we're slowing<br>
down on that front and devoting a lot more of our time<br>
to scouting (which is loads of fun, but unfortunately,<br>
our days are STILL only 24 hours long no matter how<br>
much we wish they weren't).  I do miss those cold<br>
rainy Springtime games though!  We are still huge fans<br>
and almost invariably stop to watch a game, be it pro<br>
ball or herd ball...and now I'm wondering why we've<br>
never done a soccer box!<br>
<br>
Glad you joined and hope you enjoy it more this time<br>
around!<br>

<div>Lucy - I tried to convince my daughter to do a soccer box as I played for 16 years and she has been playing for 2 1/2, but she is very attached to our Golden Retriever puppy who is 18 months old and was her Christmas present this year.  Thus the name Goldenboy for our letterbox we want to plant in Frisco.  Guess we will have to do a Goldenboy and a soccer box.  There are none in Frisco so that would be a good start.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for your reply, I have already received a ton today.  Makes one feel welcome.</div>

                    <html><body><div>As I mentioned earlier, Fearless Fox, Lightning and I were hanging out with SJZ and RXKaffee and Baby Jonah this weekend.  I finally remembered to bring my Jonah box with me, and a couple of other boxes I've had hanging around waiting to be planted. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Saturday afternoon, SJZ and Fearless Fox and Lightning and I went to do a little letterboxing/garage saling, and we took Jonah with us on his first letterboxing foray.  Jonah is nearly 4 months old now and long overdue for a trip out. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We took quite a convoluted route to Crosstimbers Park where I hoped to find a couple of Beneficus Rex' boxes, we ran across the Graham-Argyle Cemetery and thought it looked like a nice little cemetery for one of my boxes.  Now most of y'all know I've got reservations about cemetery boxes and haven't ever, until now, planted one of my own.  We all got out of the car and began exploring.  We quickly realized this was a somewhat unusual cemetery because for one thing, it seemed many of the headstones were facing the wrong direction - not sure what was up with that, but it sure made it difficult to keep from walking on graves or heck, even knowing if we were about to walk on a grave.  We also saw several different styles of WOTW headstones.  While SJZ and I peered around in overgrown corners, Fearless Fox and Lightning worked to keep Jonah entertained.  They discovered that he was especially enamoured with trees and leaves, so Fearless Fox kept burying Lightning in leaves so he could pop up and send the baby into fits of grins.  It was so cool! 
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>We got that box planted and proceeded on to Crosstimbers Park, which we eventually found (both SJZ and Fearless Fox had dialed the park in on their respective internet connections, but neither of them had figured out a direct route to the park, so finding the park became - interesting).  By the time we got to the park, we had hit a few garage sales and found a few bargains, among them being a book SJZ had been wanting.  Jonah, meanwhile, had expended so much energy at the cemetery that he was starving, so SJZ decided she would stay in the car and feed Jonah and read.  Fearless Fox, Lightning, and I got out and headed down the trail to the first box, which we quickly found and stamped in to.  Fearless Fox suddenly realized it was silly for SJZ to sit in the car when he could stay with the baby and she could come along with us, so he went back to the car and sent SJZ along while Lightning and I worked on planting another box.  We had the box in place and were ready to work out the clues, when I remembered that I hadn't logged the box into my book.  After Lightning pulled it back out of its hidey hole, we realized I had brought the wrong box out of the car and was about to leave behind a box I have been intending to plant near home!  Oops!  No box hidden in THAT park...  SJZ caught up with us and we began trying to find the second BR box in Crosstimbers Park, and we were fairly sure we were hot on the trail, but the offshoot trail we took didn't have a pond, and the pond was critical to following the clues, so we must have been off-base.  By then we were losing daylight and half of us had to go to the bathroom, so we decided to let it go and try again later.  It continues to amaze me though, how much park cities can squeeze into a neighborhood, and Crosstimbers Park was a good example of that!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ and RXKaffee are very late sleepers, so Fearless Fox and Lightning and I were up for quite a long time before they ever arose.  FF and I decided we would go plant Jonah's box on our own since we were tired of waiting.  Lightning was more interested in staying and playing RXKaffee's very old Playstation (it was not a PS3, or a PS2, but an original PS).  He had overheated it the day before so we were glad to know it worked again.  It would be a SHAME for an antique like that not to function!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, FF and I headed out to plant Jonah's box, but he decided the place we had previously decided to place it wasn't very good.  We decided to try another place and were eventually to find a good hiding spot.  When we got back to the apartment, Jonah and his mama were finally getting up.  Jonah was very excited we had finally hidden his box!  He was silly - every time we mentioned the word "letterbox" he would grin.  I think he has the fever already!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We left Denton about Noon and went on toward home.  Fearless Fox suggested that we take our time and letterbox our way home, so I fired up the internet on his cell phone and proceeded to find clues, but about the time I would have some clues dialed in, he would change course and I would have to start all over.  Of course, we were also still on a search for a Wii, so I was vying with Lightning for time.  We eventually just decided to head on home by our normal route, but we did stop in Gun Barrel City to plant a box and we finally also found "Time in a - Barrel?" box, which can be tricky if you aren't tall...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I realized when we got home that it's been a long time since we planted more boxes than we found on a given trip!</div>

<div>We got that box planted and proceeded on to Crosstimbers Park, which we eventually found (both SJZ and Fearless Fox had dialed the park in on their respective internet connections, but neither of them had figured out a direct route to the park, so finding the park became - interesting).  By the time we got to the park, we had hit a few garage sales and found a few bargains, among them being a book SJZ had been wanting.  Jonah, meanwhile, had expended so much energy at the cemetery that he was starving, so SJZ decided she would stay in the car and feed Jonah and read.  Fearless Fox, Lightning, and I got out and headed down the trail to the first box, which we quickly found and stamped in to.  Fearless Fox suddenly realized it was silly for SJZ to sit in the car when he could stay with the baby and she could come along with us, so he went back to the car and sent SJZ along while Lightning and I worked on planting another box.  We had the box in place and were ready to work out the clues, when I remembered that I hadn't logged the box into my book.  After Lightning pulled it back out of its hidey hole, we realized I had brought the wrong box out of the car and was about to leave behind a box I have been intending to plant near home!  Oops!  No box hidden in THAT park...  SJZ caught up with us and we began trying to find the second BR box in Crosstimbers Park, and we were fairly sure we were hot on the trail, but the offshoot trail we took didn't have a pond, and the pond was critical to following the clues, so we must have been off-base.  By then we were losing daylight and half of us had to go to the bathroom, so we decided to let it go and try again later.  It continues to amaze me though, how much park cities can squeeze into a neighborhood, and Crosstimbers Park was a good example of that! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ and RXKaffee are very late sleepers, so Fearless Fox and Lightning and I were up for quite a long time before they ever arose.  FF and I decided we would go plant Jonah's box on our own since we were tired of waiting.  Lightning was more interested in staying and playing RXKaffee's very old Playstation (it was not a PS3, or a PS2, but an original PS).  He had overheated it the day before so we were glad to know it worked again.  It would be a SHAME for an antique like that not to function! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, FF and I headed out to plant Jonah's box, but he decided the place we had previously decided to place it wasn't very good.  We decided to try another place and were eventually to find a good hiding spot.  When we got back to the apartment, Jonah and his mama were finally getting up.  Jonah was very excited we had finally hidden his box!  He was silly - every time we mentioned the word "letterbox" he would grin.  I think he has the fever already! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We left Denton about Noon and went on toward home.  Fearless Fox suggested that we take our time and letterbox our way home, so I fired up the internet on his cell phone and proceeded to find clues, but about the time I would have some clues dialed in, he would change course and I would have to start all over.  Of course, we were also still on a search for a Wii, so I was vying with Lightning for time.  We eventually just decided to head on home by our normal route, but we did stop in Gun Barrel City to plant a box and we finally also found "Time in a - Barrel?" box, which can be tricky if you aren't tall... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I realized when we got home that it's been a long time since we planted more boxes than we found on a given trip!</div>

                    <html><body><div>So - just as we have letterboxing backpacks, we could buy a Miata and also have a letterboxing car.  And if deep rural letterboxing were planned, it might even be small enough to be loaded in the back of a full-sized 4 wheel drive truck for deployment at the box site???
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let me just mention that the thing about it being handy for drive-bys is not real definitive - not too long ago Lightning and I were able to reach out of the car and pick up a drive-by box (one of Bambi's boxes here in Jacksonville) in my Buick Regal by driving it between two trees.  Of course, my Buick Regal doesn't have many of the other qualities you describe, so it's only claim to letterboxing usefulness is that in that particular instance, I could pick up a drive-by from the car, and that I don't particularly care if it gets scratched up because the paint job is already shot.
