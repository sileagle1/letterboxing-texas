<br>
For those of you who are new to letterboxing and<br>
haven't yet figured out that Silver Eagle has been a<br>
driving force behind boxing in Texas, you are in for a<br>
real treat at the gathering when you meet him!<br>
<br>
Silver Eagle and BabyBear have personally planted<br>
many, many of the boxes we find in Texas (with a nod<br>
to Eoghan and others), counting their plantings as<br>
seeds to keep the rest of us in the hobby.  For those<br>
of you who are discouraged that there aren't many<br>
boxes in your area, remember that when S.E. and B.B.<br>
started boxing, there weren't many in the STATE!  <br>
<br>
A few months ago, Silver Eagle posted a message with<br>
the statistics of growth of letterboxing in Texas. <br>
I've been personally amazed at the growth since the<br>
last (and first) gathering this past March, which the<br>
two of them organized.  <br>
<br>
I can't wait to all get together in March to see how<br>
we've grown.<br>

<div>It has been a wonderful, strange, and sometimes frustrating 2 years of letterboxing.   Most of my friends, and even my wife (Love Bunny), still don't really understand my joy in carving and finding boxes all around the country, and sometimes out of the country.  I can't believe it myself sometimes, how I am driven to go out of my way to try to find a hidden treasure along some dusty road.   It is also strange how I have evolved in the 2 years, from that first letterbox that Silver Eagle talked me into trying to find.  We had no personal stamps, walked all over a park in Spokane, Washington, and finally reached under a little bridge and pulled out our first box.  If that box would have been missing, we would not have placed over 200 boxes combined and now found over 800.   After that we both went out and bought store stamps as our personal stamp, and decided we would only find boxes, not carve our own.   A few
 months later we evolved again, deciding we should start carving stamps, especially since there were none to find in Texas.  We also ditched our store stamps and carved our own person stamps, and soon became like the veterans on the talk list that scoffed at store bought stamps.   Then we hid boxes everywhere, and soon learned another valuable lesson - they needed to be hidden better and double bagged.   On a letterboxing trip up through the middle states, we found our first microbox, and this changed things again for both of us.  I still like the traditional box, but Micro's are much easier to deal with when you can't find a place to hide a large box.  Anyway, it has been a long journey in a short amount of time, but well worth it.   It is fun now to watch the new letterboxers go through the stages we experienced.  </div>

<div>Again, can't wait for the event!!!</div>
