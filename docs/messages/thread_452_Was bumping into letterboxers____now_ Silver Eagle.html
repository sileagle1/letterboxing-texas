<br/>
For those of you who are new to letterboxing and<br/>
haven't yet figured out that Silver Eagle has been a<br/>
driving force behind boxing in Texas, you are in for a<br/>
real treat at the gathering when you meet him!<br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle and BabyBear have personally planted<br/>
many, many of the boxes we find in Texas (with a nod<br/>
to Eoghan and others), counting their plantings as<br/>
seeds to keep the rest of us in the hobby.  For those<br/>
of you who are discouraged that there aren't many<br/>
boxes in your area, remember that when S.E. and B.B.<br/>
started boxing, there weren't many in the STATE!  <br/>
<br/>
A few months ago, Silver Eagle posted a message with<br/>
the statistics of growth of letterboxing in Texas. <br/>
I've been personally amazed at the growth since the<br/>
last (and first) gathering this past March, which the<br/>
two of them organized.  <br/>
<br/>
I can't wait to all get together in March to see how<br/>
we've grown.<br/>

&gt; Baby Bear and I bumped into 3 new boxers in a small<br/>
&gt; park<br/>
&gt; in the middle of Idaho last summer.  We had taken<br/>
&gt; the box<br/>
&gt; to a picnic table and watched as this trio pulled up<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; proceded to follow the clues to the box.  They<br/>
&gt; looked<br/>
&gt; disappointed at not finding it until I walked up<br/>
&gt; with it<br/>
&gt; in my hand.  They had no idea how rare this<br/>
&gt; encounter was<br/>
&gt; and I had to explain about exchanging before they<br/>
&gt; would<br/>
&gt; stamp into my logbook.  This encounter is even more <br/>
&gt; amazing when you realize there were only a handful<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; letterboxers in the entire state at that time!<br/>
