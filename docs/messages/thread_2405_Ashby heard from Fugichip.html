                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Since many of you seemed interested in the Adazing<br>
Treasure box report, I thought I should send an<br>
update.  I did hear back from Fugichip today and will<br>
be mailing their box to them tomorrow.  Thank you for<br>
all your interest and concern.<br>
<br>
I have learned a lot about stamping in from this<br>
experience, because a FEW of the stamps or notes are<br>
as clear as if they were written just this morning,<br>
but MOST of them are washed away completely...I guess<br>
the difference between different kinds of inks, in<br>
both stamp pads or writing pens.  I am going to find<br>
out more about this and make sure I am using something<br>
that will not wash away.  I don't know if what I am<br>
using right now is waterproof or not, so this<br>
situation has been very informative for me.<br>

<div>The subject of ink comes up periodically on other lists, mainly newboxers.  Pigment inks take longer to dry, but are more colorfast.  Dye inks are quick dry, quick to run.  I think kids' markers are a mistake because they are intended (for the most part) to be washable - washable means runnable.

<div>It really is funny though, when you see a logbook that has been waterlogged, to see some stamps that are plain as day and others that look like Picasso in pastel.<br/><br/> </div>

for boxing is a hybrid ink - all the benefits of a quick drying dye ink <br>
but the waterfast properties of a pigment.  Many varieties are <br>
available and can be found at your local craft store.  I use the <br>
Ancient Page and/or Versafine brands but there are others that work <br>
just as well.<br>
