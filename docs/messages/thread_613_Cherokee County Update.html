                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a really busy weekend planned, but through a<br/>
series of quirky events I found myself whisked away at<br/>
1 a.m. Saturday morning to go camping with Cub Scouts<br/>
(long story - but basically, a couple of leaders were<br/>
taken ill and they needed my credentials, not me). <br/>
Luckily, the campout happened to be happening in a<br/>
park where there are two letterboxes, so I checked<br/>
them out.  <br/>
<br/>
One of them, Crowin Bout the Railroad, I had never<br/>
found.  This box was created by one of the younger<br/>
Birds of a Feather flock, and it was a cool box. <br/>
Scarcely a word to the clues, but oh so clever!  Silly<br/>
me - I had a preconceived idea of what the stamp was<br/>
going to be, so it took me a minute or two to finally<br/>
figure out why it was named what it was.  DUHHHH!  The<br/>
other DUH thing I did was to grab the wrong stamp out<br/>
of our kit, so I got to the box and went to stamp in,<br/>
only to find that I had my son's stamp instead.  I<br/>
stamped in anyway, and made a note to the effect that<br/>
it was me stamping in disguise.  I'll probably get<br/>
back there fairly soon and be able to stamp in<br/>
properly.  I'm going to chalk that up to being<br/>
disturbed in the middle of the night!<br/>
<br/>
The other box in the park was Texas RR by Silver<br/>
Eagle.  It had been reported missing by Birds of a<br/>
Feather, but since I had previously found that box and<br/>
knew exactly where it was, I decided to check in on it<br/>
anyway.  It doesn't look good - I couldn't find it<br/>
either.  There had been a lot of disturbance in the<br/>
area.  I'm going to report what I found to Silver<br/>
Eagle so he can do what he wants about it, so check<br/>
the clues before you go hunting for it!<br/>
