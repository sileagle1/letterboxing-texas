the stamps, pick the great places and hide the boxes, I just want to <br/>

This whole situation seems like it would be very frustrating - I guess <br/>
I'm getting a picture of what to look forward to when I finally plant <br/>
a box - but it is also very eye - opening for us newbies.  I didn't <br/>
realize as I first started this venture that things like carrying <br/>
baggies and extra logbooks were important, but I have seen a few boxes <br/>
that seem to need immediate help. It feels good to be able to do <br/>
something nice for someone that has taken the time to create such a <br/>
fun hobby for so many others!!!<br/>
