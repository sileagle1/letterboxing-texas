Your response is anonymous.  I am okay with any outcome, so feel free<br/>
to vote how you really feel.  As I said, we can revisit it in 6<br/>
months, a year or never.<br/>
<br/>
If we get to what I think is a viable number of yeses, I'll go ahead<br/>
and start the group.  In that event, everyone is welcome to join.  We<br/>
can start by discussing the Sweet Treats mini gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
If anyone has suggestions as to a good name, would love to hear it. <br/>
Houstonboxers seems too limiting and the SETex boxers hardly rolls off<br/>
the tongue, but it may be the best fit!<br/>
