                    <html><body><div>Well, I have planted another box. That's two now. I'm on a roll. You may view the clue at the following:</div> <div> </div> <div><a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=25839">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/clue/index.html?gBoxId=25839</a></div> <div> </div> <div>Does it ever become blase' posting the clue. I have a million butterflies jumping in my stomach right now. </div> <div> </div> <div>It was a gorgeous day in the metroplex today (well for y'all it was yesterday). Perfect day for letterboxing. Unfortunately we got a late start and only had time to plant the one box. But, I've got two clues printed and when I find an extra hour this week, I'm going. Even if I have to go by myself. They can hear the great stories I'll have to tell.</div> <div> </div> <div>I planted the box that was at the gathering. A Color of His Own. Is that okay to do it that way? Do I need to post a separate plant for everyone who found it
 at the GBA? I'm still so new that my learning curve is still shooting towards the stars.</div> <div> </div> <div>I also just realized tonight that I hadn't posted any of my finds for the gathering yet. I guess for me it's the adventure that draws me. I'm so silly.</div> <div> </div> <div>Y'all have a great week. I hope to see most of you on Saturday.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Bedford</div><p>
