                    <html><body><p>Okay, I'm still freaking out over this, so I just had to share this story with you - my friends.<br/><br/>In the last few months, I've lived a horribly boring life, trying only to keep up, not hoping to get ahead. My schedule has sucked up my leisure time. Life has gotten bigger than I am. I'm not unique or unusual - this happens to most of us from time to time. I hate it though, because I spend too much time with my nose to the grindstone and not enough time with my head up living life. One thing I know - this too shall pass, IF I don't continue to take on more things than I can manage. I guess I sound whiney, but I don't mean to. I really am enjoying the things I'm doing, it's just that I'm not getting to choose to do other things I enjoy and that bums me out. <br/>
<br/>So anyway, when I get myself into this predicament, I don't sleep quite as well or soundly as I do when I am in control of things. In recent weeks, I've thought I have heard whispers in the night. Just little hints of night noises that WEREN'T ghosts or bears or clowns or cajuns or hispanic shadows. <br/>
<br/>Having lived in the same house for the last 16 years, I know its noises, know the life of the house. When I hear things, I can tell if it's just the old house creaking, or if a kid is trying to be sneaky. I know if someone is making a mid-night trip to the bathroom or raiding the refrigerator or lulling themselves back to sleep in front of the TV. I can tell from behind my eyelids and beneath my covers if it is getting close to daylight or if it is deep night. If it's getting colder outside or maybe warming up. I know my home like I know myself, and I knew the shush-shushes weren't right, but I couldn't quite put my finger on them. <br/>
<br/>I got used to the noises and decided perhaps the house was evolving, settling a little bit more on its 60 year old frame. We have, after all, begun to take it apart bit by bit in the last year to revamp it to a new face, so maybe we were affecting its zen balance - it was coming un feng-shui'd. In the back of my mind, I began to realize that the night sounds were
something like when we had squirrels in the attic, except that it
wasn't like a perpetual nocturnal party going on - squirrels are rude
house guests. The sounds never took shape, so I let them rest in my subconscious. Until about three weeks ago.<br/><br/>I got up sometime in the middle of the night to get a drink of water. My long-time habit is to reach in and turn on the light before I step into the room I am entering. I've done this since I was a child, presumably so I could turn and run in case I encounter something disturbing. I've never been one to watch scary movies, so who knows where this silly idea came from. Anyway, out of habit, I reached in and turned on the light - and saw a shadow dart across the floor from beneath my kitchen table to my microwave stand, and then to my cabinets and down the length of them until I could no longer see it. That I saw it at all was a miracle - I don't put my contacts in when I get up in the middle of the night, so everything is shadowy. It made my heart speed up, but I chose to ignore it, get a drink of water, and go back to bed to eventually go back to sleep.<br/>
<br/>Choosing to hope that it was an isolated incident or a myopic figment of my imagination, I decided to deal with it by making noise before entering the kitchen during the night. If I didn't see anything, there wasn't anything there, right? Well...nice theory.<br/>
<br/>About two weeks ago, I saw it again (I choose to believe it was the exact same one). Virtually the same pattern. That day I went to Walmart and got some sticky traps, thinking they would be better than snapping its head off or risking poisoning it and then having the cats eat it, or worse, having Trail Whale discover a forgotten poison packet as he grazes from the floor (he's TWO - what do you expect?). I set the traps out and went happily about my way, leaving them out as we went camping Thanksgiving weekend. I was confident we would come home to find one of those little traps with a tiny little mouse stuck to it. <br/>
<br/>The traps disappeared. I eventually found three of the four devoid of even so much as a mouse hair, but the fourth remains at large to this moment. This caused alarm bells to go off, but my hope was that we were dealing with a smart tiny mouse (singular) and it would get the idea we didn't want it around and just leave. It had, after all, been courteous enough NOT to run across my foot and it hadn't as yet eaten into anything as far as we knew. Fearless Fox, meanwhile, was no help whatsoever. He declared me insane, swearing I was seeing things and cutting me off from any nighttime meds I might take for cough, cold, whatever. After all, he roams the house a lot more than I do at night and he hadn't seen a thing.<br/>
<br/>So - two nights ago, I got up to go to the bathroom and once again reached into the room to turn on the light before I entered. Before I continue, you have to keep in mind that our bathroom is completely torn apart (STILL, for those
of you who might keep track of our home improvement projects), so the
framing of the walls is exposed and provides prime climbing fodder for
anything that chooses to use it as such. As I paused before entering, just as the light brightened to illuminate the room, a shadow JUMPED and glided down from above my shoulder and scurried across the floor to behind the hot water heater. Suddenly, it became perfectly logical to me that I not enter a room until I could see into it! What if I had walked in BEFORE turning the light on? That THING might have jumped to my shoulder and gotten tangled in my hair instead! Problem was, the hot water heater is by the commode, and I still really need to go despite the fact that by all rights I should have peed all over myself after the gliding, jumping monster showed himself. At that odd moment, I found a bit of pride in the fact that I still had to go. But this is probably TMI for many, if not all, of you. Anyway, I summoned up the courage to proceed, one near-sighted eye on the hot water heater and the other on the door.<br/>
<br/>Not knowing what else to do, most definitely NOT sleepy anymore, I woke Fearless Fox up and warned him to watch out for flying creatures in the bathroom. I heard Lightning get up to go, and I called him into our room so I could warn him of the same. I got the same response from both of them - roughly translated as "whatever."<br/>
<br/>As I lay there awake, I thought more about the encounter. It was most certainly NOT a mouse, so I had to adjust my thinking. Either what I had seen before was not a tiny mouse, or we had TWO night creatures. Suddenly, the mouse ceased to be a benign annoyance and became an ominous threat. I swore I felt him crawling on my quilt, coming to get me for disturbing his night ramblings, and I turned my light on several times before I talked myself out of that delusion. <br/>
<br/>I reasoned that perhaps one of the cats had gotten into the house and I had startled it and it had pounced and run away. Thing is, when our cats are indoors, the most activity I can expect from them is for them to turn over and push against my legs as I try to reclaim some of my side of the bed from them. And if they were startled, it would have only been that they were surprised a feeding opportunity presented itself in the middle of the night, and they would have run to me instead of away. The cat theory seemed highly unlikely.<br/>
<br/>I tried to account for my lack of visual acuity at night and my surprise to convince myself it wasn't nearly as large as it had seemed, so I finally reconciled it to be roughly the size of a raccoon. A great - gliding - indoor - raccoon? Made sense to me. Had to be a raccoon! Still though, I couldn't justify having a raccoon infestation any more than I could accept having a mouse in the house. I've seen the damage they can do to a campsite, and my house is just one big campsite. <br/>
<br/>I eventually went back to sleep, and woke a few short hours later, with the flying raccoon still on my mind. I decided that if a cat is good enough to catch a mouse, maybe it would be good enough to catch a raccoon. Besides, I had cats on hand. I didn't have raccoon bait. As I got ready for work, I sat down with the cats and had a pep talk with them. Explained to them how proud I was this summer of the way they consistently brought us gifts of snakes, moles, gophers, mice (OUTDOOR mice), birds, and whatever other once living creatures they could catch and kill and bring to the porch or in to the kitchen. I praised their predatory skills and explained that they were now being called upon to come to the aid of the family. I told them I was deeming them to be guerilla warriors, urban soldiers. Stinky seemed most concerned that we not disturb her beauty sleep on our bed. Delilah seemed to say "I don't do raccoons." I was resting my hope on a pretty shaky army of two. Two felines. Two well-fed felines. I got snap traps at Walmart before I came home last night.<br/>
<br/>Fearless Fox and Lightning were both still very skeptical about mice, rats, or raccoons in the house. Surely they would have noticed something, right? So I took a lot of haranguing from Fearless Fox as I selected armament at Walmart. I picked up a four pack of small snap traps, but I was skeptical as I thought of the disappearing sticky traps. For the same price as the four, I could purchase a single large snap trap. At that moment, I decided to assume we had a tiny mouse in the kitchen and a raccoon in the bathroom. One four pack and one very large snap trap. I got home and armed the traps right before I went to bed. <br/>
<br/>I awoke some time around 1:30, the time of the raccoon incident the night before, and I wondered if the coon was roaming the bathroom as I lay awake. I listened carefully but heard nothing. Some time around 2:30, Fearless Fox woke me up to tell me he had heard one of my traps spring. He urged me to get up and check it, but knowing I wouldn't be able to see much anyway because I had taken my contacts out, I opted not to. Finally, he couldn't stand it and got up and looked himself. The problem was he had not seen where I finally set the trap, so when he saw it under the hot water heater, he thought I had put it there. It looked to be sprung, but the trap bar was flat against the trap, so he thought it had misfired.<br/>
<br/>I got up bright and early and took Lightning to the school. I went home and opted not to check the traps - not caring to have to do the cleanup so early in the morning. Finally, once daylight drifted in the windows and I had my contacts in and a couple of cups of coffees sucked down, I checked all the little ones and found two of them had sprung but caught nothing. Lastly, I checked the one in the bathroom, and sure enough it had been sprung, but it looked empty. I went to fish it out from under the hot water heater with a broom, and found that it had very effectively caught a pretty good-sized RAT! And it had squeezed its neck down to nothing, so that the trap WAS flat. Wow. I'd hate to get caught that way. That'd suck! Still though, I thought I could see a little smile on his face - a smirk.<br/>
<br/>I woke Fearless Fox up so I could gloat over the rat/raccoon. I thought he would be glad to dispose of it out since he had made so much fun of me. He admired the size of the rat (roughly 14" from tip of the tail to its nose, although we debated whether the flattened neck would make it longer, or if the crease in its neck would shorten it), but declined to do the cleanup detail. I decided Lightning should certainly have to look at it too since he had been skeptical of me. In the end, disposition of the body was a joint effort and as I saw the rat into the trash, my last thought was that the tail was so long, that if he had jumped on me night before last instead of jumping past me, he could have wrapped that tail around my neck and choked me to death - boy, was I ever lucky I had turned the light on before walking into the room!<br/>
<br/>I realize now he was probably smirking over the fact that he
decimated my sticky traps. I could just see him accidentally stepping
on one, then walking away, trying to shake it off his foot, until
finally he was able to fling it away, then repeating the process with
the others just because he could. And with the same arrogant attitude,
tripping my small snap traps too. He probably approached the big trap brazenly, expecting to make a mockery of my diligence in destruction, only to get caught by his own cavalier attitude. Did I defeat him, or did he defeat himself?<br/>
<br/>This rat debacle - it's the most interesting thing that's happened to me in months!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

I will never recommend poison because it leaves you with a dead rat in the wall stinking up your house until all the flesh has been eaten away by the bugs. So disgusting! </div>
<div>I feel for you I really do. I woke one night to a rat crawling on my covers over my leg. And once going to the bathroom late at night one scurried out and down the hall and into the living room where I'm sure it ducked into the wall. Old houses have plenty of creepy holes for some reason. </div>
<div>This was the last straw for me. I was pregnant and I refused to have a baby in a house of dirty rats. We moved about 7 times before I had my first daughter just so we could get away from the rats and have a new house built. Now we live in a farm area and my new problem are small gray mice in the garage. Lucky for me the garage isn't attached to the house or I would be packing it up again. Though we do have all sorts of wild things coming into the yard the dog seems to be cat like in killing and presenting us with rats and mice and possums. </div>
<div>I'm sorry but one rat means more rats can easily get in, if they aren't already in. Traps are the way to go. Keep them baited and check them regularly.</div>

<div>We had big rats in our old house. We used poison... I will never 
  recommend poison because it leaves you with a dead rat in the wall stinking up 
  your house until all the flesh has been eaten away by the bugs. So disgusting! 
  </div>
<div>I feel for you I really do. I woke one night to a rat crawling on my 
  covers over my leg. And once going to the bathroom late at night one scurried 
  out and down the hall and into the living room where I'm sure it ducked into 
  the wall. Old houses have plenty of creepy holes for some reason. </div>
<div>This was the last straw for me. I was pregnant and I refused to have a 
  baby in a house of dirty rats. We moved about 7 times before I had my 
  first daughter just so we could get away from the rats and have a new 
  house built. Now we live in a farm area and my new problem are small gray mice 
  in the garage. Lucky for me the garage isn't attached to the house or I would 
  be packing it up again. Though we do have all sorts of wild things coming into 
  the yard the dog seems to be cat like in killing and presenting us with rats 
  and mice and possums. </div>
<div>I'm sorry but one rat means more rats can easily get in, if they aren't 
  already in. Traps are the way to go. Keep them baited and check them 
  regularly.</div>

  [letterboxingtexas] Flying Raccoons-Long, Non-letterboxing 
  Story<br/><br/><span> </span>
<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>Okay, I'm still freaking out over this, so I just had to share this story 
  with you - my friends.<br/><br/>In the last few months, I've lived a horribly 
  boring life, trying only to keep up, not hoping to get ahead.  My 
  schedule has sucked up my leisure time.  Life has gotten bigger than I 
  am.  I'm not unique or unusual - this happens to most of us from time to 
  time.  I hate it though, because I spend too much time with my nose to 
  the grindstone and not enough time with my head up living life.  One 
  thing I know - this too shall pass, IF I don't continue to take on more things 
  than I can manage.  I guess I sound whiney, but I don't mean to.  I 
  really am enjoying the things I'm doing, it's just that I'm not getting to 
  choose to do other things I enjoy and that bums me out.  <br/><br/>So 
  anyway, when I get myself into this predicament, I don't sleep quite as well 
  or soundly as I do when I am in control of things.  In recent weeks, I've 
  thought I have heard whispers in the night.  Just little hints of night 
  noises that WEREN'T ghosts or bears or clowns or cajuns or hispanic shadows. 
  <br/><br/>Having lived in the same house for the last 16 years, I know its 
  noises, know the life of the house.  When I hear things, I can tell if 
  it's just the old house creaking, or if a kid is trying to be sneaky.  I 
  know if someone is making a mid-night trip to the bathroom or raiding the 
  refrigerator or lulling themselves back to sleep in front of the TV.  I 
  can tell from behind my eyelids and beneath my covers if it is getting close 
  to daylight or if it is deep night.  If it's getting colder outside or 
  maybe warming up.  I know my home like I know myself, and I knew the 
  shush-shushes weren't right, but I couldn't quite put my finger on them.  
  <br/><br/>I got used to the noises and decided perhaps the house was evolving, 
  settling a little bit more on its 60 year old frame.  We have, after all, 
  begun to take it apart bit by bit in the last year to revamp it to a new face, 
  so maybe we were affecting its zen balance - it was coming un 
  feng-shui'd.  In the back of my mind, I began to realize that the night 
  sounds were something like when we had squirrels in the attic, except that it 
  wasn't like a perpetual nocturnal party going on - squirrels are rude house 
  guests. The sounds never took shape, so I let them rest in my 
  subconscious.  Until about three weeks ago.<br/><br/>I got up sometime in 
  the middle of the night to get a drink of water.  My long-time habit is 
  to reach in and turn on the light before I step into the room I am 
  entering.  I've done this since I was a child, presumably so I could turn 
  and run in case I encounter something disturbing.  I've never been one to 
  watch scary movies, so who knows where this silly idea came from.  
  Anyway, out of habit, I reached in and turned on the light - and saw a shadow 
  dart across the floor from beneath my kitchen table to my microwave stand, and 
  then to my cabinets and down the length of them until I could no longer see 
  it.  That I saw it at all was a miracle - I don't put my contacts in when 
  I get up in the middle of the night, so everything is shadowy.  It made 
  my heart speed up, but I chose to ignore it, get a drink of water, and go back 
  to bed to eventually go back to sleep.<br/><br/>Choosing to hope that it was an 
  isolated incident or a myopic figment of my imagination, I decided to deal 
  with it by making noise before entering the kitchen during the night.  If 
  I didn't see anything, there wasn't anything there, right?  Well...nice 
  theory.<br/><br/>About two weeks ago, I saw it again (I choose to believe it was 
  the exact same one).  Virtually the same pattern.  That day I went 
  to Walmart and got some sticky traps, thinking they would be better than 
  snapping its head off or risking poisoning it and then having the cats eat it, 
  or worse, having Trail Whale discover a forgotten poison packet as he grazes 
  from the floor (he's TWO - what do you expect?).  I set the traps out and 
  went happily about my way, leaving them out as we went camping Thanksgiving 
  weekend.  I was confident we would come home to find one of those little 
  traps with a tiny little mouse stuck to it.  <br/><br/>The traps 
  disappeared.  I eventually found three of the four devoid of even so much 
  as a mouse hair, but the fourth remains at large to this moment.  This 
  caused alarm bells to go off, but my hope was that we were dealing with a 
  smart tiny mouse (singular) and it would get the idea we didn't want it around 
  and just leave.  It had, after all, been courteous enough NOT to run 
  across my foot and it hadn't as yet eaten into anything as far as we 
  knew.  Fearless Fox, meanwhile, was no help whatsoever.  He declared 
  me insane, swearing I was seeing things and cutting me off from any nighttime 
  meds I might take for cough, cold, whatever.  After all, he roams the 
  house a lot more than I do at night and he hadn't seen a thing.<br/><br/>So - 
  two nights ago, I got up to go to the bathroom and once again reached into the 
  room to turn on the light before I entered.  Before I continue, you have 
  to keep in mind that our bathroom is completely torn apart (STILL, for those 
  of you who might keep track of our home improvement projects), so the framing 
  of the walls is exposed and provides prime climbing fodder for anything that 
  chooses to use it as such. As I paused before entering, just as the light 
  brightened to illuminate the room, a shadow JUMPED and glided down from above 
  my shoulder and scurried across the floor to behind the hot water 
  heater.  Suddenly, it became perfectly logical to me that I not enter a 
  room until I could see into it!  What if I had walked in BEFORE turning 
  the light on?  That THING might have jumped to my shoulder and gotten 
  tangled in my hair instead!  Problem was, the hot water heater is by the 
  commode, and I still really need to go despite the fact that by all rights I 
  should have peed all over myself after the gliding, jumping monster showed 
  himself.  At that odd moment, I found a bit of pride in the fact that I 
  still had to go.  But this is probably TMI for many, if not all, of 
  you.  Anyway, I summoned up the courage to proceed, one near-sighted eye 
  on the hot water heater and the other on the door.<br/><br/>Not knowing what 
  else to do, most definitely NOT sleepy anymore, I woke Fearless Fox up and 
  warned him to watch out for flying creatures in the bathroom.  I heard 
  Lightning get up to go, and I called him into our room so I could warn him of 
  the same.  I got the same response from both of them - roughly translated 
  as "whatever."<br/><br/>As I lay there awake, I thought more about the 
  encounter.  It was most certainly NOT a mouse, so I had to adjust my 
  thinking.  Either what I had seen before was not a tiny mouse, or we had 
  TWO night creatures.  Suddenly, the mouse ceased to be a benign annoyance 
  and became an ominous threat.  I swore I felt him crawling on my quilt, 
  coming to get me for disturbing his night ramblings, and I turned my light on 
  several times before I talked myself out of that delusion.  <br/><br/>I 
  reasoned that perhaps one of the cats had gotten into the house and I had 
  startled it and it had pounced and run away.  Thing is, when our cats are 
  indoors, the most activity I can expect from them is for them to turn over and 
  push against my legs as I try to reclaim some of my side of the bed from 
  them.  And if they were startled, it would have only been that they were 
  surprised a feeding opportunity presented itself in the middle of the night, 
  and they would have run to me instead of away.  The cat theory seemed 
  highly unlikely.<br/><br/>I tried to account for my lack of visual acuity at 
  night and my surprise to convince myself it wasn't nearly as large as it had 
  seemed, so I finally reconciled it to be roughly the size of a raccoon.  
  A great - gliding - indoor - raccoon?  Made sense to me.  Had to be 
  a raccoon!  Still though, I couldn't justify having a raccoon infestation 
  any more than I could accept having a mouse in the house.  I've seen the 
  damage they can do to a campsite, and my house is just one big campsite.  
  <br/><br/>I eventually went back to sleep, and woke a few short hours later, 
  with the flying raccoon still on my mind.  I decided that if a cat is 
  good enough to catch a mouse, maybe it would be good enough to catch a 
  raccoon.  Besides, I had cats on hand.  I didn't have raccoon 
  bait.  As I got ready for work, I sat down with the cats and had a pep 
  talk with them.  Explained to them how proud I was this summer of the way 
  they consistently brought us gifts of snakes, moles, gophers, mice (OUTDOOR 
  mice), birds, and whatever other once living creatures they could catch and 
  kill and bring to the porch or in to the kitchen.  I praised their 
  predatory skills and explained that they were now being called upon to come to 
  the aid of the family.  I told them I was deeming them to be guerilla 
  warriors, urban soldiers.  Stinky seemed most concerned that we not 
  disturb her beauty sleep on our bed.  Delilah seemed to say "I don't do 
  raccoons."  I was resting my hope on a pretty shaky army of two.  
  Two felines.  Two well-fed felines.  I got snap traps at Walmart 
  before I came home last night.<br/><br/>Fearless Fox and Lightning were both 
  still very skeptical about mice, rats, or raccoons in the house.  Surely 
  they would have noticed something, right?  So I took a lot of haranguing 
  from Fearless Fox as I selected armament at Walmart.  I picked up a four 
  pack of small snap traps, but I was skeptical as I thought of the disappearing 
  sticky traps.  For the same price as the four, I could purchase a single 
  large snap trap.  At that moment, I decided to assume we had a tiny mouse 
  in the kitchen and a raccoon in the bathroom.  One four pack and one very 
  large snap trap.  I got home and armed the traps right before I went to 
  bed.  <br/><br/>I awoke some time around 1:30, the time of the raccoon 
  incident the night before, and I wondered if the coon was roaming the bathroom 
  as I lay awake.  I listened carefully but heard nothing.  Some time 
  around 2:30, Fearless Fox woke me up to tell me he had heard one of my traps 
  spring.  He urged me to get up and check it, but knowing I wouldn't be 
  able to see much anyway because I had taken my contacts out, I opted not 
  to.  Finally, he couldn't stand it and got up and looked himself.  
  The problem was he had not seen where I finally set the trap, so when he saw 
  it under the hot water heater, he thought I had put it there.  It looked 
  to be sprung, but the trap bar was flat against the trap, so he thought it had 
  misfired.<br/><br/>I got up bright and early and took Lightning to the 
  school.  I went home and opted not to check the traps - not caring to 
  have to do the cleanup so early in the morning.  Finally, once daylight 
  drifted in the windows and I had my contacts in and a couple of cups of 
  coffees sucked down, I checked all the little ones and found two of them had 
  sprung but caught nothing.  Lastly, I checked the one in the bathroom, 
  and sure enough it had been sprung, but it looked empty.  I went to fish 
  it out from under the hot water heater with a broom, and found that it had 
  very effectively caught a pretty good-sized RAT!  And it had squeezed its 
  neck down to nothing, so that the trap WAS flat.  Wow.  I'd hate to 
  get caught that way.  That'd suck!  Still though, I thought I could 
  see a little smile on his face - a smirk.<br/><br/>I woke Fearless Fox up so I 
  could gloat over the rat/raccoon.  I thought he would be glad to dispose 
  of it out since he had made so much fun of me.  He admired the size of 
  the rat (roughly 14" from tip of the tail to its nose, although we debated 
  whether the flattened neck would make it longer, or if the crease in its neck 
  would shorten it), but declined to do the cleanup detail.  I decided 
  Lightning should certainly have to look at it too since he had been skeptical 
  of me.  In the end, disposition of the body was a joint effort and as I 
  saw the rat into the trash, my last thought was that the tail was so long, 
  that if he had jumped on me night before last instead of jumping past me, he 
  could have wrapped that tail around my neck and choked me to death - boy, was 
  I ever lucky I had turned the light on before walking into the room!<br/><br/>I 
  realize now he was probably smirking over the fact that he decimated my sticky 
  traps.  I could just see him accidentally stepping on one, then walking 
  away, trying to shake it off his foot, until finally he was able to fling it 
  away, then repeating the process with the others just because he could.  
  And with the same arrogant attitude, tripping my small snap traps too.  
  He probably approached the big trap brazenly, expecting to make a mockery of 
  my diligence in destruction, only to get caught by his own cavalier 
  attitude.  Did I defeat him, or did he defeat himself?<br/><br/>This rat 
  debacle - it's the most interesting thing that's happened to me in 
  months!<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's
