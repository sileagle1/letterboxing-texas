1. Bring insect spray!<br/>
2. Many of the boxes I found Saturday were laying out in the open, <br/>
including my own.  I have changed my clues a little (as now buried box <br/>
at base of the small tree).  <br/>
3.  This park will flood if we get heavy rain, so if box is permanent <br/>
you may want to make sure it is on high ground.  Mr. Bones is in area <br/>
that is often a swamp in spring time.<br/>
<br/>
Great Stamps by all.  I had a great time running around the park <br/>
finding all your boxes.  Thanks, and see y'all Saturday!!!<br/>
