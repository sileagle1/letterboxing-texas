<p>Hi all! With the coming of spring, the Webmasters at LbNA are seeing lots of notes with questions about missing boxes and retired letterbox clues. Here's a brief note about how to manage your own retired and missing letterbox clues.<br/>
<br/>
The LbNA FAQ on the topic says:<br/>
I had to remove my actual letterbox. Can I delete my clues? <br/>
You have the option of archiving your letterbox or deleting it completely. Archiving it removes it from the standard letterbox lists, but you can still see it in grey in your list of letterboxes in Member Services and in the LbNA Basement. You can activate one of your archived letterboxes from the same list later. To delete the letterbox, click archive then click the link to delete the box.<br/>
<br/>
So the best thing to do with a retired letterbox clue is to "archive" it into the LbNA Basement. That way the clues still stay in your account for future reference, and other boxers who have logged it as "found" still keep their count.<br/>
<br/>
There are some folks that put the word "retired" into the clue title (or the body of the clues) instead of archiving the box. This does work, but the preferred method is to archive the clue.<br/>
<br/>
If you search for a letterbox and are convinced that it is missing, the first things to do are to use the "contact the placer" button to let them know, plus mark the box as attempted in the box status area. If you don't receive a reply from the placer, please feel free to contact the LbNA Webmasters (webmasters-lbna at yahoogroups dot com) and we will be glad to help.<br/>
<br/>
Happy boxing, Jay in CT<br/>

&gt; We will be automatically archiving boxes by inactive boxers that have such<br/>
&gt; notes, but we will be giving active boxers the opportunity to either archive<br/>
&gt; their own, tell us to go ahead and archive, or tell us "leave my box<br/>
&gt; alone!".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The challenge in this project is - we have to look at the clues for every<br/>
&gt; box that has key words in it, because sometimes (as in the case of at least<br/>
&gt; one of BootsTex' boxes) the word "retired" is used in reference to a person<br/>
&gt; who retired from their trade.  We don't want to retire Boots' box because he<br/>
&gt; has written about a retired guy!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The reward of this project is getting the database cleaned up a bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, if you have boxes you need to archive, take an opportunity to go<br/>
&gt; ahead and do it and save our fingers and eyes!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks,<br/>
&gt; Lucy<br/>

&gt; Subject: [LbNA] Letterbox Basement How-To<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi all! With the coming of spring, the Webmasters at LbNA are seeing lots of<br/>
&gt; notes with questions about missing boxes and retired letterbox clues. Here's<br/>
&gt; a brief note about how to manage your own retired and missing letterbox<br/>
&gt; clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The LbNA FAQ on the topic says:<br/>
&gt; I had to remove my actual letterbox. Can I delete my clues?<br/>
&gt; You have the option of archiving your letterbox or deleting it completely.<br/>
&gt; Archiving it removes it from the standard letterbox lists, but you can still<br/>
&gt; see it in grey in your list of letterboxes in Member Services and in the<br/>
&gt; LbNA Basement. You can activate one of your archived letterboxes from the<br/>
&gt; same list later. To delete the letterbox, click archive then click the link<br/>
&gt; to delete the box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the best thing to do with a retired letterbox clue is to "archive" it<br/>
&gt; into the LbNA Basement. That way the clues still stay in your account for<br/>
&gt; future reference, and other boxers who have logged it as "found" still keep<br/>
&gt; their count.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are some folks that put the word "retired" into the clue title (or the<br/>
&gt; body of the clues) instead of archiving the box. This does work, but the<br/>
&gt; preferred method is to archive the clue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you search for a letterbox and are convinced that it is missing, the<br/>
&gt; first things to do are to use the "contact the placer" button to let them<br/>
&gt; know, plus mark the box as attempted in the box status area. If you don't<br/>
&gt; receive a reply from the placer, please feel free to contact the LbNA<br/>
&gt; Webmasters (webmasters-lbna at yahoogroups dot com) and we will be glad to<br/>
&gt; help.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy boxing, Jay in CT<br/>
