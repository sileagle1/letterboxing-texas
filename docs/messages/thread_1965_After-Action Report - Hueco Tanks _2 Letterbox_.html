After Action Report - Hueco Tanks Letterbox #2. <br/>
<br/>
This message is the second part of the continuing story of our search and<br/>
recovery efforts for the Letterboxes known as Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks<br/>
#2. <br/>
<br/>
To recap the previous operation, my wife (Dane Lady) and I applied for and<br/>
were granted permission, and enlisted the help of a park guide to search for<br/>
both Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks #2 Letterboxes.  We successfully<br/>
recovered Hueco Tanks #1 at N 31 55.195 W 106 02.910.  The letterbox was<br/>
removed to be given to the park superintendent. <br/>
<br/>
With the clues for Hueco Tanks #2 in hand, the guide and I did a whirlwind<br/>
recon of most of Hueco Tanks North Mountain.  Dane Lady did her best not to<br/>
slow us down too much.  We identified and did a fast scan of several<br/>
promising areas.  We did not recover Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did<br/>
identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to concentrate on.  This operation<br/>
all but did my wife in.  She is a real trooper, but not up to that kind of<br/>
strenuous recon activity.  I on the other hand loved it! <br/>
<br/>
After discussion through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the clues<br/>
and I was granted permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco Tanks #2<br/>
on my own, within the park rules of course.  At that time I was also offered<br/>
the opportunity to repair Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be<br/>
Determined later) in the park.  This is great news.  It may be difficult to<br/>
find a good hiding place that will be approved.  But one thing is certain.<br/>
It will not happen without trying.  My ranger-friend Danny Lee says it<br/>
should work out.  I am hopeful and will continue to press forward on this as<br/>
time permits. <br/>
<br/>
The original Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape.  The original<br/>
logbook is ruined.  The plastic container is crumbling.  I intend to make a<br/>
new stamp in the image of what I believe the original stamp was intended to<br/>
be.  I also intend to re-mount the original stamp and leave it in the<br/>
Letterbox.  And I have a good supply of ammo cans.  One small one will be<br/>
painted to match the approved location.  Ammo cans last forever. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows I am also a Geocacher.  All my letterbox hides to date are<br/>
Letterbox Hybrid Geocaches.  I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a<br/>
Letterbox exclusively.  I am not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers<br/>
searching for the box.  A few respectful Letterboxers will be enough.   The<br/>
park must be protected first and fore-most.  I may request to place a<br/>
Geocache out there in the future.  But that is beyond the scope of this<br/>
report. <br/>

Clues HUECO TANKS LETTERBOX #2 <br/>
<br/>
If one climbs the south side of North Mountain; follows one of the easy<br/>
routes at the end of the paved road (all 5.4 to 5.6 stuff) they lead to a<br/>
large amphitheatre that has a huge oak in it. The amphitheatre is accessible<br/>
from all directions. In a hueco (natural hole-as is the area) 14 paces from<br/>
the old oak is a box covered by a rock. <br/>
<br/>
Note: access to this area requires some rock climbing. <br/>

************************* <br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, 24 June 2006, a second attempt was mounted to locate the<br/>
Letterbox known as Hueco Tanks #2.  This attempt was made with the help of<br/>
my son James (Army Scout) who was home on leave from the Army.  We hit the<br/>
gate as early as was possible.  After his orientation briefing, we were on<br/>
the trail.  My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked us to keep a watch for sign of<br/>
some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park.  We promised to do so. <br/>
<br/>
To get to the locations I GPS-waypointed on the last mission required us to<br/>
hike over North Mountain.  Although the primary point of interest was lower<br/>
on the south end of the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is<br/>
closed, open only to guided hiking.  We were unguided on this mission, so<br/>
our approach was limited.  The western approach is nearly a shear cliff.<br/>
Not impossible, but certainly more dangerous.  Crossing the mountain was the<br/>
safest allowed approach.  And so we did.  I thoroughly enjoyed that hike.<br/>
We were out early and only had to share the mountain with a pair of foxes,<br/>
some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of lizards.  The sky was<br/>
lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool.  Cool for summer in El Paso<br/>
anyway.  The mission was ahead of us.  We were optimistic.  We had proper<br/>
gear and equipment.  We were on the hunt.  Two warriors headed out to do<br/>
what they do best.  Life doesn't get better than this!  I was loving it.<br/>
W.E.T.S.U.  <grin> <br/>
<br/>
While we were hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with<br/>
sheep droppings.  I GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few.  The<br/>
first location was at N 31 55.340 W 106 02.783.  But soon it was obvious<br/>
that the droppings were not difficult to find.  So I stopped marking and<br/>
photographing. <br/>
<br/>
James and I arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco Tanks #2<br/>
within an hour of hiking.  It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a<br/>
large oak tree on the south west end of the mountain.   It is located at N<br/>
31 55.242 W 106 02.860.  We set out a safety rope, and James went down.  I<br/>
lowered our gear to James, then followed.  James - being a Cavalry scout,<br/>
always seems to take point.  As I was climbing down he remarked that this<br/>
secluded hole was full of sheep droppings.  I got to the bottom and we began<br/>
our search. <br/>
<br/>
For about 1.5 hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice.  We<br/>
found two very promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks<br/>
covering the holes in the east wall north of the tree.  One hole was empty.<br/>
The second had broken glass in it.  Neither had anything resembling a<br/>
letterbox inside.  In the process of searching for the letterbox we filled<br/>
two shopping bags with trash.  After exhausting every possibility, I climbed<br/>
out, pulled our gear up, and threw the rope down for James to get out.  I<br/>
enjoyed every minute in that spot.  But I was disappointed we came out<br/>
without the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
The search of the other areas went about like the first.  None was as<br/>
promising as the first.  Some places required us to climb in and out<br/>
carefully.  In order to search many of the likely places we needed to<br/>
carefully look behind the plant life.  Thorns and scratches were the rule of<br/>
the day.  At one point we had to remove our gear and crawl through a series<br/>
of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet dragging behind to get<br/>
to the spot.  Each time we went in hopeful, but came out empty.  After<br/>
nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility.  I was<br/>
not ready to give up.  But there was nothing left to do.  We crawled out and<br/>
shouldered up our gear to start back.  About 200 yards into the return trip<br/>
we realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash.  So we returned to<br/>
collect up the bags. <br/>
<br/>
On the way back, I took James to see some of the rock paintings.  If you<br/>
visit Hueco Tanks State Park - be sure to see these paintings.  They are<br/>
located on North Mountain at N 31 55.422 W 106 02.796.  The coordinates<br/>
will put you at the base of a rock face to your south.  Crawl in the crevice<br/>
at your feet and move west to the large room.  As your eyes adjust to the<br/>
dim light, you will see some of the finest Indian paintings in the park.<br/>
Don't forget your camera. <br/>
<br/>
The return trip was uneventful, almost somber.  We had failed.  Failure is<br/>
not a word we accept easily.  On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with<br/>
my son.  He has grown into a man.  The kind of man I was used to working<br/>
with when I was a hard-charging Sergeant so long ago.  The kind of man you<br/>
want to have by your side when everything else around you is going wrong.<br/>
Cavalry Scout.  Sniper.  Paramedic.  He can use his hands as weapons, and<br/>
his weapons as though they were his hands.  His hands can heal or kill with<br/>
equal skill.  Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line with a warrior like<br/>
this? <br/>
<br/>
By the time you read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone.  But some of<br/>
you will have the opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood.  He will be doing<br/>
some letterboxing, scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in<br/>
late September.  I hope you-all will welcome him to your part of the state. <br/>
<br/>
This concludes the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox.  I will continue to<br/>
work with the park staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a location<br/>
worthy of letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff.  This will<br/>
not happen quickly.  Perhaps by Christmas. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to once again point out that not a word of this report would<br/>
have been possible without the cooperation of the staff at Hueco Tanks state<br/>
Park.  Thank you Rangers!  And it is a shining example of why I believe<br/>
having an open dialog with the park staff about your letterbox is better<br/>
than placing a letterbox secretly and hoping the rangers do not find it. <br/>
<br/>
I also thank Dane Lady and Army scout for participating is parts of this<br/>
adventure.  Having them along made it all the more enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
Last - I will send a final report when Hueco Tanks #1 is repaired and<br/>
replaced.  This has been a great adventure for me.  I would also like to<br/>
thank Silver Eagle for asking me to take on this mission.  I wish the 50-%<br/>
successful report I bring to the list was a 100% successful report.  I can<br/>
only say we did our best. <br/>

&gt; you will have the opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood.  He will be<br/>
doing<br/>
&gt; some letterboxing, scouting out the good ones for me when we visit<br/>
him in<br/>
&gt; late September.  I hope you-all will welcome him to your part of the<br/>
state. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This concludes the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox.  I will<br/>
continue to<br/>
&gt; work with the park staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a<br/>
location<br/>
&gt; worthy of letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff. <br/>
This will<br/>
&gt; not happen quickly.  Perhaps by Christmas. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would like to once again point out that not a word of this report<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; have been possible without the cooperation of the staff at Hueco<br/>
Tanks state<br/>
&gt; Park.  Thank you Rangers!  And it is a shining example of why I believe<br/>
&gt; having an open dialog with the park staff about your letterbox is better<br/>
&gt; than placing a letterbox secretly and hoping the rangers do not find<br/>
it. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also thank Dane Lady and Army scout for participating is parts of this<br/>
&gt; adventure.  Having them along made it all the more enjoyable. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Last - I will send a final report when Hueco Tanks #1 is repaired and<br/>
&gt; replaced.  This has been a great adventure for me.  I would also like to<br/>
&gt; thank Silver Eagle for asking me to take on this mission.  I wish<br/>
the 50-%<br/>
&gt; successful report I bring to the list was a 100% successful report.<br/>
 I can<br/>
&gt; only say we did our best. <br/>

&gt; After Action Report - Hueco Tanks Letterbox #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This message is the second part of the continuing story of our search and<br/>
&gt; recovery efforts for the Letterboxes known as Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco <br/>
&gt; Tanks<br/>
&gt; #2.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To recap the previous operation, my wife (Dane Lady) and I applied for and<br/>
&gt; were granted permission, and enlisted the help of a park guide to <br/>
&gt; search for<br/>
&gt; both Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks #2 Letterboxes. We successfully<br/>
&gt; recovered Hueco Tanks #1 at N 31 55.195 W 106 02.910. The letterbox was<br/>
&gt; removed to be given to the park superintendent.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; With the clues for Hueco Tanks #2 in hand, the guide and I did a whirlwind<br/>
&gt; recon of most of Hueco Tanks North Mountain. Dane Lady did her best not to<br/>
&gt; slow us down too much. We identified and did a fast scan of several<br/>
&gt; promising areas. We did not recover Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did<br/>
&gt; identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to concentrate on. This operation<br/>
&gt; all but did my wife in. She is a real trooper, but not up to that kind of<br/>
&gt; strenuous recon activity. I on the other hand loved it!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; After discussion through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the <br/>
&gt; clues<br/>
&gt; and I was granted permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco <br/>
&gt; Tanks #2<br/>
&gt; on my own, within the park rules of course. At that time I was also <br/>
&gt; offered<br/>
&gt; the opportunity to repair Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be<br/>
&gt; Determined later) in the park. This is great news. It may be difficult to<br/>
&gt; find a good hiding place that will be approved. But one thing is certain.<br/>
&gt; It will not happen without trying. My ranger-friend Danny Lee says it<br/>
&gt; should work out. I am hopeful and will continue to press forward on <br/>
&gt; this as<br/>
&gt; time permits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The original Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape. The original<br/>
&gt; logbook is ruined. The plastic container is crumbling. I intend to make a<br/>
&gt; new stamp in the image of what I believe the original stamp was <br/>
&gt; intended to<br/>
&gt; be. I also intend to re-mount the original stamp and leave it in the<br/>
&gt; Letterbox. And I have a good supply of ammo cans. One small one will be<br/>
&gt; painted to match the approved location. Ammo cans last forever.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Everyone knows I am also a Geocacher. All my letterbox hides to date are<br/>
&gt; Letterbox Hybrid Geocaches. I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a<br/>
&gt; Letterbox exclusively. I am not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers<br/>
&gt; searching for the box. A few respectful Letterboxers will be enough. The<br/>
&gt; park must be protected first and fore-most. I may request to place a<br/>
&gt; Geocache out there in the future. But that is beyond the scope of this<br/>
&gt; report.<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; If one climbs the south side of North Mountain; follows one of the easy<br/>
&gt; routes at the end of the paved road (all 5.4 to 5.6 stuff) they lead to a<br/>
&gt; large amphitheatre that has a huge oak in it. The amphitheatre is <br/>
&gt; accessible<br/>
&gt; from all directions. In a hueco (natural hole-as is the area) 14 paces <br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; the old oak is a box covered by a rock.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Note: access to this area requires some rock climbing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;  Brooks / Devere, 12-28-2000<br/>
&gt; *************************<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On Saturday, 24 June 2006, a second attempt was mounted to locate the<br/>
&gt; Letterbox known as Hueco Tanks #2. This attempt was made with the help of<br/>
&gt; my son James (Army Scout) who was home on leave from the Army. We hit the<br/>
&gt; gate as early as was possible. After his orientation briefing, we were on<br/>
&gt; the trail. My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked us to keep a watch for sign of<br/>
&gt; some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park. We promised to do so.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; To get to the locations I GPS-waypointed on the last mission required <br/>
&gt; us to<br/>
&gt; hike over North Mountain. Although the primary point of interest was lower<br/>
&gt; on the south end of the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is<br/>
&gt; closed, open only to guided hiking. We were unguided on this mission, so<br/>
&gt; our approach was limited. The western approach is nearly a shear cliff.<br/>
&gt; Not impossible, but certainly more dangerous. Crossing the mountain <br/>
&gt; was the<br/>
&gt; safest allowed approach. And so we did. I thoroughly enjoyed that hike.<br/>
&gt; We were out early and only had to share the mountain with a pair of foxes,<br/>
&gt; some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of lizards. The sky was<br/>
&gt; lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool. Cool for summer in El <br/>
&gt; Paso<br/>
&gt; anyway. The mission was ahead of us. We were optimistic. We had proper<br/>
&gt; gear and equipment. We were on the hunt. Two warriors headed out to do<br/>
&gt; what they do best. Life doesn't get better than this! I was loving it.<br/>
&gt; W.E.T.S.U. <grin><br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; While we were hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with<br/>
&gt; sheep droppings. I GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few. The<br/>
&gt; first location was at N 31 55.340 W 106 02.783. But soon it was obvious<br/>
&gt; that the droppings were not difficult to find. So I stopped marking and<br/>
&gt; photographing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; James and I arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco <br/>
&gt; Tanks #2<br/>
&gt; within an hour of hiking. It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a<br/>
&gt; large oak tree on the south west end of the mountain. It is located at N<br/>
&gt; 31 55.242 W 106 02.860. We set out a safety rope, and James went down. I<br/>
&gt; lowered our gear to James, then followed. James - being a Cavalry scout,<br/>
&gt; always seems to take point. As I was climbing down he remarked that this<br/>
&gt; secluded hole was full of sheep droppings. I got to the bottom and we <br/>
&gt; began<br/>
&gt; our search.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; For about 1.5 hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice. We<br/>
&gt; found two very promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks<br/>
&gt; covering the holes in the east wall north of the tree. One hole was empty.<br/>
&gt; The second had broken glass in it. Neither had anything resembling a<br/>
&gt; letterbox inside. In the process of searching for the letterbox we filled<br/>
&gt; two shopping bags with trash. After exhausting every possibility, I <br/>
&gt; climbed<br/>
&gt; out, pulled our gear up, and threw the rope down for James to get out. I<br/>
&gt; enjoyed every minute in that spot. But I was disappointed we came out<br/>
&gt; without the letterbox.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The search of the other areas went about like the first. None was as<br/>
&gt; promising as the first. Some places required us to climb in and out<br/>
&gt; carefully. In order to search many of the likely places we needed to<br/>
&gt; carefully look behind the plant life. Thorns and scratches were the <br/>
&gt; rule of<br/>
&gt; the day. At one point we had to remove our gear and crawl through a series<br/>
&gt; of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet dragging behind <br/>
&gt; to get<br/>
&gt; to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out empty. After<br/>
&gt; nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility. I was<br/>
&gt; not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and<br/>
&gt; shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip<br/>
&gt; we realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to<br/>
&gt; collect up the bags.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; On the way back, I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you<br/>
&gt; visit Hueco Tanks State Park - be sure to see these paintings. They are<br/>
&gt; located on North Mountain at N 31 55.422 W 106 02.796. The coordinates<br/>
&gt; will put you at the base of a rock face to your south. Crawl in the <br/>
&gt; crevice<br/>
&gt; at your feet and move west to the large room. As your eyes adjust to the<br/>
&gt; dim light, you will see some of the finest Indian paintings in the park.<br/>
&gt; Don't forget your camera.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The return trip was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is<br/>
&gt; not a word we accept easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with<br/>
&gt; my son. He has grown into a man. The kind of man I was used to working<br/>
&gt; with when I was a hard-charging Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you<br/>
&gt; want to have by your side when everything else around you is going wrong.<br/>
&gt; Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He can use his hands as weapons, and<br/>
&gt; his weapons as though they were his hands. His hands can heal or kill with<br/>
&gt; equal skill. Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line with a warrior like<br/>
&gt; this?<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; By the time you read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone. But <br/>
&gt; some of<br/>
&gt; you will have the opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood. He will be doing<br/>
&gt; some letterboxing, scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in<br/>
&gt; late September. I hope you-all will welcome him to your part of the <br/>
&gt; state.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; This concludes the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox. I will continue to<br/>
&gt; work with the park staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a <br/>
&gt; location<br/>
&gt; worthy of letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff. This will<br/>
&gt; not happen quickly. Perhaps by Christmas.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I would like to once again point out that not a word of this report would<br/>

<div>Thanks so much for your effort above and beyond to try to find the #2 box, and to rehabilitate the #1.  Thanks too for letting the rest of us observe vicariously through your pictures.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although I realize exactly why you think of your effort as a failure, I think your only failure could have been to do nothing and try nothing, to say "Not my box, not my problem".  What you've done is a good example of how we all have to consider every box our own, whether we are rehiding, or reporting condition to the owner, or doing first aid, or adopting abandoned boxes.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Excellent.  Thank you.</div>

<br/>&gt; rule of<br/>&gt; the day. At one point we had to remove our gear and crawl through a series<br/>&gt; of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet dragging behind<br/>&gt; to get<br/>&gt; to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out empty. After
<br/>&gt; nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility. I was<br/>&gt; not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and<br/>&gt; shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip
<br/>&gt; we realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to<br/>&gt; collect up the bags.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; On the way back, I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you<br/>&gt; visit Hueco Tanks State Park - be sure to see these paintings. They are
<br/>&gt; located on North Mountain at N 31 55.422 W 106 02.796. The coordinates<br/>&gt; will put you at the base of a rock face to your south. Crawl in the<br/>&gt; crevice<br/>&gt; at your feet and move west to the large room. As your eyes adjust to the
<br/>&gt; dim light, you will see some of the finest Indian paintings in the park.<br/>&gt; Don't forget your camera.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; The return trip was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is<br/>&gt; not a word we accept easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with
<br/>&gt; my son. He has grown into a man. The kind of man I was used to working<br/>&gt; with when I was a hard-charging Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you<br/>&gt; want to have by your side when everything else around you is going wrong.
<br/>&gt; Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He can use his hands as weapons, and<br/>&gt; his weapons as though they were his hands. His hands can heal or kill with<br/>&gt; equal skill. Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line with a warrior like
<br/>&gt; this?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; By the time you read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone. But<br/>&gt; some of<br/>&gt; you will have the opportunity to meet him at Fort Hood. He will be doing<br/>&gt; some letterboxing, scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in
<br/>&gt; late September. I hope you-all will welcome him to your part of the<br/>&gt; state.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; This concludes the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox. I will continue to<br/>&gt; work with the park staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a
<br/>&gt; location<br/>&gt; worthy of letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff. This will<br/>&gt; not happen quickly. Perhaps by Christmas.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I would like to once again point out that not a word of this report would
<br/>&gt; have been possible without the cooperation of the staff at Hueco Tanks<br/>&gt; state<br/>&gt; Park. Thank you Rangers! And it is a shining example of why I believe<br/>&gt; having an open dialog with the park staff about your letterbox is better
<br/>&gt; than placing a letterbox secretly and hoping the rangers do not find it.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I also thank Dane Lady and Army scout for participating is parts of this<br/>&gt; adventure. Having them along made it all the more enjoyable.
<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Last - I will send a final report when Hueco Tanks #1 is repaired and<br/>&gt; replaced. This has been a great adventure for me. I would also like to<br/>&gt; thank Silver Eagle for asking me to take on this mission. I wish the 50-%
<br/>&gt; successful report I bring to the list was a 100% successful report. I can<br/>&gt; only say we did our best.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; You can see a slideshow of our adventure. Go to this site:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; <a href="http://www.photoshow.net/KD9KC/adventure">

After Action Report - Hueco Tanks Letterbox #2. <br/>
<br/>
This message is the second part of the continuing story of our search and<br/>
recovery efforts for the Letterboxes known as Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks<br/>
#2. <br/>
<br/>
To recap the previous operation, my wife (Dane Lady) and I applied for and<br/>
were granted permission, and enlisted the help of a park guide to search for<br/>
both Hueco Tanks #1 and Hueco Tanks #2 Letterboxes. We successfully<br/>
recovered Hueco Tanks #1 at N 31 55.195 W 106 02.910. The letterbox was<br/>
removed to be given to the park superintendent. <br/>
<br/>
With the clues for Hueco Tanks #2 in hand, the guide and I did a whirlwind<br/>
recon of most of <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Hueco</st1:placename>
<st1:placename w:st="on">Tanks</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">North</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Mountain</st1:placetype></st1:place>. Dane Lady did
her best not to<br/>
slow us down too much. We identified and did a fast scan of several<br/>
promising areas. We did not recover Hueco Tanks #2 that day, but did<br/>
identify and GPS-waypoint several areas to concentrate on. This operation<br/>
all but did my wife in. She is a real trooper, but not up to that kind of<br/>
strenuous recon activity. I on the other hand loved it! <br/>
<br/>
After discussion through E-mail, the park superintendent reviewed the clues<br/>
and I was granted permission to continue to seek recovery of Hueco Tanks #2<br/>
on my own, within the park rules of course. At that time I was also offered<br/>
the opportunity to repair Hueco Tanks #1 and place it somewhere (To Be<br/>
Determined later) in the park. This is great news. It may be difficult to<br/>
find a good hiding place that will be approved. But one thing is certain.<br/>
It will not happen without trying. My ranger-friend Danny Lee says it<br/>
should work out. I am hopeful and will continue to press forward on this as<br/>
time permits. <br/>
<br/>
The original Hueco Tanks #1 stamp is not in good shape. The original<br/>
logbook is ruined. The plastic container is crumbling. I intend to make a<br/>
new stamp in the image of what I believe the original stamp was intended to<br/>
be. I also intend to re-mount the original stamp and leave it in the<br/>
Letterbox. And I have a good supply of ammo cans. One small one will be<br/>
painted to match the approved location. Ammo cans last forever. <br/>
<br/>
Everyone knows I am also a Geocacher. All my letterbox hides to date are<br/>
Letterbox Hybrid Geocaches. I have decided to keep Hueco Tanks #1 a<br/>
Letterbox exclusively. I am not comfortable having hundreds of Geocachers<br/>
searching for the box. A few respectful Letterboxers will be enough. The<br/>
park must be protected first and fore-most. I may request to place a<br/>
Geocache out there in the future. But that is beyond the scope of this<br/>
report. <br/>

Clues HUECO TANKS LETTERBOX #2 <br/>
<br/>
If one climbs the south side of North Mountain; follows one of the easy<br/>
routes at the end of the paved road (all 5.4 to 5.6 stuff) they lead to a<br/>
large amphitheatre that has a huge oak in it. The amphitheatre is accessible<br/>
from all directions. In a hueco (natural hole-as is the area) 14 paces from<br/>
the old oak is a box covered by a rock. <br/>
<br/>
Note: access to this area requires some rock climbing. <br/>
<br/>

************<wbr/>*********<wbr/>**** <br/>
<br/>
On Saturday, 24 June 2006, a second attempt was mounted to locate the<br/>
Letterbox known as Hueco Tanks #2. This attempt was made with the help of<br/>
my son James (Army Scout) who was home on leave from the Army. We hit the<br/>
gate as early as was possible. After his orientation briefing, we were on<br/>
the trail. My ranger-friend Danny Lee asked us to keep a watch for sign of<br/>
some Bighorn Sheep that had moved into the park. We promised to do so. <br/>
<br/>
To get to the locations I GPS-waypointed on the last mission required us to<br/>
hike over <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">North</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Mountain</st1:placetype></st1:place>. Although the primary point of
interest was lower<br/>
on the south end of the mountain, the ground approach on the south side is<br/>
closed, open only to guided hiking. We were unguided on this mission, so<br/>
our approach was limited. The western approach is nearly a shear cliff.<br/>
Not impossible, but certainly more dangerous. Crossing the mountain was the<br/>
safest allowed approach. And so we did. I thoroughly enjoyed that hike.<br/>
We were out early and only had to share the mountain with a pair of foxes,<br/>
some prairie dogs, and an uncountable number of lizards. The sky was<br/>
lightly overcast and the temperatures were cool. Cool for summer in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">El Paso</st1:place></st1:city><br/>
anyway. The mission was ahead of us. We were optimistic. We had proper<br/>
gear and equipment. We were on the hunt. Two warriors headed out to do<br/>
what they do best. Life doesn't get better than this! I was loving it.<br/>
W.E.T.S.U. &lt;grin&gt; <br/>
<br/>
While we were hiking across the mountain we discovered several places with<br/>
sheep droppings. I GPS-waypointed and photographed the first few. The<br/>
first location was at N 31 55.340 W 106 02.783. But soon it was obvious<br/>
that the droppings were not difficult to find. So I stopped marking and<br/>
photographing. <br/>
<br/>
James and I arrived at the first and most promising point for Hueco Tanks #2<br/>
within an hour of hiking. It is a 30 foot deep steep-walled hole with a<br/>
large oak tree on the south west end of the mountain. It is located at N<br/>
31 55.242 W 106 02.860. We set out a safety rope, and James went down. I<br/>
lowered our gear to James, then followed. James - being a Cavalry scout,<br/>
always seems to take point. As I was climbing down he remarked that this<br/>
secluded hole was full of sheep droppings. I got to the bottom and we began<br/>
our search. <br/>
<br/>
For about 1.5 hours we checked every possible hole, crack and crevice. We<br/>
found two very promising places that fit the clues perfectly and had rocks<br/>
covering the holes in the east wall north of the tree. One hole was empty.<br/>
The second had broken glass in it. Neither had anything resembling a<br/>
letterbox inside. In the process of searching for the letterbox we filled<br/>
two shopping bags with trash. After exhausting every possibility, I climbed<br/>
out, pulled our gear up, and threw the rope down for James to get out. I<br/>
enjoyed every minute in that spot. But I was disappointed we came out<br/>
without the letterbox. <br/>
<br/>
The search of the other areas went about like the first. None was as<br/>
promising as the first. Some places required us to climb in and out<br/>
carefully. In order to search many of the likely places we needed to<br/>
carefully look behind the plant life. Thorns and scratches were the rule of<br/>
the day. At one point we had to remove our gear and crawl through a series<br/>
of cracks and crevices with the gear tied to our feet dragging behind to get<br/>
to the spot. Each time we went in hopeful, but came out empty. After<br/>
nearly 6 hours on this mission we had exhausted every possibility. I was<br/>
not ready to give up. But there was nothing left to do. We crawled out and<br/>
shouldered up our gear to start back. About 200 yards into the return trip<br/>
we realized we had forgotten about 3 bags full of trash. So we returned to<br/>
collect up the bags. <br/>
<br/>
On the way back, I took James to see some of the rock paintings. If you<br/>
visit <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Hueco</st1:placename> <st1:placename w:st="on">Tanks</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">State Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>
- be sure to see these paintings. They are<br/>
located on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">North</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Mountain</st1:placetype></st1:place> at N 31 55.422 W 106 02.796.
The coordinates<br/>
will put you at the base of a rock face to your south. Crawl in the crevice<br/>
at your feet and move west to the large room. As your eyes adjust to the<br/>
dim light, you will see some of the finest Indian paintings in the park.<br/>
Don't forget your camera. <br/>
<br/>
The return trip was uneventful, almost somber. We had failed. Failure is<br/>
not a word we accept easily. On the other hand, I had a GREAT outing with<br/>
my son. He has grown into a man. The kind of man I was used to working<br/>
with when I was a hard-charging Sergeant so long ago. The kind of man you<br/>
want to have by your side when everything else around you is going wrong.<br/>
Cavalry Scout. Sniper. Paramedic. He can use his hands as weapons, and<br/>
his weapons as though they were his hands. His hands can heal or kill with<br/>
equal skill. Who wouldn't be proud to stand on line with a warrior like<br/>
this? <br/>
<br/>
By the time you read this - and sadly for me - he will be gone. But some of<br/>
you will have the opportunity to meet him at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Fort</st1:placetype> <st1:placename w:st="on">Hood</st1:placename></st1:place>.
He will be doing<br/>
some letterboxing, scouting out the good ones for me when we visit him in<br/>
late September. I hope you-all will welcome him to your part of the state. <br/>
<br/>
This concludes the report on Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox. I will continue to<br/>
work with the park staff to rebuild and replace Hueco Tanks #1 in a location<br/>
worthy of letterboxing, but fully acceptable to the park staff. This will<br/>
not happen quickly. Perhaps by Christmas. <br/>
<br/>
I would like to once again point out that not a word of this report would<br/>
have been possible without the cooperation of the staff at Hueco Tanks state<br/>
Park. Thank you Rangers! And it is a shining example of why I believe<br/>
having an open dialog with the park staff about your letterbox is better<br/>
than placing a letterbox secretly and hoping the rangers do not find it. <br/>
<br/>
I also thank Dane Lady and Army scout for participating is parts of this<br/>
adventure. Having them along made it all the more enjoyable. <br/>
<br/>
Last - I will send a final report when Hueco Tanks #1 is repaired and<br/>
replaced. This has been a great adventure for me. I would also like to<br/>
thank Silver Eagle for asking me to take on this mission. I wish the 50-%<br/>
successful report I bring to the list was a 100% successful report. I can<br/>
only say we did our best. <br/>

  to Ft. Hood just fine.  Today he was just cruising around, playing with 
  the ham radio.  He talked to some of my radio-friends in Austin.  
  Next thing you know, he is invited to a BBQ at the radio club president's 
  house. with the rest of the radio club.  Some of you may remember the 
  Abilene trip we took for the radio club picnic.</span></div>

&gt; I, on the other hand, love climbing around on rocks, and<br/>
&gt; I wish I could have been with you on your mission. <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Tell you what.  When you get here, let the family have a day <br/>
alone, you and<br/>
&gt; I will do this one together.  Family members welcome - if you <br/>
think they can<br/>
&gt; make it.<br/>
