 Camp Ford - what a great place for a box or two!  Good thinking.  I <br/>
look<br/>
&gt; forward to finding them!<br/>
<br/>
JKC,welcome to letterboxing and I am so happy to finally see another <br/>
boxer in Smith county. I am so excited to see those boxes at Camp <br/>
Ford and I will be going after very soon!! <br/>
   Also, Stinky Monkey, Roarin' LIon and I had a great time Boxing <br/>
Sat. I had told Lucy Locket I HAD to get out and do some boxing or <br/>
go bananas!! What a treat to find a new box by JB KOkopelli close <br/>
by. "A Tribute to the Crococile Hunter" was a great way to start <br/>
stamping in. Well done JBK!!  We then headed to Jacksonville to find <br/>
a few more. After playing on the slides and swings we stamped in <br/>
three more boxes and had to leave because of the rain. Thanks to <br/>
Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle, we had a great adventure!<br/>
Happy Boxing!<br/>
