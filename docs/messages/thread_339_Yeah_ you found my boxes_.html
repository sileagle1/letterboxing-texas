I am so excited you are enjoying our boxes and your nice post was a <br>
great confidence builder for the "Pikachu Ponderer" as he is young <br>
and that was his first plant.<br>
We are still planning our big Dallas Boxing Day.  Just having <br>
trouble finding the time.<br>

<br>
And take your time planning your Dallas day - I need to double-check<br>
those pesky White Rock boxes;-)!!!<br>
We have one planned for Carrollton as a favor for someone out of state,<br>
and one planned for Fair Park which Cactus will plant when he's down<br>
there for the State Fair.<br>
And then there's the second one in the Bronze series for downtown<br>
Dallas...so the longer you wait, the more there will be!<br>
<br>
Take care,<br>
