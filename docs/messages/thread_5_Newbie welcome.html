<br/>
I guess I'm the last on this list to speak up with an<br/>
intro!<br/>
<br/>
I've been letterboxing formally since last summer,<br/>
although we had played at it for awhile longer -<br/>
planting boxes as a kids' game basically.  My family<br/>
boxes together - my husband, my 16 year old daughter,<br/>
and my almost 8 year old son.  We've also introduced<br/>
our cub scout den to it, although as yet none of them<br/>
have jumped into it.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in Northeast Texas myself, near Tyler.  The few<br/>
boxes in our area are precious - they are few and far<br/>
between, as are boxers.  I've been grateful to Silver<br/>
Eagle and BabyBear, since they have planted all the<br/>
boxes up here, but two people who live a few hours<br/>
away can't be expected to do all the work, so my<br/>
family is beginning to take on the challenge of<br/>
getting more boxes in up here - we planted our first<br/>
two a couple of weeks ago (just a hint - one of them<br/>
is in the Tyler Zoo, and the other is at Killough<br/>
Monument), and as soon as I get a chance I'll be<br/>
posting the clues on www.letterboxing.org.  We have<br/>
several more ideas, so hopefully we will get them out<br/>
soon.<br/>
<br/>
My family has big time commitments in soccer, scouts,<br/>
and my daughter's drill team activities, so we stay<br/>
very busy and don't get to go boxing very often.  What<br/>
we've gotten from LB'ing is a means to get out and<br/>
away from phones, computers, and televisions by<br/>
ourselves as a family, get into the woods we love, and<br/>
then to have the fun of hunting boxes.  I find that<br/>
when you are following someone else's clues to a box,<br/>
you see the surroundings for just a little while from<br/>
their perspective.  That has really enhanced our<br/>
enjoyment of the woods we have hiked for so many<br/>
years.  It blew me away the first time we went looking<br/>
for Silver Eagle's and BabyBear's boxes in Mission<br/>
Tejas - we've hiked all over there numerous times, and<br/>
to discover that someone else had been to "our" woods<br/>
and planted boxes along the very trails we visit two<br/>
or three times a year was amazing to me (this may not<br/>
strike you the way it did me, but I am easily<br/>
amazed!).<br/>
<br/>
The area of letterboxing that has been most<br/>
challenging for me has been stamp carving - I'm not an<br/>
artist!  I tried for the longest time to study and<br/>
think and work and design, and then to figure out<br/>
technique and method - before I ever set knife to<br/>
material.  It just didn't work that way - I finally<br/>
just dove it and gave it a try.  It's worth the<br/>
learning though - it really is exciting to see your<br/>
own stamp take shape.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, enough about me!  Looking forward to meeting you<br/>
and everyone else at Bastrop!<br/>

<div>Glad to meet you.  Sounds like you lead a busy life.  I miss those days when my kids were in school and keeping me busy.  I was much thinner back then, too...LOL.  But, back in those days when I was so busy, I thought they'd never end and looked so farward to that.  Now, I wish I was back there again.  Never ever thought I'd say THAT..lol.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>&lt;to discover that someone else had been to "our" woods<br/>and planted boxes along the very trails we visit two<br/>or three times a year was amazing to me&gt;<br/><br/>I can understand this!  There are 2 planted in Choke Canyon State Park at Calliham.  I grew up where this park is now.  There is a playground in what used to be my front yard.  I haven't gone to find them yet, but I can see where they are in my mind's eye. I know that park like the back of my hand, but never dreamed that there could be something hid there like that!   It is awesome!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And then, I found one just blocks from me that Wanda had planted.  It is at a cemetary that I have passed by many, many times.  I had never stopped before and read the historical marker.  I read it the other day and had no idea that the cemetary is as old as it is.  I had made a New Year's resolution that I'd take time to stop and read more historical markers this year.  Hmmm...letterboxing idea!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm looking forward to Bastrop.  Hope I can make it.</div>
