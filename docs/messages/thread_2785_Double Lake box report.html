maintenance work.  LSQ's box, "Shoofly", which had been missing <br/>
(consumed in a controlled burn) has been replaced, but moved to a new <br/>
spot on the Lone Star Trail near Double Lake.  It's a replacement, not <br/>
a new box.  My box, "Picoides Borealis", which was pulled due to road <br/>
work, tree cutting and burning, has been placed in a new location, <br/>
also on the LST near Double Lake.  In that same area, Will's World's <br/>
box "Holy Anole" and Baby Bear's box "The Joker" are alive and well.  <br/>
In the park, Baby Bear's box "Know Your Swimming Hole" is also good, <br/>
as is Princess Aurora's "Rainbow Butterfly", El Lobo's "It Is What It <br/>
Is" and my box, "Double Lake".  Will's World's box, "A Night at Double <br/>
Lake" is confirmed missing.  LSQ's box "Flying Geese" was also <br/>
missing, so we made a new, identical stamp and replaced the box in the <br/>
same location.  It should not be considered a new box.  The park is <br/>
filling up for the holiday weekend and is always busy on weekends.  <br/>
Monday-Thursday, it is deserted.  <br/>
