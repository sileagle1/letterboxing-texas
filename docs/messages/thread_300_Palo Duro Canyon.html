                    <div class="plaintext-content">Went on a letterbox hike yesterday to Palo Duro Canyon (TX panhandle) <br>
and found Silver Eagle's Palo Duro Canyon Mouse box. :-) It was an <br>
easy find, once I started looking from the right bench! Before that, <br>
though- it was quite a hunt. I did go further down the trail to <br>
Eoghan's lighthouse one, but it turns out to be a DNF because it was <br>
getting dark and I didn't want to end up out there without a <br>
flashlight! I will have to make another trip later on when it's not <br>
as hot and I can get out there earlier! It's quite a hike (almost 6 <br>
miles round-trip)- and take your mountain bike if you have one- lots <br>
of ups and downs on the trail.<br>
<br>
Even though I grew up here, I still forget just how beautiful that <br>
canyon is, especially at sunset. There are SO many places to hike in <br>
this canyon- I've only barely begun to find boxes and caches out <br>
there!<br>

box it was 110 degrees!  Beautiful, though.<br>
