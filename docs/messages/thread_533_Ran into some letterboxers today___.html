Today turned into an interesting day. First of all, I got an email <br/>
that my Lost and Found Leaf Micro-box was open, scattered, damp and <br/>
the stamp was missing. <br/>
<br/>
Then when my grandson Zach...uh, Cabaio Dieblo, uh...just plain <br/>
Caballo(?) and I went out to check on The Beehive Hitchhiker Hostel, <br/>
we ran into a grandmother, mom, and two children (ages 10 &amp; 7)<br/>
stamping in to 'Watchful Birds'. They were the group who had emailed <br/>
this morning about 'Lost and Found Leaf'. The mom and kids are <br/>
visiting from Colorado, and will be returning tomorrow, but they <br/>
have been letterboxing all over the area - Rockport, Goose Island <br/>
and other places. Actually, the mom and grandmother are not <br/>
letterboxers. The daughter learned about it from her teacher, who <br/>
introduced it to the class and had them all carve stamps. So the two <br/>
children are actually the letterboxers, with the support of their <br/>
mom and the cheerful accompaniment of their grandmother. :) The <br/>
grandmother, who lives in Beeville is planning to 'spread the word' <br/>
to a history group, I think she said. So we may get some more <br/>
letterboxers in the area. :)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I let the kids take the only hitchhiker currently laying <br/>
over in the hostel and then I hurried home to replace it with <br/>
another. Half-Hearted Hitchhiker is now in residence, as is 'Magic <br/>
Marble' - one that Caballo carved while we were getting ready to <br/>
return to the hostel. I also have the replacement 'Lost and Found <br/>
Leaf' ready to place again tomorrow. <br/>
<br/>
We had a great time visiting with the group, and exchanging stamps <br/>
with 'Huey Bear' and 'Emily Bear'. <br/>
