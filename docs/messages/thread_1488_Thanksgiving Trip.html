                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from my camping trip to South TX and<br>
Thanksgiving in Austin and managed to get in some boxing.  <br>
I left last Sunday with my 2 children and we headed to <br>
Mustang Island SP where we camped for 2 nights.  We first<br>
stopped in Victoria where I found Ancient Monkey God,<br>
which was planted just after I visited the same park last<br>
year.  Then it was on to Goose Island SP where we found<br>
Missing Key #1 and I placed a new box called Big Tree 2,<br>
since my original box went missing.  Consider it a new box<br>
since it is a new stamp and box, but is still near the Big Tree.<br>
Next we drove through Aransas Pass and boarded the free Ferry<br>
boat to Port Aransas on Mustang Island.  It was fun and we<br>
got to see several porpoises.  We made it to the park just<br>
before sunset to pitch our tent among all the RVs and just<br>
managed to find Treasure Island before dark.  Unfortunately<br>
all the other boxes that used to be in this park and in Port<br>
Aransas are now missing, but it is still a fun place to visit.<br>
The next day we drove back to Port Aransas to visit the UT<br>
Marine Institute, which provided a free hour's worth of fun <br>
looking at marine life in various aquariums.  By now it was<br>
starting to warm up, so we headed to Padre Island NS to play<br>
on the beach.  We had most of the beach to ourselves and <br>
enjoyed clear water and clean sand for a change.  It is hard<br>
to believe that is the same Gulf Of Mexico we swim in here<br>
in Galveston!  As we left, I placed my TX Turtle 2 box just<br>
outside the park and hopefully it will last longer than the<br>
original did.  This is also a new box with a new stamp.  Then<br>
it was back to camp and up early to see the sun rise out of the<br>
Gulf.  What a sight!  As we headed north, I stopped in Corpus<br>
Christi to place Corpus Porpoise 2.  Again, a new box with<br>
new stamp, so even if you got the original ones, now you<br>
have more to look for next time you go down there.<br>
We then headed to Beeville to look for Veterans Memorial box,<br>
but came up empty.  There were several people playing the<br>
disc golf course so I could not look too long.  Next it was on<br>
to Three Rivers where we found Dancing Ducks a little wet, but<br>
still dancing.  We went on to Choke Canyon SP and set up our<br>
tent (the only ones in the entire tent campground), then went<br>
looking for the boxes in the park.  We confirmed Southern <br>
Magnolia is missing and tried to find a box with no clues,<br>
just sketchy information from Busy Bee, but were not successful.<br>
I hid a new box on the same trail called Choke Canyon Caracara<br>
that hopefully will have better luck than others.  We then drove<br>
to another trail and found Gator Pond with Gryzzled Gryphon as<br>
the only visitor.  On the way back to camp we saw several wild<br>
pigs and deer, and that night we heard owls and coyotes, so<br>
really felt like we were camping.<br>
The next day we had to head to Austin to meet my wife and <br>
relatives for Thanksgiving, but we did not head straight there.  <br>
By winding along many back roads I was able to look for a few <br>
more boxes.  In Helena I came up empty looking for RIP #4, but<br>
found Solidarnosc in Panna Maria.  In Floresville we confirmed<br>
Peanuts is missing, but found Rancho De Las Cabras.  <br>
In Stockdale I had something new happen to me; I could not find<br>
a park.  I drove down the specified road twice and never saw<br>
the entrance, so missed out on the 3 boxes in Jackson Nature Park.<br>
Corazon later sent me a picture of the entrance and all I can<br>
say is I must have assumed it was a private ranch entrance since<br>
there were so many off that road.  Oh well, maybe next time.<br>
In La Vernia we found Square & Compass, One Stoplight Town and<br>
Simple Summer Series #1.  I found the other ones in this series<br>
last year but missed this one while it was being replaced, so <br>
was glad to finally finish this great series.  Our final box<br>
was Panther Pride in Geronimo and I was glad school was out<br>
since it would have been tough to get otherwise.<br>
I had planned to do more boxing on a day trip to Fredericksburg<br>
along with the Hill Country Christmas Light Trail at night, which<br>
I highly recommend, but the weather stopped us and we came home<br>
instead.  It was a fun trip and thanks to all placers for making<br>
it even more enjoyable!<br>

It also has a Nature Center and garden area that made for a nice place to wait while my wife shopped at the Outlet Malls.<br>
<br>
Two of the Games boxes are new versions of the 20 Questions Game:  Thing and Place.  The other two include spinners, which is my first attempt at animation:  Chutes & Ladders and The Game Of Letterboxer Life - TX Edition.  This last game gives you the chance to become one of your fellow TX Letterboxers as you play my version of the Game Of Life.  Baby Bear can even be IRA Boxer and vice-versa.  I hope you enjoy them!<br>
