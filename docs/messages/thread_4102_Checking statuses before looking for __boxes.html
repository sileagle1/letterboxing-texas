                    <html><body><p>Very true! And a great story. Funny how things happen that way. But you have to admit - that's not the norm. Usually when they are marked "retired" or archived, the placer is pretty darned sure (as you were) that the box is gone OR they actually have taken possession of the box. Otherwise they leave the status as Unknown. <br/>
<br/>One of the things I DO really like about AQ is the fact that it has the status flags. If both the finder and the planter use them properly, they are a great tool. Of course, on LBNA boxes are completely removed from search listings when they are archived, so no chance of hunting retired boxes unless you specifically go looking for them there. And then - you don't know why or how it was archived unless the planter or the webmasters make a note in the clues.<br/>
<br/>I just felt very badly because the latest reporter was very disappointed not to have found it. I would hope that folks who go looking for boxes knowing the odds are stacked against them would at least have a philosophical attitude about it. I feel like the latest one I have in mind just didn't notice or understand the designations...<br/>
<br/>Every time I get a report like that, it makes me stop and think whether I have been keeping my clues updated. I think I have - can't promise I'm always great at it - but in the cases where they've been reported missing lately, I've gone back and checked and found they were already noted.<br/>
<br/>Oh well. I hope someone gets a little something from my note. I always feel disappointed with them when they don't find my boxes.<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Sun, May 24, 2009 at 10:40 AM, Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:redbarn@eastex.net">redbarn@eastex.net</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/>

&gt; It seems like I have had a rash of no finds lately - on boxes I have either<br/>
&gt; retired on AQ or archived or marked MISSING or RETIRED on LBNA.  I feel<br/>

&gt; they never had a hope in the first place, that's a bummer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; SO - I want to make sure our new boxers have noticed that on AQ, there are<br/>
&gt; statuses, and "retired" means the placer has either removed the box or<br/>
&gt; confirmed it is gone.  "unavailable" probably means the placer has pulled it<br/>
&gt; for maintenance, or perhaps it's in an area with seasonal availability.<br/>
&gt; "Unknown" means - well - who knows the status?  You might get lucky and find<br/>
&gt; one of those.  And of course, "Active" means that as far as anyone knows,<br/>
&gt; the box is in place and active.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On LBNA, the retired boxes are (or should be) archived, so you won't see<br/>
&gt; them in a normal search.  Some folks, like me, put the words MISSING or<br/>
&gt; RETIRED in the title of the box and leave them in the listing for awhile<br/>
&gt; before archiving, so that anyone who might be behind on logging won't have<br/>
&gt; to go digging for them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm all for the idea that you never know if you'll find a box when you go<br/>
&gt; looking for it, but it really is a shame to go looking for a box that is<br/>
&gt; known to be missing before you ever left your computer screen!  Of course, I<br/>
&gt; guess the possibility is that all these folks had printed off clues quite<br/>

This has cost me more time than anything else.<br/>
<br/>Those of you who have been around for awhile know I have a "thing" about paper being neat and clean and not dog-eared, so that I would rather reprint a clue than use a raggedy looking one. I'm trying to quit killing as many trees as I used to, so I very carefully mount printed clues into notebooks so they can stay neat and clean. Then eventually, I get to go looking for them, only to find - when I return home - that their status has changed. SO - in my tree-friendly approach, I'm trying to learn to be realistic about what I can actually find and printing only those few right before I go boxing. <br/>
<br/>But now, even better - my current phone has internet. LBNA has had mobile for awhile and AQ has gotten on the mobile bandwagon too, so I can now look up clues on both LBNA and AQ and never print a thing. Problem with THAT is - what if I have no signal??? I think I can do a copy and paste to a document on my phone now though, so that I may actually be able to go paperless!<br/>

<p>Very true! And a great story. Funny how things happen that 
  way. But you have to admit - that's not the norm. Usually when 
  they are marked "retired" or archived, the placer is pretty darned sure (as

  of the things I DO really like about AQ is the fact that it has the status 
  flags. If both the finder and the planter use them properly, they are a 
  great tool. Of course, on LBNA boxes are completely removed from search 
  listings when they are archived, so no chance of hunting retired boxes unless 
  you specifically go looking for them there. And then - you don't know

myself on my phone.  If I find myself somewhere that I don't have clues <br/>
for them I use my mobile Internet to to look and see if there are any <br/>
nearby boxes.  No paper needed!<br/>
<br/>
Well ok when Princessa and I went after the 76 boxes in Jacksonville we <br/>
did print them all. That was a mass attack day!<br/>

&gt; Hey Heather,<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; No need to blame it on newbie-ness. I still print clues for old boxes <br/>
&gt; sometimes, when I get in a hurry!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Probably what I'm worse about than not noticing the status, is printing <br/>
&gt; clues and then saving them for awhile before I go to look for them. <br/>
&gt; This has cost me more time than anything else.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Those of you who have been around for awhile know I have a "thing" <br/>
&gt; about paper being neat and clean and not dog-eared, so that I would <br/>
&gt; rather reprint a clue than use a raggedy looking one. I'm trying to <br/>
&gt; quit killing as many trees as I used to, so I very carefully mount <br/>
&gt; printed clues into notebooks so they can stay neat and clean. Then <br/>
&gt; eventually, I get to go looking for them, only to find - when I return <br/>
&gt; home - that their status has changed. SO - in my tree-friendly <br/>
&gt; approach, I'm trying to learn to be realistic about what I can actually <br/>
&gt; find and printing only those few right before I go boxing.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; But now, even better - my current phone has internet. LBNA has had <br/>
&gt; mobile for awhile and AQ has gotten on the mobile bandwagon too, so I <br/>
&gt; can now look up clues on both LBNA and AQ and never print a thing. <br/>
&gt; Problem with THAT is - what if I have no signal??? I think I can do a <br/>
&gt; copy and paste to a document on my phone now though, so that I may <br/>
&gt; actually be able to go paperless!<br/>

&gt;&gt; I had to go back to my logbook online to determine if you were talking <br/>
&gt;&gt; about me! On our last lb journey last weekend, we had two attempts, <br/>
&gt;&gt; but I thought I remembered that they were both supposed to be there. <br/>
&gt;&gt; I have been guilty of searching for a box no longer present (and I was <br/>
&gt;&gt; disappointed!). I'll blame it on my "newbie-ness". :) After <br/>
&gt;&gt; searching for it, I did go check the clues again on AQ and it was <br/>
&gt;&gt; listed as active. There was a note, however, that said retired - not <br/>
&gt;&gt; in the title and not in the clue part. I <a href="http://overlooked.it" target="_blank">overlooked.it</a> when choosing <br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt; for boxes<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Very true! And a great story. Funny how things happen that way. <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; But you have to admit - that's not the norm. Usually when they are <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; marked "retired" or archived, the placer is pretty darned sure (as <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; you were) that the box is gone OR they actually have taken possession <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; of the box. Otherwise they leave the status as Unknown.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; One of the things I DO really like about AQ is the fact that it has <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; the status flags. If both the finder and the planter use them <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; properly, they are a great tool. Of course, on LBNA boxes are <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; completely removed from search listings when they are archived, so no <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; chance of hunting retired boxes unless you specifically go looking <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; for them there. And then - you don't know why or how it was archived <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; unless the planter or the webmasters make a note in the clues.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; I just felt very badly because the latest reporter was very <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; disappointed not to have found it. I would hope that folks who go <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; looking for boxes knowing the odds are stacked against them would at <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; least have a philosophical attitude about it. I feel like the latest <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; one I have in mind just didn't notice or understand the designations...<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Every time I get a report like that, it makes me stop and think <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; whether I have been keeping my clues updated. I think I have - can't <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; promise I'm always great at it - but in the cases where they've been <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; reported missing lately, I've gone back and checked and found they <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; were already noted.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; Oh well. I hope someone gets a little something from my note. I <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt; always feel disappointed with them when they don't find my boxes.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Funny you should mention this trend, because I have noticed it too, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and I don't understand why someone even looks for those boxes. I'm <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; glad you have pointed out the various "status" cattegories, but I'm <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; afraid that the folks who don't read the clues also won't be reading <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; this post. Occasionally, good things happen, though, like the recent <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; finding of my "Nimitz" box, despite the fact that it had been <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; missing since October and that a note was clearly placed on the clue <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; sheet stating that it was missing. The finder followed the original <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clues and found it, so it had never really been missing, even though <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; the report had come from a reliable letterboxer who detailed the <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; fact that the location of the box had been destroyed by construction <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; crews. I'm sure that was true and that the box was fortunate to <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; survive the damage and remain in the same place. It's now been found <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; 3 times in the last week. So, you never know for sure unless you go <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; check it out for yourself or someone stumbles upon it for whatever <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; reason.<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  It seems like I have had a rash of no finds lately - on boxes I <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have either<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  retired on AQ or archived or marked MISSING or RETIRED on LBNA. I feel<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  really badly when that happens - I hate it badly enough when <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; someone drives<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  for one of my boxes and they don't find it, but when they go after <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; it and<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  they never had a hope in the first place, that's a bummer.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  SO - I want to make sure our new boxers have noticed that on AQ, <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; there are<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  statuses, and "retired" means the placer has either removed the box or<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  confirmed it is gone. "unavailable" probably means the placer has <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; pulled it<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  for maintenance, or perhaps it's in an area with seasonal <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; availability.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  "Unknown" means - well - who knows the status? You might get lucky <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and find<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  one of those. And of course, "Active" means that as far as anyone <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; knows,<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  the box is in place and active.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  On LBNA, the retired boxes are (or should be) archived, so you <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't see<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  them in a normal search. Some folks, like me, put the words MISSING or<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  RETIRED in the title of the box and leave them in the listing for <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; awhile<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  before archiving, so that anyone who might be behind on logging <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; won't have<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  to go digging for them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  I'm all for the idea that you never know if you'll find a box when <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; you go<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  looking for it, but it really is a shame to go looking for a box <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; that is<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  known to be missing before you ever left your computer screen! Of <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; course, I<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  guess the possibility is that all these folks had printed off <br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; clues quite<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  awhile ago, but that doesn't seem too likely for ALL of them.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;  Hope this helps?<br/>
