Maybe it can work it's way down south for CalicoRose.  It got as far <br/>
as Needville, but I was afraid to leave it there as the Brazos Bend <br/>
boxes don't get many visitors.  Victoria was a little too far from <br/>
Coldspring.  I'm sure the well-known couple that were first aboard <br/>
will get some interesting passengers to ride with.<br/>

It's rodeo time in Houston and the cow-poke that just got on the bus <br/>
needs to get "Strait" to Reliant Stadium.<br/>
The bus driver has parked the bus on far from the "Rodeo Rest Stop" to <br/>
pick-up more passengers and to continue on his route.<br/>
17 paces Eastward from the Rodeo Rest Stop to a fallen tree running <br/>
parallel to the ravine,laying between this fallen tree and a medium <br/>
pine tree, X marks the spot for pick-up.<br/>

We usually hang out on Memorial Saturday morning to watch the trail<br/>

they come into town on Friday. <br/>

Logic is there, but its bonus box is missing.  I'll try to replace it<br/>
at some point, but I have some other letterboxing projects higher on<br/>
the list.  I also found a newly planted geocache (without GPS), so it<br/>
was a fun morning.<br/>

<div>As a side note to watching the trail riders arrive in Memorial Park, don't forget about the Rodeo Parade downtown Saturday morning!  The parade starts at 10:00 and is preceded at 9:50 by the Conoco Phillips Rodeo Run 5K and 10K!  Runners get to run along the parade route prior to all of the horses!  BONUS!!!<span contenteditable="false"></span></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fellow Texas Boxers,<br/>
<br/>
The Texas Tour Bus 2 is back on the road. The passengers spent a <br/>
quiet  Christmas in Austin, and even took time to help me move my <br/>
elderly parents into independent living. (We needed the bus to load <br/>
boxes and the people on the bus to carry boxes and furniture into the <br/>
new place. Not one passenger uttered a word of complaint!)<br/>
<br/>
But everyone is back on the bus, with one additional traveler. When <br/>
last seen, the bus was in Bosque County, stopping to visit the <br/>
cemetery of Our Savior's Lutheran Church in Norse.<br/>
<br/>
Don't bother looking at Mapquest for the directions to Norse. They <br/>
have it situated east of Clifton, when all locals know that Norse is <br/>
west of Clifton.<br/>
<br/>
Going north on I-35 from Austin area, exit Temple and take Hwy 36 <br/>
west to Gatesville. Continue on 36 for 6 miles to 182. Turn right on <br/>
182 for 20 miles thru Turnersville to intersection with Hwy 219, the <br/>
Cleng Peerson Memorial Hwy. Cross 219, jogging right and left, <br/>
continue on 182 for 2.2 miles to Our Savior's Lutheran Church. <br/>
<br/>
If you are coming from the north, travel south on I-35 to Waco, then <br/>
take Hwy 6 west to Clifton. (Stop for a piece of scrumptious pie at <br/>
the Tea House on the corner of Ave D and 5th St.) From Hwy 6 turn <br/>
left on Hwy 219, Cleng Peerson Memorial Hwy. Drive 6.9 miles to 182. <br/>
Turn right on 182, traveling 2.2 miles to Our Savior's Luther Church.<br/>
<br/>
Park on the right by the entrace gate to the cemetery. Notice the <br/>
monument to the first 17 Norwegians to settle in  Bosque Cnty. Once <br/>
inside the cemetery, locate the prominent grave marker of Cleng <br/>
Peerson. Pay him tribute. Then continue straight ahead to the rock <br/>
wall. Locate the grave of Martha Louise and her infant child. <br/>
Directly opposite her grave stone is a cedar tree behind the wall. <br/>
The tour bus is perched on a ledge behind the wall, under those cedar <br/>
branches.<br/>
<br/>
Happy touring!<br/>

the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering what <br/>
was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo and found <br/>
him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>
dejected.  He was still wearing his old buckskins and that coonskin <br/>
cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, and <br/>
he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle.  Anyway, I asked him <br/>
how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' tol'able, <br/>
except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and <br/>
asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind would <br/>
do.  I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas because <br/>
people like him had killed them all.  He said he was sorry about that <br/>
and would like to make amends if he could.  Maybe he could find a <br/>
bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of them in <br/>
his lifetime.  I told him that I knew of a bear out west of Houston, <br/>
but that he was just a Baby Bear.  I asked him if he would like to <br/>
take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the cub <br/>
lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize.  He <br/>
brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on it.  <br/>
We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of whom <br/>
he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>
called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived.  Pretty soon, <br/>
Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>
that bus all the way to Cypress.  I don't know how he learned to <br/>
drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they try hard <br/>
enough.  We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out front, <br/>
surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, for a <br/>
Baby Bear.  Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got to <br/>
the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to the <br/>
right and ducked under some bushes.  The last I saw of him, he was <br/>
sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a grin on <br/>
his face and a gleam in his eye.  I have no idea what he had in mind.<br/>

&gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering what <br/>
&gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo and <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>
&gt; dejected.  He was still wearing his old buckskins and that coonskin <br/>
&gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, and <br/>
&gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle.  Anyway, I asked him <br/>
&gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
tol'able, <br/>
&gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and <br/>
&gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind would <br/>
&gt; do.  I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; people like him had killed them all.  He said he was sorry about <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; and would like to make amends if he could.  Maybe he could find a <br/>
&gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of them <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; his lifetime.  I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
Houston, <br/>
&gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear.  I asked him if he would like to <br/>
&gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the cub <br/>
&gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize.  He <br/>
&gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on it.  <br/>
&gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of whom <br/>
&gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>
&gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived.  Pretty soon, <br/>
&gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>
&gt; that bus all the way to Cypress.  I don't know how he learned to <br/>
&gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they try <br/>
hard <br/>
&gt; enough.  We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
front, <br/>
&gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, for <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; Baby Bear.  Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got to <br/>
&gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to the <br/>
&gt; right and ducked under some bushes.  The last I saw of him, he was <br/>
&gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a grin <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; his face and a gleam in his eye.  I have no idea what he had in <br/>
mind.<br/>

  just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of them <br/>in <br/>&gt;

<div>I am soooo innocent. My character has been defamed - unjustly accused. I quietly spent my afternoon checking on one of my letterboxing in Tioga, Texas - birthplace of Gene Autry, the singing cowboy for goodness sake. What could be a more wholesome activity? Then after preparing a lovely dinner and washing the dishes by hand, I sat meekly in my chair, knitting and listening to classical music. All this talk of my attempting to steal that lovely box from that dear young bear is... well... is just slanderous. I may have to have a word with Mother of All Those Many Children for offering my name up in the first place. Whadda ya say, Mo5, wanna meet me for a Shiner in Buffalo, I mean, an iced beverage in some quiet place? Maybe you could bring along your barefoot friend and I could counsel her on all that name calling... Puddle Bozo, indeed! Now I must go attend to my ironing and can some peaches.</div>

<div>What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene Autry?  Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, NacTrailCat will probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of one of the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, and I'm betting BootsTex will too! </div>

<div>Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would play "cowboys" as kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I always chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the beautiful school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, I decided to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the sofa with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken away my "six shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head with it was not appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, always a thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My mother returned my six shooter long ago, but I'll need to find some caps for it.)</div>

<div>What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene Autry?  Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, NacTrailCat will probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of one of the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, and I'm betting BootsTex will too! </div>

He was still wearing his old buckskins and that coonskin <br/>&gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, and <br/>&gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked him <br/>&gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>tol'able, <br/>&gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and <br/>&gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind would <br/>&gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>because <br/>&gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry about <br/>that <br/>&gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could find a <br/>&gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of them <br/>in <br/>&gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>Houston, <br/>&gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would like to <br/>&gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the cub <br/>&gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. He <br/>&gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on it. <br/>&gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of whom <br/>&gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>&gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty soon, <br/>&gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>&gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned to <br/>&gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they try <br/>hard <br/>&gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>front, <br/>&gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, for <br/>a <br/>&gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got to <br/>&gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to the <br/>&gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he was <br/>&gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a grin <br/>on <br/>&gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had in <br/>mind.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The Ghost of IRA Boxer<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></span></div>

<div>Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would play 
  "cowboys" as kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I always 
  chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the beautiful school marm. 
  It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, I decided to rob her once, 
  and she ended up with laying on the sofa with an ice pack on her head, and our 
  mother had taken away my "six shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the 
  head with it was not appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, 
  always a thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My mother 
  returned my six shooter long ago, but I'll need to find some caps for 
  it.)</div>

<div>Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would play "cowboys" as kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I always chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the beautiful school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, I decided to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the sofa with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken away my "six shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head with it was not appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, always a thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My mother returned my six shooter long ago, but I'll need to find some caps for it.)</div>

<p>Holy crap, who stold it!!! My well laid trap for the Bus has been <br/>foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place as <br/>mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been taken, and <br/>with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the Bus make <br/>
a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow this is <br/>your fault IRA!!! <br/><br/>PS - There is another person in Cypress with my same name, so I hope <br/>you put this at the right house!!!<br/><br/>Baby Bear<br/>

<div>You're right! The more I get to "gnome" Mother of Five, the more I find she is definitely an instigator. Don't you just love it? I so admire that! She definitely is the one who started the IRA Boxer Fan Club.</div>

&gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat with <br/>
&gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals. <br/>
Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo and <br/>
&gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>
&gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
coonskin <br/>
&gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked him <br/>
&gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
&gt; tol'able, <br/>
&gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and <br/>
&gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry about <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could find a <br/>
&gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; Houston, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would like to <br/>
&gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the cub <br/>
&gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. He <br/>
&gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on <br/>
it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of <br/>
whom <br/>
&gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>
&gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty soon, <br/>
&gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned to <br/>
&gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they try <br/>
&gt; hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
&gt; front, <br/>
&gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he was <br/>
&gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>
grin <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had in <br/>
&gt; mind.<br/>

to <br/>

<div>Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would play 
        "cowboys" as kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I 
        always chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the beautiful 
        school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, I decided 
        to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the sofa with an ice 
        pack on her head, and our mother had taken away my "six shooter" and 
        told me hitting my sister on the head with it was not appropriate. Well, 
        Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, always a thief, and now I've got my 
        sights set on that TTB. (My mother returned my six shooter long ago, but 
        I'll need to find some caps for it.)</div>

<div>What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene

          NacTrailCat will probably take offense to the fact you are using the 
          name of one of the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, 
          and I'm betting BootsTex will too! </div>

<div>I am soooo innocent. My character has been defamed

            my letterboxing in Tioga, Texas - birthplace of Gene Autry, the 
            singing cowboy for goodness sake. What could be a more 
            wholesome activity? Then after preparing a lovely dinner and washing 
            the dishes by hand, I sat meekly in my chair, knitting and listening 
            to classical music. All this talk of my attempting to steal that 
            lovely box from that dear young bear is... well... is just 
            slanderous. I may have to have a word with Mother of All Those Many 
            Children for offering my name up in the first place. Whadda ya say, 
            Mo5, wanna meet me for a Shiner in Buffalo, I mean, an iced beverage

                  it has been taken, and <br/>with my wife right here all day!!! 
                  I strongly suggest the Bus make <br/>a return trip very soon, 
                  or no 6th annual event. Somehow this is <br/>your fault IRA!!!

                  its perks; you can meet and chat with <br/>&gt; other ghosts, 
                  some of whom were famous and important mortals. Just <br/>&gt; 
                  the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering 
                  what <br/>&gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to 
                  the Alamo and <br/>found <br/>&gt; him (more properly, his 
                  ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>&gt; dejected. He 
                  was still wearing his old buckskins and that coonskin <br/>&gt; 
                  cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask 
                  me, and <br/>&gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. 
                  Anyway, I asked him <br/>&gt; how he had been doing and he 
                  allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>tol'able, <br/>&gt; except 
                  that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and 
                  <br/>&gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any 
                  old kind would <br/>&gt; do. I told him that there were very 
                  few bears left in Texas <br/>because <br/>&gt; people like him 
                  had killed them all. He said he was sorry about <br/>that 
                  <br/>&gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he 
                  could find a <br/>&gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize 
                  for killing so many of them <br/>in <br/>&gt; his lifetime. I 
                  told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>Houston, 
                  <br/>&gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he 
                  would like to <br/>&gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and 
                  I'd show him where the cub <br/>&gt; lived, if he would promise 
                  that he only wanted to apologize. He <br/>&gt; brightened up at 
                  the prospect and said he'd just take me up on it. <br/>&gt; We 
                  got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of 
                  whom <br/>&gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and 
                  headed for a place <br/>&gt; called Cypress, where I knew the 
                  little bear lived. Pretty soon, <br/>&gt; Davy (or more 
                  properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>&gt; 
                  that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned 
                  to <br/>&gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want 
                  to if they try <br/>hard <br/>&gt; enough. We found the house of 
                  the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>front, <br/>&gt; surveying 
                  the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, for <br/>a 
                  <br/>&gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just 
                  before he got to <br/>&gt; the front door, he thought he heard 
                  something, so he turned to the <br/>&gt; right and ducked under 
                  some bushes. The last I saw of him, he was <br/>&gt; sitting on 
                  top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a grin <br/>on 
                  <br/>&gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what

<div>You're right! I stand corrected. I'm sure you wouldn't want to be associated with IRA Boxer! I wonder how I confused the two? Now that I think back, MO5 thought IRA Boxer might in fact be a stalker, so obviously she wouldn't be <em>his</em> fan.</div>

He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>coonskin <br/>&gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle.

Pretty soon, <br/>&gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>&gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned to <br/>&gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they try <br/>&gt; hard <br/>&gt; &gt; enough.

Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got to <br/>&gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to <br/>the <br/>&gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes.

  &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat with 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals. 
  <br/>Just <br/>&gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and 
  wondering <br/>what <br/>&gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over 
  to the Alamo and <br/>&gt; found <br/>&gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), 
  sitting there looking a little <br/>&gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing 
  his old buckskins and that <br/>coonskin <br/>&gt; &gt; cap which was getting a 
  little scraggly looking, if you ask me, <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; he was cleaning 
  his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked him <br/>&gt; &gt; how he had 
  been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>&gt; tol'able, <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind 
  <br/>would <br/>&gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in 
  Texas <br/>&gt; because <br/>&gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He 
  said he was sorry about <br/>&gt; that <br/>&gt; &gt; and would like to make 
  amends if he could. Maybe he could find a <br/>&gt; &gt; bear, just any old 
  bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>them <br/>&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>&gt; Houston, 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would like 
  to <br/>&gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the 
  cub <br/>&gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. 
  He <br/>&gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up 
  on <br/>it. <br/>&gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, 
  a few of <br/>whom <br/>&gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and 
  headed for a place <br/>&gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear 
  lived. Pretty soon, <br/>&gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took 
  over the wheel and drove <br/>&gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I 
  don't know how he learned to <br/>&gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about 
  anything they want to if they try <br/>&gt; hard <br/>&gt; &gt; enough. We found 
  the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>&gt; front, <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, <br/>for 
  <br/>&gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just 
  before he got to <br/>&gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, 
  so he turned to <br/>the <br/>&gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The 
  last I saw of him, he was <br/>&gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in 
  that long rifle, with a <br/>grin <br/>&gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; his face and a 
  gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had in <br/>&gt; mind.<br/>&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; Holy crap, who stold it!!! My well laid trap for the Bus has been <br/>
&gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place as <br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been taken, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the Bus <br/>
make <br/>
&gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow this is <br/>
&gt; &gt; your fault IRA!!! <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; PS - There is another person in Cypress with my same name, so I <br/>
&gt; hope <br/>
&gt; &gt; you put this at the right house!!!<br/>

&gt; Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering <br/>
&gt; what <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo and <br/>
&gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
&gt; coonskin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/>
him <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
&gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry about <br/>
&gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could find <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would like <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/>
cub <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. He <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on <br/>
&gt; it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of <br/>
&gt; whom <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>
soon, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>
drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/>
try <br/>
&gt; &gt; hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
&gt; &gt; front, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>
&gt; grin <br/>
&gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had in <br/>

&gt;   &gt; Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would <br/>
play "cowboys" as <br/>
&gt;   kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I always <br/>
&gt;   chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the beautiful <br/>
&gt;   school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, I <br/>
&gt;   decided to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the sofa <br/>
&gt;   with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken away <br/>
my "six <br/>
&gt;   shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head with it was <br/>
not <br/>
&gt;   appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, always a <br/>
&gt;   thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My mother <br/>
&gt;   returned my six shooter long ago, but I'll need to find some caps <br/>
for <br/>
&gt;   it.)<br/>

&gt;   &gt; What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene Autry? <br/>

will <br/>
&gt;   probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of one <br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene Autry? <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, NacTrailCat <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt;   probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of one <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, and I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt;   betting BootsTex will too! <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; <br/>

&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place as <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been taken, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the Bus <br/>
&gt; make <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow this <br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; your fault IRA!!! <br/>

&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals. <br/>
&gt; &gt;   Just <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and <br/>
&gt; wondering <br/>
&gt; &gt;   what <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a <br/>
&gt; little <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
&gt; &gt;   coonskin <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   and <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/>
&gt; him <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; tol'able, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>
&gt; &gt;   would <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/>
&gt; find a <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   them <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; Houston, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/>
&gt; like to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/>
&gt; cub <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. <br/>
&gt; He <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt;   it. <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt;   whom <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/>
&gt; place <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>
&gt; soon, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>
&gt; drove <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/>
&gt; try <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; hard <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; front, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/>
&gt; indeed, <br/>
&gt; &gt;   for <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/>
&gt; got to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt;   the <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>
&gt; &gt;   grin <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt;   &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had <br/>

&gt;           Innocent?  Some of these folks MIGHT believe you, Puddle <br/>
Splasher, but I've known you long enough to know better than to <br/>
believe you are every innocent.  Remember, I have first hand <br/>
experience in a second hand sort of way with your sneakiness when it <br/>
comes to this tour bus...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;           What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene <br/>
Autry?  Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, <br/>
NacTrailCat will probably take offense to the fact you are using the <br/>
name of one of the great cowboys as a character reference in <br/>
absentia, and I'm betting BootsTex will too! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;           Personally, I think it's funny you got beat out by a <br/>
clown or a bunny or a ghost or a neighbor, or whoever...<br/>

All this talk of my attempting to steal that lovely box from that <br/>

the Bus has been <br/>
&gt;                   foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in <br/>
such place as <br/>
&gt;                   mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it <br/>
has been taken, and <br/>
&gt;                   with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly <br/>
suggest the Bus make <br/>
&gt;                   a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. <br/>
Somehow this is <br/>
&gt;                   your fault IRA!!! <br/>

meet and chat with <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and <br/>
important mortals. Just <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy <br/>
Crockett and wondering what <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over <br/>
to the Alamo and <br/>
&gt;                   found <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there <br/>
looking a little <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old <br/>
buckskins and that coonskin <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly <br/>
looking, if you ask me, and <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. <br/>
Anyway, I asked him <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how <br/>
he was doin' <br/>
&gt;                   tol'able, <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, <br/>
which was hunting and <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, <br/>
any old kind would <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears <br/>
left in Texas <br/>
&gt;                   because <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he <br/>
was sorry about <br/>
&gt;                   that <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. <br/>
Maybe he could find a <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for <br/>
killing so many of them <br/>
&gt;                   in <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear <br/>
out west of <br/>
&gt;                   Houston, <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him <br/>
if he would like to <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show <br/>
him where the cub <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted <br/>
to apologize. He <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd <br/>
just take me up on it. <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known <br/>
Texans, a few of whom <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and <br/>
headed for a place <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear <br/>
lived. Pretty soon, <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over <br/>
the wheel and drove <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know <br/>
how he learned to <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they <br/>
want to if they try <br/>
&gt;                   hard <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and <br/>
he parked out <br/>
&gt;                   front, <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very <br/>
nice one, indeed, for <br/>
&gt;                   a <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, <br/>
just before he got to <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, <br/>
so he turned to the <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I <br/>
saw of him, he was <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long <br/>
rifle, with a grin <br/>
&gt;                   on <br/>
&gt;                   &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea <br/>
what he had in <br/>
&gt;                   mind.<br/>

<div>It's going to take some fancy maneuvering to get that bus out of Houston and up to the DFW area. I don't know if it's the price of gas or if the bus driver is too timid to make the trip. We'll have to work together up here in the DFW area to allure the bus north (and pull some devious stunt). Not to worry. As Bella Korolli says to his gymnasts (gearing up for the Olympics), <em>you can do it!</em> Maybe it will at least make it to Austin in time for the rally in October.</div>

I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>&gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear.

Pretty <br/>soon, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>drove <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress.

&gt; It's going to take some fancy maneuvering to get that bus out of <br/>
Houston and up to the DFW area. I don't know if it's the price of gas <br/>
or if the bus driver is too timid to make the trip. We'll have to <br/>
work together up here in the DFW area to allure the bus north (and <br/>
pull some devious stunt). Not to worry. As Bella Korolli says to his <br/>
gymnasts (gearing up for the Olympics), you can do it! Maybe it will <br/>
at least make it to Austin in time for the rally in October.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would <br/>
play "cowboys" <br/>
&gt; as <br/>
&gt; &gt; kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I always <br/>
&gt; &gt; chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the beautiful <br/>
&gt; &gt; school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, I <br/>
&gt; &gt; decided to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the sofa <br/>
&gt; &gt; with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken away <br/>
my "six <br/>
&gt; &gt; shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head with it was <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; &gt; appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, always a <br/>
&gt; &gt; thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My mother <br/>
&gt; &gt; returned my six shooter long ago, but I'll need to find some caps <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; it.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene Autry? <br/>
&gt; &gt; Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, NacTrailCat <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of one <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, and I'm <br/>
&gt; &gt; betting BootsTex will too! <br/>

been <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been taken, <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the Bus <br/>
&gt; make <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow this <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your fault IRA!!! <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and <br/>
wondering <br/>
&gt; &gt; what <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a <br/>
little <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
&gt; &gt; coonskin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/>
me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/>
&gt; him <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>
&gt; &gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/>
find <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>
&gt; &gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/>
&gt; cub <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. <br/>
He <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; whom <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/>
place <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>
&gt; soon, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>
&gt; drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/>
&gt; try <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; front, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/>
indeed, <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/>
got <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>
&gt; &gt; grin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>

He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>&gt; &gt; coonskin <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/>me, <br/>&gt; &gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/>&gt; him <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/>&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>&gt; &gt; would <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/>about <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/>find <br/>&gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>&gt; &gt; them <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/>like <br/>&gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/>&gt; cub <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. <br/>He <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/>on <br/>&gt; &gt; it. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; whom <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/>place <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>&gt; soon, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>&gt; drove <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/>&gt; try <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hard <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; front, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/>indeed, <br/>&gt; &gt; for <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/>got <br/>&gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/>&gt; was <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>&gt; &gt; grin <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye.

&gt; The bus is getting seriously overloaded, so I don't how much longer <br/>
&gt; it can remain on the road. Counting the "Bus" stamp, there are 30 <br/>
&gt; stamps, and some of them are really large. I think Baby Bear and <br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle are going to have to contact TeamKing about the capacity <br/>
&gt; of the bus and maybe revise the rules. Maybe someone could bring it <br/>
&gt; to a gathering so everyone could see it.<br/>

&gt; &gt; It's going to take some fancy maneuvering to get that bus out of <br/>
&gt; Houston and up to the DFW area. I don't know if it's the price of gas <br/>
&gt; or if the bus driver is too timid to make the trip. We'll have to <br/>
&gt; work together up here in the DFW area to allure the bus north (and <br/>
&gt; pull some devious stunt). Not to worry. As Bella Korolli says to his <br/>

&gt; at least make it to Austin in time for the rally in October.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of one <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think we should call her Puddle Bozo then - or maybe it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; isn't her at all, but the ghost of Bozo???<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holy crap, who stold it!!! My well laid trap for the Bus has <br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been taken, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the Bus <br/>
&gt; &gt; make <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow this <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your fault IRA!!! <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS - There is another person in Cypress with my same name, so I <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat <br/>
&gt; &gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and <br/>
&gt; wondering <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a <br/>
&gt; little <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/>
&gt; &gt; him <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/>
&gt; &gt; cub <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. <br/>
&gt; He <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whom <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/>
&gt; place <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>
&gt; &gt; soon, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>
&gt; &gt; drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/>
&gt; &gt; try <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/>
&gt; indeed, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/>
&gt; got <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/>
&gt; &gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>

&gt; The bus is getting seriously overloaded, so I don't how much longer <br/>
&gt; it can remain on the road.  Counting the "Bus" stamp, there are 30 <br/>

&gt; Silver Eagle are going to have to contact TeamKing about the <br/>
capacity <br/>

&gt; &gt; It's going to take some fancy maneuvering to get that bus out of <br/>
&gt; Houston and up to the DFW area. I don't know if it's the price of <br/>
gas <br/>
&gt; or if the bus driver is too timid to make the trip. We'll have to <br/>
&gt; work together up here in the DFW area to allure the bus north (and <br/>

always <br/>

beautiful <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-zealousness, <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; decided to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the <br/>
sofa <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken away <br/>
&gt; my "six <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head with it was <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, always a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My mother <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do you think we should call her Puddle Bozo then - or maybe <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; isn't her at all, but the ghost of Bozo???<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holy crap, who stold it!!! My well laid trap for the Bus has <br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place as <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been <br/>
taken, <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the Bus <br/>
&gt; &gt; make <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow this <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your fault IRA!!! <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS - There is another person in Cypress with my same name, so <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hope <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you put this at the right house!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and <br/>
chat <br/>
&gt; &gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important <br/>
mortals. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and <br/>
&gt; wondering <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a <br/>
&gt; little <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/>
&gt; me, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I <br/>
asked <br/>
&gt; &gt; him <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was <br/>
hunting <br/>
&gt; &gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old <br/>
kind <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/>
&gt; find <br/>
&gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; cub <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to <br/>
apologize. <br/>
&gt; He <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whom <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/>
&gt; place <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>
&gt; &gt; soon, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>
&gt; &gt; drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he <br/>
learned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; &gt; try <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/>
&gt; indeed, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/>
&gt; got <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, <br/>
he <br/>
&gt; &gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; grin <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had <br/>
&gt; in <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>

mortals. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and <br/>&gt; wondering <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo <br/>
&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a <br/>&gt; little <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/>&gt; me, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I <br/>
asked <br/>&gt; &gt; him <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was <br/>
hunting <br/>&gt; &gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old <br/>kind <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/>&gt; about <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/>
&gt; find <br/>&gt; &gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; them <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/>&gt; like <br/>&gt; &gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where <br/>
the <br/>&gt; &gt; cub <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to <br/>apologize. <br/>&gt; He <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/>
&gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/>&gt; of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; whom <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/>
&gt; place <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>&gt; &gt; soon, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>&gt; &gt; drove <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he <br/>learned <br/>&gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if <br/>they <br/>&gt; &gt; try <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked <br/>out <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/>
&gt; indeed, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/>&gt; got <br/>&gt; &gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/>
&gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, <br/>he <br/>&gt; &gt; was <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with <br/>
a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; grin <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had <br/>&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Ghost of IRA Boxer<br/>

longer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it can remain on the road. Counting the "Bus" stamp, there are <br/>
30<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Silver Eagle are going to have to contact TeamKing about the<br/>

to<br/>

(and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pull some devious stunt). Not to worry. As Bella Korolli says to<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Innocent? Some of these folks MIGHT believe you, Puddle<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splasher,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I've known you long enough to know better than to <br/>
believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>

&gt; &gt; tour<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene <br/>
Autry?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, <br/>
NacTrailCat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of <br/>
one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, and <br/>
I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; betting BootsTex will too!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I think it's funny you got beat out by a <br/>
clown or<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunny or a ghost or a neighbor, or whoever...<br/>

has<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important<br/>
&gt; &gt; mortals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the <br/>
Alamo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you <br/>
ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was <br/>
doin'<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old<br/>
&gt; &gt; kind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in <br/>
Texas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was <br/>
sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he <br/>
could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so <br/>
many<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take <br/>
me up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a <br/>
few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for <br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. <br/>
Pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he<br/>
&gt; &gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if<br/>
&gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he <br/>
parked<br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he <br/>
turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of <br/>
him,<br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he <br/>

<div>PP, I have a feeling 
that Lucy might have thought you CARVED an angel and a royal Baker as passengers 
to put on the bus, and since someone suggested since the bus was full we switch 
to a circus train she thought it would be a way to fit your stamps into a circus 
theme.  I mean, I have been taking care of 8 kids all week,I sort of feel 
as if I have been abducted by aliens, so I could be way off here.  But 
I bet that is what happened.  MO5</div>

  We'll have <br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; work together up here in the DFW area to

  I<br/>&gt; &gt; always<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chose to be Billy the Kid? 
  Of course she was always the<br/>&gt; &gt; beautiful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my 
  over-<br/>zealousness,<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to 
  rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the<br/>&gt; &gt; sofa<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken 
  away<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my "six<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shooter" and told 
  me hitting my sister on the head with it <br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, 
  <br/>always a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thief, and now I've got my sights set 
  on that TTB. (My <br/>mother<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; returned my six

  ghost), sitting there looking a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; little<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and 
  <br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you <br/>ask<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; me,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  asked<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he 
  had been doing and he allowed as to how he was <br/>doin'<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he 
  missed his favorite pastime, which was<br/>&gt; &gt; hunting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were 
  any bears around, any old<br/>&gt; &gt; kind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were 
  very few bears left in <br/>Texas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them 
  all. He said he was <br/>sorry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make 
  amends if he could. Maybe he <br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and 
  apologize for killing so <br/>many<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he 
  was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he <br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a 
  trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would 
  promise that he only wanted to<br/>&gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  He<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and 
  said he'd just take <br/>me up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other 
  well-known Texans, a <br/>few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  whom<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had 
  heard of, and headed for <br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. 
  <br/>Pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; drove<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to 
  Cypress. I don't know how he<br/>&gt; &gt; learned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they 
  want to if<br/>&gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; hard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the 
  house of the Baby Bear and he <br/>parked<br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the 
  neighborhood, which was a very nice one,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before 
  <br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he 
  <br/>turned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of 
  <br/>him,<br/>&gt; &gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, 
  <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam 
  in his eye. I have no idea what he <br/>had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now isn't it odd that when Viewfinder and I would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; play "cowboys"<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kids, instead of wanting to be Gene Autry or Roy Rogers, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; always<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always the<br/>&gt; &gt; beautiful<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-<br/>zealousness,<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to rob her once, and she ended up with laying on the<br/>&gt; &gt; sofa<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had taken away<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my "six<br/>

mother<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; returned my six shooter long ago, but I'll need to find some<br/>&gt; &gt; caps<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Puddle Splasher<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splasher,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I've known you long enough to know better than to <br/>believe<br/>&gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every innocent. Remember, I have first hand experience in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; second<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand sort of way with your sneakiness when it comes to this<br/>&gt; &gt; tour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bus...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene <br/>
Autry?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, <br/>NacTrailCat<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of <br/>
one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the great cowboys as a character reference in absentia, and <br/>I'm<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; betting BootsTex will too!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I think it's funny you got beat out by a <br/>
clown or<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunny or a ghost or a neighbor, or whoever...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holy crap, who stold it!!! My well laid trap for the Bus <br/>has<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such place <br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has been<br/>
&gt; &gt; taken,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest the <br/>Bus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. Somehow <br/>
this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your fault IRA!!!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS - There is another person in Cypress with my same <br/>name, so<br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; wondering<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the <br/>Alamo<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; little<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and <br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you <br/>ask<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; asked<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was <br/>doin'<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was<br/>
&gt; &gt; hunting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old<br/>&gt; &gt; kind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in <br/>
Texas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was <br/>sorry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he <br/>
could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so <br/>many<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he <br/>
would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take <br/>me up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a <br/>
few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for <br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. <br/>
Pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he<br/>
&gt; &gt; learned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if<br/>&gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he <br/>
parked<br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before <br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he <br/>
turned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of <br/>him,<br/>&gt; &gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, <br/>
with<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he <br/>had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bus is getting seriously overloaded, so I don't how much<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it can remain on the road. Counting the "Bus" stamp, there <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; 30<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamps, and some of them are really large. I think Baby <br/>
Bear and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver Eagle are going to have to contact TeamKing about the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; capacity<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the bus and maybe revise the rules. Maybe someone could <br/>
bring<br/>

out<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston and up to the DFW area. I don't know if it's the <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or if the bus driver is too timid to make the trip. We'll <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work together up here in the DFW area to allure the bus <br/>
north<br/>
&gt; &gt; (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pull some devious stunt). Not to worry. As Bella Korolli <br/>
says to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gymnasts (gearing up for the Olympics), you can do it! <br/>
Maybe it<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Holy crap, who stold it!!! My well laid trap for the <br/>
Bus<br/>
&gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such <br/>
place<br/>
&gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has <br/>
been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taken,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly suggest <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bus<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. <br/>

and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mortals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Alamo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there <br/>
looking a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and<br/>
&gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. <br/>
Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; doin'<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any <br/>
old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Texas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was<br/>
&gt; &gt; sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he<br/>
&gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing <br/>
so<br/>
&gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out <br/>
west<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he<br/>
&gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him <br/>
where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just <br/>
take<br/>
&gt; &gt; me up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known <br/>
Texans, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the <br/>
wheel<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want <br/>
to if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; parked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice <br/>
one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just <br/>
before<br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he<br/>
&gt; &gt; turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; him,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long <br/>
rifle,<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea <br/>
what he<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/>

<div>Eight kids! And I've been whining about having two grand kids at a time at my house all week?</div>
<div>I've been considering what character I could add to the circus train, and was considering a juggler, but MO5, it sounds like you may be better at that talent than me! Eight kids? I'm impressed, but then I always am with you.</div>

</p><div>PP, I have a feeling that Lucy might have thought you CARVED an angel and a royal Baker as passengers to put on the bus, and since someone suggested since the bus was full we switch to a circus train she thought it would be a way to fit your stamps into a circus theme.  I mean, I have been taking care of 8 kids all week,I sort of feel as if I have been abducted by aliens, so I could be way off here.  But I bet that is what happened.  MO5</div>

Maybe someone could bring<br/>&gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to a gathering so everyone could see it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>&lt;letterboxingtexas%<br/>40yahoogroups.<wbr/>com&gt;,<br/>&gt; &gt; "Maribeth Jagger"<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;cjagger405@<wbr/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's going to take some fancy maneuvering to get that bus out <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Houston and up to the DFW area.

I asked him if he <br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to<br/>&gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take <br/>me up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a <br/>few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for <br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. <br/>Pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he<br/>&gt; &gt; learned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if<br/>&gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he <br/>parked<br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before <br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he <br/>turned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of <br/>him,<br/>&gt; &gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye.

</p><div>PP, I have a 
    feeling that Lucy might have thought you CARVED an angel and a royal Baker 
    as passengers to put on the bus, and since someone suggested since the bus 
    was full we switch to a circus train she thought it would be a way to fit 
    your stamps into a circus theme.  I mean, I have been taking care of 8 
    kids all week,I sort of feel as if I have been abducted by aliens, so I 
    could be way off here.  But I bet that is what happened.

      &gt; shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head with it 
      <br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate. 
      Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a thief, <br/>always a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. (My 
      <br/>mother<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; returned my six shooter long ago, 
      but I'll need to find some<br/>&gt; &gt; caps<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Innocent? Some of these folks MIGHT believe you, 
      Puddle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Splasher,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but 
      I've known you long enough to know better than to <br/>believe<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every innocent. 
      Remember, I have first hand experience in a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      second<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand sort of way with your sneakiness 
      when it comes to this<br/>&gt; &gt; tour<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      bus...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      What really gets me, is you call out the name of Gene <br/>Autry?<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal, 
      <br/>NacTrailCat<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      probably take offense to the fact you are using the name of 
      <br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the great cowboys 
      as a character reference in absentia, and <br/>I'm<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; betting BootsTex will too!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I think it's funny you got beat out 
      by a <br/>clown or<br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunny or a 
      ghost or a neighbor, or whoever...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;

      &gt; &gt; Just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was 
      thinking about Davy Crockett and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wondering<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; what<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, 
      so I took a little trip over to the <br/>Alamo<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; little<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was 
      still wearing his old buckskins and <br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      coonskin<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a 
      little scraggly looking, if you <br/>ask<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me,<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning 
      his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I<br/>&gt; &gt; asked<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; him<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing

      tol'able,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his 
      favorite pastime, which was<br/>&gt; &gt; hunting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were 
      any bears around, any old<br/>&gt; &gt; kind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were 
      very few bears left in <br/>Texas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed 
      them all. He said he was <br/>sorry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would 
      like to make amends if he could. Maybe he <br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      find<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, 
      just any old bear, and apologize for killing so <br/>many<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I 
      knew of a bear out west <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      Houston,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby 
      Bear. I asked him if he <br/>would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas 
      Tour Bus and I'd show him where<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      cub<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that 
      he only wanted to<br/>&gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd 
      just take <br/>me up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the 
      other well-known Texans, a <br/>few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; whom<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and 
      some he had heard of, and headed for <br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear 
      lived. <br/>Pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel 
      <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      learned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, 
      but ghosts can do about anything they want to if<br/>&gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he 
      <br/>parked<br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      front,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, 
      which was a very nice one,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before 
      <br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he 
      <br/>turned<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last 
      I saw of <br/>him,<br/>&gt; &gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long

      &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sadly, the bus does fill up, as did the TTB1, and although all 350 <br/>
people on the Texas list may not have had an opportunity to add a <br/>
stamp, what can you do? The box is owned by TeamKing and it's their <br/>
call as to what they would like to do with the box once it fills up. <br/>
Maybe they'll start a TTB THREE! It's all in fun. I never got a <br/>
chance to find the second bus either, but hopefully it will make an <br/>
appearance at some of the upcoming events so I can enjoy the stamps! <br/>
(Remember, that's what we did with the original bus... shortly before <br/>
it went missing.) Puddle Splasher<br/>

&gt; No problem.  Maybe I should have not been so quick to respond but <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; kinda just struck me in a crazy way.  We haven't carved anything <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; the ttb2 yet. (not being sure of what is on it.)  Just would like <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; be able to add to it that's all.  Like the idea of it being about <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; Texas background. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What really gets me, is you call out the name of <br/>
Gene<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Autry?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Although she is much more a Roy Rogers sort of gal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; NacTrailCat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably take offense to the fact you are using the <br/>
&gt; name of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the great cowboys as a character reference in <br/>
absentia, <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; betting BootsTex will too!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I think it's funny you got beat out by a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clown or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunny or a ghost or a neighbor, or whoever...<br/>

the <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; has<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; foiled by some theif, and no Bus is located in such <br/>
&gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in this posting. I can only assume it has <br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taken,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my wife right here all day!!! I strongly <br/>
suggest <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Bus<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a return trip very soon, or no 6th annual event. <br/>
&gt; Somehow<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope<br/>

meet <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and <br/>
important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mortals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Alamo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there <br/>
&gt; looking a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doin'<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, <br/>
any <br/>
&gt; old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears <br/>
left <br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Texas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for <br/>
killing <br/>
&gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; west<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show <br/>
him <br/>
&gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just <br/>
&gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known <br/>
&gt; Texans, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and <br/>
headed <br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear <br/>
lived.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the <br/>
&gt; wheel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want <br/>
&gt; to if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice <br/>
&gt; one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just <br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I <br/>
saw <br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him,<br/>

&gt; Sadly, the bus does fill up, as did the TTB1, and although all 350 <br/>
&gt; people on the Texas list may not have had an opportunity to add a <br/>
&gt; stamp, what can you do? The box is owned by TeamKing and it's their <br/>
&gt; call as to what they would like to do with the box once it fills <br/>
up. <br/>
&gt; Maybe they'll start a TTB THREE! It's all in fun. I never got a <br/>
&gt; chance to find the second bus either, but hopefully it will make an <br/>
&gt; appearance at some of the upcoming events so I can enjoy the <br/>
stamps! <br/>
&gt; (Remember, that's what we did with the original bus... shortly <br/>
before <br/>
&gt; it went missing.) Puddle Splasher<br/>

&gt; &gt; No problem.  Maybe I should have not been so quick to respond but <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; kinda just struck me in a crazy way.  We haven't carved anything <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; the ttb2 yet. (not being sure of what is on it.)  Just would like <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; be able to add to it that's all.  Like the idea of it being about <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chose to be Billy the Kid? Of course she was always <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; school marm. It was a lot of fun until in my over-<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to rob her once, and she ended up with <br/>
laying <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sofa<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with an ice pack on her head, and our mother had <br/>
&gt; taken <br/>
&gt; &gt; away<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my "six<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shooter" and told me hitting my sister on the head <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; it<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appropriate. Well, Lucy, what can I say? Once a <br/>
thief,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thief, and now I've got my sights set on that TTB. <br/>
(My<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can <br/>
&gt; meet <br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chat<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and <br/>
&gt; important<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mortals.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy <br/>
Crockett <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wondering<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Alamo<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there <br/>
&gt; &gt; looking a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old <br/>
buckskins <br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly <br/>
looking, <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Anyway, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how <br/>
he <br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doin'<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, <br/>
which <br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hunting<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, <br/>
&gt; any <br/>
&gt; &gt; old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kind<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears <br/>
&gt; left <br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Texas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he <br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sorry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. <br/>
Maybe <br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for <br/>
&gt; killing <br/>
&gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear <br/>
&gt; out <br/>
&gt; &gt; west<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show <br/>
&gt; him <br/>
&gt; &gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; &gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known <br/>
&gt; &gt; Texans, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and <br/>
&gt; headed <br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear <br/>
&gt; lived.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; wheel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they <br/>
want <br/>
&gt; &gt; to if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and <br/>
he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very <br/>
nice <br/>
&gt; &gt; one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; &gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I <br/>
&gt; saw <br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long <br/>
&gt; &gt; rifle,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grin<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/>

&gt; Maybe the log book pages could be scanned or photographed and placed <br/>
&gt; on this site somewhere for everyone to see?  Just a thought.  The log <br/>
&gt; book is more like a scrapbook, with a lot of creative pages and <br/>
&gt; information about all the passengers.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; Sadly, the bus does fill up, as did the TTB1, and although all 350 <br/>
&gt; &gt; people on the Texas list may not have had an opportunity to add a <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp, what can you do? The box is owned by TeamKing and it's their <br/>
&gt; &gt; call as to what they would like to do with the box once it fills <br/>
&gt; up. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe they'll start a TTB THREE! It's all in fun. I never got a <br/>
&gt; &gt; chance to find the second bus either, but hopefully it will make an <br/>
&gt; &gt; appearance at some of the upcoming events so I can enjoy the <br/>
&gt; stamps! <br/>

&gt; &gt; it went missing.) Puddle Splasher<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; No problem.  Maybe I should have not been so quick to respond but <br/>
&gt; &gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kinda just struck me in a crazy way.  We haven't carved anything <br/>
&gt; &gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the ttb2 yet. (not being sure of what is on it.)  Just would like <br/>
&gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be able to add to it that's all.  Like the idea of it being about <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Texas<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. <br/>
&gt; Maybe <br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for <br/>
&gt; &gt; killing <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear <br/>
&gt; &gt; out <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; west<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him <br/>
&gt; if <br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show <br/>
&gt; &gt; him <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cub<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted <br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; apologize.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd <br/>
&gt; just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Texans, a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and <br/>
&gt; &gt; headed <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear <br/>
&gt; &gt; lived.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; soon,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wheel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know <br/>
&gt; how <br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they <br/>
&gt; want <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and <br/>
&gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parked<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very <br/>
&gt; nice <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indeed,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, <br/>
&gt; just <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turned<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I <br/>
&gt; &gt; saw <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rifle,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea <br/>

 <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering <br/>&gt; what <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo and <br/>&gt; &gt; found <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/>&gt; coonskin <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, <br/>&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/>him <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>&gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/>&gt; would <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>&gt; &gt; because <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had
 killed them all. He said he was sorry about <br/>&gt; &gt; that <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could find <br/>a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/>&gt; them <br/>&gt; &gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>&gt; &gt; Houston, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would like <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/>cub <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. He <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on <br/>&gt; it. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of <br/>&gt; whom <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/>soon,
 <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/>drove <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/>try <br/>&gt; &gt; hard <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>&gt; &gt; front, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, <br/>&gt; for <br/>&gt; &gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/>was <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/>&gt; grin <br/>&gt; &gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had in <br/>&gt; &gt; mind.<br/>&gt;

 &gt; &gt; you put this at the right house!!!<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Down and Out in Cypress, Texas<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "iraboxer" <br/> &gt; &lt;iraboxer@&gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat <br/> &gt; &gt; with <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals. <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; Just <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and <br/> &gt; wondering <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; what <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo <br/> &gt; and <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him (more properly, his
 ghost), sitting there looking a <br/> &gt; little <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dejected. He was still wearing his old buckskins and that <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; coonskin <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask <br/> &gt; me, <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; and <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle. Anyway, I asked <br/> &gt; &gt; him <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tol'able, <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting <br/> &gt; &gt; and <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; would <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do. I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people like him had killed them all. He said he was sorry <br/> &gt; about
 <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and would like to make amends if he could. Maybe he could <br/> &gt; find <br/> &gt; &gt; a <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; them <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his lifetime. I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Houston, <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear. I asked him if he would <br/> &gt; like <br/> &gt; &gt; to <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the <br/> &gt; &gt; cub <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize. <br/> &gt; He <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up <br/> &gt; on <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; it. <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few <br/> &gt; of <br/>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; whom <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a <br/> &gt; place <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived. Pretty <br/> &gt; &gt; soon, <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and <br/> &gt; &gt; drove <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that bus all the way to Cypress. I don't know how he learned <br/> &gt; to <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they <br/> &gt; &gt; try <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hard <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough. We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; front, <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, <br/> &gt; indeed, <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; for <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear. Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he <br/> &gt; got <br/> &gt; &gt; to
 <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned <br/> &gt; to <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; the <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; right and ducked under some bushes. The last I saw of him, he <br/> &gt; &gt; was <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; grin <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his face and a gleam in his eye. I have no idea what he had <br/> &gt; in <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Ghost of IRA Boxer<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -- <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/> &gt; &gt; &gt;

It's got quite a few stamps and you may not want to clutter your regular book with these stamps. Up to you though and how you manage your book...but I thought I'd throw it out there for everyone to think about.<br/>
