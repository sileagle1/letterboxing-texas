<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I have just listed the 
clues for the first five boxes in what promises to be a spectacular display of 
Texas Talent! (See Mythical Creatures, the Beginning on LBNA and 
AQ.) I listed each carver in the text of the clues, if someone knows a 
better way to do it, please let me know.  My plan is to continue the series 
with 5 more boxes in each of the next two sections of Terry Hershey Park, so 
when all are in place it can either be done in three parts, or for those with 
more stamina (ahem, Runsforchocolate) all at once.  Hike lengths are listed 
from the car and back to the parking.</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I want to again thank 
everyone who has contributed a box to this series...what talents we have lurking 
out there in the bushes!  I also want to thank my buddies Teamking and 
dewberry for walking the trails with me as I was writing the clues, and making 
sure I didn't mix up my left and right (which I have been known to do on more 
than one occasion!)  I am waiting on 2 more boxes to arrive in the mail, 
and I will be ready to plant the next section in the series.  And if you 
would still like to be a part of the longest series in Texas...please let me 
know!  There is always room for one (or five or six :) more!  Again, 
thanks you all, and come on down to Houston for some fun!
