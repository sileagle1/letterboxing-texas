                    <div class="plaintext-content">On Saturday my friend and I went looking for this box at Brackenridge<br>
Park.  We found the other one in the area, and went on to look for<br>
this one.  We found a tree with black paint on it, next to a tree with<br>
green paint on it.  We found the trail.  We found the fallen logs.  We<br>
found the 5 foot stump.  There was no box there.  <br>
Then, we ran into the Nelson clan!  We saw them at the location where<br>
we found the previous box.  We interrupted them and introduced<br>
ourselves and then searched for "Go Spurs Go" together, as we thought<br>
maybe they'd see something we didn't and help us find it.  They<br>
followed the clues and came to the same spot we'd been before, no box.<br>
 They dug around with a stick and turned over a few logs, but no box.  <br>
<br>
I took a picture of the empty hole:<br>

I don't know if you recognize the stump . . . <br>
<br>
I don't know if that helps or not.  <br>
