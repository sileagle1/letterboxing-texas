                    <div class="plaintext-content">Saturday...in spite of the HORRIBLE ice, snow, freezing rain and 10 inches of snow in Hickory, NC many braved the elements to come to the Movie Madness event.  Lots of cancellations including the park they had being closed.<br/>
<br/>
We were not able to get out to the box that had been planted in her memory and were disappointed about that but Mama Wolfe carved a beautiful image and also had a vase there in her memory.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry I didn't get to meet Janet, but can tell you she was loved by the NC folks and remembered fondly.<br/>
<br/>
Ohioan Sandy who went to NC for some warmer weather and found a winter storm unlike I have seen in 28 years!!<br/>
<br/>
The blessing of it was however was meeting some great new folks, our electricity never flickered, the hotel didn't run out of coffee (you know I am married to Coffee Mug), their heat and laundry held up and we had the great company of Safari Man and his wife as well.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping to see some of you in March when visiting out son.<br/>
