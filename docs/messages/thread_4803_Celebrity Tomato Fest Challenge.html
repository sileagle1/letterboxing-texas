<br/>sign up.  I'll need to know your team and your Team Name, and how many adults and kids are on your team.
<br/>
<br/>If you have signed up and haven't yet given me that information (signing up doesn't count, I need a little more than that, as I've mentioned in 
<br/>the messages I've sent out), send me a message this weekend.
<br/>
<br/>I'll close registration on Monday, which includes deleting anyone I haven't heard from.  Hate to be that way, but we need to start focusing 
<br/>our plan....bwaaahaaahaaaa!</p></body></html>
