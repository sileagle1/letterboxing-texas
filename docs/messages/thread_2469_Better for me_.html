You participate in a world of dog shows where dogs are constantly<br>
being judged for every little detail, measured against an<br>
"ideal"--size, coat, teeth, manner, walk, etc.  Why judge one dog<br>
"better" than another?  To a lot of us, that seems very<br>
arbitrary--different judges have different "ideals" after all.<br>
<br>
Similarly, there is an "ideal" letterbox FOR MY FAMILY.  I am fine if<br>
people want to put their best efforts out there, and I'd probably,<br>
given enough time (a biggie), money (another biggie) & energy (another<br>
biggie), go find them, even if they were far from MY ideal.  <br>
<br>
But, I don't have unlimited time, money & energy. So, I try to, the<br>
best I can, seek out those boxes that call to me. . .and because of<br>
that, I make different choices when it is just me and when it is the<br>
whole family, when I'm traveling or when I'm here, and so on, down a<br>
long list of admittedly subjective criteria.  I throw in some wild<br>
cards, and I try to find boxes from as many placers as I can, and I<br>
try to seek out new placers when I can, because I want to be<br>
encouraging of people who are just getting their toes into this hobby.<br>
<br>
And I find that I like thoughtful letterboxers--people who have given <br>
<br>
some thought to finding a special location, even if it just has<br>
meaning to them <br>
some thought to the stamp (custom, store bought or hand carved) and<br>
why it should go in that location, <br>
some thought into improving their carving skills<br>
some thought to the clues and how to make them fun for the finder,<br>
some thought to how to make the logbook fit with the box theme, and <br>
some thought to whether it is a pleasant walk and<br>
some thought to a good hiding place. <br>
<br>
And I don't get why that's such a negative.<br>

<br>
 I often wondered why people from different regions can not see that <br>
not all letterboxs or geocaches can be the same as their region. Our <br>
region is hot and dry with lots of miles between towns and cities. We <br>
are just thrilled when we get a new letterbox or geocache even if we <br>
have to drive fifty to two hundred miles for the chance to look for it. <br>
And Yes I have driven that far, if not futher to look for one. I'm <br>
artistic but not in the media of carving my own stamps, therefore, <br>
sorry my personal stamp is store bought, but is shows my native West <br>
Texan character very well! So everyone keep on planting those <br>
letterboxs, and there will be people like me, who will come and look <br>
for them reguardles if they are handcarved or store bought stamps. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, my mistake.  I apologize.  I'm completely unsure now why it<br>
matters that the dog was rolling in goose poop then if it is solely<br>
about performance and coat condition matters not one whit.  Surely<br>
Green Danes can perform as well as White ones (funny story, though).<br>
<br>
And, I throw up my hands and give up trying to make anyone see there<br>
is any viewpoint other than their own.  I strongly believe that there<br>
is room for a lot of different approaches to letterboxing (and life),<br>
but I am sick and tired of being a lonely passenger on that train.<br>
<br>
Sooooooooo, for the sake of my own blood pressure and sanity, I think<br>
I will take sage advice received elsewhere and give myself an extended<br>
break from posting (not necessarily reading) what I perceive as an<br>
increasingly angry and divisive list.  <br>
<br>
I tried very hard to offer support, encouragement and even advice when<br>
asked, especially to new boxers, but clearly, I have been an<br>
ineffective communicator.  Anyone who wants to can email me at my<br>
personal email or I can be reached through AQ.  Get me there or on the<br>
gulfcoast boxers list.<br>
<br>
Now everyone have fun and go plant (and find) some boxes!  <br>

<div>Dewberry, </div>
<div>I'm very sorry for everyone on this list that the Texasletterbox readers 
won't be able to enjoy your funny sense of humor and benefit from your 
experience and reasonable point of view for awhile, but keep this in mind:  
it only takes a few very vocal and angry voices to sound like an angry mob, and 
most of the Texas boxers are actually reasonable, quiet people who just like 
letterboxing and don't get all riled up when someone makes a comment they don't 
personally agree with (or maybe don't understand).  Your contributions to 
Texas letterboxing speak louder than angry voices, and will probably last 
longer, too. </div>
