                    <html><body><div>I really can get a lot done in the evening if I put my mind to it.  It's just that most of the time I choose not to put my mind to it.  Tuesday evening though, I walked out of the office to an unseasonably cool (80 something - I never thought I woulda called that cool) non-raining evening.  I had been planning to wait until SJZ got here to go find JBK's July Holiday Series, but the call of the fresh air overcame me.  I quick ran back inside and printed off the clues and then realized - I still had to go home and get my LB backpack.  Got home and then decided to go ahead and change clothes and put on my new hiking shoes so I could start breaking them in.  I was back in the car in five minutes flat, got my clues out and pulled out of the driveway, when I realized - one of these clues was a puzzle.  Yikes.  I had forgotten about that.  I realized I was also really, really hungry, so I opted to go somewhere and grab a bite to eat and work the clue out.  Thankfully I got one of those waiters that knows just when to interrupt and when to fill glasses and take plates silently.  I finished the clue and tipped him really well for not bugging me - I didn't SAY that, but since he seemed to be a reasonably intelligent fellow, I'm sure he figured it out.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I set out to the site of the puzzle clue, only to find someone parked right in the way!  Grrrr!  I circled the block three times, glaring at him the second time.  He must've gotten the idea because he glared back the third time.  But he still didn't leave.  I decided to go get the groceries I needed to buy before SJZ got in and come back.  I had the presence of mind NOT to go to Walmart, where I would surely take twice as long because I would have to stop and talk to half the people there, so the shopping went relatively quickly!  I debated getting perishables or not, but decided I was going to have one shot at the grocery store only, so I'd better go ahead and get everything.  Milk, cheese, meat, you name it...the catch was, I'm driving a two door at the moment, and my trunk is full of cub scout stuff, so I had to throw most of the groceries in on top of my letterboxing stuff, and the perishables I put in the back on a bag of ice I bought in case I wound up being gone longer than I hoped.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the meantime, our friend called and told me to come out and get some fresh blueberries - picked that day.  Not being one to pass up free fresh blueberries, and knowing SJZ absolutely worships blueberries, I figured I had better allow time for that.  I ventured out to their house and while on my way, kept an eye out for a place to leave a box I've been carrying around to plant.  No luck on that front, but the blueberries were melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's a lot harder to find a place for an all-wrong box than it is to find a place for a just-right box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the time I was on my way back to town, I figured I could for sure go back and stare down that man if he was still there, when my phone rang - again.  This time it was a lady who was expecting to meet me at my house to pick some stuff up that I had given away to her on Freecycle.  Yeesh.  As I hightailed it back to the house, I remembered - I didn't have to go home because I had pulled it out on the porch!  Yea!  I called her back and told her what to grab and I changed course yet again to head back to my showdown with the parking guy.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to the parking spot where he had been and I must confess I was almost disappointed to see that he was gone.  But he was.  I ventured out to follow the clues, dribbling grapes on the ground as I did.  I quickly retrieved the box and was certainly NOT disappointed by the image.  Nice - very appropriate.  I was a little worried about being stealthy because I could see someone moving in a window nearby, but as far as I could tell, they had no idea I was where I was doing what I was doing.  We can hope anyway.   I chunked my stuff back in on top of my groceries, and off we went.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I headed out to find the Parents Day box, and that's where things got a little rough.  I learned at least one lesson today - wearing an orange t-shirt is NOT conducive to stealth!  I approached where I thought the box would be (on short runs, I try to remember the clues because it seems like reading the clues from a sheet of paper seems more obvious than a strange woman rooting around in the local green growth) and found it wasn't there!   Wasn't there?  JBK JUST planted it!  I checked and checked again, trying very hard to keep on the side of the tree away from the houses and more importantly, the people in them.  Finally, I shrugged my shoulders and conceded it was gone.  I returned to the car and got in, and then happened to re-read the clues.  Yep.  I had left out a step.  In the meantime, some guy pulled up next to me.  As I got out to nonchalantly go sit at a table and sketch the trees, I got the idea to grab some cheese out of a grocery bag and a couple pieces of bread and pretend to eat too.  The bread was already squished. He got out and nonchalantly followed me to the table as I nonchalantly ate (and being already full, I ate very slowly).  He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was enjoying the nice evening.  He pointed to my stuff and asked again what I was doing.  "Oh this?" I asked innocently.  I then proceeded to explain that I am an amateur artist and I was inspired by the lovely park and decided to draw while I ate.  He wasn't buying it, but he went back to his car and left.  Soon, a police car passed by, then passed by again.  Finally it stopped and a cop got out and sauntered over.  Now I DO live in a small town and I know a lot of the cops - went to school with them, babysat them, coached their kids in soccer, taught their boys in scouts.  My bro-in-law was a local cop for awhile, I work with one cop's mother.  But I didn't know this guy.  To his credit, he took a pretty low key approach (I mean, how much of a threat is a middle-aged overweight white woman in a park during daylight?), but he was very curious what I was doing (I think the other guy must've seen me fishing around in the bushes in my orange t-shirt, so he was wondering what I was doing), so I fed him the art story.  He eventually roamed back to his car and left, and I quickly stamped in and left too.  
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Off I went to a nearby box, Cow Day, and I proceeded to grab it and stamp in on the hood of my car.  What do you know, but the same cop cruised by again!  He asked what I was doing NOW, and I tried the art story again.  He laughed and said he didn't believe me the first time and didn't believe me this time either.  His buddy pulled up in an unmarked car and the first guy nodded toward me and said "She's an artist" (in a way that conveyed "she's not an artist").  The other officer got out of his car and when he stood up, I realized I DID know him.  We hugged and said our "Hi, How are ya's?"  Now he and my bro-in-law have been friends since high school, so there was a day when I hauled them around so they could pretend they were cool enough to have an older chick that wasn't their sister drive them around.  He looked at my logbook and said "You're not an artist.  You're playing that hiding game aren't you?"  He knows my sis-in-law and knows that we sometimes box together, although whatever discussion had transpired between my bro-in-law and him was clearly along the lines of indulging the loonies.  He proceeded to explain to his cohort what I was doing (although he didn't get it very much right and I didn't feel inclined to straighten him out).  The other guy asked a few questions and my friend answered them and I sat there feeling like the Village Idiot, drooling while someone patiently explained to someone else why I kept running off with the villagers' shoes or something.  I had already finished up stamping in when the first guy rolled up, so while they talked I casually buttoned up the box.  I stood there a few more minutes while they shot the breeze and finally I said, "Are we good to go?"  My friend turned and said "Sure, but don't you have to hide something?"  I told them I wasn't going to hide it with them right there and they moaned about "no big deal" and so forth.  Finally, I went and hid it in the wrong place and they happily drove off and I drove off, rounded the block and quickly moved it to the right place.  And on to the next box...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I knew I wasn't going to be able to get one of the July boxes, so I was down to the last one for the day and it was very duskish by then.  The area of town used to be a modest yet respectable area, but it has slowly deteriorated as years have gone by.  If you've read the clues for JBK's Ice Cream Month box of the July series, she talks about this park. I remember something along the same lines as JBK - but my babysitter lived in that neighborhood, so I got to play on the rocket every day.  The rocket is gone and the park isn't the same, but it still brings back memories.  I was hesitant to go, but I felt like there was enough light that I wouldn't have to worry and if I got there and didn't like the vibes, I could always keep on going and come back in full daylight.  No vibes hit, so I got out and parked, and paused to enjoy the sounds of a quiet neighborhood.  Many of the houses aren't air-conditioned, so they had their doors open and some of them were just finishing supper.  I could hear dishes clanking together and pots and pans banging, and smell the aroma of fried-whatever.  And I could hear families talking vaguely to one another.  The sounds of life slowing down for the evening.  Sweet.  Sadly, I also know that within a few blocks of that park, the drug and gang elements were poised, waiting to come to life after the sun went down.  Even small towns aren't exempt from big worries.  ANYWAY, I quickly found the box and began stamping in, when suddenly the odd thought hit, and I wondered what I would do if I had another police encounter.  And then I wondered if they were back at the station talking about that crazy Lucy character that roams the town digging in bushes for hidden treasures.  No further encounters happened and I got in my car and happily found my way home, where I unloaded groceries and got ready for SJZ to show up.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, I was NOT the first finder on any of these boxes - nor was Gryzzled Gryphon.  Nooo...Texas Dragonfly was FF on every one of them, and Pawtrekker (one of my Girl Scout friends) was second, making July 2nd a very busy letterboxing day in Jacksonville!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a side note, SJZ and I headed out Tuesday evening and found the fifth of the series (Pawtrekker being FF).  It seems her far too sensible b/f doesn't let her play in the rain, so we took advantage of the opportunity and went and found the box and then splashed around in the rain for awhile.  Who says growing up is no fun?

<div><font size="2">When I was living in Newtown, Connecticut, I bought a book about the town's history. Back when the town was established in the 1700's, a citizen could be paid 16 shillings by the town if he provided care for one of the village idiots. I loved that story. Often when my husband would do something that seemed less than sensible in my way of thinking, I would tell him I was going down to the town hall to apply for my 16 shillings. Now I'm thinking I may have to move to East Texas so I can continue to add to my earnings.</font></div>

it.  Tuesday evening though, I walked out of the office to an
unseasonably cool (80 something - I never thought I woulda called that cool)
non-raining evening.  I had been planning to wait until SJZ got here to go
find JBK's July Holiday Series, but the call of the fresh air overcame
me.  I quick ran back inside and printed off the clues and then realized -
I still had to go home and get my LB backpack.  Got home and then decided
to go ahead and change clothes and put on my new hiking shoes so I could start
breaking them in.  I was back in the car in five minutes flat, got my
clues out and pulled out of the driveway, when I realized - one of these clues
was a puzzle.  Yikes.  I had forgotten about that.  I realized I
was also really, really hungry, so I opted to go somewhere and grab a bite to
eat and work the clue out.  Thankfully I got one of those waiters that
knows just when to interrupt and when to fill glasses and take plates
silently.  I finished the clue and tipped him really well for not bugging
me - I didn't SAY that, but since he seemed to be a reasonably intelligent
fellow, I'm sure he figured it out.  <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I set out to the site of the puzzle clue, only to find
someone parked right in the way!  Grrrr!  I circled the block three
times, glaring at him the second time.  He must've gotten the idea because
he glared back the third time.  But he still didn't leave.  I decided
to go get the groceries I needed to buy before SJZ got in and come back. 
I had the presence of mind NOT to go to Walmart, where I would surely take
twice as long because I would have to stop and talk to half the people there,
so the shopping went relatively quickly!  I debated getting perishables or
not, but decided I was going to have one shot at the grocery store only, so I'd
better go ahead and get everything.  Milk, cheese, meat, you name
it...the catch was, I'm driving a two door at the moment, and my trunk is full
of cub scout stuff, so I had to throw most of the groceries in on top of my
letterboxing stuff, and the perishables I put in the back on a bag of ice I
bought in case I wound up being gone longer than I hoped. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">In the meantime, our friend called and told me to come out
and get some fresh blueberries - picked that day.  Not being one to pass
up free fresh blueberries, and knowing SJZ absolutely worships blueberries, I
figured I had better allow time for that.  I ventured out to their
house and while on my way, kept an eye out for a place to leave a box I've been
carrying around to plant.  No luck on that front, but the blueberries were
melt-in-your-mouth wonderful. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">It's a lot harder to find a place for an all-wrong box than
it is to find a place for a just-right box.<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the time I was on my way back to town, I figured I could
for sure go back and stare down that man if he was still there, when my phone
rang - again.  This time it was a lady who was expecting to meet me at my
house to pick some stuff up that I had given away to her on Freecycle. 
Yeesh.  As I hightailed it back to the house, I remembered - I didn't have
to go home because I had pulled it out on the porch!  Yea!  I called
her back and told her what to grab and I changed course yet again to head back
to my showdown with the parking guy.  <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I got to the parking spot where he had been and I must
confess I was almost disappointed to see that he was gone.  But he
was.  I ventured out to follow the clues, dribbling grapes on the ground
as I did.  I quickly retrieved the box and was certainly NOT disappointed
by the image.  Nice - very appropriate.  I was a little worried about
being stealthy because I could see someone moving in a window nearby, but as
far as I could tell, they had no idea I was where I was doing what I was
doing.  We can hope anyway.   I chunked my stuff back in on top
of my groceries, and off we went. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I headed out to find the Parents Day box, and that's where
things got a little rough.  I learned at least one lesson today -
wearing an orange t-shirt is NOT conducive to stealth!  I approached where
I thought the box would be (on short runs, I try to remember the clues because
it seems like reading the clues from a sheet of paper seems more obvious than a
strange woman rooting around in the local green growth) and found it wasn't
there!   Wasn't there?  JBK JUST planted it!  I checked and
checked again, trying very hard to keep on the side of the tree away from the
houses and more importantly, the people in them.  Finally, I shrugged my
shoulders and conceded it was gone.  I returned to the car and got in, and
then happened to re-read the clues.  Yep.  I had left out a
step.  In the meantime, some guy pulled up next to me.  As I got out
to nonchalantly go sit at a table and sketch the trees, I got the idea to grab
some cheese out of a grocery bag and a couple pieces of bread and pretend
to eat too.  The bread was already squished. He got out and nonchalantly
followed me to the table as I nonchalantly ate (and being already full, I ate
very slowly).  He asked me what I was doing and I told him I was enjoying
the nice evening.  He pointed to my stuff and asked again what I was
doing.  "Oh this?" I asked innocently.  I then proceeded to
explain that I am an amateur artist and I was inspired by the lovely park and
decided to draw while I ate.  He wasn't buying it, but he went back to his
car and left.  Soon, a police car passed by, then passed by again. 
Finally it stopped and a cop got out and sauntered over.  Now I DO live in
a small town and I know a lot of the cops - went to school with them, babysat
them, coached their kids in soccer, taught their boys in scouts.  My
bro-in-law was a local cop for awhile, I work with one cop's mother.  But
I did! n't know this guy.  To his credit, he took a pretty low key
approach (I mean, how much of a threat is a middle-aged overweight white woman
in a park during daylight?), but he was very curious what I was doing (I think
the other guy must've seen me fishing around in the bushes in my orange
t-shirt, so he was wondering what I was doing), so I fed him the art
story.  He eventually roamed back to his car and left, and I
quickly stamped in and left too.  <br clear="all"/>
<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Off I went to a nearby box, Cow Day, and I proceeded to grab
it and stamp in on the hood of my car.  What do you know, but the same cop
cruised by again!  He asked what I was doing NOW, and I tried the art
story again.  He laughed and said he didn't believe me the first time and
didn't believe me this time either.  His buddy pulled up in an unmarked
car and the first guy nodded toward me and said "She's an
artist" (in a way that conveyed "she's not
an artist").  The other officer got out of his car and when he
stood up, I realized I DID know him.  We hugged and said our "Hi, How
are ya's?"  Now he and my bro-in-law have been friends since high
school, so there was a day when I hauled them around so they could pretend they
were cool enough to have an older chick that wasn't their sister drive them around. 
He looked at my logbook and said "You're not an artist.  You're
playing that hiding game aren't you?"  He knows my sis-in-law and
knows that we sometimes box together, although whatever discussion had
transpired between my bro-in-law and him was clearly along the lines of
indulging the loonies.  He proceeded to explain to his cohort what I was
doing (although he didn't get it very much right and I didn't feel inclined to
straighten him out).  The other guy asked a few questions and my friend
answered them and I sat there feeling like the Village Idiot, drooling while
someone patiently explained to someone else why I kept running off with the
villagers' shoes or something.  I had already finished up stamping in when
the first guy rolled up, so while they talked I casually buttoned up the
box.  I stood there a few more minutes while they shot the breeze and
finally I said, "Are we good to go?"  My friend turned and said
"Sure, but don't you have to hide something?"  I told them I
wasn't going to hi! de it wi th them right there and they moaned about "no
big deal" and so forth.  Finally, I went and hid it in the wrong
place and they happily drove off and I drove off, rounded the block and quickly
moved it to the right place.  And on to the next box... <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I knew I wasn't going to be able to get one of the July
boxes, so I was down to the last one for the day and it was very duskish by
then.  The area of town used to be a modest yet respectable area, but it
has slowly deteriorated as years have gone by.  If you've read the clues
for JBK's Ice Cream Month box of the July series, she talks about this park. I
remember something along the same lines as JBK - but my babysitter lived in
that neighborhood, so I got to play on the rocket every day.  The rocket
is gone and the park isn't the same, but it still brings back memories.  I
was hesitant to go, but I felt like there was enough light that I wouldn't
have to worry and if I got there and didn't like the vibes, I could always keep
on going and come back in full daylight.  No vibes hit, so I got out and
parked, and paused to enjoy the sounds of a quiet neighborhood.  Many of
the houses aren't air-conditioned, so they had their doors open and some of
them were just finishing supper.  I could hear dishes clanking together and
pots and pans banging, and smell the aroma of fried-whatever.  And I could
hear families talking vaguely to one another.  The sounds of life slowing
down for the evening.  Sweet.  Sadly, I also know that within a few
blocks of that park, the drug and gang elements were poised, waiting to come to
life after the sun went down.  Even small towns aren't exempt from big
worries.  ANYWAY, I quickly found the box and began stamping in, when
suddenly the odd thought hit, and I wondered what I would do if I had another
police encounter.  And then I wondered if they were back at the station
talking about that crazy Lucy character that roams the town digging in bushes
for hidden treasures.  No further encounters happened and I got in my car
and happily found my way home, where I unloaded groceries and got ready for SJZ
to show up. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">By the way, I was NOT the first finder on any of these boxes
- nor was Gryzzled Gryphon.  Nooo...Texas Dragonfly was FF on every one of
them, and Pawtrekker (one of my Girl Scout friends) was second, making July 2nd
a very busy letterboxing day in Jacksonville! <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal"> <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">As a side note, SJZ and I headed out Tuesday evening and
found the fifth of the series (Pawtrekker being FF).  It seems her far too
sensible b/f doesn't let her play in the rain, so we took advantage of the
opportunity and went and found the box and then splashed around in the rain for
awhile.  Who says growing up is no fun? <o:p></o:p></p>
