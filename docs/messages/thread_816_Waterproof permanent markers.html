<div>If you are looking for waterproof 
permanent markers to use for coloring our handcarved stamps, I recommend the Zig 
Memory System markers.  They are water based making them "rubber 
friendly".  Other permanent markers (i.e. Sharpies, Prismacolor, etc.) are 
solvent based and will eventually break down the rubber, unless the stamps are 
properly cleaned and conditioned after using these markers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They are a bit on the expensive 
side, but are well worth the extra money.  The retail price is usually 
around $3.00 each.  They come in many colors.  These can be readily 
found in scrapbooking and craft stores.  They come in dual tips with a fine 
tip on one end and a bullet tip on the other and in a brush tip.  The pigment ink is acid free, archival quality, lightfast, 
waterproof, fade proof and non-bleeding.   They are put out by EK 
Success.  I found a good selection of them at  <a href="http://store.scrapbooking-warehouse.com/brushables.html">http://store.scrapbooking-warehouse.com/brushables.html</a>  
and <a href="http://store.scrapbooking-warehouse.com/zigwriterpens.html">http://store.scrapbooking-warehouse.com/zigwriterpens.html</a>  
(nope, I'm not affiliated with them, but I have ordered from them and have 
received great service.  They offer $5.99 flat rate 
shipping)</div>
