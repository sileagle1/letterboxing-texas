<div>I remember our first Christmas away from home - we were in Southern California.  We had no family around and it was sunny and warm (that was back in the old days when it actually got cold in Texas in the wintertime!) and it just didn't seem like Christmas.  I still have a picture of us sitting in shopping carts (don't recall why, but I'm guessing alcohol was involved) in shorts with the ocean in the background.

<div>Fearless Fox was in the Navy and we thought it seemed fitting that we have a bunch of the native Texas guys from his ship over for dinner, but all those Texas twangs just made me more lonesome!</div>
