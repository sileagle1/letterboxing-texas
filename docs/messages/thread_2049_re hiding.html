<div>Oh, that every 
letterboxer (or letterboxer for the moment)  out there would take the time 
to look at the pictures in the link dewberry posted.  Out of the 
last 4 boxes we have found, only one was actually re hidden, one we could 
actually see from the car.  (Remember, this is Houston, a lot of our boxes 
are in urban locations.)  As someone who has had a fair number of boxes go 
missing I also implore everyone to take an extra few minutes to make sure the 
box is really hidden when you walk away from it.  Maybe we should start a 
boot camp for new boxers, but instead of target practice we could make them 
practice re sealing baggies, closing box lids, and finding cover for the 
letterbox.  The problem is that I suspect the people who need to look at 
these pictures are most likely not reading this list.

                    <html><body><div>A few of us in the northern half have been having an off-list discussion about this very topic.  Offlist because we didn't realize Houston was having a problem as well and didn't want to bore the whole list with a "what do we do?" discussion.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One thing we've noticed about y'all in the Houston area is that y'all seem to team up with newbies quite often.  I notice that y'all often talk about boxing together and it seems even the new folks wind up boxing with other folks.  Is this because y'all meet up to exchange, or have y'all known one another in another part of your lives?  I wonder if this makes for sort of a mentoring effect, so that things go a little smoother.  Possibly not, if you are seeing a lot of poorly hidden boxes...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do agree with MO5, that the problem may likely be coming from folks who aren't subscribing to this or other lists.  I think that people who go the extra step to see what other resources are out there besides LBNA (the one that always seems to get noted by media) are also folks who are diligent enough to figure out how to box properly.  So how do we bring the other folks in?  I know I always try to write back to folks who log my boxes to thank them and invite them to the list - but I always have a lot more paper log entries than I have site-logged finds.  Do we leave something in our boxes with the addy for the list?  Do we wait until someone finds our boxes and then track them down and invite them?  I've thought about putting a place at the bottom of each logbook page asking for email addresses, but that seems tacky (although it would be nice to be able to get in touch with the last finder).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I like MO5's Boot Camp idea and I think it would be great for us all - I wonder if we couldn't incorporate it into a game format at the next gathering?  We do this sort of thing in scouting - "who can put up a tent the fastest", "who can have the biggest fire going in five minutes?".  Instead we could have "who can rehide a box most invisibly?" or "how many baggies can you properly reseal in 30 seconds?" sort of thing?
