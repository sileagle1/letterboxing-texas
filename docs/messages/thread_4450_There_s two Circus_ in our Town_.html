Humm, well the TTC had made plans to pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote" location near us because no one is ever there when we go...  well we just went by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so "remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many muggles around on a Friday afternoon!  So being that the TTC was not too happy with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town... until 9:00 pm.  I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I can find them a new spot to set-up!!  No purchase is required just ask the lady in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?<br>
<br>
Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br>

We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Erghh! Humm, well the TTC had made plans to
pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote"
location near us because no one is ever there when we go... well we just went
by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so
"remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many
muggles around on a Friday afternoon! So being that the TTC was not too happy
with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie
booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town...
until 9:00 pm. I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready
to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I
can find them a new spot to set-up!! No purchase is required just ask the lady
in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have
buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br/>
<br/>
We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two
newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br/>

<p>Erghh! Humm, well the TTC had made plans to pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote" location near us because no one is ever there when we go...  well we just went by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so "remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many muggles around on a Friday afternoon!  So being that the TTC was not too happy with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town... until 9:00 pm.  I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I can find them a new spot to set-up!!  No purchase is required just ask the lady in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?</p>
<div class="im"><br/>
<br/>
Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br/>
<br/>
We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>

this week and have not been getting home until 9:30 or 10:00 each night.Â  
This turned out to be an early evening, and we got home around 8:15.Â  Dogs 
released and fed, showers taken and hair washed,Â and JBK sat down to check 
email around 8:45.Â  Lo and behold, she announced that our favorite circus 
family was in town and implied that we had missed our opportunity since it was

myÂ hair in a towel, we jumped back in the car and raced up the road to 
Wally World.Â  The Girl Scout troop was finishing up butÂ the TTC was

that this little bitty operationÂ is going to be able to repay its host 
unless it sets up in a town with less competition.Â  The crew began packing

> Erghh! Humm, well the TTC had made plans to pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote" location near us because no one is ever there when we go... well we just went by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so "remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many muggles around on a Friday afternoon! So being that the TTC was not too happy with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town... until 9:00 pm. I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I can find them a new spot to set-up!! No purchase is required just ask the lady in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?<br>
