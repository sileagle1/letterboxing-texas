Humm, well the TTC had made plans to pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote" location near us because no one is ever there when we go...  well we just went by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so "remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many muggles around on a Friday afternoon!  So being that the TTC was not too happy with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town... until 9:00 pm.  I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I can find them a new spot to set-up!!  No purchase is required just ask the lady in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br/>
<br/>
We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br/>

Happy Trails!<br/>

<p>Erghh! Humm, well the TTC had made plans to
pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote"
location near us because no one is ever there when we go... well we just went
by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so
"remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many
muggles around on a Friday afternoon! So being that the TTC was not too happy
with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie
booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town...
until 9:00 pm. I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready
to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I
can find them a new spot to set-up!! No purchase is required just ask the lady
in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?<br/>
<br/>
Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have
buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br/>
<br/>
We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two
newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br/>

Happy Trails!<br/>

<p>Erghh! Humm, well the TTC had made plans to pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote" location near us because no one is ever there when we go...  well we just went by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so "remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many muggles around on a Friday afternoon!  So being that the TTC was not too happy with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town... until 9:00 pm.  I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I can find them a new spot to set-up!!  No purchase is required just ask the lady in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?</p>
<div class="im"><br/>
<br/>
Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br/>
<br/>
We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="128372202-20032010">JBKokopelli and I have been on Circle Tour 2010 DFW 
this week and have not been getting home until 9:30 or 10:00 each night.  
This turned out to be an early evening, and we got home around 8:15.  Dogs 
released and fed, showers taken and hair washed, and JBK sat down to check 
email around 8:45.  Lo and behold, she announced that our favorite circus 
family was in town and implied that we had missed our opportunity since it was 
so late...it was probably already gone and besides, we'd never get there in 
time.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="128372202-20032010"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="128372202-20032010">I live fairly close to WW, and said that we should run up 
to the store anyway.  Even if we'd missed it, at least we would have tried, 
right?  Time was a-wasting, so wearing pj's, house shoes, and 
my hair in a towel, we jumped back in the car and raced up the road to 
Wally World.  The Girl Scout troop was finishing up but the TTC was 
still trying to make some sales.  After a few final minutes of cookie 
clean-up, the workers were released from their duties.  
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="128372202-20032010"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="128372202-20032010"><span class="128372202-20032010">The folks said 
that they really enjoyed helping with the cookie sale.  Unfortunately, they 
ate more than they sold and now owe the Girl Scouts a lot of moolah.  
Since there is another circus in town, just across the highway, it's not likely 
that this little bitty operation is going to be able to repay its host 
unless it sets up in a town with less competition.  The crew began packing 
up its belongings to hit the road again.  The boss said he's not sure yet 
where they will be headed... hopefully somewhere with greener pastures where 
they can earn the funds to pay for all their cookies!</span></span></div>

&gt; JBKokopelli and I have been on Circle Tour 2010 DFW this week and have not been getting home until 9:30 or 10:00 each night.  This turned out to be an early evening, and we got home around 8:15.  Dogs released and fed, showers taken and hair washed, and JBK sat down to check email around 8:45.  Lo and behold, she announced that our favorite circus family was in town and implied that we had missed our opportunity since it was so late...it was probably already gone and besides, we'd never get there in time.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I live fairly close to WW, and said that we should run up to the store anyway.  Even if we'd missed it, at least we would have tried, right?  Time was a-wasting, so wearing pj's, house shoes, and my hair in a towel, we jumped back in the car and raced up the road to Wally World.  The Girl Scout troop was finishing up but the TTC was still trying to make some sales.  After a few final minutes of cookie clean-up, the workers were released from their duties.  <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; The folks said that they really enjoyed helping with the cookie sale.  Unfortunately, they ate more than they sold and now owe the Girl Scouts a lot of moolah.  Since there is another circus in town, just across the highway, it's not likely that this little bitty operation is going to be able to repay its host unless it sets up in a town with less competition.  The crew began packing up its belongings to hit the road again.  The boss said he's not sure yet where they will be headed... hopefully somewhere with greener pastures where they can earn the funds to pay for all their cookies!<br/>

&gt; Erghh! Humm, well the TTC had made plans to pitch up their Big Top in a spot that we thought was a "remote" location near us because no one is ever there when we go... well we just went by to help "set them up" and have discovered it's not so "remote" for a Big Top this big to be able to hide with this many muggles around on a Friday afternoon! So being that the TTC was not too happy with those arrangements they have decided to volunteer at my troop's cookie booth sale tonight @ the local Wally World on the southside of our town... until 9:00 pm. I know this isn't the norm for the circus but the TTC is ready to roll on and my weekend is booked; it could be another week or so before I can find them a new spot to set-up!! No purchase is required just ask the lady in green shirt if she's seen LB Bozo lately?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, there is another Circus in town this weekend at the local mall, I have buy one get one free admission coupons in the Big Top!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We've enjoyed the circus staying with us and helping them to find their two newest members - Sallie the Sea Lion and Flixxy the Dancing Horse!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Trails!<br/>
