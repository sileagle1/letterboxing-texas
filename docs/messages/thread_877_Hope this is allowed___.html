letterboxing on livejournal. It's free to have one and anyone can <br>
join. It's a great way to have like an online log book or journal <br>
about your boxing. There's just the two of us there right now. I'm <br>
planning on starting it up in a few minutes here.<br>
<br>
So, if you have an LJ, come join!!!<br>
And if you don't, create an account and then come join!<br>
<br>
We hope to see you there!<br>
