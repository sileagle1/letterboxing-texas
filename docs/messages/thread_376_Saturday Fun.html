Navigator and I spent Saturday in Belton at a HamFest, which really <br/>
isn't much fun too unless you like looking at all those wires, <br/>
radios, microphones and other gizmos.  When that party broke up, we <br/>
went to Miller Springs Nature Center to find Christy's two Indian <br/>
Symbols boxes.  As she warned in her updated clues the bridge was <br/>
washed out...  By the dates in the logbooks, we were the first ones <br/>
to stamp in since it had washed out.  Me trying to crawl up the <br/>
slippery, muddy creek bank was NOT a pretty scene.  But it got even <br/>
more fun when Navigator proposed a cross-country short cut back to <br/>
the parking area! It was a great hike, however, and we talked about <br/>
making it again.  On the way back home we stopped in Salado and <br/>
found Silver Eagle's Salado College box.  We never would have known <br/>
that structure was there without Silver Eagle's guidance.  Then we <br/>
stopped at San Marcos for the Salamander box at Aquarena Springs.  <br/>
This was another cool location, I hadn't been there for years.  All <br/>
this makes me eager to sit down and do some carving to meet that <br/>
goal of one box per month until the gathering...<br/>
See you then!<br/>
