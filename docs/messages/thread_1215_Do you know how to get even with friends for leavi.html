I finally got these boys (my son and our friends'<br>
kiddo - I swapped them my husband for this kid at 6:30<br>
a.m.) out of the house and on the trail with the<br>
intention of at least moving Killough Monument today -<br>
well not the whole monument, but my box that is there.<br>
<br>
We've hiked a fair amount with our friends and when we<br>
are with them and in a park where we know there are<br>
boxes, they are kind enough to at least humor us and<br>
let us box a little, and really, I think they kind of<br>
enjoy it themselves.  So when they dropped him off,<br>
they left him with a store-bought stamp for him to use<br>
while we were boxing.  I had an extra little art book,<br>
so I grabbed it before we left and made it into his<br>
personal logbook.  <br>
<br>
We drove first out to Killough and the boys had a good<br>
time climbing all over the monument while I tended to<br>
the box.  I then sat them down and told them the story<br>
of the Killough Massacre.  Somehow, boys just really<br>
relate to that story!  After the story I got them<br>
started stamping in (my son hadn't stamped Killough<br>
either) and then we started the other boy's logbook. <br>
I set about finding a new home for it while they<br>
played a bit more.  I loaded them back up, and this<br>
kid was ready to hit another box.  I had already<br>
planned to hit Love's Lookout, which I still haven't<br>
gotten, so that was cool with me.  We stopped at LL on<br>
our way back in to town and at first they just wanted<br>
to stamp and leave the finding to me.  When it came<br>
down to it though, they decided they wanted to look<br>
too.  So we hunted it down together and once again,<br>
went through the whole stamping process (now I feel<br>
for you moms who tow multiple youngers around with you<br>
- I'm used to going with an older and a younger, but<br>
two 9 year old boys is an --- experience!).  By now,<br>
the other boy (who decided to go by Scrappy) was gung<br>
ho and didn't want to stop with that one.  I<br>
envisioned what was between us and my house, and<br>
figured we could get two more.  We went and they found<br>
one of mine and one of TexasLuvBug's (Sunflower Summer<br>
is still there and well hidden TLB).  He STILL wasn't<br>
ready to stop!  I still have Spring Hope at home, so I<br>
told him I would let him stamp that one and an as yet<br>
unreleased stamp too.  He finally decided that was<br>
fine, as long as I told him where to find some other<br>
ones he could get his mother to take him to.  I agreed<br>
and a deal was made.<br>
<br>
Soooo...how do you get even with friends who leave<br>
their kid at your house at only slightly after<br>
daybreak?  You take him and get him hooked on<br>
letterboxing, then send him home armed with clues!<br>
heheh....what a good friend I am!<br>
