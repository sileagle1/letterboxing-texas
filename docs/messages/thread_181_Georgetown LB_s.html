I had the morning off and decided to spend it in the beautiful San <br/>
Gabriel park in Georgetown looking for the 2 letterboxes hidden <br/>
there.  <br/>
Unfortunately, the San Gabriel Letterbox seems to have been claimed <br/>
by its namesake.  All I found in it's hiding place were a few soggy, <br/>
well-written pages on the history of letterboxing.  <br/>
I did find Ashley's Aspiration alive and well, so the park in <br/>
Georgetown still has a hidden treasure.<br/>
Later,<br/>
