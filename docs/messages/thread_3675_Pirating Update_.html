<br/>
Yes,we did have the idea to pirate frogkisses but when she didn't get <br/>
back to us we chose to pirate our own.<br/>
<br/>
There is also more behind this story than just a "pirated" box, but <br/>
you must find the box to understand so I encourage all to check out <br/>
all Hunt County boxes.<br/>
<br/>
So I hope everyone is relieved that nobody's box was touched without <br/>
permission.  Glad we started some fun on the forum too.<br/>
<br/>
P.S. GG found it first as usual, we knew he would we planted it.  <br/>
Thanks GG!<br/>
