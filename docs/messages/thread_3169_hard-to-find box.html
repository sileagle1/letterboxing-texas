<div>Not a complaint, just some thoughts to consider . . . </div>
<div>I've had several recent "Attempted" reports on one of my boxes, Whistle 
Stop Spur, and I've just come from checking on it this morning and yep, 
just as I suspected,  it's still in place.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>This box has been there for two and a half years, and every so often I get 
reports that it's missing, but when I look, it's still there.  This isn't 
an easy box to spot; it's well-hidden and you really have to look carefully to 
find it, but that's probably why it's lasted so long through so many 
visitors.  I do occasionally find, though, that  it's been moved 
slightly to a nearby but different location, so I have to search all around 
to find it myself sometimes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So this brings up several things that probably need to be mentioned again, 
for the sake of new finders especially:</div>
<div>    1.  Some boxes are easy to find and others 
less obvious, even when you're in the right place.  That's part of the game 
and should be a challenge, not a discouragement.  When you do find the 
hard-to-find box, it's even more of a reward!  At least in the case of this 
box, the location is fun anyway, whether you actually find the box or not.</div>
<div>    2.  When you replace a box, please be careful 
to put it back <em><u>exactly</u></em> where it is supposed to be according to 
the clues, so someone else following those clues can find it, too, even if you 
think another spot is a better location!  Or, if the original spot won't 
work anymore for some reason, at least notify the placer  so the clues can 
be changed to match.</div>
<div>    3.  Even if you're sure you've been in the 
right place and didn't find the box, think carefully about logging and 
"Attempted" find for that box.  Some boxers look at <em>"Attempted"</em> as 
<em>"Don't Bother Because That Box Must Be Missing,"</em> when in fact, the box 
may be right there but you just didn't find it for whatever reason.  
Contact the placer and let them know you tried and didn't find it, and then if 
it's really missing, the placer will (or should, anyway) note that in the clues, 
after they've verified that it's truly missing.  </div>
<div>   </div>
<div>Thanks, and have fun out there!  The weather's great right now for 
letterboxing adventures.  I just had a great adventure this week finding 
all of PuddleSplasher's boxes in and around McKinney, as well as a few others in 
the vicinity, and it was a gorgeous time to be out in the woods and on the 
trails.  More details to come . . . .</div>

<div>When we first started letterboxing, my husband thought it would be okay to move a box around a little if he thought he could see a better spot for it, or if he thought the spot it was in wasn't very secure.  It made him crazy when I wouldn't let him - he would argue with me saying "the box is bound to go missing" or "but it's below the high water line", and I insisted that was the placer's responsibility to worry about that.  Finally, after a few frustrating searches when just a foot or two made a difference, he got the idea - even if he knew (or thought he knew) better than the placer, he didn't have the right to change things up on the placer's behalf without the placer's permission.
