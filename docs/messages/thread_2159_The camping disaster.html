"Camping Disaster?"<br>
<br>
The heat is what got us. <br>
I just wish we could've stayed longer - but then<br>
again, I'm glad we got out when we did - avoiding a<br>
tsunami.<br>
We should exchange our pictures. So many things that<br>
we could've done... oh well.<br>
<br>
Maybe the next camping trip will be cool like I had<br>
expected instead of the instant heat. :/<br>
<br>
The food, oh the food. The Chick-n-dumplins and smores<br>
... DELISH! <br>
Janet, Email me offlist that recipe and I'll remember<br>
to send you that clue.<br>
<br>
Back to work for me.<br>

Y'all got out right on time. In a few seconds I was soaked. Luckily, we were putting the last load in the car though. You would've laughed if you had seen Gary taking the (still up) tent to the parking lot to skake out and then take down. He was covered in mud, not exaggerating, when we got in the car. It took two baths and a shower to get completely clean and all the aches and pains gone.</div> <div> </div> <div>I'll send you the recipe tonight when I'm at work.
