                    <div class="plaintext-content">I read the posts this morning starting with Lucy's vent and several responses. It reminded me of a very beneficial and lively discussion on the Texas list a few years ago, and I've been thinking about it all day. That particular theme was about how some boxers were so disappointed that some of the boxes they'd gone searching for were missing, but not marked as missing by the placers. Of course there were many reasons why placers had not marked their boxes missing, ranging from "not in the game anymore" to "haven't had time to check to personally verify they were indeed missing". However, more important than that, the thread evolved into a discussion more to the heart of letterboxing... that is, are we to be assured that there will always be a letterbox at the end of the search, or is part of the fun and intrigue not knowing if we will actually be able to find it or not. Some boxers had expressed that their children were so disappointed if they didn't actually find the box and had actually gone so far as to have a "throw down" box in their backpacks to quickly hide close by just in case the box they were searching for was missing. I just remember our dearly departed friend, Ruby Tuesday (who always seemed to say just the right thing), saying that not finding a treasure each time you looked was the perfect opportunity for parents to teach their children that you don't always win a trophy, but the experience was worth far more than a prize. I've carried that philosophy with me ever since that discussion (sometimes as a reminder to myself and sometimes with my grandchildren). In fact, my six year old grandson actually cracks up laughing at the funny situation when we've followed the clues and found the obvious location, but the box had decided to take a hike before we got there. And finding a box in bad repair? He couldn't be more delighted because then we get to pull out our "first aid kit" and fix it!<br/>
...... So..... I'm going with the philosophy that courtesy does count for something. Making a letterbox and finding a great spot to plant it is a gift to those who choose to look for it, so they should regard it as such and not criticize the giver.<br/>
<br/>
Having said all that... I have a lot of boxes in need of new logbooks. I'm working on making them now and will be visiting my boxes in the next few weeks doing whatever repair is necessary. So I apologize ahead of time if you happen to encounter some of my boxes that have full logbooks.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I couldn't have said it better myself!  I know it is disappointing when a letterbox is missing or in need of repair, but it pays to remember that a box is only as good as the last finder leaves it, and Mother Nature can wreak havoc on even the best maintained boxes.  Blaming the placer is not only rude, but possibly not warranted.  BL, I think your sarcastic response was spot on; pointing out the really important things about boxing without being mean.  At the risk of generalizing, I would bet anyone sending an email like that will not stay in Letterboxing very long anyway, so take it with a big grain of salt.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I find this quite interesting, and when I get a chance, I'm going to go look up this conversation.<br/>
<br/>
The first time I took my son letterboxing, we had a nice long chat on our way to the park.  It consisted of two things - 1. We have to be super sneaky so non-boxers don't know what we're up to and steal the boxes, and we have to rehide the boxes really good when we find them.  And 2. There's a good chance some or all of the boxes might not be there, and it's the adventure that's the important part.  He was sorta disappointed that some of the boxes in the series were missing, but he took our chat to heart and throughly enjoyed the views of the river we found and all the wildlife.<br/>
<br/>
We found one box that probably could have used a little bit of maintenance, but as new boxers who didn't know what we were really looking for, we were not at all prepared for it.  The kiddo was actually pretty upset that we couldn't do box maintenance, more upset about that than he was when boxes were missing.<br/>
<br/>
The first box that I found with the kiddo in tow had gotten wet, and I let the box owner know (since that's what every website I had read said to do), but I also made sure to mention how great of a place it was.  Mom always said if you can't say something nice, don't say anything at all.  Courtesy definitely goes a long way!<br/>
