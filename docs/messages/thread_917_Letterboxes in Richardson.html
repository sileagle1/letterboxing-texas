Either<br>
1. A taller CelticLion (that's easy: they are ALL taller than me!)<br>
2. A machete<br>
Or<br>
3. The CelticLion Boxers - for some reason they LOVE rolling on weeds -<br>
we'll have a path in no time!<br>
<br>
When you brave that area again, let me know - that's our stompin' grounds &<br>
I'd love to meet for coffee & an exchange!!<br>

<div>Great!  I'm currently teaching a class at SMU that runs from 12:00 - 
4:00, so I made my run north of Beltline Rd. "on my way" - which means I left 
Keller around 9:00 and was in the first park around 10:20 and left the 
second park by 11:15 to get back down to SMU.  I might try it 
again one day next week, or, if not, I'll bring along my sister sometime next 
month when she's finished her moving process back and forth between here and CT 
(and my class will be over) and we can all get together.   She'd 
probably just jump into the weeds, but I had to go do that class today and 
be at least sort of professional about it.  Although, last spring, I kept 
showing up for my classes with dirty knees, scratched arms, inky fingers, and 
they never minded that!  </div></font></body></html>
