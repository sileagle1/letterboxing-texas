>Glad you found our little "jewel" in this neck of the woods.  This <br>
box was the second box I went after and when we went after it we saw <br>
some wildlife in the process.  Nothing dangerous but scared up a doe <br>
aand her fawn.  I don't know who was more scared.  There are a few <br>
other boxes in the Temple/Belton area.  TX Dragonfly and I (Texas Gal) <br>
aare fairly new to boxing and are trying to put some boxes out.  Also <br>
Silver eagle has a box in Salado that is easy and was my first find.  <br>
I just posted directions to my first placed box yesterday on the LBNA <br>
site.<br>
