<div>We are going up to Grand Prairie for a triathlon in July and are working

<div>Oh.... I think I gained about ten pounds by stopping in West the first year my daughters were in college in San Marcos. I always had to stop on the way down for kolaches, and my husband always timed our drive home so we could have dinner at the German restaurant in town. I always heard that freshmen gained about ten pounds their first year of college, but I didn't realize their parents did too.</div>

&gt;Glad you found our little "jewel" in this neck of the woods.  This <br/>
box was the second box I went after and when we went after it we saw <br/>
some wildlife in the process.  Nothing dangerous but scared up a doe <br/>
aand her fawn.  I don't know who was more scared.  There are a few <br/>
other boxes in the Temple/Belton area.  TX Dragonfly and I (Texas Gal) <br/>
aare fairly new to boxing and are trying to put some boxes out.  Also <br/>
Silver eagle has a box in Salado that is easy and was my first find.  <br/>
I just posted directions to my first placed box yesterday on the LBNA <br/>
site.<br/>
