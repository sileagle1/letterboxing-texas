                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, another TX Annual LB Event has come and gone, and I must say it was one of my favorites.  The weather was good, the people were fun, and the place was beautiful and welcoming.  Even though our planned Demos fell through, I don't think anyone became bored.  In fact, the relaxed pace with no scheduled activities was kind of nice and let people visit or letterbox more.  The only dark spot was not having Barefoot Lucy and her family.  They had to leave early Saturday to help a friend who had a death in the family.  You were missed, BL!<br/>
<br/>
As usual, the post-event "campfire" (burn ban prevented an actual fire) was a highlight for me.  Wanda &amp; Pete showed up early to present Baby Bear and I with our Lifetime Achievement Letterboxing Awards and it was fun revisiting with these icons of American Letterboxing before they left to go night boxing.  As others began arriving the mood became jovial (helped with "special" hot chocolate) as many stories were swapped.  I especially enjoyed hearing Gryzzled Gryphon's version of his "coming out".  I just wish we could have continued all night. <br/>
<br/>
I'd like to thank Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter for bringing the copy machine, making jambalaya, and just for being there.  You epitomize everything good about TX Letterboxing and I can't imagine an Event without you.  Special kudos for your creative circus poster clue, too, and to Pacifickle for figuring it out so soon.<br/>
<br/>
I'd also like to thank all the out-of-state visitors, too.  Lionsmane &amp; Astro D came again from New Mexico, JBanana from Louisiana, Goofy Girl from Oklahoma, Granny Butterfly from Ohio, and Wanda &amp; Pete from Rhode Island.  I guess our Event has become too big even for Texas!<br/>
<br/>
And of course I have to thank all of you TX boxers for making it such a success with all your great food, conversation and creativity.  You are the best!<br/>
<br/>
Just before leaving the park, I talked with a Ranger who was very nice (he is the one that gives talks about the park history) and I praised his park and its acceptance of us letterboxers.  Y'all should feel proud that you reinforced the good will we have at this park by your demeanor this weekend.  He mentioned that more trails were due to be opened in the next few years, so we might just have to revisit.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to post some pictures soon and if any of you have some, feel free to post them, too.  Thanks again for a great time!<br/>

Ranger John was a hoot.  In addition to sharing his extensive knowledge of the park and its history, he was also quite generous with the corny jokes.  He had SoccerChik and I groaning several times throughout the weekend.<br/>

This was our favorite TALE yet.  Thanks again Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, Boots Tex, LSQ and everyone else who contributed to a wonderful weekend.  Can't wait to see what next year brins.<br/>

Oh, and for anyone interested in knowing this bit of trivia: There are 10 historical markers in the 20 miles between Crockett and Weches, and another 10 historical markers in the 10 miles between Weches and Alto.  Very historic area!  And that's just along the roadside, not counting all that history IN the parks, cemeteries, and forest nearby!  (Now who would actually count those things?  We did!)</p><div class="aol_ad_footer" id="MAILCIADA045-5c8049b6956b1ea"><br/> <hr/>Access 350+ FREE radio stations anytime from anywhere on the web. <a href="http://toolbar.aol.com/aolradio/download.html?ncid=emlweusdown00000035">Get the Radio Toolbar</a>! </div>

Just wanted to chime in and say that we enjoyed this TALE better than anyone we have attended. We were so glad to see everyone. The older boxers and the newer boxers also. We were so happy that Granny Butterfly could come from OH to visit with us. Hope you had a great time. Loved boxing with you. We got a lot of exchanges and a lot of boxes but not everyone of them. If we did not exchange with you this event, we will catch you at the next. Thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear and also to Boot TX and Lone Star Quilter for the use of your copy machine. We enjoyed the food and the fun. Sorry we missed the Camp Fire but I was too tired. Maybe next year. Remember the stories so you can tell them again next year. Sounds like they were fun.
