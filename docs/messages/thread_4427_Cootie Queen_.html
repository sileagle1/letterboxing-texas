<div>A-maze-ing, I found the "Fly on the Wall" event box in my backpack side pocket after I got home..lol I guess someone thought it was a cootie to pass on.  If you will send me your address off board I will mail it back to you.</div>

<p>As I understand it, Lucy Locket had a cootie queen or so visit her at the hospital yesterday as well. Seems she found a couple of cooties in her hospital bed after some pretty cool letterboxers paid her a visit. I guess if you try to escape from letterboxing by going to the hospital, letterboxing will come to you. We'll have to find out more about this when Lucy Locket gets back to her computer.</p>

</p><div>I think what I enjoy the very most about every event is meeting and getting to know different boxers every year.  Over the years I've made so many great friends!  Even Fearless Fox, who shies away from us all a little bit, is starting to feel like he knows folks at these things.  And Draconis viridis just seems to do his own thing at gatherings - I glance up every now and then to see him across the area, talking to someone or doing something - it's kind of cool to realize he has basically grown up amongst letterboxers and doesn't know much different!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This year, we had the pleasure of sharing a campsite with BeachBum and Pink Cookie and with Cancan.  We had a great time in our own campsite during the down time because our company was so good.  I will always remember the great conversations around our own campfires in the morning and evenings. One thing I advise though if you ever think to share a campsite with someone - be sure you REALLY know what type of people your sitemates are. As it turns out, we had the Cootie Queen and her Trainee in our site.  Every time I turned anything over, every time I opened anything up, a cootie fell out!  I have never been so cootied during the non-event portion of an event as I was this year!  Of course, it would be rude to name names as to who this person (and her trainee) is, but I think I could maintain my manners and still rule out Cancan (who, by the way, graced us with her delicious Texas sheet cake).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had the good fortune of spending a little after event time with Bell Motel and Whiz Gee on Sunday morning.  I had heard from several folks how congenial and truly good-hearted they are - but really, until you meet them you have no idea how much that is the case.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was pleased to meet Mosaic Butterfly, who arranged for accomodations for us all at Gonzales Food Market, where we all gathered on Friday night and set the tone for the whole weekend.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nice to catch up a bit with BloominGrammaJo and Bird Dog, to get to talk briefly to Corazon, to see and wave to PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder (why did we never manage to sit down and talk?), to visit a bit with SandiBox...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is just never enough time to get to know the new folks and talk to the old friends, so I guess Silver Eagle and Baby Bear will have to keep having gatherings forever.  Thanks, guys, for another great event.  Only thing I suggest is - Next year, don't invite the snake.  I told y'all when we started letting ghosts in, the crowd was gonna go downhill!<br/></div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>
