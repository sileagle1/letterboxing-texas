<br/>
I see that the bus is filling up quickly. So, I think TT2 should just<br/>
stop taking passengers if it's full and allow it to roam the state<br/>
allowing those who haven't seen it a chance to get it. If anyone wants<br/>
to continue the tour bus series and start a number 3 bus, please go<br/>
for it. Since I'm no longer in Texas, it doesn't make sense for me to<br/>
do another one.<br/>
<br/>
If I recall correctly, the first bus - which was full - went missing<br/>
after someone picked it up and never put back in the wild. It's great<br/>
to see TT2 is still alive and touring. <br/>
<br/>
Hope you had fun with them. <br/>

Only one or two letterboxes in my county. Dartmoor and Essex are<br/>
closest areas but still a few hours away. I've done a bit more<br/>
geocaching which is more popular in my area. So, not too exciting for<br/>
my letterboxing 'interest'- at least not too often. lol. <br/>

Off to Disneyland Paris next week with the kids. Yeah. I should look<br/>
and see if anything around there. Never can tell.<br/>

Sounds like all is well back there.<br/>

&gt; Speaking of geocaching in your area, you MUST explain the photo of<br/>
the bloody fake leg (or was it an arm?) on your blog post about your<br/>
geocaching activities.  The picture is giving me nightmares.  MO5<br/>

&gt;   Alive and well! Raining here today and in the 60s but I'm not missing<br/>
&gt;   the Texas heat! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Only one or two letterboxes in my county. Dartmoor and Essex are<br/>
&gt;   closest areas but still a few hours away. I've done a bit more<br/>
&gt;   geocaching which is more popular in my area. So, not too exciting for<br/>
&gt;   my letterboxing 'interest'- at least not too often. lol. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Off to Disneyland Paris next week with the kids. Yeah. I should look<br/>
&gt;   and see if anything around there. Never can tell.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;   Sounds like all is well back there.<br/>

&gt;   &gt; It is GREAT to see you!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; So how is life in England? We really do miss you!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; Hey everyone -<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; I see that the bus is filling up quickly. So, I think TT2<br/>
should just<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; stop taking passengers if it's full and allow it to roam the state<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; allowing those who haven't seen it a chance to get it. If<br/>
anyone wants<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; to continue the tour bus series and start a number 3 bus,<br/>
please go<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; for it. Since I'm no longer in Texas, it doesn't make sense<br/>
for me to<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; do another one.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; If I recall correctly, the first bus - which was full - went<br/>
missing<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; after someone picked it up and never put back in the wild.<br/>
It's great<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; to see TT2 is still alive and touring.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Hope you had fun with them.<br/>
