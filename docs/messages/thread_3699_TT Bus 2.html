                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey everyone -<br>
<br>
I see that the bus is filling up quickly. So, I think TT2 should just<br>
stop taking passengers if it's full and allow it to roam the state<br>
allowing those who haven't seen it a chance to get it. If anyone wants<br>
to continue the tour bus series and start a number 3 bus, please go<br>
for it. Since I'm no longer in Texas, it doesn't make sense for me to<br>
do another one.<br>
<br>
If I recall correctly, the first bus - which was full - went missing<br>
after someone picked it up and never put back in the wild. It's great<br>
to see TT2 is still alive and touring. <br>
<br>
Hope you had fun with them. <br>
<br>

Only one or two letterboxes in my county. Dartmoor and Essex are<br>
