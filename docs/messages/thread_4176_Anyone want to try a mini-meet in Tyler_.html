                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought it might be fun to have a back-to-school meet for the teacher letterboxers and a good time for everybody else. Our church has a recreation/nature facility (called the ROC) located just south of the Loop 49 and Highway 69 intersection in Tyler. I have reserved a pavillion for us on Saturday, August 8 from 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. The pavillion has a charcoal grill and electrical outlets (fans!). The ROC has a 2+ acre stocked pond (come join us - we'll do a little fishing early in the morning), baseball &amp; soccer fields, frisbee golf course, a one-mile paved walking trail, and nature trails throughout the woods (although I'm told that one trail has a lot of poison ivy right now and I'm not sure it will be cleared by August). After the event is over, you can hang around town and locate (some of the) hundreds of boxes within a 30 mile radius. Lunch will be a potluck. I'll keep everyone updated as we get closer to the event.<br/>
<br/>
I'll have to get the address/directions to those who sign up. Try as I might, everything I use for the location puts this even on Rock Road (it is NOT!). *shrug, smile*<br/>

I've posted the event on AtlasQuest.  Let me know if you have any questions.  I'd love to meet all of you.  Hope to see you soon.<br/>

<div>Dogs?  Now I could arrange that.  You 
could win the prize for traveling the farthest.  I could sent you home with 
two puppies that are tearing up my yard.  They've dug/chewed up my

<p>I thought it might be fun to have a back-to-school meet for the 
        teacher letterboxers and a good time for everybody else. Our church has 
        a recreation/nature facility (called the ROC) located just south of the 
        Loop 49 and Highway 69 intersection in Tyler. I have reserved a 
        pavillion for us on Saturday, August 8 from 8 a.m. - 2 p.m. The 
        pavillion has a charcoal grill and electrical outlets (fans!). The ROC 
        has a 2+ acre stocked pond (come join us - we'll do a little fishing 
        early in the morning), baseball &amp; soccer fields, frisbee golf 
        course, a one-mile paved walking trail, and nature trails throughout the 
        woods (although I'm told that one trail has a lot of poison ivy right 
        now and I'm not sure it will be cleared by August). After the event is 
        over, you can hang around town and locate (some of the) hundreds of 
        boxes within a 30 mile radius. Lunch will be a potluck. I'll keep 
        everyone updated as we get closer to the event.<br/><br/>I'll have to get 
        the address/directions to those who sign up. Try as I might, everything 
        I use for the location puts this even on Rock Road (it is NOT!). *shrug, 
        smile*<br/><br/>I've posted the event on AtlasQuest. Let me know if you 
        have any questions. I'd love to meet all of you. Hope to see you

<div>BL, I'm looking into how we can stay a little 
cooler. I'll post updates as possible. As to the accessibility 
(sorry, I forgot to answer this earlier), the grounds are open to the 
public. You can certainly go in a few days early and plant boxes. I 
have a series I'm going to put in. Now, to get carving!</div>

<p>I signed up. It's just a 2 and a half hour drive from my location, and I 
  missed out on all the meets this year. And I have always wanted to go to 
  Tyler. <br/>It would be good to know what is needed - I'll decide closer to 
  time what to bring. I'll be dragging my sister with me this time, and we'll do 
  some cooking before we head out. <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>,

I want to do a box, but two and a half hours is a bit of a ways out for me! If I could cough up hotel moolah I would go out, plant and be happy. <br/>
Also, we didn't want to say for sure what we are bringing, we thought it would be better to decide closer to time.<br/>
<br/>
Just send me a message or email me if you need anything!<br/>
