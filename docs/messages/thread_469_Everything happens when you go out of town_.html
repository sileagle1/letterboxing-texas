Wow,<br>
I missed a lot of news while I was up in the Sunflower State!<br>
<br>
Carie,  I am so sorry that two-legged reptile did such a horrible <br>
thing.  He's probably not a very happy person and takes it out on <br>
others.<br>
<br>
Congrats TeamKing!  Wow, I am only at F28 but I'll keep plugging <br>
away.<br>
<br>
I placed boxes 3 and 4 of my Lost Texan series in Eastern KS this <br>
weekend.  The first two are in OK.  My goal is to put two in every <br>
state I visit.  There are some great boxes up there to find.  We had <br>
fun finding some by Wes and Jess and Ryan and Allison.<br>
<br>
The other cool thing is I FINALLY converted a non-boxer to becoming <br>
a full-blown boxer.  Look for Meatwad's stamp in KS boxes.  After <br>
getting blank looks from everyone else I finally convinced someone <br>
how fun LB is!  Yippee!<br>
Glad to be back in the Lone Star State<br>
