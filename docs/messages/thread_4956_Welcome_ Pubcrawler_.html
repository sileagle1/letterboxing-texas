Welcome! The more, the merrier! I see that you have started planting boxes in the Corpus area - way to go!  I was down that way over Thanksgiving and found some nice boxes and some nice locations. I hope to return this Spring and plant a few of my own.<br>
<br>
Say. There is a letterboxer gathering in the Houston area in a little over a week. Hope you can make it. These events are a great way to meet and greet with a lot of the active boxers in the area.<br>
