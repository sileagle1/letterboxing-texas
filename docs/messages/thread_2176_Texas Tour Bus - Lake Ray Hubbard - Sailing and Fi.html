      the exit we went on into Elgin B. Robertson's Park, the actual address is

<div>When coming into the park there is a T in the road. The sign in front

      natural way to turn. We saw sailboats to the right of us. Up ahead on the 
      left were some young kids and their parents (I'm assuming) flying kites. 
      We drove around the big circle grass area with some trees. After leaving 
      the T in road we noticed that we drove .8 miles around. On the right was a 
      telephone pole with the number/letter combination: 7N17E71. I don't know 
      why the passengers noticed it, but they did. Joan yelled, "STOP." And, if 
      you know Joan, you better do what she says. So, we stopped right by the 
      rusty trash can by the telephone pole. A little ways a way on the left was 
      a brick structure, we noticed it was a bathroom. That's what Joan needed 
      (if she'd lay off the Dr. Pepper, she wouldn't be in such a rush). So, 
      while Joan went to the bathroom we looked to the right at the lake. Right 
      in front of us was 2 trees. The second past the telephone pole, it's a big 
      tree that droops to the ground. It was a neat tree, we don't know what 
      kind though. We're hoping someone will know that species of tree. But, if 
      you crawl under the branches you can stand up under there. If you were on 
      the South side of the the trunk and you looked 5 feet up the trunk, you'd 
      see the bus waiting. . .</div>

<div>Let me know how long the bathroom break was.</div>

                    <html><body><div>I wake up at 2:45pm to get Cassie from bus stop. I can suggest a really good stamp in a cool area near the airport. It's called Tombs and Tees. It's not my box, so I'm being honest. It's easy to get to, a great spot, there's a place to sit and a table to eat, drink or just rest your elbows. Some people might not think eating at a cemetery is appetizing, I could think of worse places. I think it's about 10 minutes tops from the airport.</div> <div> </div> <div>Have a great trip, be safe,</div> <div>Janet, TX<br/><br/><b><i>Mike Olbrisch &lt;mike2004@elp.rr.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="129241803-25092006">Things have changed just a little bit.</span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="129241803-25092006"></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="129241803-25092006">We are leaving for Dallas tomorrow morning.  Expect to arrive in the evening, and staying with a friend in Carrollton over-night.</span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="129241803-25092006"></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="129241803-25092006">The following day (tuesday) it looks like we will have about 5 hours to kill.  Could do an exchange, or search for some boxes, or ???  I will have a wi-fi laptop

Let me know if you want to meet up with my family and I. If not, I totally understand that this is not a wandering trip. And the way the airport is, you have to schedule longer than normal. I remember when I would pick my mom up (once a month) and I could be in and out in less than 8 minutes (you had to pay after 8 minutes). It's not like that anymore. Make sure you have at least $2.00 for the toll. You can't get out with less than $1.00 for sure. I forgot to take
 cash once, I had to write a check for 1.00. Isn't that the craziest?</div> <div> </div> <div>Have a good trip.

This exit is Dalrock Rd. At the exit we went on into Elgin B. Robertson's Park, the actual address is 500 S Cooke. It's South of the freeway.</div> <div> </div> <div>When coming into the park there is a T in the road. The sign in front says, "Bayview Marina, Weekends Cafe, etc." We tu right there, it's a natural way to turn. We saw sailboats to the right of us. Up ahead on the left were some young kids and their parents (I'm assuming) flying kites. We drove around the big circle grass
 area with some trees. After leaving the T in road we noticed that we drove .8 miles around. On the right was a telephone pole with the number/letter combination: 7N17E71. I don't know why the passengers noticed it, but they did. Joan yelled, "STOP." And, if you know Joan, you better do what she says. So, we stopped right by the rusty trash can by the telephone pole. A little ways a way on the left was a brick structure, we noticed it was a bathroom. That's what Joan needed (if she'd lay off the Dr. Pepper, she wouldn't be in such a rush). So, while Joan went to the bathroom we looked to the right at the lake. Right in front of us was 2 trees. The second past the telephone pole, it's a big tree that droops to the ground. It was a neat tree, we don't know what kind though. We're hoping someone will know that species of tree. But, if you crawl under the branches you can stand up under there.
