                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all- Bunnybee from Amarillo here! :-)<br>
<br>
I have checked out myself on search engines... and I am surprised at <br>
some of the things that get pulled up. Sometimes it's something <br>
fairly personal (like an address) but most of the time, I'm finding <br>
info about someone else (with the same name) or I'm not even found. <br>
But yeah- it IS scary just what people can find out about you if they <br>
really know where and how to dig. The internet is quite the open door!<br>
<br>
Anyway, about letterboxing and this forum... I think it should be <br>
required that people offer some personal info if they want to join. <br>
Sometimes that is enough to discourage the ones who really aren't <br>
interested. And to send an email to those who have joined but never <br>
introduced themselves... and if they don't respond, then go ahead and <br>
delete them. They aren't active here anyway- so what would that <br>
matter? And if they decide to introduce themselves, then that's all <br>
the better- maybe they'll get active and jump in, too! <br>
<br>
And as for actual going-out-and-finding-boxes kind of security... I'd <br>
suggest not posting on here where you're headed for the weekend, just <br>
in case we do have unsavory lurkers looking for an opportunity to be <br>
unsavory. I don't like to get paranoid (or to get anyone else here <br>
that way) but I do believe in internet safety -so much that you never <br>
announce to a group online when and where you will be. Especially <br>
with something like letterboxing- they could get directions to the <br>
place just by clicking on a link. So yeah- come and report what boxes <br>
you've found AFTER you've been there- but don't announce it <br>
beforehand. Or if you're headed somewhere and have a question to ask <br>
first, at least leave it open to several days when you might be <br>
there, and be vague on any specifics. <br>
<br>
I think once we've figured out who is here and who's who... that <br>
won't be such a factor- but for now, I'd rather not announce my plans <br>
ahead of time. Thankfully, I am relieved we've never heard of anyone <br>
using letterboxing or geocaching clues to do any criminal acts or as <br>
a way of finding victims. I know- my head works in weird ways- but I <br>
hope everyone will realize just how safe letterboxing is and has been-<br>
 just be aware of what you're doing at all times anyway. <br>

We all must look pretty suspicious lurking about in<br>
parks, examining trees up close, hiding behind people<br>
and backpacks while we crawl around through the bushes<br>
looking for boxes! I know I've received a few odd<br>
looks, and I wouldn't doubt that folks have gone a bit<br>

That's because you hid your boxes in tiny parks where no one ever goes. . .so you stick out when you're there lurking around!<br>

Maybe the shirts should be re-designed so they look like some sort of city or park official garb. Then maybe we would at least look we could legitimately be there lurking about bushes or buildings. . .:)<br>
