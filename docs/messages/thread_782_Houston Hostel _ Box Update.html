lot.  As Baby Bear mentioned, there was some clearing going on around <br>
its location.  Hopefully, the new spot will hold up okay - although a <br>
little worried with the Arboretum's Summer Camps coming up and kids <br>
roaming through the woods! :)<br>
<br>
Anyway, the clue is updated with the new location.<br>

In other news, these boxes are all alive and well as of this week:<br>
