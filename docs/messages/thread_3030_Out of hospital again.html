days. I had a bleeding ulcer that they fixed but I fell while I was <br>
there and broke 3 ribs. They said that I was so low on blood that that <br>
was what caused me to pass out and fall. I received 2 units of blood <br>
while I was there. I feel much better now. We went Saturday to Malakoff <br>
and did some repair on "Little Bunny Fu Fu". We have not been able yet <br>
to go to fix the stamp in "The Drifter". As soon as we can we will tend <br>
to that. It was reported to me that the stamp was broke. We are planing <br>
to go to the Athens Mini Meet. It will be so glad to meet the new <br>
letterboxer here in this area and also to see others that come. <br>
