<div>Strange find...was 
there anything else in the baggie?  Maybe it was something a boxer was 
using for a personal stamp, and it was dropped accidentally.  Mother of 
Texas is one of my all time favorite boxes, first because of how much I learned 
about Texas history, second because were it not for letterboxing I would never 
have visited that cemetery (of even known it was there) and third because my 
oldest son (in second grade at the time we found the box) still talks about a

<br/>
First of all, on atlasquest.com there is a great glossary with all the<br/>
terms, including mystery box:<br/>
http://www.atlasquest.com/aboutlb/glossary/<br/>
You will also find more clues at atlasquest, great FAQs and tutorials.  <br/>
<br/>
Another good informational site is maintained by Silent Doug<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.info<br/>
<br/>
You can dive into the archives of this list, join the newboxers list<br/>
and more.  There's also good info on the grandmaster website, lovingly<br/>
referred to as LBNA--http://www.letterboxing.org<br/>
<br/>
Now, in general, I would suggest rather than taking a whole troop to<br/>
find an existing box, consider hiding boxes specifically for your girl<br/>
scout troop to find (then you can open it up to the general<br/>
letterboxing public if you like).  I made this offer on the big list,<br/>
so I will make it here too.  If carving stamps intimidates you (and it<br/>
can at first, but it's easier than you think), I will send you a stamp<br/>
to make a box from.  Just email me off list.  This holds true for any<br/>
scout or group leader reading this.<br/>
<br/>
It's also wise, in my opinion, to find a few more before making your<br/>
first plant.  You get a feel for different types of hides, different<br/>
kinds of containers, etc.  This helps you make a smarter first hide<br/>
(although many of us lost our first boxes--there is a learning curve).<br/>
<br/>
Feel free to ask questions here, or at the newboxers list.  It's a<br/>
fun, great activity and I'm so glad you enjoy it.  <br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Letterboxers and scout groups have a lot in common, but one of the things that frustrates letterboxers about scout groups and other youth groups is that they tend to be a bit overwhelming on a box location.  Some leaders take their scouts out as a whole group - imagine seeing 12 kids and a couple of adults all hovering around a box in the woods...Hardly inconspicuous!  And inevitably the first person who pulled the box out of its hiding spot wants to move on before the last person has logged in, so they run ahead and aren't available to tell the last person how the box was in place.  And the box winds up being rehidden badly.  Another, less difficult, problem is that they tend to take a lot of pages in a logbook.  It isn't that a letterboxer wants to be stingy with pages, but each girl shouldn't take a page apiece - the box owner winds up having to go replace the logbook much more quickly when the pages aren't used wisely.  And from what I know of Girl Scouts, I know that good use of resources is heavily emphasized, so I'm sure the girls would want to know that it is a good idea to be frugal with space - take enough, but don't take too much.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When we started boxing with our Cub Scout three years ago, we started out by planting a 4 box temporary series for a campout we had.  We gave 'em clues and sent them out in pairs with an adult.  We also didn't worry about having a rubber stamp - we let them sign their names and take a sticker for their clue sheet, so that we emphasized the seeking and not all the stuff that surrounds it.  On the next outing, our den of four helped me place a box and we went through the site selection process and what makes a good location.  On other occasions, I let them help me find a box - but I pulled and replaced while they watched.  On any occasion possible, they have loved looking through my logbook at all the cool stamps I've collected.  Finally, last year we carved stamps and I started introducing them to how to box on their own.  It's been slow going (probably slower than it had to be) but the boys have the fever now.  In the last week or two, I've had five or six boys in the pack (and a few more parents besides) ask when we are going to have an outing when we can letterbox!  And every den wants some time this year for me to teach them to carve (although I am reserving this for 3rd graders and up, when Cub Scouts traditionally earn the right to carry a knife).
<br/><br/>There are lots of different ways to introduce scouts to letterboxing, but I've always been kind of fond of taking the approach of feeding them just enough to pique their interest, make 'em beg, but let them think they have to earn the privilege to letterbox.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That said, it sounds like you are on the right track - trying it out yourself first and getting a feel for it.  I'm sure you'll have a great time boxing with your scouts!  I've set up two scout training series myself and I'll send you the link for them off the list to possibly give you some ideas about teaching letterboxing.
