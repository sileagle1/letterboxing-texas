<div> </div>
<div>I wasn't able to get to Killough Monument before they closed the gates, so I've been worried it would be gone. Well I was finally able to get to it today and it is JUST FINE!  The logbook is nearly full, so I need to take another one back for it, but other than that, the area I placed it has been largely ignored.  They do now have hours posted - 6 
a.m. to 6 p.m.  Hopefully this will limit the bad stuff that goes on there, although I have to admit I came up on something today that wasn't kosher there, although I'm not sure quite what.  There was a couple in a truck and they got real nervous when Lightning and I drove up and got out.  I'm not sure if they were making out or doing drugs.  Killough is a really cool site to visit and it has lots of awesome local history, but I strongly advise against going there alone, and certainly follow your instinct if there are other visitors there.

<div>As to Homestead HH Hostel, I had pulled it to update the HH's in it, but in the meantime the land it is hidden on is being 1) mowed and hayed, and 2) considered for purchase by a company relocating to our town.  The land it is located on is part of the town's economic development program.  It's doubtful anyone will buy it, but since there have been folks roaming around on the plot lately, I decided not to replace it until it settles down.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>SO Killough is available again and Homestead is not.  I'll follow up soon on Homestead I hope.</div>
