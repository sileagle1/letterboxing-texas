<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I think this is an 
interesting question Lucy posed to us.  And I think part of the answer 
comes back to choosing boxes with clues that suit your taste.  If you know 
you are going to be out letterboxing with people that are less enthusiastic than 
you are (as I often am) choose a box that will keep them happy.  I think 
Dewberry was very wise the other day when she said, "don't be afraid to walk 
away without a box."  Two boxes in particular come to mind when I think 
about this, Baby Bear's "Blue Northern" (along the Lone Star Hiking trail) which 
I looked for 3 times before finally stamping it in my logbook (and yes, all kids 
plus my parents were along, which is why I had to go back!) and 
another in the UP of Michigan which had me looking for a "forest knee".  
When I finally found the "knee", the clues made perfect sense. I also seriously 
misinterpreted Dewberry's "Humpty Dumpty" clues, but that is a story for another 
day.  Part of the fun is searching for the boxes, if they were all easy to 
find we would miss that "ah ha!" moment when you finally do find the box.  
Some of my very favorite "letterboxing days" were times we just couldn't find 
the box, but you still get to spend time in the particular place and in the 
company of particular people, and that is something to be treasured, even if you 
can't stamp it in a logbook.  Mother of Five</font></div></body></html>

<div> </div>
<div>I have a love/hate thing with boxes that reference parks with no address.  If I see them before I go, I research the heck out of them.  Even with the internet, some parks are hard to locate!  I even wrote to one city recreational department and got a very nice email back explaining to me exactly how to get to the park I asked about.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Where it really gets yukky is when I don't notice that I need to do that research and I get out there and can't find the park.  It's really hard to give it up and move on, but sometimes you just have to.  I ran into the same situation this past weekend, when I had maps of Denton and I even had downloaded a park map I thought would be a real treasure.  When I hit the road with an hour and a half to get my boxing done, I quickly learned the park map was not good at all, especially since road names were a little blurry (don't know if the print was that bad or if it was my eyes on that given day - I had a heck of a time with my contacts up there).  I think that was more frustrating than anything - I knew the park was in the area I was searching but I couldn't find it anywhere and no one else that was awake at that early hour knew either.  I spent way too much time searching and wound up not having time to get any boxes that day.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm reminded of one of raindear's Plano Balloon Festival.  The clues said something like - Find your way to Joe Blow park.  You're a letterboxer - do I have to tell you how to get there?  My first thought was "Yeah - I'm from out of town", followed by "No, put it that way, I'll find my own way there."
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm torn on this point of clue-writing though - while it would be courteous for placers to give directions from major roads to parks, it also takes a little challenge away from the box if you just have to follow the directions.  I guess the placer has to ask him/herself what they are going for with that box.

<div>I had that same experience with that park, Lucy, finding that 
letterbox.  I did find it on mapquest after a long time searching, and then 
finding my way INTO that park was another adventure (it was one of those that 
runs along the major street, but the entrances are inside a neighborhood and you 
almost have to live there to know how to get to it, but again, determination and 
persistence paid off.  That, and the fact that after all that trouble I 
wasn't giving up!  It was a very long drive from here to there, so finding 
that one was very satisfying!  But I've remembered the frustration in 
writing my clues to parks, too, and tried to give a little more direction, 
unless I've intended it to be a mystery.  -- VF</div></font></body></html>

<div>I just received a copy of "Allen Image" in the mail. It's a free magazine sent in the mail once a month to residents who live in or around the city of Allen, just north of Dallas. On one page, sponsored by a local kid's dentist, is an article about letterboxing which concludes by giving the clues to a letterbox located nearby in Plano "just to get you started". I don't know if the author of this article had permission from the planter (Cadenza) to publish the clues to this box or not. Perhaps she did, but it got me thinking. Isn't it considered bad form to publish clues to other people's boxes without their permission, or to publish photographs of their stamp images (which she did <u>not</u> do in the article, by the way)?</div>
