Subject: WHAT is going on????<br/>
<br/>
Fearless Fox,Lightning, and I have been happily camping and enjoying ourselves, when I decided to check in on the list and found some crazy stuff going on! <br/>
<br/>
Coincidentally there was some ruckus here in the park where we are an hour or two ago.  I heard what sounded like a raggedy old school bus and a bunch of folks making a big commotion. Over the top of the party on wheels, I heard someone yelling "Allons Junya - no left, no right - he's still hanging on.". Followed by cursing in Spanish...<br/>
<br/>
Could it have been?   I think a little evening sleuthing is in order! <br/>
