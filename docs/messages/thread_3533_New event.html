There has been a couple of times when we have gone out to breakfast that there has been a couple signing. I only know the letters and I Love You, so she told her Granny she wanted to learn to sign. Well, Granny told her bff about it and her bff has bought her no less than 3 books and 2 dvds. So, it looks like we'll be learning sign language.<br/><br/>Good luck with the conference. <br/><br/>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Kristin Cox &lt;mrscox@tmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>I have just listed the Statewide Conference for Deaf Education as a <br/> letterboxing event on Atlas Quest.
