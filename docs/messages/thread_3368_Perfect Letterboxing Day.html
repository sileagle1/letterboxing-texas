                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I had what I consider to be a perfect letterboxing day, or as <br/>
close to it as I can get.  I finally made it to Mercer Arboretum to <br/>
get all the new boxes there and they were great, especially the <br/>
Murder series by The Texians.  If you haven't found these boxes yet I <br/>
highly recommend them.  So, how do I define a perfect letterboxing <br/>
day?<br/>
<br/>
First, the weather has to be great.  Sunny, cool enough to keep the <br/>
bugs away and to keep me from sweating while hiking, low wind to not <br/>
scatter clue sheets, and dry enough to sit on the ground to stamp <br/>
without getting wet.  Today was all of these.<br/>
<br/>
Second, the location has to be beautiful with nice trails.  For those <br/>
of you that have been to Mercer, you know it meets this criteria.<br/>
<br/>
Third, the location has to be uncrowded.  I only saw about 5 other <br/>
people on the trails all day!<br/>
<br/>
Fourth, the letterboxes have to be fun, fairly easy to find, and <br/>
memorable.  The boxes today were just awesome!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to The Texians and IRA Boxer for a great day!<br/>

<br/>
P.S. It was really strange finding boxes hidden by a dead letterboxer <br/>
(IRA Boxer) and then notifying him of my finds.  Not sure if I will <br/>
get a response, or if I want to! <br/>

<div>I am so happy to hear 
that you had such a great day, and that you found this spectacular series.  
Letterboxing just doesn't get much better than "Murder at the Arboretum", does 
it?  Good thing you only saw about 5 people on the trail, I bet you would 
have looked really strange sitting alone in the woods laughing out loud to 
yourself!  MO5</div>
