I can't wait to meet everyone too.  I would have been to last years <br/>
meet but we were have our first LA-MS meet the same weekend and I <br/>
couldn't pass up crawfish and beer.  The talk around here is all <br/>
about the TX gathering, we'll be there in full force.  I believe <br/>
we'll be sending in our support crew early to try to hold some good <br/>
spots.  If they let I'll post the name they'll be camping under and <br/>
the spots can fill in around them; if that is allowed in parks.  <br/>
Does anyone know, can you ask the Rangers at the gate to put you <br/>
next to another camper already there?  I'm new to state park camping <br/>
I usally just hit the woods and rough it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My experience last year was that the campsites were first-come-first-choice. That is the way Texas parks do it. Most of the letterboxers ended up really close together since we all went for sites around the shelter where we were to meet for the gathering. So, I would think that if you have a choice get a site near the shelter. Makes it easier to get your stuff to the shelter that morning too. And---then we can walk from your tent, after coffee meeting, to the shelter---an added bonus! lol<br/>
