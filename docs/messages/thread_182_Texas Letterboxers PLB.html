<br/>
I have decided that since our little group is growing and becoming <br/>
it's own organism, I'd make a stamp.  Since Texas is so big and not <br/>
everyone would be able to visit a little box in Victoria, I decided <br/>
to make it a PLB.  Everyone in the group is invited. If you'd like <br/>
to recieve it, please email me your address off list, or contact me <br/>
in the Texas/Oklahoma forum at www.lbworld.org  <br/>
<br/>
I don't plan on retiring it. Whenever we gain a new Texas <br/>
letterboxer, it is theirs for the asking, as long as it is returned <br/>
to me.<br/>
<br/>
I won't have a cutoff date for the original list for a few days as I <br/>
have not made the stamp. Once it is complete I'll let everyone know <br/>
and give a date then.<br/>

everybody until July 8th to sign up for the original mailing.  I <br/>
only have five people listed so far and I know there are more of you <br/>
out there, so don't be shy. <br/>
<br/>
I've also decided to open it up to anyone who has planted a box in <br/>
Texas. Not just those that live here.  Every box planted enriches <br/>
the game, so I couldn't leave them out.  <br/>

I've lost track of who has this PLB, but could whoever has it now, <br/>
bring it to the gathering?  That way, those that have not recieved <br/>
it yet, or weren't on the list can stamp in.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm still not sure if I'll be able to make it or not.  My wife's <br/>
morning sickness seems to be lasting all day.<br/>
