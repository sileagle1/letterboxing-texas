</p><div>Hello, Moon Rabbit and other letterboxers who have given "Black Bear Paw" a lift (or will soon):</div>
<div>I live in Sandy Hook, Ct on the shores of the Housatonic River. After this long, snowy winter, I was just out in San Diego, CA vacationing and did a little hiking and letterboxing! I was feeling a little blue because I had just left a hitchhiker which I was fond of in a box high on the cliffs overlooking the beautiful blue Pacific Ocean in La Jolla. However, I traveled on to locate the "Tea Time" letterbox hidden in the Scripps Coastal Reserve at UCSD. Upon locating the box, my spirits were immediately lifted when not only was there a great stamp representing "Tea Time" but also the wonderful "Black Bear Paw" hitchhiker! It's in good shape and still has both of it's log books. It has traveled extensively along the west coast from Washington to vineyards in CA and along the Pacific Ocean collecting many stamps. I carefully brought it back to CT with me with the intensions of placing it on the Appalachian Trail, but when I read how extensively it had already traveled in New England, I then carefully packaged it and sent it on another plane ride to my sister in Texas where there is a fun group of Texans doing a lot of letterboxing! Hopefully it will travel well in that area and pick up some wonderful stamps. </div>

                    <html><body><div>Just glad we could help the Black Bear Paw travel!  It was great to look at both logbooks and see all the East Coasters that had stamped in!  We will always be rather fond of him as well - he was our first HH find - and was located at the peak of a tough hike - so quite the reward!  I have been following the LBTX group from afar - out here in northern CA - and you guys have such enthusiasm!  Have a great time at your gathering....we look forward to reading all about it!</div>
