<div> </div>
<div>I had good intentions of heading out to Camp Pirtle to hide boxes all weekend, but I wound up having to funeralize most of the day yesterday for a very dear lady who was very kind to me when, as a child, I needed kindness and security.  It being a Catholic funeral, it was quite long, what with all the symbolism and tradition that must be observed, followed by all the nice things people had to say about her.  As I thought more about her, I thought that she certainly deserves a box.  It may be my first cemetery box.  The last time I saw her - in Walmart, she asked me about letterboxing (saw the article a long time ago now) and asked me to please visit when her daughter was in town from Houston and tell her about it, because she would enjoy it with her three sons.  She forgot to call me, and I forgot to call her and inquire when they might visit.  How things pass!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I didn't make it to camp as I had hoped, so I was left with this afternoon for planting.  Fearless Fox and Lightning loaded up with me and we got out there about 2:30 and had 14 boxes planted by 6:30.  And planted well, I might add.  I have one more hidey box to do (although FF thinks I need to do six more).  I am now standing at 136 personal stamps, and needing approximately 20 more.  I have to do 1 event stamp, 5 station stamps, with another miscellaneous 5 or so stamps to do.  If you had told me 3 months ago I was going to have to carve more than 30 stamps in a week, I would have laughed in your face!  Today?  30 stamps?  No sweat!  And I have a whole week?  WOOHOO!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am getting really excited about this event!  I think it is going to be awesome!  I'm going to have a few boy scouts helping me, along with Lightning.  If anyone thinks it would be fun to join in and come out and help Cub Scouts letterbox for a day, email me privately!

here you can find a tree to hide a box behind.  We hid some boxes in <br>
Midland, in mesquite bushes, behind sand dunes, in a cactus patch, <br>
in a cotton field.  (Just kidding, sort of).  We did hide one behind <br>
a pump jack, though.<br>
