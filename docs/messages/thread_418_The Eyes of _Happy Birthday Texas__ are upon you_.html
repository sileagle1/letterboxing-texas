Break out the streamers &amp; candles!<br/>
<br/>
Cactus Licker is creating a stamp and I'm putting together a logbook for a<br/>
"Happy Birthday, Texas!" Postal Letterbox. <br/>
This PLB will only be open to folks in this letterboxingtexas yahoo group.<br/>
If you are interested in receiving this box in time for (or at least close<br/>
to!) your birthday, please email me at:<br/>
celticlions@comcast.net<br/>
<br/>
In your email, please include:<br/>
1. Your birth date (no need to include year, unless you'd like to brag!)<br/>
2. Your snail mail address<br/>
<br/>
We've seen this done for other groups, so thought we'd give it a try - I<br/>
think that at least at first we need to limit it to the birthday of the<br/>
primary letterboxer in the family. And if you choose to take part, you are<br/>
agreeing to keep this PLB for no more than 3-4 days before mailing it either<br/>
to the next person on the list, or back to us for maintenance. We're<br/>
requesting that you send it by priority mail with a delivery confirmation,<br/>
which might cost around $4.00-$5.00 total.<br/>
<br/>
Anybody want to party with us???<br/>
<br/>
