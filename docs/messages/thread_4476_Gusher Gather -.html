                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Lucy for another super gathering. The weather was so perfect! Cool breeze off the lake and not too hot on the trails. Synergy Park is such a nice park. You can picnic, fish or walk the trails. It was such a pleasure to meet Trail Whale and congrats on the four generations of boxers! Nac Trail Cat is one of my favorite boxers and it was so good to see her again. <br/>
All of you who drove several hours to Synergy park, Thank-you for making the trip. It was a great to see you again.<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
