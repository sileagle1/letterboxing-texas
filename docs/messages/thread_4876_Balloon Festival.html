Let me know if you want to head toward Jacksonville for some respite. We've had a few fires in Cherokee County as well, and that one really bad one on the Nacogdoches/Cherokee county border in the Angelina river bottom. Lots of our more rural friends have been evac'd, but thankfully the worst we have seen in town has been the constant smoke in the air and fires that are affecting our wider travel but not our immediate home life. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>We collected cases of water at a big scout event we had on Thursday and then split it between our three counties (Anderson, Cherokee, and Rusk) and delivered it to volunteer fire departments in our counties. A firefighter friend who works in Longview told me how much water and gatorade they had gone through in the last few days - I can't remember the amounts, but I remember being flabberghasted!</div>

Thanks Lucy, It has been very scary around here the last couple of weeks. I just drove over to where all three fires were,it is so sad to see. I will post some pics soon on FB that I took today. Thankfully, all the fires here in Rusk County are contained, but I saw a lot of smoldering and hot spots still going. The fire just southwest of us, has burned 2700 acres, and they are still watching it.  The one Tuesday was about 1.5 miles from our house when we evacuated. The wind shifted and sent it East instead of south so we were able to come back home. Thanks also for the water and gatorade. The firefighters are exhausted. When we talked to the New Londen crew, they weren't quite sure what day it was. We have been collecting liquids also, and giving to several different units. So glad there aren't any big smoke clouds today :)<br>

> Thanks Lucy, It has been very scary around here the last couple of weeks. I just drove over to where all three fires were,it is so sad to see. I will post some pics soon on FB that I took today. Thankfully, all the fires here in Rusk County are contained, but I saw a lot of smoldering and hot spots still going. The fire just southwest of us, has burned 2700 acres, and they are still watching it. The one Tuesday was about 1.5 miles from our house when we evacuated. The wind shifted and sent it East instead of south so we were able to come back home. Thanks also for the water and gatorade. The firefighters are exhausted. When we talked to the New Londen crew, they weren't quite sure what day it was. We have been collecting liquids also, and giving to several different units. So glad there aren't any big smoke clouds today :)<br>
