                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I had to travel north to Humble today for my daughter's soccer <br/>
tournament, we decided to go pick blueberries between games.  I have <br/>
been going to Moorhead's Blueberry Farm for over 6 years and though <br/>
kind of far from Houston, it is worth the trip.  Right now their <br/>
biggest blueberries are ripe for picking, and as further incentive I <br/>
placed a box nearby called TX Blueberry with clues posted on LBNA.  I <br/>
recommend going early, especially on weekends, since it gets very <br/>
crowded and hot.  Blueberries are only $1.50/lb and you can eat all you <br/>
want while picking.  Enjoy!<br/>
