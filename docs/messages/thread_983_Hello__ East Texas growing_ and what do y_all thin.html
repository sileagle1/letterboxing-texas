<p>My husband is an Eagle Scout and thinks your ideas are great.  He says it would have been a lot more fun for him to learn orienteering this way.</p>

Buffalo,<br/>&gt;Jefferson, Caddo Lake, Nacogdoches, and Mission Tejas,<br/>&gt;and some yet undecided), but they probably won't make<br/>&gt;it out until fall.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;As most of y'all know, I split my time between cub<br/>&gt;scouting and letterboxing.  And as I mentioned on the<br/>&gt;big list, the topic of discussion last weekend on the<br/>&gt;national scout leader list I belong to was geocaching<br/>&gt;and letterboxing with scouts.  And as has been<br/>&gt;discussed in the past on various letterboxing lists<br/>&gt;(this one included), letterboxers are often a little<br/>&gt;leery about scouts and other groups heading out to<br/>&gt;letterbox because sometimes leaders aren't diligent to<br/>&gt;make sure that boxes are cared for and rehidden well.<br/>&gt;Because of the recent discussion, several local<br/>&gt;scouters have asked me to help them 
introduce<br/>&gt;letterboxing to their scouts.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Soooo...I'm considering setting up a "training course"<br/>&gt;of sorts, several boxes in a single park, with clear<br/>&gt;solid directions so that a group (or an individual)<br/>&gt;can come out and find several boxes geared toward the<br/>&gt;beginner and get the hang of interpreting clues,<br/>&gt;practicing compass skills, using good outdoor skills,<br/>&gt;and being responsible boxers.  Although it would be<br/>&gt;geared toward scouts (and specifically cub scouts),<br/>&gt;anyone could try it out.  I'm thinking that instead of<br/>&gt;posting the clues on the website, I would list it on<br/>&gt;the website and direct those interested to email me<br/>&gt;for clues and information.  I realize that this would<br/>&gt;be a high risk series, so I'm thinking I'll plant it<br/>&gt;somewhere near to me, like 
Jim Hogg State Park, so I<br/>&gt;can check on it more easily.  I would like to place<br/>&gt;nice stamps, but nothing too intricate since I may<br/>&gt;well have to recarve from time to time.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;So what do y'all think?  Is this a lame idea?<br/>&gt;Thinking back to your newbie days (especially if you<br/>&gt;have kids), what would have been helpful to learn<br/>&gt;early on?  As planters, what would you like finders to<br/>&gt;know?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Lucy<br/>&gt;--- dewberrylb &lt;dewberrylb@gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Good point, she says to Lucy, who she assumes must<br/>&gt; &gt; be grinning from<br/>&gt; &gt; ear to ear because there is now yet another boxer<br/>&gt; &gt; placing boxes in<br/>&gt; &gt; Jacksonville.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And, I see Lucy Locket's been busy planting boxes in<br/>&gt; &gt; East Texas<br/>&gt; &gt; too. .
