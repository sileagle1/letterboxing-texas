                    <html><body><div>I had a little time to kill yesterday evening, but couldn't really stray out of town, so I took the opportunity to pick up a few boxes I hadn't had an opportunity to find recently.  Yep.  In spite of the heat...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>JBK recently planted one box, The Circus Fight, to highlight a bruhaha the locals had with a traveling circus.  Apparently way back when, Jacksonville was a wild and woolly little town (and if you recall from discussion back when JEN was about to happen, the town of Milford got a population boost when a bunch of folks got fed up with the drinking and carousing that went on in Jacksonville and moved to Milford, so apparently there is some truth to Jacksonville's reputation).  Anyway, some of the locals stirred up trouble at the circus and it spilled over into the bars and caused the circus to pack up and move along, but not before the locals came looking for more trouble.  This has always been one of my favorite Jacksonville stories - you can read it at JBK's box write up.  The cool thing is - she put it at a railroad loading dock that has been standing for many, many years virtually without notice, likely something similar to that used by the circus.  I can't tell you how many times a week I drive by that place and never thought to associate it with the story I love about the circus, even if just theoretically.  As I poked around looking for that box, I couldn't help imagining that circus working like mad to get loaded so they could get out of town, only to be confronted yet again by wild-eyed locals.  Wow - what an experience that must have been!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also went and found her Tomato Bowl box with a realistic carving of Jacksonville's beloved Tomato Bowl, our cozy depression-era WPA-built stadium like no other still standing.  When I first was talking to her about it, I thought I knew exactly where it was, and I also thought it might not last very long.  Turns out - it was NOT where I thought it would be - and it was very well hidden!  She talks about the trains passing through during football games.  I remember that train vividly both from my own high school days and from my not too distant past since SJZ was on drill team and I spent many Friday nights back in those stands.  That train still runs and the home crowd still seems to gather up in a collective pause as the train goes through while the visitors always seem startled by the interruption.  I'm currently on hiatus from "official" Tomato Bowl mom duty since SJZ has graduated and moved on and Lightning won't be marching in the band there for a couple more years or so!  Anyway, as I found that box, the train blew through and I had to stop and watch it pass, as though I was sitting in the crowded stadium on a fall evening instead of roaming about outside the stadium sweating in the early summer...  I hope they never decide to replace the Tomato Bowl!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also ventured over to find her Texas Basket Factory box - a location that also hearkens back to Jacksonville's past.  That and another crate company across town turned out hundreds of thousands of baskets to carry Jacksonville's bustling tomato crop away.  Again, nicely hidden and a good look back.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before I tell you about what was actually the first box I found, I should mention that I managed to slip out to Mixon right before dark and grab a couple of boxes out there - also JBK's - her Afton Grove Mayor box and one of her December Holiday Series.  That is a cool cemetery and I always enjoy roaming in it a bit.  I did, by the way, stumble upon a geocache very near the holiday box, but by appearances they have lived together very nicely for several months and have shared many finders.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My first box of the evening was A Tragic End about one of the young men from New Summerfield who died in a car accident.  What caught my eye in the clue was that he had recently been awarded his Eagle Scout rank.  I've sat on several Eagle Boards of Review and I am always in awe of the young men who reach that level of scouting and I  consider it an honor for myself to get to be a part of their last hurdle in achieving the rank.  It really does take quite an effort to get that far, so I know that the loss of Joe Woolery was a true loss indeed.  As JBK leads the finder in to the box that honors his memory, she notes that you should look for the headstone that reads "Gunsmith to millions of Cowboys".  That had also caught my eye since I couldn't imagine who that might be.  Sure enough, I spotted the headstone and began to really ponder who on earth that might have been - Jacksonville has had its share of characters and standouts, but I couldn't think of a single gunsmith.  Finally, the little voice of reason in my head spoke up enough for me to hear it, and it suggested I read the name on the headstone - well what a good idea that was!  And so I did - it was Talley Nichols.  Cool - one of Jacksonville's greatest benefactors!  I knew he had been a big plastics man, but I had no idea he was a gunsmith too - I thought that was a very interesting combination of interests.  And that little voice again suggested that I might see what happened when I combined the two (plastics and guns) and suddenly I realized - "Of course!  Plastic guns!  Mr. Nichols' first company, Nichols Industries, made its fortune making plastic guns".  He went on to start up several other companies around town, all based around the plastics industry, and one of his sons carried on the tradition.  As a result of the Nichols' family's efforts, Jacksonville has as strong an economic base an any small town our size.  And yet - on his tombstone he wears the title "Gunsmith to Millions of Cowboys".  How cool is that?</div>
