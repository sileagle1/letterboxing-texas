While I was hanging out on the couch for the last few days, feeling<br/>
absolutely wretched, our elusive Gryzzled Gryphon signed in to the Gryphon<br/>
Bait box dedicated to him/her and wrote a most erudite and courteous note to<br/>
us! <br/>
Several of us had made all kinds of conjectures about the nature of this<br/>
famous Texas letterboxer - analyzing the size of the handwriting, trying to<br/>
decipher the code, tracking where &amp; when Gryphon appeared at various boxes -<br/>
obviously when you present a group of letterboxers with any kind of mystery<br/>
we just can't help being compulsive about solving it!<br/>
Lucy, BusyBee and Dewberry - you will not be surprised that your guesses<br/>
about his/her character seem to be right on target - if emails are anything<br/>
to go by! The note we received was incredibly modest, charming and<br/>
intelligent.<br/>
Soooo...now we just need to persuade him/her that we are actually harmless<br/>
(!!!) and would love to welcome this infamous letterboxing specter to the<br/>
Texas Letterboxing list!<br/>
<br/>
I'm "blind-copying" this note to dear GG, in hopes this will be the<br/>
invitation necessary to prompt a new membership - but honoring his/her<br/>
privacy at the same time by concealing the address. <br/>

were feeling so badly...<br/>
<br/>
I suppose I don't mind if he wants to remain<br/>
anonymous, but I do want him to know how much richer<br/>
he has made letterboxing in Texas!  To my knowledge he<br/>
was the first person ever to find one of my boxes -<br/>
and I waited months to find a log entry and was<br/>
beginning to despair of ever having one discovered.  <br/>
<br/>
It has been such fun to know there is a boxer who<br/>
ferrets out and logs even remote boxes such as A<br/>
Family Affair - and how much fun it was for me to know<br/>
that he and I had been boxing the same area the same<br/>
day!<br/>
<br/>
And I have two questions (at least) for him - 1) Why<br/>
has he never hidden any boxes of his own? and 2) May I<br/>
please see his logbook?  Wouldn't that be interesting?<br/>
 Has he ever boxed out of Texas?  And<br/>
ooooohhhhh....does he have any exchanges????  <br/>
Hmmmm....<br/>
<br/>
When I emailed the placers of a couple of HH's I found<br/>
week before last, I made sure to tell them of their<br/>
own good fortune in having a GG stamp in their<br/>
logbook.  One of the placers was very excited, having<br/>
heard us mention GG on the big list.  He even went off<br/>
on his own internet search, trying to figure out who<br/>
he is (but of course, he didn't get any further than<br/>
we did!).<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad to know that the nature of his messages have<br/>
perpetuated our image of him!<br/>
