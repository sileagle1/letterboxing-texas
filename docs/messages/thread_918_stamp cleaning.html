I just wanted to share something that you all may know but that I <br>
learned about this past week while letterboxing with my small <br>
children.  Baby wipes make a wonderful stamp cleaner.  I have a small <br>
flat container that is for a diaper bag that holds wipes, it also fits <br>
perfectly into the small backpack that we keep our letterboxing stamps, <br>
logbooks, and ink in.  After stamping I now wipe off my stamp as well <br>
as the stamp of the letterbox that I am visiting.  <br>

Thanks,<br>

<br>
Bad, bad, bad idea. Baby wipes are usually scented with a perfume, and the <br>
scent can attract critters to the letterbox, and they'll ultimately destroy it.<br>
<br>
Also, even the "unscented" ones still have a scent from the soap that's <br>
embedded in the wipes, and that odor can draw animals to the letterbox to <br>
investigate further, and usually that means the end of the letterbox.<br>
<br>
Any kind of "scented" ink pad is also a bad idea to use in a letterbox for <br>
the same reason.<br>
<br>
Damp paper towels in a baggie are easy to carry and work perfectly fine at <br>
cleaning most stamps.<br>

Learn something new every day.  Now, clearly there's a serious market <br>
for critter-repellant babywipes (takers, anyone?).  I've been finding <br>
chew marks on some of my urban park boxes.  I think urban raccoons are <br>
perhaps more enterprising than their country cousins.<br>
<br>
Seriously, though, the versatility of babywipes makes them a good part <br>
of a letterboxing with children survival kit, along with a first aid <br>
kit(bandaids, neosporin, calamine, instant ice pack, poison ivy soap), <br>
sunscreen, insect repellant, snacks (lots of snacks), a compass for <br>
each child, a logbook for each child, and water!  <br>
