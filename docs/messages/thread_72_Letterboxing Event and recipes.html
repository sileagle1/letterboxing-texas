                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all.  I wrote yesterday, but evidently my message didn't take.  <br/>
I wanted to thank everyone for participating in this great event.  A <br/>
big Hoorah to Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, and all those  who's <br/>
logistical talents came off so well.  Also, a special thanks to those <br/>
who went out of their way to bring such tasty eats!  I asked for <br/>
recipies for the great chili and those delectable Thai chicken wraps <br/>
yesterday, and I see that Grace and I weren't the only ones who <br/>
really enjoyed them.  Thanks for the recipies guys!<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, we had a great time, had fun searching for <br/>
letterboxes with some fun people and, all in all, thoroughly enjoyed <br/>
the day.  Sunday morning saw us at Beuscher State Park finding a few <br/>
more boxes.  What a pretty hike down into the "wilderness."<br/>
<br/>
Warm regards to all, and let's all stay in touch.<br/>
<br/>
