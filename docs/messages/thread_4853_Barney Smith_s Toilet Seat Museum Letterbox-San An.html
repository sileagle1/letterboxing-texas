                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello All. I've been delinquent in reporting about a recent trip to San Antonio and Barney's Toilet Seat Museum.  I went to San Antonio with 4 friends to bowl in the Women's State Bowling Tournament in mid-June. I had picked out several letterboxes and geocaches that I thought would be interesting to find.  One of the 4 ladies traveling with me is also a letterboxer and geocacher and, if we didn't have time during our short trip to San Antonio to look for all of them, a must see for us was to meet Barney and see his museum.  We were not disappointed and the other 3 members of our entourage and I were in awe when Barney opened up the garage doors for us to go inside.  What an awesome experience we had and what a wonderful new friend we made when we met Barney.  We came in search of both a letterbox and geocache at Barney's.  Barney was very gracious about letting us into his museum on short notice.  We were all in awe of what we saw when he opened up the garage doors.  A camera is definitely a must bring when you go.  Barkaboutus and I were able to sign the newest geocaching toilet seat and we also found, signed, and stamped into the letterbox too!  Before we left we took pictures of ourselves with Barney and we told him that we needed to get to our bowling tournament and he asked us if we wanted to sign his bowling toilet seat so all 5 of us were the 3rd through 7th signees on this toilet seat.  It was the best experience I've ever had. <br/>
<br/>
Barney is 90 years young and he has many great stories to share with you so if you get down San Antonio way make sure to include a stop at Barney's Museum but don't wait too long.  Who knows how much longer he'll be around.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Barney!!  And thank you JB Kokopelli for carving and planting this letterbox.<br/>
