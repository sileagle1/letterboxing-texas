                    <div class="plaintext-content">It all started for me back in April, 2002 when I read<br/>
an article in a magazine (I can't remember which one)<br/>
about letterboxing.  I thought it sounded interesting,<br/>
so I went to LBNA website and read all about it and was<br/>
further intrigued.  However, when I looked on the Texas<br/>
clue page, there were less than 10 boxes in the entire<br/>
state and none near me, so I promptly lost interest and<br/>
did not think any more about it for several months.  Then<br/>
in August, Baby Bear (my brother) and I flew to Spokane, WA<br/>
to go backpacking in Glacier NP, so I looked on the LBNA<br/>
site for Spokane and found one box that looked close to<br/>
where we would stay the last night before heading home.<br/>
I talked Baby Bear into looking for it, even though we did<br/>
not have stamps or logbooks or inkpads.  We were both<br/>
skeptical until we actually found it, then a change came<br/>
over us and we knew this was something we would enjoy.  The<br/>
Finch Arboretum Letterbox became our first find, and luckily<br/>
it had cards with the stamp image on them so we were able<br/>
to bring back the image and eventually paste it into our<br/>
newly purchased logbooks.  As luck would have it, there was<br/>
a Hitchhiker also in the box, so not knowing exactly what<br/>
to do with it except to move it to another box, we took it<br/>
with us back to Texas.<br/>
Our next step was to pick trail names and get a personal stamp<br/>
and logbook.  At the time, I was in Indian Pricesses with my<br/>
daughter and my Indian name was Silver Eagle, so I went with <br/>
that.  I bought some silver ink and an eagle stamp, since I<br/>
did not think there was any way I could carve one, and was<br/>
all set.  But, since there were still no boxes near me and<br/>
I had this HH to get rid of, I realized I would have to place<br/>
a box of my own.  My family was about to go to Zube Park, so<br/>
I bought a train stamp and created my first box, Zube Zephyr,<br/>
where I placed the Hitchhiker (it was the Hitch HH, shaped<br/>
like Alfred Hitchcock) on 09/21/2002.<br/>
After reading on the Big Talklist about how hand-carved stamps<br/>
were much more desireable than store-bought, I decided to try<br/>
one.  Now understand, I have no artistic ability, so this was<br/>
a major undertaking.  I had this huge, green, rubber eraser<br/>
on my desk, so I decided to create an alligator and put it in<br/>
Brazos Bend SP.  This became my first hand-carved stamp box<br/>
and first box in a series (TX Bird Trail) on 11/09/2002.<br/>
Soon Baby Bear was placing boxes of his own and we started<br/>
finding each other's and going on Letterbox Placing trips<br/>
when our families would let us.  I had decided early on<br/>
that the best way to get letterboxing going in Texas was to<br/>
spread new boxes over as wide an area as I could, so that is<br/>
what I tried to do.  I thought of them as little letterboxing<br/>
seeds and I was the ever-hopeful gardener.  I guess it worked,<br/>
just look at us now!<br/>
As I got better carving, I decided I should create a hand-<br/>
carved personal stamp, so I created my current Silver Eagle<br/>
and stamps for both my children.  Unfortunately, they still<br/>
remain uninterested in letterboxing and it is the one regret<br/>
I have about the whole thing.<br/>
I often wonder what would have happened if Baby Bear and I<br/>
had not found that box in Spokane.  Would we have eventually<br/>
started letterboxing after a while or forgotten all about it?<br/>
Only the Letterboxing Gods know for sure.<br/>
