                    <html><body><p>Ive noticed that myself, and in fact, there is someone who has signed up to attend the gathering this next weekend like that.<span> </span>I had never heard of them, so I went to AQ to check out their logbook and it was private  7 finds, no idea where or which ones.<span> </span>It threw up red flags in my mind  something along the lines of Im inviting these folks to my home turf, theyll possibly meet some of my real life friends, Ill be giving them my cell phone number, and yet they dont give me a peek at who they are?<span> </span>They wrote me shortly thereafter to ask a few questions, and they seem just as nice and normal as any other letterboxer, so I decided to chill and reserve judgment.</p>
<p></p>
<p>After thinking about it a bit, I suspect it is an attempt to protect their privacy  a reaction to the fact that they are leaving footprints everywhere they go in letterboxing, and not wanting that to be quite so evident as an online logbook makes it.<span> </span>I can understand that.<span> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>I can also see that old school-style players dont want to show their logbooks, but then, old schoolers dont log their finds online anyway.<span> </span>And yet again, I can see that by having a private logbook, its a good way for old schoolers to keep up with their finds online without revealing their logbooks.<span> </span>Most old schoolers dont really think that way, but it could happen that way even so.</p>
<p></p>
<p>I think weve sort of come to think of the online logbook as a handshake of sorts  a way to measure someone without giving them the third degree or being rude.<span> </span>Another of those many things  whatever did we do before all the online bells and whistles came along?</p>
