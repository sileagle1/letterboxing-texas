<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">After thinking about it a bit, I suspect it is an attempt to protect their privacy  a reaction to the fact that they are leaving footprints everywhere they go in letterboxing, and not wanting that to be quite so evident as an online logbook makes it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I can understand that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I can also see that old school-style players dont want to show their logbooks, but then, old schoolers dont log their finds online anyway.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>And yet again, I can see that by having a private logbook, its a good way for old schoolers to keep up with their finds online without revealing their logbooks.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Most old schoolers dont really think that way, but it could happen that way even so.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I think weve sort of come to think of the online logbook as a handshake of sorts  a way to measure someone without giving them the third degree or being rude.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Another of those many things  whatever did we do before all the online bells and whistles came along?</p>
