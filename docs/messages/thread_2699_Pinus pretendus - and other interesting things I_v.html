<div>Pinus pretendus - the one I found yesterday looked distinctly like an oak tree.  The reason I know it wasn't an oak tree is because the clues said it was a pine tree.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the last month, I've chased lefts that were really rights, parks that had one name in the clues and another in real life, driven two miles that were supposed to be five, and driven eight miles to find signs that were supposed to be three miles out.  I've driven miles to a town looking for a particular street, only to find the street doesn't exist in said town.  I've had to guess whether someone meant two-stepped paces or one-stepped paces, then tried to step it out both ways only to be left to wonder if they had done toe-to-toe steps or giant steps, or made the number up altogether.  But I've never failed to find a box because the clues were so bad I couldn't - thankfully.  Fortunately we letterboxers are pretty ingenious folk and we can figure out ways to get around clue writers to find the box.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - if you are planting a box, please be precise in your clues unless you are planting a puzzle box.  And even with a puzzle box, you shouldn't be blatantly wrong or misleading - the fun in a puzzle box is saying exactly what you mean, just making it difficult to figure out exactly what you mean.  Sometimes the problem isn't that bad - in the case of yesterday, we followed the directions until we knew we were in the area, but the only possible tree wasn't a pine tree, so we knew there was a mistake in the clues, so we pretended the tree was a pine tree and looked and found the box - no problem.  Still though, some inaccuracies can cause major frustration and expense in terms of time and gas.  There is no fun in that.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And let me just say - if anyone ever thinks there is something in my clues that isn't right, please let me know!  I like to think my clues are always perfectly precise, but precise to me isn't necessarily precise to you - and what does it matter if it is precise to me, since I already know where the box is?

<div><font size="2">And thank you for not REALLY putting it in very fine print. All good points. I've been the victim of clues where the writer would say: "take the exit off I-84 onto Hwy 67 go right, and go 7 miles to the trail entrance". Unfortunately, I was coming from the west side of the state (CT) and they were writing the clues coming from the east side of the state, but I didn't know that because they didn't say, "traveling west, take the exit for Hwy 67, etc.". Obviously, when following the clues, I turned left on 67 and headed south seven miles, when I should have been heading north. If at all possible, it's always a good idea to have someone check your clues before posting them.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I've had people email me and tell me when they were confused following my clues, and I really appreciate it so I can make sure they're clear. The object is to have my boxes found!</font></div>

<div>
<div><font size="2">That's another good point: I didn't realize that the military standard of 1 step is one pace. According to the book, "The Letterboxer's Companion" by Randy Hall, he states "The official definition of a pace is two steps, but most American letterboxers count a pace as a single step.  The real trick to pace counting, be it in steps or paces, is to calibrate your pace to that of the clue writer."  So..... I usually write my clues like this: "Go 16 paces (32 short person steps), etc", and I try to follow that with another clue such as "to a hollowed out oak tree on your left." Heck... if your GPS only gets you within five to ten feet, my "short person steps" ought to be at least that accurate!</font></div>

<div>Pinus pretendus - the one I found yesterday looked distinctly like an oak tree.  The reason I know it wasn't an oak tree is because the clues said it was a pine tree.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the last month, I've chased lefts that were really rights, parks that had one name in the clues and another in real life, driven two miles that were supposed to be five, and driven eight miles to find signs that were supposed to be three miles out.  I've driven miles to a town looking for a particular street, only to find the street doesn't exist in said town.  I've had to guess whether someone meant two-stepped paces or one-stepped paces, then tried to step it out both ways only to be left to wonder if they had done toe-to-toe steps or giant steps, or made the number up altogether.  But I've never failed to find a box because the clues were so bad I couldn't - thankfully.  Fortunately we letterboxers are pretty ingenious folk and we can figure out ways to get around clue writers to find the box. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please - if you are planting a box, please be precise in your clues unless you are planting a puzzle box.  And even with a puzzle box, you shouldn't be blatantly wrong or misleading - the fun in a puzzle box is saying exactly what you mean, just making it difficult to figure out exactly what you mean.  Sometimes the problem isn't that bad - in the case of yesterday, we followed the directions until we knew we were in the area, but the only possible tree wasn't a pine tree, so we knew there was a mistake in the clues, so we pretended the tree was a pine tree and looked and found the box - no problem.  Still though, some inaccuracies can cause major frustration and expense in terms of time and gas.  There is no fun in that. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And let me just say - if anyone ever thinks there is something in my clues that isn't right, please let me know!  I like to think my clues are always perfectly precise, but precise to me isn't necessarily precise to you - and what does it matter if it is precise to me, since I already know where the box is? </div>

<div><font size="2">That's another good point: I didn't realize that the 
  military standard of 1 step is one pace. According to the book, "The 
  Letterboxer'<wbr>s Companion" by Randy Hall, he states "The official 
  definition of a pace is two steps, but most American letterboxers count a pace 
  as a single step.  The real trick to pace counting, be it in steps or 
  paces, is to calibrate your pace to that of the clue writer."  So..... I 
  usually write my clues like this: "Go 16 paces (32 short person steps), etc", 
  and I try to follow that with another clue such as "to a hollowed 
  out oak tree on your left." Heck... if your GPS only gets you within five to 
  ten feet, my "short person steps" ought to be at least that 
  accurate!</wbr></font></div>

<div>Pinus pretendus - the one I found yesterday looked distinctly like an oak tree.  The reason I know it wasn't an oak tree is because the clues said it was a pine tree.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the last month, I've chased lefts that were really rights, parks that had one name in the clues and another in real life, driven two miles that were supposed to be five, and driven eight miles to find signs that were supposed to be three miles out.  I've driven miles to a town looking for a particular street, only to find the street doesn't exist in said town.  I've had to guess whether someone meant two-stepped paces or one-stepped paces, then tried to step it out both ways only to be left to wonder if they had done toe-to-toe steps or giant steps, or made the number up altogether.  But I've never failed to find a box because the clues were so bad I couldn't - thankfully.  Fortunately we letterboxers are pretty ingenious folk and we can figure out ways to get around clue writers to find the box. </div>

<div>Please - if you are planting a box, please be precise in your clues unless you are planting a puzzle box.  And even with a puzzle box, you shouldn't be blatantly wrong or misleading - the fun in a puzzle box is saying exactly what you mean, just making it difficult to figure out exactly what you mean.  Sometimes the problem isn't that bad - in the case of yesterday, we followed the directions until we knew we were in the area, but the only possible tree wasn't a pine tree, so we knew there was a mistake in the clues, so we pretended the tree was a pine tree and looked and found the box - no problem.  Still though, some inaccuracies can cause major frustration and expense in terms of time and gas.  There is no fun in that. </div>

<div>And let me just say - if anyone ever thinks there is something in my clues that isn't right, please let me know!  I like to think my clues are always perfectly precise, but precise to me isn't necessarily precise to you - and what does it matter if it is precise to me, since I already know where the box is? </div>

<br>
Sometimes you learn the placer by finding enough of his/her boxes and <br>
you just know what they mean...even though the clues are wrong, you <br>
know what they should say.<br>
<br>
I admit to having east/west dyslexia.  I know which direction I mean, <br>
I never confuse north and south and I never confuse right and left.  <br>
But sometimes, I will write east for west or west for east.  <br>
<br>
But, I've occasionally been guilty of miscounting steps or <br>
trailsigns.  Sometimes what made sense in the field doesn't make <br>
sense at home when I'm writing up the clues.  That's one reason I'm <br>
always relieved when boxes have a first finder...<br>

standard of 1 step is one pace. According to the book, "The <br>
Letterboxer's Companion" by Randy Hall, he states "The official <br>
definition of a pace is two steps, but most American letterboxers <br>
count a pace as a single step.  The real trick to pace counting, be <br>
it in steps or paces, is to calibrate your pace to that of the clue <br>
writer."  So..... I usually write my clues like this: "Go 16 paces <br>
(32 short person steps), etc", and I try to follow that with another <br>
clue such as "to a hollowed out oak tree on your left." Heck... if <br>
your GPS only gets you within five to ten feet, my "short person <br>
steps" ought to be at least that accurate!<br>

I always add about 10% to his distances and they work well that way <br>
