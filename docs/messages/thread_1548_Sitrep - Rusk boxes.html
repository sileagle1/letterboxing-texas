(chiming in on the "safe bats" thing), Lightning and I<br/>
spent our day in Rusk checking on boxes there and<br/>
planting our scout series and a couple of the festival<br/>
series that I should've gotten planted long ago.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, we were not able to check the two boxes<br/>
at The Footbridge - well, we probably could've, but I<br/>
know they've been doing maintenance on the bridge so<br/>
there were workers around.  We found those a couple of<br/>
months ago and they were in great shape, so we'll wait<br/>
until after the work is done before we check on them<br/>
again.<br/>
<br/>
Information on specific boxes follows.<br/>
<br/>
Our first stop was at Jim Hogg State Historical Site,<br/>
where we checked two boxes and planted our six box<br/>
Scout Training Series.  I'll probably drop the<br/>
"training" out of that title, and I'm going to post<br/>
that series a little differently than a standard box. <br/>
It's geared toward Cub Scouts, although Girl Scouts<br/>
and Boy Scouts will enjoy it also, as will plain ol'<br/>
boxers.  I'm going to provide a packet of information<br/>
to leaders who want to take their dens boxing and<br/>
include in it the clues and instructions for leaders<br/>
to cover as well as things for them to watch for as<br/>
they take their boys boxing.  My son stepped off the<br/>
steps so that they will be done in boy steps (in other<br/>
words, watch out grown ups - the step counts will be<br/>
really short compared to yours!) and I've included<br/>
compass readings, visual landmarks, steps, and one box<br/>
that is just plain easy but it will require stealth. <br/>
I'll be posting clues for the series somewhere other<br/>
than LBNA, but I'll put an announcement and an<br/>
invitation to request additional information on LBNA. <br/>
Once I have it all sorted out, I'll post a link here<br/>
and I'll also request input on the information I'll be<br/>
providing to scout leaders.  I hope to hand stuff out<br/>
on the series at Roundtable next Thursday, so<br/>
hopefully I'll get all this done in the next day or<br/>
two.<br/>
<br/>
After our encounter with the creepy dude and our<br/>
ambitious box-planting foray at Jim Hogg, we didn't<br/>
get to spend as much time as we wanted at Rusk State<br/>
Park.  We got over there about 4:00 p.m. and went<br/>
right over to check on Silver Eagle's Texas RR 2 and<br/>
then planted one of the festival boxes I had in my<br/>
possession.  We cruised around the camping area and<br/>
tried to figure out where our group pavilion will be,<br/>
but weren't sure exactly.  If it's where I think it<br/>
is, there is a lot of group camping around it that<br/>
would be cool for anyone who wants to group up with<br/>
other letterboxers.  I'll check that next time I make<br/>
it down that way.  It was getting late fast, so we<br/>
headed to the nature trail and planted another<br/>
festival box we had, and meanwhile checked up on Birds<br/>
of a Feathers' Crowin' bout the Railroad.  I love<br/>
those clues!  We were stamping into the logbook and<br/>
checking out the book when suddenly it was as though<br/>
someone started shutting off the lights.  We buttoned<br/>
the box back up and replaced it, mindful we needed to<br/>
get back to the road before it got real dark - and we<br/>
ALMOST made it!<br/>
<br/>
The good news is - every single box we checked on was<br/>
rehidden well.  And every box except my own was in<br/>
very good condition.  Sure was a nice day and we got<br/>
in lots of good hiking, him with his new backpack and<br/>
me with new hiking shoes.  Oh yeah, and we were amazed<br/>
by all the PURPLE leaves!  Pretty...<br/>

SPECIFIC BOX STATUS:<br/>
HOGG-We found Hogg with no problem - it's in great<br/>
shape and has had quite a few visitors.  Box was nice<br/>
and dry and the stamp is still in great condition,<br/>
even being nearly three years old!  While this was one<br/>
of our first boxes we ever found, I took an imprint<br/>
anyway just because I wanted to see how a three year<br/>
old stamp carved on a cheap eraser would stamp, and it<br/>
looks great!  <br/>
<br/>
STARRY, STARRY NIGHT -this box was pretty soggy.  I've<br/>
been migrating to better containers and this one is a<br/>
testament to why that's a good idea.  Although the box<br/>
was closed well, it had a small crack in the edge of<br/>
the lid and apparently that was sufficient to let a<br/>
lot of water in.  It was also one of the last boxes I<br/>
left an ink pad in and I am now a firm believer in<br/>
leaving ink out of boxes!  Fortunately, the pad was<br/>
separately bagged, so all I had to do was lift the<br/>
nasty mess out of the box in its bag, and drop it into<br/>
another bag in my backpack.  The stamp was also really<br/>
wet, but I dried it off as best I could and I'm going<br/>
to watch the wood backing to see how badly it warps. <br/>
The logbook, thankfully, was dry as a bone.  I'll<br/>
replace the container and possibly the stamp backing<br/>
in March at gathering time, if not before, so need for<br/>
anyone to worry about it if they find that box before<br/>
I get back to it.  <br/>
<br/>
TEXAS RR 2 - Box is in great shape.  It's seen a fair<br/>
number of visitors, so I bet the logbook is enough for<br/>
any traffic between now and the gathering, but it<br/>
won't last through the gathering.<br/>
<br/>
CROWIN' ABOUT THE RAILROAD-We caught this one as the<br/>
sun was rapidly dropping on us!  I still LOVE the<br/>
clues for this one and was glad to find the box in<br/>
very good condition.  Quite a few visitors so far. <br/>
The first time I visited it, I had grabbed the wrong<br/>
sig stamp, so I corrected it today.<br/>
