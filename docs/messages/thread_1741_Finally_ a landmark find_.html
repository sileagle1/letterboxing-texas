for 2.5 years and I've only today hit 100 finds!<br/>
<br/>
SJZ is visiting, but she was hanging out with friends<br/>
yesterday, and Fearless Fox and Lightning had gone to<br/>
Arkansas to hike, so I was alone for the weekend.  I<br/>
was thoroughly tired by yesterday evening, so I had<br/>
settled down to looking through my logbook and<br/>
cleaning things up in it, when I suddenly realized I<br/>
was only 4 boxes shy of 100!  I knew I could probably<br/>
get those four at the gathering next week, but I<br/>
wanted to go to the gathering WITH 100...<br/>
<br/>
So I figured out where I would have to go to get those<br/>
four, and realized the closest places with<br/>
concentrations of boxes I hadn't yet found were either<br/>
Waco/Temple/Killeen or Livingston/Diboll/Lufkin -<br/>
either direction about 2 hours for me.  I opted to go<br/>
south, so with clues for six boxes in hand, I figured<br/>
I could hit my mark.<br/>
<br/>
I went all the way to Livingston to start so I could<br/>
work my way home, and when I stopped at my first box,<br/>
all I could find was the cap - yikes!  I was down to<br/>
five possibilities right away, so I quickly called SJZ<br/>
and asked her to look up the Nacogdoches boxes I<br/>
haven't yet gotten (because y'all know Lucy Locket<br/>
likes to plant new boxes as soon as I work Nacogdoches<br/>
over, and she now has cohorts in her efforts at<br/>
that!).  SJZ obliged, so I felt a little better being<br/>
equipped with a couple more backups that I had<br/>
handwritten clues for.<br/>
<br/>
I made my way to the state park at Lake Livingston and<br/>
quickly found Quetzel's State Mammal, but there were<br/>
muggles all around so I couldn't go in for it right<br/>
away.  How frustrating!  I finally decided I could<br/>
make like I was examining the ants near the box (the<br/>
ones I had earlier set my hand in while trying to<br/>
determine if I had the right place) and could possibly<br/>
retrieve the box inconspicuously.  It worked out just<br/>
fine, which was great except that recovering well is<br/>
always more difficult than extricating when there are<br/>
prying eyes around, at least for me!  I finally caught<br/>
a break in traffic and got the box rehidden, so I made<br/>
my way to the next starting point.  <br/>
<br/>
Now Lake Livingston State Park has a couple of pretty<br/>
unique features you don't see in just any old state<br/>
park - a pool and a boardwalk trail.  The next box was<br/>
down the boardwalk.  I had fun walking that, except<br/>
that as I walked my steps reverberated behind me and I<br/>
kept thinking folks were coming up behind me and I<br/>
would move aside to let them by.  I finally wound up<br/>
walking on the edge so I could quit looking over my<br/>
shoulder.  I'm sure I looked kind of silly!  The box<br/>
was placed by Frye Team's boys, and it was a nice<br/>
hide.  Fun box - and what's better, I happened upon<br/>
Chillin' at Tonkawa trying to make its way home.  How<br/>
do you count that though?  Hmmm...<br/>
<br/>
I wanted to try autumn.wind's Treasure, but I thought<br/>
I had lost my clues to it until I realized much too<br/>
late that I had put them out of order.  I guess it's<br/>
just destined that I will leave a town with one more<br/>
box for me to find.  And that meant I had to find the<br/>
next two or I would have to detour to Nac before I<br/>
could go home.<br/>
<br/>
I got back to Diboll and quickly got Frye Team's<br/>
Crawlin Down 59.  I had tried for it on my way down<br/>
when I stopped to stretch for a few, but there were<br/>
construction workers close by and I was afraid they<br/>
would notice me lurking around.  Luckily they were<br/>
packing up and leaving when I arrived back, so I just<br/>
lurked suspiciously about until they had vacated the<br/>
job site.  <br/>
<br/>
I was up to 99 - and I had one more box to check out -<br/>
Lucy Locket's Land of the Little Angel.  It was the<br/>
only one in Lufkin I hadn't yet gotten.  Another nice<br/>
trail and a very good hide.  I thought it was a great<br/>
box to call #100!  I thought it was cool it was one of<br/>
Lucy's too, since she has a way of keeping one or two<br/>
boxes in her back pocket to pull out just when I think<br/>
I've found all of hers (okay, I'm not really so<br/>
self-absorbed that I believe she does it deliberately,<br/>
but it sure SEEMS that way)!<br/>
<br/>
I was able to make my way home without detouring to<br/>
Nacogdoches, although that wouldn't have been a<br/>
terrible thing either.  <br/>
<br/>
The drive was glorious - everything is brilliantly<br/>
blindingly busting out green and lots of trees are<br/>
blooming.  <br/>
<br/>
So - since I decided to do a little counting this<br/>
weekend, this is where I stand countwise:<br/>
<br/>
Finds 100<br/>
Plants 33<br/>
Exchanges 48<br/>
Hitchhikers 9<br/>
Events 3<br/>
Postals 3<br/>
Virtuals 3<br/>
Games 36<br/>
and Traveling Event Stamps 7<br/>
<br/>
And I guess I'm going to have to have an evacuee<br/>
category too - for Chillin' At Tonkawa!<br/>

found our four boxes.  Not only that, you would have been first <br/>
finder on all four.  They're getting lonesome!<br/>
We were in Rusk and Jacksonville this weekend and I wanted to <br/>
apologize for not contacting you.  I forgot to take your cell phone <br/>
number with me.  We had a laptop with remote Internet access, but <br/>
couldn't get a signal.  We were hoping you would call.  We found <br/>
your Homestead Hitchhiker Hostel and took 3 and left 3.  Also, and I <br/>
say this in all modesty, you are standing in the presence of <br/>
greatness...we found your mystery box, Spring Hope, and it was a <br/>
lovely place.  In all, we found 17 boxes and placed 2.  I'll get the <br/>
2 new ones posted tonight.  They're called "The General Sherman" <br/>
and "Underground Railroad - Quilt Block Series No. 3" and they're <br/>
planted in Rusk State Park.  We were planning on doing your Scout <br/>
Series this morning, but the park was locked and we didn't know what <br/>
time it would be open, so we had to save it for another day.  We <br/>
also stopped by Nacogdoches on the way home and found Go Jacks! and <br/>
there was not another sould around the whole time.  Good timing.<br/>
Maybe we'll meet another time to swap stamps.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh believe me, I seriously considered going on down to<br/>
Cold Springs, but I was concerned that the extra drive<br/>
time would cut into my daylight.  As it was, I got<br/>
home about 45 minutes before dark, so it would've been<br/>
cutting it close, but it might've worked.<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, I was in the deep woods much of the<br/>
day yesterday without a phone signal so I couldn't<br/>
call out and you couldn't have reached me.  I guess it<br/>
just wasn't meant to be!  SJZ, my daughter, saw y'all<br/>
though.  I had mentioned that y'all were in the area<br/>
yesterday, so when she and I connected yesterday<br/>
evening, she asked if there was a box in a particular<br/>
place and I confirmed there was (Little Red Chili<br/>
Pepper) - and she said "Well I saw some people<br/>
stamping in then!"  I fussed at her for not stopping<br/>
and saying hello.  <br/>
<br/>
Just out of curiosity, did y'all find Blue Butterfly's<br/>
box in the Railroad Park in Rusk?  <br/>
<br/>
Someone had mentioned that Jim Hogg closes at some<br/>
certain time, which I didn't realize.  I need to find<br/>
out their hours so I can include that in the clues. <br/>
I'm sorry you couldn't get to those boxes!<br/>
<br/>
Glad y'all had a good, productive weekend up in this<br/>
area.  Can you believe that just a couple years ago<br/>
(hmmm...last year even) there were maybe 5 boxes in<br/>
all of Cherokee County, and 3 of those were closest to<br/>
Alto?<br/>

&gt; Lucy, you could have gone 20 miles farther south to<br/>
&gt; Coldspring and <br/>
&gt; found our four boxes.  Not only that, you would have<br/>
&gt; been first <br/>
&gt; finder on all four.  They're getting lonesome!<br/>
&gt; We were in Rusk and Jacksonville this weekend and I<br/>
&gt; wanted to <br/>
&gt; apologize for not contacting you.  I forgot to take<br/>
&gt; your cell phone <br/>
&gt; number with me.  We had a laptop with remote<br/>
&gt; Internet access, but <br/>
&gt; couldn't get a signal.  We were hoping you would<br/>
&gt; call.  We found <br/>
&gt; your Homestead Hitchhiker Hostel and took 3 and left<br/>
&gt; 3.  Also, and I <br/>
&gt; say this in all modesty, you are standing in the<br/>
&gt; presence of <br/>
&gt; greatness...we found your mystery box, Spring Hope,<br/>
&gt; and it was a <br/>
&gt; lovely place.  In all, we found 17 boxes and placed<br/>
&gt; 2.  I'll get the <br/>
&gt; 2 new ones posted tonight.  They're called "The<br/>
&gt; General Sherman" <br/>
&gt; and "Underground Railroad - Quilt Block Series No.<br/>
&gt; 3" and they're <br/>
&gt; planted in Rusk State Park.  We were planning on<br/>
&gt; doing your Scout <br/>
&gt; Series this morning, but the park was locked and we<br/>
&gt; didn't know what <br/>
&gt; time it would be open, so we had to save it for<br/>
&gt; another day.  We <br/>
&gt; also stopped by Nacogdoches on the way home and<br/>
&gt; found Go Jacks! and <br/>
&gt; there was not another sould around the whole time. <br/>
&gt; Good timing.<br/>
&gt; Maybe we'll meet another time to swap stamps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm almost embarassed to say I've been<br/>
&gt; letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 2.5 years and I've only today hit 100 finds!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; SJZ is visiting, but she was hanging out with<br/>
&gt; friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; yesterday, and Fearless Fox and Lightning had gone<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Arkansas to hike, so I was alone for the weekend. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was thoroughly tired by yesterday evening, so I<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; settled down to looking through my logbook and<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleaning things up in it, when I suddenly realized<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was only 4 boxes shy of 100!  I knew I could<br/>
&gt; probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; get those four at the gathering next week, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted to go to the gathering WITH 100...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So I figured out where I would have to go to get<br/>
&gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt; four, and realized the closest places with<br/>
&gt; &gt; concentrations of boxes I hadn't yet found were<br/>
&gt; either<br/>
&gt; &gt; Waco/Temple/Killeen or Livingston/Diboll/Lufkin -<br/>
&gt; &gt; either direction about 2 hours for me.  I opted to<br/>
&gt; go<br/>
&gt; &gt; south, so with clues for six boxes in hand, I<br/>
&gt; figured<br/>
&gt; &gt; I could hit my mark.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I went all the way to Livingston to start so I<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; work my way home, and when I stopped at my first<br/>
&gt; box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; all I could find was the cap - yikes!  I was down<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; five possibilities right away, so I quickly called<br/>
&gt; SJZ<br/>
&gt; &gt; and asked her to look up the Nacogdoches boxes I<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven't yet gotten (because y'all know Lucy Locket<br/>
&gt; &gt; likes to plant new boxes as soon as I work<br/>
&gt; Nacogdoches<br/>
&gt; &gt; over, and she now has cohorts in her efforts at<br/>
&gt; &gt; that!).  SJZ obliged, so I felt a little better<br/>
&gt; being<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipped with a couple more backups that I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; handwritten clues for.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I made my way to the state park at Lake Livingston<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly found Quetzel's State Mammal, but there<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; muggles all around so I couldn't go in for it<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; &gt; away.  How frustrating!  I finally decided I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; make like I was examining the ants near the box<br/>
&gt; (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; ones I had earlier set my hand in while trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; determine if I had the right place) and could<br/>
&gt; possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; retrieve the box inconspicuously.  It worked out<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; fine, which was great except that recovering well<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; always more difficult than extricating when there<br/>
&gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; prying eyes around, at least for me!  I finally<br/>
&gt; caught<br/>
&gt; &gt; a break in traffic and got the box rehidden, so I<br/>
&gt; made<br/>
&gt; &gt; my way to the next starting point.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now Lake Livingston State Park has a couple of<br/>
&gt; pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; unique features you don't see in just any old<br/>
&gt; state<br/>
&gt; &gt; park - a pool and a boardwalk trail.  The next box<br/>
&gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; down the boardwalk.  I had fun walking that,<br/>
&gt; except<br/>
&gt; &gt; that as I walked my steps reverberated behind me<br/>
&gt; and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; kept thinking folks were coming up behind me and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would move aside to let them by.  I finally wound<br/>
&gt; up<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking on the edge so I could quit looking over<br/>
&gt; my<br/>
&gt; &gt; shoulder.  I'm sure I looked kind of silly!  The<br/>
&gt; box<br/>
&gt; &gt; was placed by Frye Team's boys, and it was a nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; hide.  Fun box - and what's better, I happened<br/>
&gt; upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; Chillin' at Tonkawa trying to make its way home. <br/>
&gt; How<br/>
&gt; &gt; do you count that though?  Hmmm...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I wanted to try autumn.wind's Treasure, but I<br/>
&gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; I had lost my clues to it until I realized much<br/>
&gt; too<br/>
&gt; &gt; late that I had put them out of order.  I guess<br/>
&gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; just destined that I will leave a town with one<br/>
&gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; box for me to find.  And that meant I had to find<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; next two or I would have to detour to Nac before I<br/>
&gt; &gt; could go home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I got back to Diboll and quickly got Frye Team's<br/>
&gt; &gt; Crawlin Down 59.  I had tried for it on my way<br/>
&gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; when I stopped to stretch for a few, but there<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; construction workers close by and I was afraid<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; would notice me lurking around.  Luckily they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; packing up and leaving when I arrived back, so I<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; lurked suspiciously about until they had vacated<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; job site.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was up to 99 - and I had one more box to check<br/>
&gt; out -<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lucy Locket's Land of the Little Angel.  It was<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; only one in Lufkin I hadn't yet gotten.  Another<br/>
&gt; nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; trail and a very good hide.  I thought it was a<br/>
&gt; great<br/>
&gt; &gt; box to call #100!  I thought it was cool it was<br/>
&gt; one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lucy's too, since she has a way of keeping one or<br/>
&gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes in her back pocket to pull out just when I<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've found all of hers (okay, I'm not really so<br/>
&gt; &gt; self-absorbed that I believe she does it<br/>
&gt; deliberately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but it sure SEEMS that way)!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I was able to make my way home without detouring<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Nacogdoches, although that wouldn't have been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; terrible thing either.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The drive was glorious - everything is brilliantly<br/>
&gt; &gt; blindingly busting out green and lots of trees are<br/>
&gt; &gt; blooming.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So - since I decided to do a little counting this<br/>
&gt; &gt; weekend, this is where I stand countwise:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Finds 100<br/>
&gt; &gt; Plants 33<br/>

concentrated more on finding than placing.  We started LBing last <br/>
November and have 122 finds, but have only placed 6, so we're way <br/>
behind in that category.  Ya'll have a great time next weekend.  <br/>
Maybe we'll meet some of you on the trail.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; four, and realized the closest places with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; concentrations of boxes I hadn't yet found were<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; hide.  Fun box - and what's better, I happened<br/>
&gt; &gt; upon<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Chillin' at Tonkawa trying to make its way home. <br/>
&gt; &gt; How<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; do you count that though?  Hmmm...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I wanted to try autumn.wind's Treasure, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I had lost my clues to it until I realized much<br/>
&gt; &gt; too<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; late that I had put them out of order.  I guess<br/>
&gt; &gt; it's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just destined that I will leave a town with one<br/>
&gt; &gt; more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box for me to find.  And that meant I had to find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; next two or I would have to detour to Nac before I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could go home.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I got back to Diboll and quickly got Frye Team's<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Crawlin Down 59.  I had tried for it on my way<br/>
&gt; &gt; down<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when I stopped to stretch for a few, but there<br/>
&gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; construction workers close by and I was afraid<br/>
&gt; &gt; they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would notice me lurking around.  Luckily they were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; packing up and leaving when I arrived back, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lurked suspiciously about until they had vacated<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; job site.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was up to 99 - and I had one more box to check<br/>
&gt; &gt; out -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy Locket's Land of the Little Angel.  It was<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; only one in Lufkin I hadn't yet gotten.  Another<br/>
&gt; &gt; nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trail and a very good hide.  I thought it was a<br/>
&gt; &gt; great<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box to call #100!  I thought it was cool it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy's too, since she has a way of keeping one or<br/>
&gt; &gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes in her back pocket to pull out just when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've found all of hers (okay, I'm not really so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-absorbed that I believe she does it<br/>
&gt; &gt; deliberately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it sure SEEMS that way)!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was able to make my way home without detouring<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nacogdoches, although that wouldn't have been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible thing either.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The drive was glorious - everything is brilliantly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blindingly busting out green and lots of trees are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blooming.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So - since I decided to do a little counting this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend, this is where I stand countwise:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Finds 100<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Plants 33<br/>

&gt; Lucy, you could have gone 20 miles farther south to Coldspring and <br/>
&gt; found our four boxes.  Not only that, you would have been first <br/>
&gt; finder on all four.  They're getting lonesome!<br/>
&gt; We were in Rusk and Jacksonville this weekend and I wanted to <br/>
&gt; apologize for not contacting you.  I forgot to take your cell phone <br/>
&gt; number with me.  We had a laptop with remote Internet access, but <br/>
&gt; couldn't get a signal.  We were hoping you would call.  We found <br/>
&gt; your Homestead Hitchhiker Hostel and took 3 and left 3.  Also, and I <br/>
&gt; say this in all modesty, you are standing in the presence of <br/>
&gt; greatness...we found your mystery box, Spring Hope, and it was a <br/>
&gt; lovely place.  In all, we found 17 boxes and placed 2.  I'll get the <br/>
&gt; 2 new ones posted tonight.  They're called "The General Sherman" <br/>
&gt; and "Underground Railroad - Quilt Block Series No. 3" and they're <br/>
&gt; planted in Rusk State Park.  We were planning on doing your Scout <br/>
&gt; Series this morning, but the park was locked and we didn't know what <br/>
&gt; time it would be open, so we had to save it for another day.  We <br/>
&gt; also stopped by Nacogdoches on the way home and found Go Jacks! and <br/>
&gt; there was not another sould around the whole time.  Good timing.<br/>
&gt; Maybe we'll meet another time to swap stamps.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I'm almost embarassed to say I've been letterboxing<br/>
&gt; &gt; for 2.5 years and I've only today hit 100 finds!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; SJZ is visiting, but she was hanging out with friends<br/>
&gt; &gt; yesterday, and Fearless Fox and Lightning had gone to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Arkansas to hike, so I was alone for the weekend.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was thoroughly tired by yesterday evening, so I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; settled down to looking through my logbook and<br/>
&gt; &gt; cleaning things up in it, when I suddenly realized I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was only 4 boxes shy of 100!  I knew I could probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; get those four at the gathering next week, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted to go to the gathering WITH 100...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So I figured out where I would have to go to get those<br/>
&gt; &gt; four, and realized the closest places with<br/>
&gt; &gt; concentrations of boxes I hadn't yet found were either<br/>
&gt; &gt; Waco/Temple/Killeen or Livingston/Diboll/Lufkin -<br/>
&gt; &gt; either direction about 2 hours for me.  I opted to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; south, so with clues for six boxes in hand, I figured<br/>
&gt; &gt; I could hit my mark.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I went all the way to Livingston to start so I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; work my way home, and when I stopped at my first box,<br/>
&gt; &gt; all I could find was the cap - yikes!  I was down to<br/>
&gt; &gt; five possibilities right away, so I quickly called SJZ<br/>
&gt; &gt; and asked her to look up the Nacogdoches boxes I<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven't yet gotten (because y'all know Lucy Locket<br/>
&gt; &gt; likes to plant new boxes as soon as I work Nacogdoches<br/>
&gt; &gt; over, and she now has cohorts in her efforts at<br/>
&gt; &gt; that!).  SJZ obliged, so I felt a little better being<br/>
&gt; &gt; equipped with a couple more backups that I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; handwritten clues for.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I made my way to the state park at Lake Livingston and<br/>
&gt; &gt; quickly found Quetzel's State Mammal, but there were<br/>
&gt; &gt; muggles all around so I couldn't go in for it right<br/>
&gt; &gt; away.  How frustrating!  I finally decided I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; make like I was examining the ants near the box (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; ones I had earlier set my hand in while trying to<br/>
&gt; &gt; determine if I had the right place) and could possibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; retrieve the box inconspicuously.  It worked out just<br/>
&gt; &gt; fine, which was great except that recovering well is<br/>
&gt; &gt; always more difficult than extricating when there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; prying eyes around, at least for me!  I finally caught<br/>
&gt; &gt; a break in traffic and got the box rehidden, so I made<br/>
&gt; &gt; my way to the next starting point.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Now Lake Livingston State Park has a couple of pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; unique features you don't see in just any old state<br/>
&gt; &gt; park - a pool and a boardwalk trail.  The next box was<br/>
&gt; &gt; down the boardwalk.  I had fun walking that, except<br/>
&gt; &gt; that as I walked my steps reverberated behind me and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; kept thinking folks were coming up behind me and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would move aside to let them by.  I finally wound up<br/>
&gt; &gt; walking on the edge so I could quit looking over my<br/>
&gt; &gt; shoulder.  I'm sure I looked kind of silly!  The box<br/>
&gt; &gt; was placed by Frye Team's boys, and it was a nice<br/>

&gt; &gt; Events 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; Postals 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; Virtuals 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; Games 36<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Traveling Event Stamps 7<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And I guess I'm going to have to have an evacuee<br/>
&gt; &gt; category too - for Chillin' At Tonkawa!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; box to call #100!  I thought it was cool it was one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy's too, since she has a way of keeping one or two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes in her back pocket to pull out just when I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I've found all of hers (okay, I'm not really so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; self-absorbed that I believe she does it deliberately,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but it sure SEEMS that way)!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I was able to make my way home without detouring to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nacogdoches, although that wouldn't have been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible thing either.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The drive was glorious - everything is brilliantly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blindingly busting out green and lots of trees are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; blooming.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So - since I decided to do a little counting this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend, this is where I stand countwise:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Finds 100<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Plants 33<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Exchanges 48<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hitchhikers 9<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Events 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Postals 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Virtuals 3<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Games 36<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and Traveling Event Stamps 7<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I guess I'm going to have to have an evacuee<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; category too - for Chillin' At Tonkawa!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
