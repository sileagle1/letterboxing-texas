                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm almost embarassed to say I've been letterboxing<br>
for 2.5 years and I've only today hit 100 finds!<br>
<br>
SJZ is visiting, but she was hanging out with friends<br>
yesterday, and Fearless Fox and Lightning had gone to<br>
Arkansas to hike, so I was alone for the weekend.  I<br>
was thoroughly tired by yesterday evening, so I had<br>
settled down to looking through my logbook and<br>
cleaning things up in it, when I suddenly realized I<br>
was only 4 boxes shy of 100!  I knew I could probably<br>
get those four at the gathering next week, but I<br>
wanted to go to the gathering WITH 100...<br>
<br>
So I figured out where I would have to go to get those<br>
four, and realized the closest places with<br>
concentrations of boxes I hadn't yet found were either<br>
Waco/Temple/Killeen or Livingston/Diboll/Lufkin -<br>
either direction about 2 hours for me.  I opted to go<br>
south, so with clues for six boxes in hand, I figured<br>
I could hit my mark.<br>
<br>
I went all the way to Livingston to start so I could<br>
work my way home, and when I stopped at my first box,<br>
all I could find was the cap - yikes!  I was down to<br>
five possibilities right away, so I quickly called SJZ<br>
and asked her to look up the Nacogdoches boxes I<br>
haven't yet gotten (because y'all know Lucy Locket<br>
likes to plant new boxes as soon as I work Nacogdoches<br>
over, and she now has cohorts in her efforts at<br>
that!).  SJZ obliged, so I felt a little better being<br>
equipped with a couple more backups that I had<br>
handwritten clues for.<br>
<br>
I made my way to the state park at Lake Livingston and<br>
quickly found Quetzel's State Mammal, but there were<br>
muggles all around so I couldn't go in for it right<br>
away.  How frustrating!  I finally decided I could<br>
make like I was examining the ants near the box (the<br>
ones I had earlier set my hand in while trying to<br>
determine if I had the right place) and could possibly<br>
retrieve the box inconspicuously.  It worked out just<br>
fine, which was great except that recovering well is<br>
always more difficult than extricating when there are<br>
prying eyes around, at least for me!  I finally caught<br>
a break in traffic and got the box rehidden, so I made<br>
my way to the next starting point.  <br>
<br>
Now Lake Livingston State Park has a couple of pretty<br>
unique features you don't see in just any old state<br>
park - a pool and a boardwalk trail.  The next box was<br>
down the boardwalk.  I had fun walking that, except<br>
that as I walked my steps reverberated behind me and I<br>
kept thinking folks were coming up behind me and I<br>
would move aside to let them by.  I finally wound up<br>
walking on the edge so I could quit looking over my<br>
shoulder.  I'm sure I looked kind of silly!  The box<br>
was placed by Frye Team's boys, and it was a nice<br>
hide.  Fun box - and what's better, I happened upon<br>
Chillin' at Tonkawa trying to make its way home.  How<br>
do you count that though?  Hmmm...<br>
<br>
I wanted to try autumn.wind's Treasure, but I thought<br>
I had lost my clues to it until I realized much too<br>
late that I had put them out of order.  I guess it's<br>
just destined that I will leave a town with one more<br>
box for me to find.  And that meant I had to find the<br>
next two or I would have to detour to Nac before I<br>
could go home.<br>
<br>
I got back to Diboll and quickly got Frye Team's<br>
Crawlin Down 59.  I had tried for it on my way down<br>
when I stopped to stretch for a few, but there were<br>
construction workers close by and I was afraid they<br>
would notice me lurking around.  Luckily they were<br>
packing up and leaving when I arrived back, so I just<br>
lurked suspiciously about until they had vacated the<br>
job site.  <br>
<br>
I was up to 99 - and I had one more box to check out -<br>
Lucy Locket's Land of the Little Angel.  It was the<br>
only one in Lufkin I hadn't yet gotten.  Another nice<br>
trail and a very good hide.  I thought it was a great<br>
box to call #100!  I thought it was cool it was one of<br>
Lucy's too, since she has a way of keeping one or two<br>
boxes in her back pocket to pull out just when I think<br>
I've found all of hers (okay, I'm not really so<br>
self-absorbed that I believe she does it deliberately,<br>
but it sure SEEMS that way)!<br>
<br>
I was able to make my way home without detouring to<br>
Nacogdoches, although that wouldn't have been a<br>
terrible thing either.  <br>
<br>
The drive was glorious - everything is brilliantly<br>
blindingly busting out green and lots of trees are<br>
blooming.  <br>
<br>
So - since I decided to do a little counting this<br>
weekend, this is where I stand countwise:<br>
<br>
Finds 100<br>
Plants 33<br>
Exchanges 48<br>
Hitchhikers 9<br>
Events 3<br>
Postals 3<br>
Virtuals 3<br>
Games 36<br>
and Traveling Event Stamps 7<br>
<br>
And I guess I'm going to have to have an evacuee<br>
category too - for Chillin' At Tonkawa!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lucy, you could have gone 20 miles farther south to Coldspring and <br>
found our four boxes.  Not only that, you would have been first <br>
finder on all four.  They're getting lonesome!<br>
We were in Rusk and Jacksonville this weekend and I wanted to <br>
apologize for not contacting you.  I forgot to take your cell phone <br>
number with me.  We had a laptop with remote Internet access, but <br>
couldn't get a signal.  We were hoping you would call.  We found <br>
your Homestead Hitchhiker Hostel and took 3 and left 3.  Also, and I <br>
say this in all modesty, you are standing in the presence of <br>
greatness...we found your mystery box, Spring Hope, and it was a <br>
lovely place.  In all, we found 17 boxes and placed 2.  I'll get the <br>
2 new ones posted tonight.  They're called "The General Sherman" <br>
and "Underground Railroad - Quilt Block Series No. 3" and they're <br>
planted in Rusk State Park.  We were planning on doing your Scout <br>
Series this morning, but the park was locked and we didn't know what <br>
time it would be open, so we had to save it for another day.  We <br>
also stopped by Nacogdoches on the way home and found Go Jacks! and <br>
there was not another sould around the whole time.  Good timing.<br>
Maybe we'll meet another time to swap stamps.<br>

day yesterday without a phone signal so I couldn't<br>
call out and you couldn't have reached me.  I guess it<br>
just wasn't meant to be!  SJZ, my daughter, saw y'all<br>
though.  I had mentioned that y'all were in the area<br>
yesterday, so when she and I connected yesterday<br>
evening, she asked if there was a box in a particular<br>
place and I confirmed there was (Little Red Chili<br>
Pepper) - and she said "Well I saw some people<br>
stamping in then!"  I fussed at her for not stopping<br>
and saying hello.  <br>
<br>
Just out of curiosity, did y'all find Blue Butterfly's<br>
box in the Railroad Park in Rusk?  <br>
<br>
Someone had mentioned that Jim Hogg closes at some<br>
certain time, which I didn't realize.  I need to find<br>
out their hours so I can include that in the clues. <br>
I'm sorry you couldn't get to those boxes!<br>
<br>
Glad y'all had a good, productive weekend up in this<br>
area.  Can you believe that just a couple years ago<br>
(hmmm...last year even) there were maybe 5 boxes in<br>
all of Cherokee County, and 3 of those were closest to<br>
Alto?<br>

stopped by.  And yes, we found Blue Butterfly's box.  We were <br>
surprised and pleased by the "next finder gift", and meant to thank <br>
you for it.  We also found your "Flying Again" and "Killough <br>
Monument" in addition to those I've already mentioned.  I just <br>
posted our new boxes at Rusk, The General Sherman and Underground <br>
Railroad.  Thanks for placing all those boxes for us to find.  We've <br>
concentrated more on finding than placing.  We started LBing last <br>
November and have 122 finds, but have only placed 6, so we're way <br>
behind in that category.  Ya'll have a great time next weekend.  <br>
Maybe we'll meet some of you on the trail.  <br>
