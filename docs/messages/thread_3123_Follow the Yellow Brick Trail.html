Mother of Five for the fantastic gathering they put on last week in <br/>
Memorial Park.  As always, they had more letterboxes available than we <br/>
had time to find, and we had already been there on Friday to get a <br/>
head start!  Thanks to everyone else who placed boxes for the event, <br/>
also.  Memorial Park is a treasure-trove of letterboxes now.  Of <br/>
course, it was good to see everyone, both regulars and new boxers.  <br/>
The rain even cooperated, waiting unto mid-afternoon to come calling. <br/>
Can't wait to see what they come up with next year. <br/>
