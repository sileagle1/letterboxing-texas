<div><font face="Calibri">For those of you who know we locked our 
electronic keys (both of them) in Whiz Gee's new Corvette on Saturday 
night, we got back into it yesterday just fine.  Huge, huge hugs and 
thanks to Cancan, who drove us to the B&amp;B in Luling Saturday night, 
drove back out to pick us up Sunday morning, waited while the locksmith failed 
to break in to the Corvette, and drove us all the way back to Austin to the 
hospital to visit Lucy Locket and Blue Butterfly.  And more thanks to 
Bloomin' Gramma Jo, who drove us from the hospital the rest of the way to our 
home.  Whiz Gee got up early Monday, and had a key made for the secret 
Corvette keyhole, and we drove back to Palmetto State Park.  We were 
expecting alarm noise when he inserted the key, but the car quietly let us back 
in.  The park staff graciously did not charge us any more fees.  We 
found the last four letterboxes that we couldn't get to before dark on Saturday, 
and are now home safe and sound, with all our cars and belongings.  
Today Whiz Gee will activate OnStar!</font></div>

Eagle and Baby Bear for hosting this great event!  -- Bell
