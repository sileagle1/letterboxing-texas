By the way, TXHipowr was at the Event and he said he knew<br>

I really enjoyed seeing the photos!  Memories of Bastrop State Park <br>
(where Eoghan and I got engaged) came flooding back!  We miss that <br>
place.  It looked like an excellent day to have an event too.  I'm <br>
so happy to "see" that everyone had a great time.  <br>
<br>
I will have Eoghan post a message to enlighten you about what his <br>
name means.  And yes, we knew TXHipower when we lived in Austin.  <br>
He's been very good to us, checking on our boxes/caches, etc.  We <br>
started geocaching back in 2000.  I'm bent out of shape on the sport <br>
now because of the politics - too many rules now.  I'm pushing to be <br>
more active in letterboxing instead.<br>
<br>
Was wondering, if anyone found our boxes in Bastrop/Buescher - Lost <br>
Pines and O Knots - what was the condition of the boxes, etc???  <br>
Would love to know just in case we need to have someone check on <br>
them for us.  Thanks to all of you in Texas!  Take care!<br>
<br>
Ciao,<br>
