This park has recently re-opened after Katrina, but only one main <br/>
trail and one short trail is open for hikes.  <br/>
<br/>
I was lucky enough for find SQUIRE SQUIRREL in good shape.  The box <br/>
was in it's place, although it was exposed.  I also found PEPE LE <br/>
TEXAN.  The landscape has changed a bit due to the storm and <br/>
subsequent clean up, but I found the box laying a few feet away from <br/>
the appointed place.  I wasn't able to look for DEER FRIEND, as that <br/>
part of the park is still not open to visitors.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
