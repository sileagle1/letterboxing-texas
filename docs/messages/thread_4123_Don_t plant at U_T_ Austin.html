I suspected it was something along those lines, but never heard from him.<br/><br/>I only camo the lid of my boxes and not the bottom and sides, so that if they can get a reasonable view of the insides, they might not think it was a threat. On the other hand, if it's nestled into its hidey hole, they can't necessarily SEE the sides or bottoms. <br/>
<br/>Glad to be of help - wish it would have worked out so you could keep it on campus with a permit or something.<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Sat, May 30, 2009 at 12:13 PM, Lore Guilmartin <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:loreguilmartin@yahoo.com">loreguilmartin@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/>

I don't think that many on this list WERE planting boxes at UT Austin, but in case you were tempted, BarefootLucy contacted me this week to say that someone had turned the San Jacinto Hall letterbox in to the university police. <br/>
<br/>I spoke with the UT police department representative, who was a very pleasant and cheerful person, who said that when a letterbox or geocache is found on campus they send out their bomb sniffing dog to make sure it's not a threat! The box or cache is then confiscated until it can be picked up by the owner. And we thought there was drama involved in planting in state parks! Sheesh!<br/>
<br/>So, just to let everyone know, in case you were tempted to plant at UT, it's probably best not to. <br/><br/>Thanks, Lucy, for your help with this!<br/><br/>Lore<br/></td></tr></tbody></table><br/>
