and I missed it.  Regarding postdating clues on AQ...<br/>
I postdated a clue on AQ for the 26th (on the 24th, I think), and it <br/>
showed immediately.  I didn't think it would, so I did some <br/>
research.  It seems that recently Ryan made the change.<br/>
Quote from AQ:<br/>

"-you put the plant date as the date of the gathering.-<br/>
<br/>
I have to admit, I'm getting rather annoyed with how often this <br/>
problem happens. The reason I first allowed post-dating of boxes was <br/>
because of people wanting to plant postals but wanted to list the <br/>
date the tracker started (which was really something totally <br/>
different), but I figured it would save me grief by being bugged <br/>
about it.<br/>
<br/>
Instead, now I get bugged about why boxes aren't showing up that <br/>
are "supposed" to be there (even though they haven't supposedly been <br/>
planted yet). <br/>
<br/>
Oh! Maybe I should just make clues available--even post-dated ones. <br/>
That would solve that problem real fast. *nodding* You know, the more <br/>
I think about, the more I like this idea. If you want to hide your <br/>
clues, don't post them! =)<br/>
<br/>
Ryan, happily making post-dated boxes available -- if you have posted <br/>
clues you don't want available, now's the time to take them off! =)"<br/>

*I would like to get 6 patches.<br/>
