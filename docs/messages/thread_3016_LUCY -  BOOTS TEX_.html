Olbrisch of El Paso, Texas.  I am a volunteer in Franklin Mountain State 
Park.  This park is 37 square miles of desert mountain range and has only 3 
rangers patrolling.  Being retired from the Army and quite capable in the 
outdoors, the rangers appreciate having me patrol the places they cannot get 
to.  Ask them about Mike and Parker, my Great Dane hiking companion.  
We are well known out in the high places.</font></span></div>

budget, I have found some unique and interesting ways to help bring $$$$ into 
the park.  One of those ways is to post the hiking trails on the 
internet.  Please go to <a href="http://www.localhikes.com">www.localhikes.com</a> and find TX - El 
Paso.  I have nearly 50 hikes posted in total, although not all are in the 
Franklins.  I get many requests for more hiking information in the 
franklins from this site.  Perhaps if your parks are not listed, I may be 
able to help you get a local to volunteer to become a hike 
reporter.</font></span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="052140023-15082007">    <font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Something else I did, and the main subject of 
my letter is Letterboxing and Geocaching.  I placed some of the first 
Geocaches in the El Paso area in the Franklin Mountains.  This was done 
with the permission of the rangers long before TPWD had an official 
policy.  I wish I could say it was 100-% perfect.  But we both know 
that there are people who could screw up a hammer.  Still, the overall 
result was a net gain of visitors and $$$$, and only one negative 
incident.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="052140023-15082007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="052140023-15082007">    <font face="Verdana"><font color="#008000" size="2">I started out just Geocaching.  
When I learned of Letterboxing I was immediately interested in it.  I now 
actually enjoy it a bit more than Geocaching.  I quickly learned that the 
average Letterboxer was a little more responsible than the average 
Geocacher.  There are fewer Letterboxers and letterboxes are spread out, 
(we are working on that) so each boxer takes a bit of responsibility for every 
letterbox visited.  We kind of "watch over each other" so to speak.  
Since the letterboxes are less frequently visited, and the average visiting 
letterboxer takes care of a letterbox problem if one is found, there is really 
less trouble here than with the average geocache that is visited frequently and 
deteriorates quickly because only the owner really watches out for it.  I 
could copy you several notes from our Texas forum (or you could subscribe - ??? 
Lucy?) to see for yourself.  When a damaged box is found, it is immediately 
taken care of by the visiting boxer and/or the owner notified and arrangements 
made.  I personally have rebuilt and replaced one letterbox in San Marcos 
TX, and recovered and replaced two in El Paso that were in danger after the July 
2006 floods.  I suppose you did hear about Franklin Mountain State Park and 
the floods?  I was one of the first in, right after the dozer cleared a 
path for my jeep.  Yup - that bad!  They are STILL digging out some 
parts of the park.</font></font></span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="052140023-15082007">    <font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">In any case, I am requesting that you talk to 
and consider working with the appointed (by us) representative of Texas 
Letterboxing to the mutual benefit of both parties.  I assure you sir, we 
are not interested in causing you trouble.  We are friends of the parks and 
friends of nature.  We use the parks.  We vote for the parks when on 
the ballot.  We practice LNT.  We would not wish to hurt or destroy 
that which we most enjoy - our hobby in the outdoors.</font></span></div>

to deal with.  The "check it every quarter" rule is a bit tough when the 
owner isn't from the area.  I handle the majority of it myself in the El 
Paso area.  I am kinda the "GO-TO" guy for Geocaching and 
Letterboxing.  Please don't rat us out, but I have a sort of under the 
table agreement with the 3 rangers.  I watch over the stashes in El Paso 
and interface for them.  So far with the exception of one incident we have 
had nearly 6 years of trouble free fun.  I do not have current data on the 
impact I have had in visitors and $$$$, but I know it is quite positive.  
If you call the rangers I am sure they will back up my 
claim.</font></span></div>

Letterboxing representative.  We are all reasonable folks just looking to 
have fun in the end, just like everyone else.  I feel certain some 
agreement can be worked out.  It has certainly worked in El Paso, and in 
several other states - states that even put out letterboxes and geocaches 
themselves to draw visitors.  I am certain out representative would be 
happy to show you how to get started with that also.</font></span></div>

  Mr. Good,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Good afternoon sir. My name is Mike Olbrisch of El 
  Paso, <br/>Texas. I am a<br/>&gt; volunteer in Franklin Mountain State Park. 
  This park is 37 square <br/>miles of<br/>&gt; desert mountain range and has only 
  3 rangers patrolling. Being <br/>retired from<br/>&gt; the Army and quite 
  capable in the outdoors, the rangers appreciate <br/>having me<br/>&gt; patrol 
  the places they cannot get to. Ask them about Mike and <br/>Parker, my<br/>&gt; 
  Great Dane hiking companion. We are well known out in the high 
  <br/>places.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; photo here - delete this text....<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Mike &amp; Parker on the eastern slope of the Franklins.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Having a bit of an understanding of the TPWD budget, I have 
  <br/>found some<br/>&gt; unique and interesting ways to help bring $$$$ into the 
  park. One <br/>of those<br/>&gt; ways is to post the hiking trails on the 
  internet. Please go to<br/>&gt; www.localhikes.<wbr>com and find TX - El Paso. 
  I have nearly 50 hikes <br/>posted in<br/>&gt; total, although not all are in 
  the Franklins. I get many requests <br/>for more<br/>&gt; hiking information in 
  the franklins from this site. Perhaps if <br/>your parks<br/>&gt; are not 
  listed, I may be able to help you get a local to volunteer <br/>to 
  become<br/>&gt; a hike reporter.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Something else I did, and the 
  main subject of my letter is <br/>Letterboxing<br/>&gt; and Geocaching. I placed 
  some of the first Geocaches in the El <br/>Paso area in<br/>&gt; the Franklin 
  Mountains. This was done with the permission of the <br/>rangers<br/>&gt; long 
  before TPWD had an official policy. I wish I could say it <br/>was 
  100-%<br/>&gt; perfect. But we both know that there are people who could screw 
  <br/>up a<br/>&gt; hammer. Still, the overall result was a net gain of visitors 
  and <br/>$$$$, and<br/>&gt; only one negative incident.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I 
  started out just Geocaching. When I learned of Letterboxing <br/>I was<br/>&gt; 
  immediately interested in it. I now actually enjoy it a bit more 
  <br/>than<br/>&gt; Geocaching. I quickly learned that the average Letterboxer 
  was a <br/>little<br/>&gt; more responsible than the average Geocacher. There 
  are fewer <br/>Letterboxers<br/>&gt; and letterboxes are spread out, (we are 
  working on that) so each <br/>boxer takes<br/>&gt; a bit of responsibility for 
  every letterbox visited. We kind <br/>of "watch over<br/>&gt; each other" so to 
  speak. Since the letterboxes are less <br/>frequently visited,<br/>&gt; and the 
  average visiting letterboxer takes care of a letterbox <br/>problem if<br/>&gt; 
  one is found, there is really less trouble here than with the 
  <br/>average<br/>&gt; geocache that is visited frequently and deteriorates 
  quickly <br/>because only<br/>&gt; the owner really watches out for it. I could 
  copy you several <br/>notes from<br/>&gt; our Texas forum (or you could 
  subscribe - ??? Lucy?) to see for <br/>yourself.<br/>&gt; When a damaged box is 
  found, it is immediately taken care of by <br/>the visiting<br/>&gt; boxer 
  and/or the owner notified and arrangements made. I <br/>personally have<br/>&gt; 
  rebuilt and replaced one letterbox in San Marcos TX, and recovered 
  <br/>and<br/>&gt; replaced two in El Paso that were in danger after the July 
  2006 <br/>floods. I<br/>&gt; suppose you did hear about Franklin Mountain State 
  Park and the <br/>floods? I<br/>&gt; was one of the first in, right after the 
  dozer cleared a path for <br/>my jeep.<br/>&gt; Yup - that bad! They are STILL 
  digging out some parts of the park.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In any case, I am 
  requesting that you talk to and consider <br/>working with<br/>&gt; the 
  appointed (by us) representative of Texas Letterboxing to the 
  <br/>mutual<br/>&gt; benefit of both parties. I assure you sir, we are not 
  interested <br/>in causing<br/>&gt; you trouble. We are friends of the parks and 
  friends of nature. <br/>We use the<br/>&gt; parks. We vote for the parks when on 
  the ballot. We practice <br/>LNT. We<br/>&gt; would not wish to hurt or destroy 
  that which we most enjoy - our <br/>hobby in<br/>&gt; the outdoors.<br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; Some of the current rules are a little tough to deal with. <br/>The 
  "check<br/>&gt; it every quarter" rule is a bit tough when the owner isn't from 
  <br/>the area. I<br/>&gt; handle the majority of it myself in the El Paso area. 
  I am kinda <br/>the<br/>&gt; "GO-TO" guy for Geocaching and Letterboxing. Please 
  don't rat us <br/>out, but I<br/>&gt; have a sort of under the table agreement 
  with the 3 rangers. I <br/>watch over<br/>&gt; the stashes in El Paso and 
  interface for them. So far with the <br/>exception of<br/>&gt; one incident we 
  have had nearly 6 years of trouble free fun. I do <br/>not have<br/>&gt; current 
  data on the impact I have had in visitors and $$$$, but I <br/>know it 
  is<br/>&gt; quite positive. If you call the rangers I am sure they will back 
  <br/>up my<br/>&gt; claim.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I hope you will listen to and 
  hear-out our Letterboxing <br/>representative.<br/>&gt; We are all reasonable 
  folks just looking to have fun in the end, <br/>just like<br/>&gt; everyone 
  else. I feel certain some agreement can be worked out. <br/>It has<br/>&gt; 
  certainly worked in El Paso, and in several other states - states <br/>that 
  even<br/>&gt; put out letterboxes and geocaches themselves to draw visitors. I 
  <br/>am certain<br/>&gt; out representative would be happy to show you how to 
  get started <br/>with that<br/>&gt; also.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If I can be of 
  assistance please do not hesitate to E-mail me.<br/>&gt; 
  mike-2007@..<wbr>.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Thank you sir,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike 
  Olbrisch.<br/>&gt; TPWD Volunteer.<br/>&gt; El Paso, Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; That sounds great to me. Mr. Good already told me that he 
  thought <br/>I <br/>&gt; was misinformed on the quarterly review, that he 
  understood how <br/>that <br/>&gt; could be a problem, and that the point would 
  be considered. Let's <br/>&gt; get something going and see what happens.
