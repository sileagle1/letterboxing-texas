                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had been planning a camping/letterbox trip ever since the kids got out of school for Christmas break, but something kept getting in the way.  Finally, this last weekend looked like a go, but then I got a call about an old co-worker passing away, and the viewing was going to be in Bryan on Saturday.  Then the kids decided they really didn't want to camp in the cold, so I decided to combine grief with pleasure and go by myself.<br/>
<br/>
I had to start early Saturday since the viewing was at 2:00 and I wanted to hike the Lone Star Trail before going.  The plan was to find Lone Star Surprise letterbox and move it up the trail as far as I could, and also place a box.  The weather was great and I made good time on the trail, moving the box a little over 5 miles and placing my Dice Poker Game box.  This game uses actual dice that I had to create without using images, since LBNA does not allow them, and it took me several weeks to program so I hope you enjoy it.  Then, because I did not have another person to shuttle the car, I had to backtrack all those 5 miles back to my car before heading to Bryan.  Hopefully my box will give you incentive to move the Lone Star Surprise further up the trail, but if you do, be aware that the trail crosses a creek a little beyond where the box is now and it is not obvious since another trail continues straight.<br/>
<br/>
I made it to the funeral home a little after 2:00 and quickly changed into nice clothes.  Thank goodness for tinted windows on the SUV!  After paying my respects, I placed a box in a local park and headed to Lake Somerville as the sun was setting.  I did not feel like letterboxing, especially at night, so I just enjoyed the peace and quiet while viewing the many stars visible.  I had the whole camping area virtually to myself.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning was gloomy with light rain, but I got going and found most of the letterboxes I looked for.  Many of them were from the Event back in 2007 and I was glad to finally make it back for them.  I also replaced the log and container for my Flowers For Algernon box, so it is ready for more visitors.  Then it was time to place another box, so I decided to make it another TX Treasure hike.  I made it 4 miles RT so most everyone can do it.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to Brenham, Burton and Round Top, then Oak Thicket Park near Fayetteville.  I had planned to go on to Buescher SP, but the weather was getting worse and it was getting late, so I headed home.  I ended up placing 5 boxes and finding only 11, but the long hikes were worth getting fewer boxes.  It was a fun start to a New Year and I highly recommend it!<br/>

<p><span>Thanks for hiding boxes on longer hikes!  Although we have
no near-term plans to visit Texas, we choose our vacation destinations based on
where there are some good hikes with letterboxes.  We just got back from
Arizona where we enjoyed finding 4  older boxes on a great 9-mile loop in
the Superstition Wilderness,  6 newer boxes on a 12+ mile loop in another
park, and a 6-7 mile hike in a canyon to find an interesting 11-box
series.  Our favorite day is to park the car once and hike all day finding
boxes!<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It sounds like you've been racking up some serious Texas Treasure Hiking points already.  I'm sorry we weren't home Saturday when you were hiking the LST (we had been in the Hill Country and were on our way home) because we would have been glad to shuttle you back to your car.  If anyone else wants to move that box on down the trail (or hike any other part of the trail), check with us beforehand and, if we can, we'll pick you up.  Maybe you could meet at our place and we could follow you to the end point where you can leave your car and we could drop you off at the starting point.  When we moved the box, we dropped a car off at the end and set that spot as a waypoint on our gps so we could follow our progress.  It was a lot of fun.  Some areas along that trail are pretty wild and the trail isn't always maintained, plus there are creeks and wetlands to navigate, but that's part of the fun. Thanks for the new box, you don't see many new ones on the Lone Star Trail anymore. I would also like to commend you on your game boxes, Silver Eagle.  I envy your programming skills, which are amazing to me.  Good job.  <br/>

<p>I had been planning a camping/letterbox trip ever since the
kids got out of school for Christmas break, but something kept getting in the
way. Finally, this last weekend looked like a go, but then I got a call about
an old co-worker passing away, and the viewing was going to be in Bryan on
Saturday. Then the kids decided they really didn't want to camp in the cold, so
I decided to combine grief with pleasure and go by myself.<br/>
<br/>
I had to start early Saturday since the viewing was at 2:00 and I wanted to
hike the Lone Star Trail before going. The plan was to find Lone Star Surprise
letterbox and move it up the trail as far as I could, and also place a box. The
weather was great and I made good time on the trail, moving the box a little
over 5 miles and placing my Dice Poker Game box. This game uses actual dice
that I had to create without using images, since LBNA does not allow them, and
it took me several weeks to program so I hope you enjoy it. Then, because I did
not have another person to shuttle the car, I had to backtrack all those 5
miles back to my car before heading to Bryan. Hopefully my box will give you
incentive to move the Lone Star Surprise further up the trail, but if you do,
be aware that the trail crosses a creek a little beyond where the box is now
and it is not obvious since another trail continues straight.<br/>
<br/>
I made it to the funeral home a little after 2:00 and quickly changed into nice
clothes. Thank goodness for tinted windows on the SUV! After paying my
respects, I placed a box in a local park and headed to Lake Somerville as the
sun was setting. I did not feel like letterboxing, especially at night, so I
just enjoyed the peace and quiet while viewing the many stars visible. I had
the whole camping area virtually to myself.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning was gloomy with light rain, but I got going and found most of
the letterboxes I looked for. Many of them were from the Event back in 2007 and
I was glad to finally make it back for them. I also replaced the log and
container for my Flowers For Algernon box, so it is ready for more visitors.
Then it was time to place another box, so I decided to make it another TX
Treasure hike. I made it 4 miles RT so most everyone can do it.<br/>
<br/>
Then it was on to Brenham, Burton and Round Top, then Oak Thicket Park near
Fayetteville. I had planned to go on to Buescher SP, but the weather was
getting worse and it was getting late, so I headed home. I ended up placing 5
boxes and finding only 11, but the long hikes were worth getting fewer boxes.
It was a fun start to a New Year and I highly recommend it!<br/>

   It sounds like you are well on your way to the first Texas Treasure <br/>
Hiking milestone - 25 miles.  From what I gather of your weekend just <br/>
about all the hiking miles counted towards TTH.  Sounds like a great <br/>
start for the new year.<br/>
