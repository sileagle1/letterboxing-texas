thank BL for handling this situation the best way I know of.  I was <br/>
gone most of the day, so BL had to deal with this on her own, and I <br/>
think she did fine.  <br/>
<br/>
Just to let ya'll know, being the owner/moderator for a List can <br/>
sometimes be a trying experience.  You have to occasionally make <br/>
judgment calls about when a person is "crossing the line" and then <br/>
decide how to handle it.  In this case, BL was sent many emails from <br/>
some of ya'll complaining about Kirbert and his style of discourse.  <br/>
(BTW, it would be better if you sent complaints to the Owners group <br/>
that she posted instead of just to her)  He was put on Moderation for <br/>
a while so we could monitor his posts, but then it got worse <br/>
yesterday.  She sent him a private email that was very well written <br/>
and tactful explaining why some of his posts were rubbing people the <br/>
wrong way and gave suggestions for how to make them better.  She did <br/>
not tell him to stop posting or to no longer disagree with people, <br/>
she just suggested doing it in a more positive manner.  When this did <br/>
not work and he kept posting the same way, she publicly reprimanded <br/>
him so all of you could see that his posts were not acceptable.  If I <br/>
had been here I would have been the one to post the public message.  <br/>
The next step would have probably been a final private warning to <br/>
improve his posts or be kicked off our List, but he unsubscribed on <br/>
his own.  Though this may make many people happy or relieved, it <br/>
makes me sad.  I must admit it makes things easier from a Moderator <br/>
point of view, but it also means I failed to keep a member on this <br/>
List who quite often contributed good discussion.  <br/>
<br/>
Just to let ya'll know, I view this List as a family, but just <br/>
because BL and I are the Moderator/Owners, I don't feel like we are <br/>
your parents.  I don't want you to feel like you always have to agree <br/>
with everything people say or to feel scared to express a contrary <br/>
opinion.  I just want you to do it in a manner that would be <br/>
acceptable to you from another person.  Also, if you don't like the <br/>
tone of someone's post, try writing them privately first before <br/>
responding publicly or complaining to BL and me.  Explain how you <br/>
interpreted their message and try to resolve it.  If that fails, then <br/>
we will deal with it.  Overall, I prefer to be less restrictive on <br/>
what people post since I don't want to suppress free speech, but if <br/>
many people are upset then I will act.<br/>
<br/>
Now, hopefully we can get back to good discussions.  I think many of <br/>
our recent ones have been interesting and timely.  Thanks for being <br/>
such a great group!<br/>

&gt; In my opinion there is no need for an apology, and I want to <br/>
publicly <br/>
&gt; thank BL for handling this situation the best way I know of.  I was <br/>
&gt; gone most of the day, so BL had to deal with this on her own, and I <br/>
&gt; think she did fine.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just to let ya'll know, being the owner/moderator for a List can <br/>
&gt; sometimes be a trying experience.  You have to occasionally make <br/>
&gt; judgment calls about when a person is "crossing the line" and then <br/>
&gt; decide how to handle it.  In this case, BL was sent many emails <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; some of ya'll complaining about Kirbert and his style of <br/>
discourse.  <br/>
&gt; (BTW, it would be better if you sent complaints to the Owners group <br/>
&gt; that she posted instead of just to her)  He was put on Moderation <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; a while so we could monitor his posts, but then it got worse <br/>
&gt; yesterday.  She sent him a private email that was very well written <br/>
&gt; and tactful explaining why some of his posts were rubbing people <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; wrong way and gave suggestions for how to make them better.  She <br/>
did <br/>
&gt; not tell him to stop posting or to no longer disagree with people, <br/>
&gt; she just suggested doing it in a more positive manner.  When this <br/>
did <br/>
&gt; not work and he kept posting the same way, she publicly reprimanded <br/>
&gt; him so all of you could see that his posts were not acceptable.  If <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; had been here I would have been the one to post the public <br/>
message.  <br/>
&gt; The next step would have probably been a final private warning to <br/>
&gt; improve his posts or be kicked off our List, but he unsubscribed on <br/>
&gt; his own.  Though this may make many people happy or relieved, it <br/>
&gt; makes me sad.  I must admit it makes things easier from a Moderator <br/>
&gt; point of view, but it also means I failed to keep a member on this <br/>
&gt; List who quite often contributed good discussion.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Just to let ya'll know, I view this List as a family, but just <br/>
&gt; because BL and I are the Moderator/Owners, I don't feel like we are <br/>
&gt; your parents.  I don't want you to feel like you always have to <br/>
agree <br/>
&gt; with everything people say or to feel scared to express a contrary <br/>
&gt; opinion.  I just want you to do it in a manner that would be <br/>
&gt; acceptable to you from another person.  Also, if you don't like the <br/>
&gt; tone of someone's post, try writing them privately first before <br/>
&gt; responding publicly or complaining to BL and me.  Explain how you <br/>
&gt; interpreted their message and try to resolve it.  If that fails, <br/>
then <br/>
&gt; we will deal with it.  Overall, I prefer to be less restrictive on <br/>
&gt; what people post since I don't want to suppress free speech, but if <br/>
&gt; many people are upset then I will act.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now, hopefully we can get back to good discussions.  I think many <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; our recent ones have been interesting and timely.  Thanks for being <br/>
&gt; such a great group!<br/>

I'll read a thread till something like that <br/>comes <br/>&gt; up, then I'll ignore the rest of the thread.

 biting my tongue, plus it hurts :) .<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; But, one good thing came out of it. I now know that if I feel <br/>&gt; someone is out of line, 1. I'm usually not the only one thinking it <br/>&gt; and 2. I can write to the mods and tell them how I feel and they <br/>can <br/>&gt; take it from there.

Hey, <br/>&gt; are you coming to DFW for one or both of the mini meets? It would <br/>be <br/>&gt; great to meet you and Cold Front.

 a <br/>&gt; &gt; major announcement.

I never once <br/>participated <br/>&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; any conversation that he was part of, because I could never show <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; restraint that some of you show. I'm not gonna go back and dig up <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; thread but if somebody told him off, I owe them a beer!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Warm Front<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "Silver Eagle" <br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;sileagle@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion there is
 no need for an apology, and I want to <br/>&gt; &gt; publicly <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thank BL for handling this situation the best way I know of. I <br/>&gt; was <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; gone most of the day, so BL had to deal with this on her own, <br/>and <br/>&gt; I <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; think she did fine. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to let ya'll know, being the owner/moderator for a List <br/>can <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes be a trying experience. You have to occasionally make <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; judgment calls about when a person is "crossing the line" and <br/>&gt; then <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; decide how to handle it. In this case, BL was sent many emails <br/>&gt; &gt; from <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; some of ya'll complaining about Kirbert and his style of <br/>&gt; &gt; discourse. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; (BTW, it would be better if you sent complaints to the Owners <br/>&gt; group <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that she posted instead of just to her) He was put on <br/>Moderation <br/>&gt; &gt; for
 <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a while so we could monitor his posts, but then it got worse <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; yesterday. She sent him a private email that was very well <br/>&gt; written <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and tactful explaining why some of his posts were rubbing <br/>people <br/>&gt; &gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrong way and gave suggestions for how to make them better. She <br/>&gt; &gt; did <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not tell him to stop posting or to no longer disagree with <br/>&gt; people, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; she just suggested doing it in a more positive manner. When <br/>this <br/>&gt; &gt; did <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not work and he kept posting the same way, she publicly <br/>&gt; reprimanded <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; him so all of you could see that his posts were not acceptable. <br/>&gt; If <br/>&gt; &gt; I <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had been here I would have been the one to post the public <br/>&gt; &gt; message. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; The next step would have probably been a final private warning <br/>to
 <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; improve his posts or be kicked off our List, but he <br/>unsubscribed <br/>&gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; his own. Though this may make many people happy or relieved, it <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; makes me sad. I must admit it makes things easier from a <br/>&gt; Moderator <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; point of view, but it also means I failed to keep a member on <br/>&gt; this <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; List who quite often contributed good discussion. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just to let ya'll know, I view this List as a family, but just <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because BL and I are the Moderator/Owners, I don't feel like we <br/>&gt; are <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; your parents. I don't want you to feel like you always have to <br/>&gt; &gt; agree <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with everything people say or to feel scared to express a <br/>&gt; contrary <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; opinion. I just want you to do it in a manner that would be <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; acceptable to you from another person. Also, if you
 don't like <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tone of someone's post, try writing them privately first before <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; responding publicly or complaining to BL and me. Explain how <br/>you <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; interpreted their message and try to resolve it. If that fails, <br/>&gt; &gt; then <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; we will deal with it. Overall, I prefer to be less restrictive <br/>on <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what people post since I don't want to suppress free speech, <br/>but <br/>&gt; if <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; many people are upset then I will act.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, hopefully we can get back to good discussions. I think <br/>many <br/>&gt; &gt; of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; our recent ones have been interesting and timely.
