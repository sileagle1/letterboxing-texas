we proved them right! <br/>
<br/>
Stillwater, Vandal and I have been longing to go check out TX2Chic's boxes<br/>
in the Keller area - and each time Viewfinder planted a new one, it became<br/>
harder to resist!<br/>
So of course we picked a day when it was over 100 degrees, and waited until<br/>
noon to start...;-)<br/>
We've never looked around Keller - beautiful city and the box locations were<br/>
delightful. Clues were perfect, stamps &amp; logbooks were very cute, and we had<br/>
a wonderful time....despite feeling as though we were trudging thru a sauna!<br/>
<br/>
One funny note - in one of the logbooks I spotted a really neat stamp I'd<br/>
never seen before - and pointed it out to Stillwater. It reminded me a bit<br/>
of TeamKing's clever stamp. When I returned home I had an email from that<br/>
out-of-town boxer who had also located a couple of our CelticLions boxes.<br/>
<br/>
It was especially exciting to hunt Tx2chic's boxes, because I can remember<br/>
back when I first found their stamp in one of our boxes &amp; I'm always HOPING<br/>
that people who hunt our boxes will turn around and plant some for us to<br/>
hunt...well, they certainly did!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for a wonderful day!<br/>
