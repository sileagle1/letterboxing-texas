<div>I'm not able to do anything on the 26th myself and Blue Butterfly has ruled that date out as well, but if that's a better date for everyone else, it can be done then.   JBK had said she couldn't do it on the 19th because you and she already have something planned, so based on the ones who I know have an interest, the 12th looked like the day.  We can put it off a month, but if it gets too hot too early, I won't be there (I'm not much of a summer boxer!).  Lucy Locket's the other one who has consistently been interested in doing this, and her May schedule is pretty chaotic according to Blue Butterfly, which kind of supports putting it off til June.

&gt; You're right, Plant-a-Box-Day is a national initiative, and that <br/>
was one of the reasons I wanted to get a date before May 24th - so <br/>
if we had folks who wanted to participate in the NE Texas thing and <br/>
weren't going to be able to do Plant a Box, they could hold their <br/>
clues until the 24th.<br/>

&gt; The rest of April is completely out for me and I'm not able to do <br/>
anything on May 26th myself and Blue Butterfly has ruled that date <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We've talked a couple of times about having a planting day in <br/>
&gt; Northeast<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Texas. Well let's quit talking and DO IT!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This is open for discussion, but here's how I see the format: <br/>
&gt; Let's set a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; broad area to plant boxes in (Say, East of Dallas and North of <br/>
I-<br/>
&gt; 20) and set<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the day to go plant a few and find a few, then meet up in a <br/>
&gt; central location<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; might be a good idea for folks to RSVP with where they are <br/>
&gt; thinking to place<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes, which of course doesn't mean you can't plant wherever <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; want to, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just might help some folks decide where they will plant.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Here's the date that Blue Butterfly and JB Kokopelli and I <br/>
like -<br/>
&gt; May<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 12th. How does that sound to other folks?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We might also include our Northwest Louisiana friends in this, <br/>
&gt; since there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is now a very small number of them and they would probably <br/>
like <br/>
&gt; to see more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes in that area, or may want to do a similar initiative to <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Once we have a few details sort of ironed out, I'll post it to <br/>

If you end up taking 360 North from 20 or 30, make sure you stop and get Tombs and Tees (I think that's what it's called) It's either Viewfinder's or PuddleSplasher's box. It's in a very quaint cemetery (can a cemetery be quaint? Sure it can.) There's even an area where you can sit and eat if that doesn't bother you. Anyways, it's a great setting and the stamp is cute. I ended up spending over an hour there, but my DD#2 loves to look at 'all' the graves and imagine who, what, where. There is a box under a bench that has notes and stuff for the young man (late teens) buried there. Lots of baby graves (how sad). We had to go out there a second time to get a Halloween stamp and DD#2 had to look at the box again to see what had been added. It reminded me of a letterbox of a different type.</div> <div> </div> <div>Happy Hunting,</div>

                    <html><body><div>I've gone ahead and set up a date for the Planting Day in the far northeast, and I stayed with May 12th.  HOWEVER, let's just say that if anyone plants a box in one of the counties listed on the event page between now and May 31st, I'll send them an imprint of the event stamp.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you want to plant on May 12th, RSVP on the event page.  Once we have an RSVP list, we'll decide where we'll meet up at the end of the day that day.  Also, email me with your box and likely location for it.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you can't plant with us on that day but you have a box you want to plant at another time, email me with the what and where you will be planting, and I'll post that on the event page so others can see how the seeding effort is coming along.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Needless to say, if you don't care to share the details of your box, that's fine, or if you want to share it with me but don't want it publicized, that's cool too.  And if you put down for one box in one place and get inspired to do something else somewhere else, don't worry about it.  The posted list will be GUIDELINES ONLY, not a hard commitment for you!
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Okay.  Hopefully this made good sense.  I just took something for a headache.  If it didn't make sense, I'll bet y'all can figure out what I meant.  You are, after all, letterboxers!  (Just kidding - email me a HUH? and I'll answer in the morning!)
