<div>Thanks for the replies about permitting at Brazos Bend SP.  I suppose 
I was just wondering if the park was expecting us as a group of letterboxers, 
and expecting us to ask for permits.  I will follow my own 
conscience!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since I mentioned that my Mom’s cancer had returned, I wanted to let 
everyone know that all traces of her cancer disappeared with one round of 
chemotherapy!  Yay!  The MDs made her continue with five more rounds 
of chemo, but she has had almost no side effects from the chemo – no nausea, no 
hair loss.  She is doing quite well.  Thanks for your 
well-wishes.</div>
