planning the Waxahachie Barn-Raising, ( as well as her Scouting and<br>
"Otherlife" stuff!), I've asked her to let me take over on the Texas<br>
Letterboxing Patches.<br>
<br>
Since people and their needs and wants change, I'm just going to start<br>
afresh with orders for patches. I plan to order 100 2 inch patches in the<br>
shape of our orange & green Texas Letterboxing logo. It is shown on the HOME<br>
page of this group - the orange background would be twill fabric with<br>
embroidery only for the lettering & compass point and green edging. The<br>
patches will probably cost about $1.50 - $1.75 each, if we get iron-on or<br>
peel&stick backing. (This compares VERY well with the official LbNA patches<br>
which cost $2.15 each, and shipping is additional) <br>
<br>
I have requests for quotes in to two companies, and I'm checking with a<br>
third local company. <br>
<br>
If you would like to order patches, please write to me offlist at:<br>
celticlions@comcast.net<br>
<br>
and include:<br>
1. Trailname<br>
2. Real name!<br>
3. Shipping address<br>
4. Number of patches<br>
<br>
I'll be glad to mail these out or bring them to Waxahachie.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
