                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got an email saying that my "Memphis In May" microbox is alive & well, though a little damp, after being submerged under the Mighty Mississippi for several days.  It is a film canister that was attached to a bush in a park pretty far above the river, so I was surprised that it got flooded in the first place, but amazed it survived.  This restores my belief that film canisters can remain relatively dry if resealed correctly, but unfortunately that doesn't always happen.  So nice to get an email about a survivor instead of MIA!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That really is amazing.  I wouldn't have believed it could survive being submerged.  The cap really needs to be "snapped" back in place and obviously the last finder sealed it well.  That's great!<br>
