<br/>
 We stopped by Hunstville State Park this past weekend while
camping in Cagle.  It was $8 to get in and the place was packed
solid.   Is it just this time of year that makes it
packed?   We had a couple of boxes to plant there byut
decided against it as it seemed a little high to get in.<br/>
<br/>
 My boys camped at Livingston at the beginning of the year and it was not near as crazy.<br/>
<br/>
More disappointing was not being able to get the box we went there
for.  We also werent able to find the other box in Huntsville that
was at the Sam Houston Museuem but was so glad we were able to tour the
grounds.  There were some great houses to look at there.  <br/>
<br/>
Cagle was great and both boxes that were there are nice and safe! 
This weather makes me want to spend all day lb and not doing anything
else!!!<br/>

                    <html><body><div>I haven't been to Huntsville in ages, but I'm guessing that one big difference is the time of year.  Only the hardcore camp and visit state parks in winter months, but once it starts brightening up, lots of folks pour out!  And the only time worse than spring is summer - crowdwise...

<div>The cost to get in can add up and I can imagine it was frustrating to pay the fee and then not be able to do what you went to do!  We usually get the Texas Passport, which is $60 for one card and $75 for two.  The main benefit is that everyone in the car enters the park for free (you know, the daily per person fee?).  We decided this year that it probably wasn't worth it to us to renew, until we started having to pay those fees again.  For about six weeks straight, I and some combination of folks were in state parks together, so that we could've save the entire amount in less than two months...I'm a believer again in that Passport!
