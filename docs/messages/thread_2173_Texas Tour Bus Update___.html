                    <html><body><div>We interrupt your regularly scheduled surfing for a very important announcement...</div> <div> </div> <div>The Texas Tour Bus is departing Bedford today at 11am CST: All Aboard Who's Going Aboard!</div> <div> </div> <div>The Texas Tour Bus is heading out today. We're heading to Dallas, then we will see where we end up after that.</div> <div> </div> <div>I carved a stamp of Selena. It's an outline drawing I found on the internet. I used the white material that is supposed to 'cut like butter'. It's positively awful. I wish I had waited a week before I ordered it. I'm definitely going to order from stampeaz next time. It's so dissapointing to pay the money and the shipping (which I am against) and then to get such awful product. But, as with everything in life, I learn from my mistakes. I am going to see if I can carve a replacement as soon as I can order some much better material. Maybe it wasn't the material, maybe it's me. But, I've carved other
 stamps that had much better curves. I don't think I want a material to cut like butter, I don't have a steady enough hand for it (too much Starbuck's, hee hee).</div> <div> </div> <div>Enough about that, on to the fun. A great lady of this state (and nation) was going to ride the bus, but she had to back out. Something about being an honorary pallbearer and such (okay, she was just too hard to carve, but she'd be a great person for someone else. Hint, hint). So, Selena who I'm sure everyone has heard of, decided to join the group on the tour bus. She's excited about learning some techniques from the great musicians on the bus. And, she's looking forward to discussing great topics from the legendary figures of the Great State of Texas.</div> <div> </div> <div>Tonight, probably right after 7pm CST (that's when I get to work) I will post the new location of the Texas Tour Bus. Please tune in and let's see who the next lucky recipient will be.</div>
<div> </div> <div>Back to your regularly scheduled surfing.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Bedford</div><p>
