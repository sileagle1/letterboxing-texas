It's hit or miss with us too, depending on schedules, who's feeling <br/>
up to it and what's going on.  Right now is hugely busy, but my <br/>
littlest one and I sometimes have time during the week.  He really <br/>
likes to find and hide, so we have good "mommy and Graham" time.<br/>
<br/>
Will be taking a huge break probably closer to fall when I chair the <br/>
auction for my older son's school again.  <br/>
<br/>
So it's all in the timing!<br/>
