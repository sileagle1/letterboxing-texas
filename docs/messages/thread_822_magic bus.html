It's hit or miss with us too, depending on schedules, who's feeling <br>
up to it and what's going on.  Right now is hugely busy, but my <br>
littlest one and I sometimes have time during the week.  He really <br>
likes to find and hide, so we have good "mommy and Graham" time.<br>
<br>
Will be taking a huge break probably closer to fall when I chair the <br>
auction for my older son's school again.  <br>
<br>
So it's all in the timing!<br>
