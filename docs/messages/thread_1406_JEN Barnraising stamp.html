<div>I've heard that timing is everything right? I got home last night from the JEN Barnraising, and there was a package in my mailbox from a very nice letterboxer in Connecticut that I had exchanged stamps with a few weeks ago. She had sent a letterbox for our JEN with a great stamp and log book, etc. The enclosed note said, "Puddle Splasher, Hope you don't mind if I crash your party by adding a box... would you or someone else nearby be willing to be 'caretaker' please? Have fun! Sojourner". How nice! Unfortunately, it didn't arrive in time for the event. If those of you that were at the barnraising yesterday would send me your address, I can put together a list to enclose with the LB and will then mail it to the first person, and they can send it to the next and so on until all those who want to stamp in have. Then we can plant it and post the clues on the LBNA.</div>
<div>By the way, I had so much fun yesterday at the event. It was so great meeting everyone! ..... and no, I haven't solved "those clues" yet!</div>
