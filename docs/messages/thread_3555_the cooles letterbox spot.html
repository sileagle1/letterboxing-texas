<div>What a great 
topic!  I have seen so many amazing spots because of letterboxing, it is 
impossible to choose just one.  Some of my very favorites have included the 
bridge in Waco, the most astounding view from the 360 bridge in Austin, the Sea 
Center Texas (this has become one of my kids all time favorite places), the 
giant president heads in Houston (I almost crashed my car when I rounded the 
corner and saw a 50 foot tall bust of George Bush, I just wasn't quite prepared 
I guess.)  I guess if I had to choose just one it would be Stonehenge 2 
near Kerrville...the most astounding thing I have ever seen.  This box 
really gives meaning to the phrase "only in Texas"!

Okay, I just moved Houston giant president heads to the top of the <br/>
list. Gotta see that bust!  Then hope to solve that mystery series.<br/>
The sight with most impact for me was Explosion in New London. Seeing <br/>
all those names on that monument, by class, really was sobering. <br/>
Never would have know about that without l'boxing. <br/>
Plus discovering some crazy vintners along the way!<br/>
