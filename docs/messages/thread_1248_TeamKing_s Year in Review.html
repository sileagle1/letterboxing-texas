                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last August, I read the Time magazine article describing this  <br>
interesting pastime called 'letterboxing'. It sounded intriguing. So,  <br>
I checked out the LBNA site and found that were boxes right here in  <br>
Houston! Alright! Off I went. My first box was Baby Bear's 'Park  <br>
Angel' in Telge Park. I was excited when I found it. Didn't really  <br>
know WHAT I was looking for and since the box was a micro, I was  <br>
surprised how tiny. Onward I went through the heat of August &  <br>
September getting boxes mostly by Hawk, Baby Bear, Silver Eagle, and  <br>
Tiger. Who WERE these people? Some I chatted with online. Others  <br>
didn't say too much. I never met any of them until Thanksgiving. By  <br>
then we finally ventured out of Houston and headed up to Dallas for  <br>
the weekend. I finally met my first real letterboxers - the Celtic  <br>
Lions. We hit our 100th box that weekend too - Celtic Lions' Shawnee  <br>
Trail box. Wee. 100 boxes! We finally felt like real boxers.<br>
<br>
Little by little, more names and people started to appear. By March,  <br>
we were excited to be going to our first Texas gathering. A chance to  <br>
finally put some faces to the names. We had a great time that day.  <br>
Thanks to everyone who came out, and those who contributed boxes. And  <br>
who could ever forget meeting Wanda from R.I.?!<br>
<br>
Since then, I have continued this 'hobby' with varying degrees of  <br>
interest - have often been first finder on the Houston boxes for a  <br>
while but have laid low recently. Planted boxes in Texas, Ohio,  <br>
Pennsylvania, England, and France. Spent 2 days in Dartmoor in July -  <br>
what a fabulous experience THAT was! And have continued my  <br>
involvement in postal letterboxing which I really enjoy.<br>
<br>
I am really surprised at the amount of new people that have come in  <br>
this year. So many new boxes right here in Houston. Great thanks to  <br>
all of you for continuing to plant them for the rest of us. (Go  <br>
Gramatrick!) Also, around the rest of state. Areas that were hardly  <br>
mentioned a year ago seem to have grown in leaps and bounds. How  <br>
could you not enjoy traveling across Texas with the assortment of  <br>
boxes we now have available?!<br>
<br>
Thanks for making letterboxing such a fun time for our whole family.  <br>
We love getting out and exploring, and finding all the neat little  <br>
parks, trails, and places we had never noticed before. We are  <br>
currently just over 500 finds and still going strong - one year later.<br>

letterboxing.  It's hard to believe y'all have only<br>
been with us for a year - it seems like a lifetime!<br>
<br>
Congratulations on all you've accomplished and here's<br>
to many great years of letterboxing yet to come!<br>
