I ran out of my supply of PZ Kut recently, except for scraps, so I decided to give the Pink Stuff another try and I find that I really like it!  It's a little softer than PZ Kut, but I carved one of my detailed portrait stamps on it and it seems to work fine, so I guess I just didn't give it a chance at first.  If you buy it at Michaels, be sure to print out a 40% OFF coupon.  I found one easily online.  The coupon makes it cheaper than the Stampeaz price for the same thing and you don't have to pay the shipping.  The 6" x 12" sheet, with coupon and tax, is about $11.00 and you can get 18 2" x 2" stamps out of it.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've always been a fan of the pink stuff. It has held up forever for my signature stamp so I know it's durable. Never tried the white PZ cut but tried the orange and didn't like it, it did not take a pencil transfer well and that was mostly what I was doing. I felt like it didn't hold the ink well either but I probably should have tried sanding it. In any case, I just tried the new stuff from Stampeaz and really am hooked on it now because it takes a lovely iron on transfer. Finally I can get good detail. It's very firm though. I'll probably use the new stuff for detailed images I want to transfer with an iron and use the pink stuff for pencil transfers.<br/>

My first Signature stamp was out of Master Carve and I didn't really like it. Now I use the Pink Stuff. I've never used anything else.<br/>
