<p><strong>Tourism Department Adopts Geocaching Hobby - </strong>The Arkansas Department of Parks and Tourism has adopted geocaching as a way to encourage travelers to explore the state this year. Cache in With the Natural State provides the coordinates to a different cache each month. Trade items in the caches may include tourism incentives such as certificates for lodging or restaurants. Geocaching is an international hobby in which caches are hidden by individuals or groups. The location of each geocache is identified by global positioning system coordinates that are shared via the Internet. Hobbyist use hand-held GPS units to hunt for the caches.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I talked (by email) to the "Special Assistant to the Director" at <br>
Texas Parks and Wildlife concerning letterboxing in state parks.  I <br>
got an email from him exactly two weeks ago and he said they were <br>
checking to see if letterboxing would fit into their <br>
existing "activity guidelines" and that he would get back to <br>
me "within the week".  I've considered contacting him again, but <br>
don't want to sound too pushy.  I'll give him a few more days, then <br>
I'll nudge him a little bit just to let him know we're still <br>
interested.  I told him that we'd like to meet with someone to <br>
explain letterboxing, but he didn't make an offer to meet, at least <br>
not yet.  I'll keep you informed of any progress.<br>

<br>
Hi Charles,<br>
<br>
We are in the process of reviewing and updating most of our <br>
operational policies for State Parks.  I am confident that our <br>
present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br>
letterboxing as the activities have similarities.  I believe the <br>
policy update will be completed by September 1.<br>
<br>
Thanks for checking,<br>
<br>
Kevin Good<br>
<br>
I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied to <br>
him:<br>
<br>
Dear Mr. Good,<br>
 <br>
I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits.  The <br>
policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br>
maintained quarterly.  If a family from Houston, for instance, <br>
visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br>
wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br>
which would violate the policy.  I respecfully ask that you consider <br>
this point.  Thank you.<br>
<br>
I'll keep you posted.<br>

<div><font size="2">Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they will consider your request. I certainly understand why they are protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit of bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought me to numerous state parks which I would never have visited otherwise. After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more to support the growth and maintenance of the park system. That can't be a bad thing for the TPW!</font></div>

<p>I contacted Mr. Good at TPW again and received the following reply:<br/><br/>Hi Charles,<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing and updating most of our <br/>operational policies for State Parks. I am confident that our <br/>present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br/>letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the <br/>policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/><br/>Thanks for checking,<br/><br/>Kevin Good<br/><br/>I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied to <br/>him:<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Good,<br/><br/>I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. The <br/>policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>maintained quarterly. If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br/>which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you consider <br/>this point.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm trying to proceed cautiously.  They seem to be willing to <br>
listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching.  Not <br>
that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br>
to see letterboxing as more of a family activity.  Their policy on <br>
geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br>
and wait for it to be approved.  You then have to meet with the park <br>
staff and get approval for the location of the box.  Then, you have <br>
to come back every 3 months to check on the box.  The permit has to <br>
be renewed anually.  I just don't think that would work for most of <br>
us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br>
boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br>
scenario.  I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br>
demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br>
to do that.  I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br>
think they are "getting it" just yet.  If anyone has any ideas, I'd <br>
like to hear them. <br>

consider your request. I certainly understand why they are <br>
protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit of <br>
bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't <br>
really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought me <br>
to numerous state parks which I would never have visited otherwise. <br>
After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride <br>
and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more <br>
to support the growth and maintenance of the park system. That can't <br>
be a bad thing for the TPW!<br>

<p>I'm trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the park <br/>staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>to do that.

Mr. Good:<br>
<br>
"I think you may have been misinformed.  The permits for a geocache <br>
must be renewed annually, rather than quarterly.  However, I <br>
understand your concern and will take that into consideration."<br>
<br>
I replied to him with my thanks for his patience and copied the link <br>
to the Connecticut forest site.  I told him that Connecticut has <br>
more letterboxes than any other state, 1881, but that Texas was <br>
rapidly catching up with 1619 (per LbNA) and that we were seeking <br>
official sanction for letterboxing in state parks and we thought <br>
that it would promote visitation to Texas state parks.  We'll see <br>
what he says.<br>

<p>I contacted Mr. Good at TPW again and received the following 
  reply:<br/><br/>Hi Charles,<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing and 
  updating most of our <br/>operational policies for State Parks. I am confident 
  that our <br/>present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover 
  <br/>letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the <br/>policy 
  update will be completed by September 1.<br/><br/>Thanks for 
  checking,<br/><br/>Kevin Good<br/><br/>I'm not sure this is the answer I was 
  looking for, so I replied to <br/>him:<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Good,<br/><br/>I am hoping 
  letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. The <br/>policy for 
  geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>maintained quarterly. If 
  a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>visited Davis Mountain State Park and 
  placed a letterbox, they <br/>wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months 
  to check on it, <br/>which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you 
  consider <br/>this point. Thank you.<br/><br/>I'll keep you posted.<br/><br/>Boots

  section of the Dallas <br/>&gt; Morning <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; News today.<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like Arkansas has figured out that geocaching can 
  <br/>&gt; be <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; used in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a positive 
  way for their state. We do need to approach <br/>&gt; someone <br/>&gt; &gt;

  *Tourism Department Adopts Geocaching Hobby - *The <br/>Arkansas <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; Department of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parks and Tourism has adopted 
  geocaching as a way to <br/>&gt; encourage <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; travelers 
  to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explore the state this year. Cache in With the 
  Natural <br/>State <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; provides the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  coordinates to a different cache each month. Trade items <br/>in <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; caches may<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; include tourism 
  incentives such as certificates for <br/>lodging <br/>&gt; or <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  restaurants.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Geocaching is an international hobby 
  in which caches are <br/>&gt; &gt; hidden <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; &gt; &gt; individuals or groups. The location of each geocache is 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; identified by global<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 
  positioning system coordinates that are shared via the <br/>&gt; &gt; Internet. 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hobbyist<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use hand-held GPS 
  units to hunt for the caches. For <br/>&gt; &gt; coordinates <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;

<div><font size="2">Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for 
  taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they will consider 
  your request. I certainly understand why they are protective of the parks, but 
  hope they also realize the benefit of bringing more people to the parks. Since 
  my husband and I aren't really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing 
  has brought me to numerous state parks which I would never have visited 
  otherwise. After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride and 
  "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more to support the 
  growth and maintenance of the park system. That can't be a bad thing for the 
  TPW!</font></div>

<p>I contacted Mr. Good at TPW again and received the following 
    reply:<br/><br/>Hi Charles,<br/><br/>We are in the process of reviewing and 
    updating most of our <br/>operational policies for State Parks. I am 
    confident that our <br/>present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded 
    to cover <br/>letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the 
    <br/>policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/><br/>Thanks for 
    checking,<br/><br/>Kevin Good<br/><br/>I'm not sure this is the answer I was 
    looking for, so I replied to <br/>him:<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Good,<br/><br/>I am 
    hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. The <br/>policy for 
    geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>maintained quarterly. 
    If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>visited Davis Mountain State 
    Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>wouldn't be able to go back there 
    every 3 months to check on it, <br/>which would violate the policy. I 
    respecfully ask that you consider <br/>this point. Thank you.&lt; </p></div><!--End group email --></font></blockquote></div></blockquote></body></html>

 by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individuals or groups. The location of each geocache is <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; identified by global<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positioning system coordinates that are shared via the <br/>&gt; &gt; Internet. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hobbyist<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use hand-held GPS units to hunt for the caches.

 trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the park <br/>staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>to do that. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br/>think they
 are "getting it" just yet. If anyone has any ideas, I'd <br/>like to hear them. <br/><br/>Boots Tex <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/>&lt;cjagger405@<wbr>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good response, Boots.

The <br/>&gt; policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>&gt; maintained quarterly. If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>&gt; visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>&gt; wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br/>&gt; which would violate the policy.

<div><font size="2">That is so true because since I found the original thirty forest letterboxes in CT, they have retired that series and put a new boxes in different locations in their (now) 32 state forests. Now I want to go up there and spend a couple of weeks finding all the new ones. It does take awhile to find all of them because some of the hikes may take a couple of hours, then you have to drive to the next closest forest (perhaps and hour away) to find the next box. The most I could do in a single day was four, but it was usually more like two or three. So that's a good ten days worth of boxing.... not to mention all the other wonderful boxes hidden in those forests by other great letterboxers. I mean, who would be able to pass up boxes hidden by Randy Hall or Silent Doug or Sojourner or.....</font></div>

<div>I'm trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the park <br/>staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>to do that. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br/>think they are "getting it" just yet. If anyone has any ideas, I'd <br/>like to hear them. <br/><br/>Boots Tex <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/>&lt;cjagger405@<wbr>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good response, Boots.

I certainly understand why they are <br/>protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit of <br/>bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't <br/>really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought me <br/>to numerous state parks which I would never have visited otherwise. <br/>After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride <br/>and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more <br/>to support the growth and maintenance of the park system.

The location of each geocache is <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identified by global<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positioning system coordinates that are shared via the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Internet. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hobbyist<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use hand-held GPS units to hunt for the caches.

</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">Most gc's give you cords and possibly an encoded "hint" to help you find it, but most gc'ers consider looking at the hint as wimping out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>There are a few gc's that give you coords, then give you clues to bring you on in  those are good.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, by and large, gc's give you coords only (with the aforementioned encoded hint maybe).
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Then - every GPSr has some margin of accuracy  10 sq ft is pretty darned good (yeah, I've heard stories of folks who buy the el cheapo at Walmart and it gets 'em within a foot or two, and I just don't buy it)  and when you add the margin of your unit to the margin of the planter's unit, you are within 20 sq ft on a good day, and then you start looking.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And if you aren't good at thinking like a geocacher, you wind up overturning everything until you find the cache, creating a mess and disturbing all the things park rangers don't like to see disturbed.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">With letterboxing, GOOD clues bring you right on in to an exact location.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>This isn't to say that the same thing can't happen with a LB, but it is less likely, especially if the clues are well-written.
</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">Here's another difference between letterboxing and geocaching.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We talk.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and their means of disseminating information is not as efficient as ours.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We have the national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and Houston, we have regional lists.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">If we play on our effective communication, and if we do "education" on the lists sometimes (and since we are talking about state parks, I suggest using the state list  this one), we can point to the fact that we keep our members up and running on best practices  
i.e. not placing boxes in such a way as there is only one way in and one way out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Perhaps we can make a list of critical topics and discuss one a month, or have one person lead a discussion of them (
i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be willing to lead a discussion of LNT).<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">THEN  if we had one park or one person who agreed to be the letterboxing liaison, so that if they could not reach a box owner they could contact that person who will try to get in touch with the owner through other means, or will come get the offending box, or will arrange for someone else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to loosening the rules for us.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I think though, that we cannot put too much on the liaison  it has to be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" thing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But if the liaison is unable to reach the owner and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a box, he can contact the park and say "no luck here either  chunk it" and we can do some spot education to prevent the same sort of problem from happening again.

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The problem here is that the folks who are planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards we agree to, and we have to account for that. </font></div>

<br/>the owner<br/>&gt; and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a box, he can <br/>contact the<br/>&gt; park and say "no luck here either  chunk it" and we can do some <br/>spot<br/>&gt; education to prevent the same sort of problem from happening again. 
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It's a bit of a jump, but these may be the sorts of measures that <br/>allow us<br/>&gt; freedom. We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means <br/>we all have<br/>&gt; to be accountable to each other. The problem here is that the 
<br/>folks who are<br/>&gt; planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards we <br/>agree to,<br/>&gt; and we have to account for that.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; So what do y'all think?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>

</p><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif">First of all, BT, one point I 
  think you can make to differentiate gc'ing from lb'ing is this (Mike, I'm 
  relying on you to correct me if I'm wrong): </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif"></font> </p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif">Most gc's give you cords and 
  possibly an encoded "hint" to help you find it, but most gc'ers consider 
  looking at the hint as wimping out.<span>   </span>There are a few gc's 
  that give you coords, then give you clues to bring you on in – those are 
  good.<span>  </span>However, by and large, gc's give you coords only 
  (with the aforementioned encoded hint maybe). <span>  </span>Then - every 
  GPSr has some margin of accuracy – 10 sq ft is pretty darned good (yeah, I've 
  heard stories of folks who buy the el cheapo at Walmart and it gets 'em within 
  a foot or two, and I just don't buy it) – and when you add the margin of your 
  unit to the margin of the planter's unit, you are within 20 sq ft on a good 
  day, and then you start looking. <span>  </span>And if you aren't good at 
  thinking like a geocacher, you wind up overturning everything until you find 
  the cache, creating a mess and disturbing all the things park rangers don't 
  like to see disturbed. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="042525122-14082007"><font face="Arial">ALL TRUE IN 
  A GENERAL SORT OF WAY.  SOME GEOCACHERS WRITE GOOD CLUES.  SOME 
  LETTERBOXERS COULD USE LESSONS.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif">With letterboxing, GOOD clues 
  bring you right on in to an exact location.<span>  </span>This isn't to 
  say that the same thing can't happen with a LB, but it is less likely, 
  especially if the clues are well-written. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="042525122-14082007"><font face="Arial">ACTUALLY - 
  I REALLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE HERE.  IN MOST CASES THERE ARE 
  ONLY SO MANY ROCKS TO HIDE IT UNDER.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif">Here's another difference 
  between letterboxing and geocaching.<span>  </span>We talk.<span>   
  </span>Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and their means of 
  disseminating information is not as efficient as ours.<span>  </span>We 
  have the national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and 
  Houston, we have regional lists. <span>  </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="042525122-14082007"><font face="Arial">I HAVE TO 
  DIFFER HERE.  THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE GEOCACHERS IN THE GEOCACHING FORMS 
  AND MORE GEOCACHING FORUMS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.  THERE ARE STATE AND 
  LOCAL GROUPS AS WELL AS MORE THAN ONE NATIONAL GROUP.  NOT ALL CACHERS 
  BELONG OR PARTICIPATE.  NEITHER DO ALL BOXERS.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif">If we play on our effective 
  communication, and if we do "education" on the lists sometimes (and since we 
  are talking about state parks, I suggest using the state list – this one), we 
  can point to the fact that we keep our members up and running on best 
  practices – i.e. not placing boxes in such a way as there is only one way in 
  and one way out.<span>  </span>Perhaps we can make a list of critical 
  topics and discuss one a month, or have one person lead a discussion of them ( 
  i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be willing to lead a discussion of 
  LNT).<span>  </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span class="042525122-14082007"><font face="Arial">IMPORTANT 
  POINT.  NOT EVERYONE IS ON THIS LIST.  LIKE I HAD ONE CACHER DIG 
  HOLES AROUND MY FAKE CACTUS - CAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW AND DIDN'T 
  PARTICIPATE.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="arial,sans-serif">THEN – if we had one park or 
  one person who agreed to be the letterboxing liaison, so that if they could 
  not reach a box owner they could contact that person who will try to get in 
  touch with the owner through other means, or will come get the offending box, 
  or will arrange for someone else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to 
  loosening the rules for us. <span>  </span>I think though, that we cannot 
  put too much on the liaison – it has to be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" 
  thing.<span>  </span>But if the liaison is unable to reach the owner and 
  unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a box, he can contact the park 
  and say "no luck here either – chunk it" and we can do some spot education to 
  prevent the same sort of problem from happening again. </font></p>

<p><span>Lucy: Again, you're right.  You can't say ALL or NONE (but I didn't).  What I find most interesting about your comment is that about every six months I google for lists and forums for geocaching and all I come up with are the Groundspeak forums, or Groundspeak-like forums.  I have a horrible time with those - I don't know why - but maybe when things slow down again (if they ever do), I'll try them again.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">These are all very good comments.  I have been taking a cautious <br>
approach.  You can argue with the umpire, but if he doesnt' like <br>
what you have to say, he has the authority to throw you out of the <br>
game, whether you are right or not.  In Texas letterboxing, we have <br>
some very talented and experienced people, and if you think the <br>
aggressive approach is better, I yield to your negotiating <br>
experience.  If we're going to do that, I suggest we come up with a <br>
comprehensive response. Barefoot Lucy, since you are obviously our <br>
most accomplished writer, would you consider writing a response, <br>
bringing up all these good points?  You could post it here first and <br>
open it to discussion, then when a final draft is approved, I could <br>
email it the Mr. Good at TPW, crediting Texas Letterboxers.  This <br>
should probably be done this week, since he said they should have a <br>
policy written by September 1.  What do you think?  Should we let <br>
him know that we are looking to making letterboxing an approved <br>
activity, like camping or hiking, rather than something requiring a <br>
permit, like geocaching or hunting?  We would also like for the <br>
activity to be consistent in all state parks instead of letting each <br>
park manager decide.  I wanted to tell him (but restrained myself) <br>
about our experience at McKinney Falls SP.  We camped there for <br>
several days and hiked most of the trails.  Everywhere we went, we <br>
took a trash bag and a grabber tool and filled up the bag with drink <br>
cans, food containers, plastic bags, etc.  When we placed our two <br>
boxes, they were hidden very well and within a few feet of the <br>
trail.  Someone made a point of finding our boxes and emailing us <br>
that they violated their policy when, in my opinion, they could have <br>
better used their time picking up trash.  Also, since there's a <br>
difference of opinion, should we concentrate more on about what's <br>
good about letterboxing instead of what's not good about geocaching? <br>

<p>These are all very good comments. I have been taking a cautious <br/>approach. You can argue with the umpire, but if he doesnt' like <br/>what you have to say, he has the authority to throw you out of the <br/>game, whether you are right or not. In Texas letterboxing, we have 
<br/>some very talented and experienced people, and if you think the <br/>aggressive approach is better, I yield to your negotiating <br/>experience. If we're going to do that, I suggest we come up with a <br/>comprehensive response. Barefoot Lucy, since you are obviously our 
<br/>most accomplished writer, would you consider writing a response, <br/>bringing up all these good points? You could post it here first and <br/>open it to discussion, then when a final draft is approved, I could <br/>email it the Mr. Good at TPW, crediting Texas Letterboxers. This 
<br/>should probably be done this week, since he said they should have a <br/>policy written by September 1. What do you think? Should we let <br/>him know that we are looking to making letterboxing an approved <br/>activity, like camping or hiking, rather than something requiring a 
<br/>permit, like geocaching or hunting? We would also like for the <br/>activity to be consistent in all state parks instead of letting each <br/>park manager decide. I wanted to tell him (but restrained myself) <br/>about our experience at McKinney Falls SP. We camped there for 
<br/>several days and hiked most of the trails. Everywhere we went, we <br/>took a trash bag and a grabber tool and filled up the bag with drink <br/>cans, food containers, plastic bags, etc. When we placed our two <br/>boxes, they were hidden very well and within a few feet of the 
<br/>trail. Someone made a point of finding our boxes and emailing us <br/>that they violated their policy when, in my opinion, they could have <br/>better used their time picking up trash. Also, since there's a <br/>difference of opinion, should we concentrate more on about what's 
<br/>good about letterboxing instead of what's not good about geocaching? <br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: You gotta be kidding, right? Maybe there are only so many <br/>rocks, but<br/>&gt; there are millions of pine trees it could be behind!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ************************************************
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: Here's another difference between letterboxing and <br/>geocaching. We<br/>&gt; talk. Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and <br/>their means<br/>&gt; of disseminating information is not as efficient as ours. We have 
<br/>the<br/>&gt; national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and <br/>Houston,<br/>&gt; we have regional lists.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; MIKE: I HAVE TO DIFFER HERE. THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE GEOCACHERS <br/>IN THE<br/>

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: Again, you're right. You can't say ALL or NONE (but I <br/>didn't). What<br/>&gt; I find most interesting about your comment is that about every six <br/>months I<br/>&gt; google for lists and forums for geocaching and all I come up with 
<br/>are the<br/>&gt; Groundspeak forums, or Groundspeak-like forums. I have a horrible <br/>time with<br/>&gt; those - I don't know why - but maybe when things slow down again <br/>(if they<br/>&gt; ever do), I'll try them again.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; *************************<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: If we play on our effective communication, and if we <br/>do "education"<br/>&gt; on the lists sometimes (and since we are talking about state <br/>
parks, I<br/>&gt; suggest using the state list  this one), we can point to the fact <br/>that we<br/>&gt; keep our members up and running on best practices  i.e. not <br/>placing boxes<br/>&gt; in such a way as there is only one way in and one way out. 
<br/>Perhaps we can<br/>&gt; make a list of critical topics and discuss one a month, or have <br/>one person<br/>&gt; lead a discussion of them ( i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be <br/>willing to<br/>&gt; lead a discussion of LNT).
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; MIKE: IMPORTANT POINT. NOT EVERYONE IS ON THIS LIST. LIKE I HAD <br/>ONE<br/>&gt; CACHER DIG HOLES AROUND MY FAKE CACTUS - CAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW AND <br/>DIDN'T<br/>&gt; PARTICIPATE.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: Yep. BUT - by promoting education, we can express to them 
<br/>our<br/>&gt; commitment to "doing it right" and to playing by the rules so that <br/>maybe<br/>&gt; their rules can be a little looser if we are going to work to <br/>bring our<br/>&gt; group to the highest level possible. I think it's far more 
<br/>important to<br/>&gt; stress to "them" that not all letterboxers are in the right place <br/>to get the<br/>&gt; education, but that the ones who are on board with them, provided <br/>they don't<br/>&gt; get too screwy with their demands.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ***************************<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: THEN  if we had one park or one person who agreed to be the<br/>&gt; letterboxing liaison, so that if they could not reach a box owner <br/>they could<br/>
&gt; contact that person who will try to get in touch with the owner <br/>through<br/>&gt; other means, or will come get the offending box, or will arrange <br/>for someone<br/>&gt; else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to loosening the 
<br/>rules for<br/>&gt; us. I think though, that we cannot put too much on the liaison  <br/>it has to<br/>&gt; be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" thing. But if the liaison is <br/>unable to reach<br/>&gt; the owner and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: That's how we know it will work - because YOU'VE made it <br/>work there!<br/>&gt; It's a bit of a jump, but these may be the sorts of measures that <br/>allow us<br/>&gt; freedom. We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means 
<br/>we all have<br/>&gt; to be accountable to each other. The problem here is that the <br/>folks who<br/>&gt; are planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards <br/>we agree<br/>&gt; to, and we have to account for that.
