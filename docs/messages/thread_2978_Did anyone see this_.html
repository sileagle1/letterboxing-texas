not yet.  I'll keep you informed of any progress.<br/>

<br/>
Hi Charles,<br/>
<br/>
We are in the process of reviewing and updating most of our <br/>
operational policies for State Parks.  I am confident that our <br/>
present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br/>
letterboxing as the activities have similarities.  I believe the <br/>
policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for checking,<br/>
<br/>
Kevin Good<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied to <br/>
him:<br/>
<br/>
Dear Mr. Good,<br/>
<br/>
I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits.  The <br/>
policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>
maintained quarterly.  If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>
visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>
wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br/>
which would violate the policy.  I respecfully ask that you consider <br/>
this point.  Thank you.<br/>
<br/>
I'll keep you posted.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It looks like Arkansas has figured out that geocaching can <br/>
&gt; be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; used in<br/>

Arkansas <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Department of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Parks and Tourism has adopted geocaching as a way to <br/>
&gt; encourage <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; travelers to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explore the state this year. Cache in With the Natural <br/>
State <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; provides the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coordinates to a different cache each month. Trade items <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; &gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; caches may<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; include tourism incentives such as certificates for <br/>
lodging <br/>
&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; restaurants.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Geocaching is an international hobby in which caches are <br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individuals or groups. The location of each geocache is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; identified by global<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; positioning system coordinates that are shared via the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Internet. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hobbyist<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use hand-held GPS units to hunt for the caches. For <br/>

<div>Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they will consider your request. I certainly understand why they are protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit of bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought me to numerous state parks which I would never have visited otherwise. After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more to support the growth and maintenance of the park system. That can't be a bad thing for the TPW!</div>

listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching.  Not <br/>
that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>
to see letterboxing as more of a family activity.  Their policy on <br/>
geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>
and wait for it to be approved.  You then have to meet with the park <br/>
staff and get approval for the location of the box.  Then, you have <br/>
to come back every 3 months to check on the box.  The permit has to <br/>
be renewed anually.  I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>
us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>
boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>
scenario.  I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>
demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>
to do that.  I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br/>
think they are "getting it" just yet.  If anyone has any ideas, I'd <br/>
like to hear them. <br/>

<div>Maybe you could refer them to this website for ideas of how state parks can work with the public (letterboxers) to improve the enjoyment and awareness of the state parks:</div>

<p>I'm trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the park <br/>staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>to do that. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br/>think they are "getting it" just yet. If anyone has any ideas, I'd <br/>like to hear them. <br/><br/>Boots Tex <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/>&lt;cjagger405@<wbr/>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for <br/>taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they will <br/>consider your request. I certainly understand why they are <br/>protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit of <br/>bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't <br/>really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought me <br/>to numerous state parks which I would never have visited otherwise. <br/>After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride <br/>and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more <br/>to support the growth and maintenance of the park system.

I am confident that our <br/>&gt; present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br/>&gt; letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the <br/>&gt; policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Thanks for checking,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Kevin Good<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied to <br/>&gt; him:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Dear Mr. Good,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. The <br/>&gt; policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>&gt; maintained quarterly. If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>&gt; visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>&gt; wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br/>&gt; which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you <br/>consider <br/>&gt; this point.

I replied to him with my thanks for his patience and copied the link <br/>
to the Connecticut forest site.  I told him that Connecticut has <br/>
more letterboxes than any other state, 1881, but that Texas was <br/>
rapidly catching up with 1619 (per LbNA) and that we were seeking <br/>
official sanction for letterboxing in state parks and we thought <br/>
that it would promote visitation to Texas state parks.  We'll see <br/>
what he says.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>
&gt; listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>
&gt; that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>
&gt; geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>
&gt; and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the <br/>
park <br/>
&gt; staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>
&gt; to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>
&gt; be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>
&gt; us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>
&gt; boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>
&gt; demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a <br/>
need <br/>
&gt; to do that. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br/>
&gt; think they are "getting it" just yet. If anyone has any ideas, I'd <br/>
&gt; like to hear them. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for <br/>
&gt; taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; consider your request. I certainly understand why they are <br/>
&gt; protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit of <br/>
&gt; bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't <br/>
&gt; really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought me <br/>
&gt; to numerous state parks which I would never have visited <br/>
otherwise. <br/>
&gt; After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride <br/>
&gt; and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more <br/>
&gt; to support the growth and maintenance of the park system. That <br/>
can't <br/>
&gt; be a bad thing for the TPW!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I contacted Mr. Good at TPW again and received the following <br/>
reply:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Hi Charles,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We are in the process of reviewing and updating most of our <br/>
&gt; &gt; operational policies for State Parks. I am confident that our <br/>
&gt; &gt; present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the <br/>
&gt; &gt; policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks for checking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Kevin Good<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; him:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dear Mr. Good,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; &gt; policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>
&gt; &gt; maintained quarterly. If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>
&gt; &gt; visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you <br/>
&gt; consider <br/>
&gt; &gt; this point. Thank you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll keep you posted.<br/>

  looking for, so I replied to <br/>him:<br/><br/>Dear Mr. Good,<br/><br/>I am hoping 
  letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. The <br/>policy for 
  geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>maintained quarterly. If 
  a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>visited Davis Mountain State Park and 
  placed a letterbox, they <br/>wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months 
  to check on it, <br/>which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you

<div>Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for 
  taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they will consider 
  your request. I certainly understand why they are protective of the parks, but 
  hope they also realize the benefit of bringing more people to the parks. Since 
  my husband and I aren't really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing 
  has brought me to numerous state parks which I would never have visited 
  otherwise. After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride and 
  "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do more to support the 
  growth and maintenance of the park system. That can't be a bad thing for the 
  TPW!</div>

&gt; Thanks, PS, that's a great web site.  I did get another reply from <br/>
&gt; Mr. Good:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; "I think you may have been misinformed.  The permits for a geocache <br/>
&gt; must be renewed annually, rather than quarterly.  However, I <br/>
&gt; understand your concern and will take that into consideration."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I replied to him with my thanks for his patience and copied the <br/>
link <br/>
&gt; to the Connecticut forest site.  I told him that Connecticut has <br/>
&gt; more letterboxes than any other state, 1881, but that Texas was <br/>
&gt; rapidly catching up with 1619 (per LbNA) and that we were seeking <br/>
&gt; official sanction for letterboxing in state parks and we thought <br/>
&gt; that it would promote visitation to Texas state parks.  We'll see <br/>
&gt; what he says.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>
&gt; &gt; listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>
&gt; &gt; that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want <br/>
&gt; them <br/>
&gt; &gt; to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a <br/>
cache <br/>
&gt; &gt; and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the <br/>
&gt; park <br/>
&gt; &gt; staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; &gt; to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>
&gt; &gt; demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a <br/>
&gt; need <br/>
&gt; &gt; to do that. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I <br/>
don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; think they are "getting it" just yet. If anyone has any ideas, <br/>
I'd <br/>
&gt; &gt; like to hear them. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for <br/>
&gt; &gt; taking the opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they <br/>
&gt; will <br/>
&gt; &gt; consider your request. I certainly understand why they are <br/>
&gt; &gt; protective of the parks, but hope they also realize the benefit <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; bringing more people to the parks. Since my husband and I aren't <br/>
&gt; &gt; really campers (although I'd love to), letterboxing has brought <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; &gt; to numerous state parks which I would never have visited <br/>
&gt; otherwise. <br/>
&gt; &gt; After visiting a park, I am always left with a feeling of pride <br/>
&gt; &gt; and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to do <br/>
more <br/>
&gt; &gt; to support the growth and maintenance of the park system. That <br/>
&gt; can't <br/>
&gt; &gt; be a bad thing for the TPW!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I contacted Mr. Good at TPW again and received the following <br/>
&gt; reply:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi Charles,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are in the process of reviewing and updating most of our <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; operational policies for State Parks. I am confident that our <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for checking,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Kevin Good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Mr. Good,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. <br/>
&gt; The <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; maintained quarterly. If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on <br/>
it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you <br/>
&gt; &gt; consider <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this point. Thank you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'll keep you posted.<br/>

&gt; Good response, Boots. I'm sure we're all grateful to you for <br/>
taking the<br/>
&gt; opportunity to contact the TPW folks. Hopefully they will consider <br/>
your<br/>
&gt; request. I certainly understand why they are protective of the <br/>
parks, but<br/>
&gt; hope they also realize the benefit of bringing more people to the <br/>
parks.<br/>
&gt; Since my husband and I aren't really campers (although I'd love <br/>
to),<br/>
&gt; letterboxing has brought me to numerous state parks which I would <br/>
never have<br/>
&gt; visited otherwise. After visiting a park, I am always left with a <br/>
feeling of<br/>
&gt; pride and "ownership" of the Texas parks, which makes me want to <br/>
do more to<br/>
&gt; support the growth and maintenance of the park system. That can't <br/>
be a bad<br/>
&gt; thing for the TPW!<br/>

&gt; I contacted Mr. Good at TPW again and received the following reply:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hi Charles,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are in the process of reviewing and updating most of our <br/>
&gt; operational policies for State Parks. I am confident that our <br/>
&gt; present policy regarding geocaching can be expanded to cover <br/>
&gt; letterboxing as the activities have similarities. I believe the <br/>
&gt; policy update will be completed by September 1.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for checking,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kevin Good<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure this is the answer I was looking for, so I replied to <br/>
&gt; him:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dear Mr. Good,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am hoping letterboxing can be considered on its own merits. The <br/>
&gt; policy for geocaching is restrictive in that the box must be <br/>
&gt; maintained quarterly. If a family from Houston, for instance, <br/>
&gt; visited Davis Mountain State Park and placed a letterbox, they <br/>
&gt; wouldn't be able to go back there every 3 months to check on it, <br/>
&gt; which would violate the policy. I respecfully ask that you <br/>
consider <br/>
&gt; this point. Thank you.&lt;<br/>

 trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the park <br/>staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>to do that.

<div>That is so true because since I found the original thirty forest letterboxes in CT, they have retired that series and put a new boxes in different locations in their (now) 32 state forests. Now I want to go up there and spend a couple of weeks finding all the new ones. It does take awhile to find all of them because some of the hikes may take a couple of hours, then you have to drive to the next closest forest (perhaps and hour away) to find the next box. The most I could do in a single day was four, but it was usually more like two or three. So that's a good ten days worth of boxing.... not to mention all the other wonderful boxes hidden in those forests by other great letterboxers. I mean, who would be able to pass up boxes hidden by Randy Hall or Silent Doug or Sojourner or.....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I've got an old dog who used to hike with me up there. Now he has really bad old hips and kidney failure problems, so I'm staying close to home with him right now. But the day will come when I will be able to travel a bit and I've definitely got a letterboxing trip in New England on my list. (as well as the HOUSTON area!)</div>

<div>I'm trying to proceed cautiously. They seem to be willing to <br/>listen, but I'd like for them to separate us from geocaching. Not <br/>that I think there's anything wrong with geocaching, but I want them <br/>to see letterboxing as more of a family activity. Their policy on <br/>geocaching is that you have to fill out a request to place a cache <br/>and wait for it to be approved. You then have to meet with the park <br/>staff and get approval for the location of the box. Then, you have <br/>to come back every 3 months to check on the box. The permit has to <br/>be renewed anually. I just don't think that would work for most of <br/>us unless we assign someone locally to be responsible for all the <br/>boxes in every park. I don't know if everyone would agree with that <br/>scenario. I have offered to meet with TPW to explain and <br/>demonstrate letterboxing, but so far they have not expressed a need <br/>to do that. I don't want to make a nuisance of myself, but I don't <br/>think they are "getting it" just yet.

</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most gc's give you cords and possibly an encoded "hint" to help you find it, but most gc'ers consider looking at the hint as wimping out.<span>
  </span>There are a few gc's that give you coords, then give you clues to bring you on in  those are good.<span>  </span>However, by and large, gc's give you coords only (with the aforementioned encoded hint maybe).
<span>  </span>Then - every GPSr has some margin of accuracy  10 sq ft is pretty darned good (yeah, I've heard stories of folks who buy the el cheapo at Walmart and it gets 'em within a foot or two, and I just don't buy it)  and when you add the margin of your unit to the margin of the planter's unit, you are within 20 sq ft on a good day, and then you start looking.
<span>  </span>And if you aren't good at thinking like a geocacher, you wind up overturning everything until you find the cache, creating a mess and disturbing all the things park rangers don't like to see disturbed.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>With letterboxing, GOOD clues bring you right on in to an exact location.<span>  </span>This isn't to say that the same thing can't happen with a LB, but it is less likely, especially if the clues are well-written.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Here's another difference between letterboxing and geocaching.<span>  </span>We talk.<span>
  </span>Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and their means of disseminating information is not as efficient as ours.<span>  </span>We have the national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and Houston, we have regional lists.
<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>If we play on our effective communication, and if we do "education" on the lists sometimes (and since we are talking about state parks, I suggest using the state list  this one), we can point to the fact that we keep our members up and running on best practices  
i.e. not placing boxes in such a way as there is only one way in and one way out.<span>  </span>Perhaps we can make a list of critical topics and discuss one a month, or have one person lead a discussion of them (
i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be willing to lead a discussion of LNT).<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>THEN  if we had one park or one person who agreed to be the letterboxing liaison, so that if they could not reach a box owner they could contact that person who will try to get in touch with the owner through other means, or will come get the offending box, or will arrange for someone else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to loosening the rules for us.
<span>  </span>I think though, that we cannot put too much on the liaison  it has to be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" thing.<span>  </span>But if the liaison is unable to reach the owner and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a box, he can contact the park and say "no luck here either  chunk it" and we can do some spot education to prevent the same sort of problem from happening again.
</p>
<p> </p>
<div class="MsoNormal">It's a bit of a jump, but these may be the sorts of measures that allow us freedom.<span>  </span>We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means we all have to be accountable to each other.
<span>  </span>The problem here is that the folks who are planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards we agree to, and we have to account for that. </div>

them with a lot of information all at once, I'm afraid they will <br/>
just cut off any discussion and do their own thing.  I did send them <br/>
the link to the Connecticut state forest site that was supplied by <br/>
Puddle Splasher, but I haven't heard from them since.  Hopefully it <br/>
is making them think and maybe do more research on letterboxing. If <br/>
and when the time comes that they agree to a meeting, I'll be <br/>
seeking advice from all of you.  I'm starting a file with good ideas <br/>

then you<br/>
&gt; start looking.  And if you aren't good at thinking like a <br/>
geocacher, you<br/>
&gt; wind up overturning everything until you find the cache, creating <br/>
a mess and<br/>
&gt; disturbing all the things park rangers don't like to see disturbed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; With letterboxing, GOOD clues bring you right on in to an exact <br/>
location.  This<br/>
&gt; isn't to say that the same thing can't happen with a LB, but it is <br/>
less<br/>
&gt; likely, especially if the clues are well-written.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's another difference between letterboxing and geocaching.  We <br/>
talk.  Yes,<br/>
&gt; they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and their means of<br/>
&gt; disseminating information is not as efficient as ours.  We have <br/>
the national<br/>
&gt; list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and Houston, <br/>
we have<br/>
&gt; regional lists.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If we play on our effective communication, and if we <br/>
do "education" on the<br/>
&gt; lists sometimes (and since we are talking about state parks, I <br/>
suggest using<br/>
&gt; the state list  this one), we can point to the fact that we keep <br/>
our<br/>
&gt; members up and running on best practices  i.e. not placing boxes <br/>
in such a<br/>
&gt; way as there is only one way in and one way out.  Perhaps we can <br/>
make a list<br/>
&gt; of critical topics and discuss one a month, or have one person <br/>
lead a<br/>
&gt; discussion of them (i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be willing to <br/>
lead a<br/>
&gt; discussion of LNT).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THEN  if we had one park or one person who agreed to be the <br/>
letterboxing<br/>
&gt; liaison, so that if they could not reach a box owner they could <br/>
contact that<br/>
&gt; person who will try to get in touch with the owner through other <br/>
means, or<br/>
&gt; will come get the offending box, or will arrange for someone else <br/>
to pick it<br/>
&gt; up, they might be more amenable to loosening the rules for us.  I <br/>
think<br/>
&gt; though, that we cannot put too much on the liaison  it has to be <br/>
a "TRY"<br/>
&gt; thing, not a "WILL" thing.  But if the liaison is unable to reach <br/>
the owner<br/>
&gt; and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a box, he can <br/>
contact the<br/>
&gt; park and say "no luck here either  chunk it" and we can do some <br/>
spot<br/>
&gt; education to prevent the same sort of problem from happening again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's a bit of a jump, but these may be the sorts of measures that <br/>
allow us<br/>
&gt; freedom.  We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means <br/>
we all have<br/>
&gt; to be accountable to each other.  The problem here is that the <br/>
folks who are<br/>
&gt; planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards we <br/>
agree to,<br/>
&gt; and we have to account for that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So what do y'all think?<br/>

<p>
</p><p>First of all, BT, one point I 
  think you can make to differentiate gc'ing from lb'ing is this (Mike, I'm 
  relying on you to correct me if I'm wrong): </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Most gc's give you cords and 
  possibly an encoded "hint" to help you find it, but most gc'ers consider 
  looking at the hint as wimping out.<span>   </span>There are a few gc's 
  that give you coords, then give you clues to bring you on in – those are 
  good.<span>  </span>However, by and large, gc's give you coords only 
  (with the aforementioned encoded hint maybe). <span>  </span>Then - every 
  GPSr has some margin of accuracy – 10 sq ft is pretty darned good (yeah, I've 
  heard stories of folks who buy the el cheapo at Walmart and it gets 'em within 
  a foot or two, and I just don't buy it) – and when you add the margin of your 
  unit to the margin of the planter's unit, you are within 20 sq ft on a good 
  day, and then you start looking. <span>  </span>And if you aren't good at 
  thinking like a geocacher, you wind up overturning everything until you find 
  the cache, creating a mess and disturbing all the things park rangers don't 
  like to see disturbed. </p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">ALL TRUE IN 
  A GENERAL SORT OF WAY.  SOME GEOCACHERS WRITE GOOD CLUES.  SOME 
  LETTERBOXERS COULD USE LESSONS.</span></p>
<p>With letterboxing, GOOD clues 
  bring you right on in to an exact location.<span>  </span>This isn't to 
  say that the same thing can't happen with a LB, but it is less likely, 
  especially if the clues are well-written. </p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">ACTUALLY - 
  I REALLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE HERE.  IN MOST CASES THERE ARE 
  ONLY SO MANY ROCKS TO HIDE IT UNDER.</span></p>
<p>Here's another difference 
  between letterboxing and geocaching.<span>  </span>We talk.<span>   
  </span>Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and their means of 
  disseminating information is not as efficient as ours.<span>  </span>We 
  have the national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and 
  Houston, we have regional lists. <span>  </span></p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">I HAVE TO 
  DIFFER HERE.  THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE GEOCACHERS IN THE GEOCACHING FORMS 
  AND MORE GEOCACHING FORUMS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.  THERE ARE STATE AND 
  LOCAL GROUPS AS WELL AS MORE THAN ONE NATIONAL GROUP.  NOT ALL CACHERS 
  BELONG OR PARTICIPATE.  NEITHER DO ALL BOXERS.</span></p>
<p>If we play on our effective 
  communication, and if we do "education" on the lists sometimes (and since we 
  are talking about state parks, I suggest using the state list – this one), we 
  can point to the fact that we keep our members up and running on best 
  practices – i.e. not placing boxes in such a way as there is only one way in 
  and one way out.<span>  </span>Perhaps we can make a list of critical 
  topics and discuss one a month, or have one person lead a discussion of them ( 
  i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be willing to lead a discussion of 
  LNT).<span>  </span></p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">IMPORTANT 
  POINT.  NOT EVERYONE IS ON THIS LIST.  LIKE I HAD ONE CACHER DIG 
  HOLES AROUND MY FAKE CACTUS - CAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW AND DIDN'T 
  PARTICIPATE.</span></p>
<p>THEN – if we had one park or 
  one person who agreed to be the letterboxing liaison, so that if they could 
  not reach a box owner they could contact that person who will try to get in 
  touch with the owner through other means, or will come get the offending box, 
  or will arrange for someone else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to 
  loosening the rules for us. <span>  </span>I think though, that we cannot 
  put too much on the liaison – it has to be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" 
  thing.<span>  </span>But if the liaison is unable to reach the owner and 
  unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a box, he can contact the park 
  and say "no luck here either – chunk it" and we can do some spot education to 
  prevent the same sort of problem from happening again. </p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">MUCH AS I 
  DO IN EL PASO NOW.</span></p>
<div class="MsoNormal">It's a bit of a jump, but 
  these may be the sorts of measures that allow us freedom.<span>  
  </span>We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means we all have to 
  be accountable to each other. <span>  </span>The problem here is that the 
  folks who are planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards 
  we agree to, and we have to account for that. </div>
<div class="MsoNormal"> </div>
<p>So what do y'all 
  think?<span class="042525122-14082007"> </span></p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">ANYTHING IS BETTER THAN NOTHING.  PRO-ACTIVE 
  APPROACH WILL AT LEAST GET YOU AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THE RANGERS.  DOING 
  NOTHING WILL NOT GET YOU ANY NOTICE AT ALL.</span></p>
<p><span class="042525122-14082007">THE FOREST USING LETTERBOXES TO DRAW VISITORS IS 
  A GOOD IDEA.  KNOWING THE TEXAS BUDGET, THAT SHOULD BE

approach.  You can argue with the umpire, but if he doesnt' like <br/>
what you have to say, he has the authority to throw you out of the <br/>
game, whether you are right or not.  In Texas letterboxing, we have <br/>
some very talented and experienced people, and if you think the <br/>
aggressive approach is better, I yield to your negotiating <br/>
experience.  If we're going to do that, I suggest we come up with a <br/>
comprehensive response. Barefoot Lucy, since you are obviously our <br/>
most accomplished writer, would you consider writing a response, <br/>
bringing up all these good points?  You could post it here first and <br/>
open it to discussion, then when a final draft is approved, I could <br/>
email it the Mr. Good at TPW, crediting Texas Letterboxers.  This <br/>
should probably be done this week, since he said they should have a <br/>
policy written by September 1.  What do you think?  Should we let <br/>
him know that we are looking to making letterboxing an approved <br/>
activity, like camping or hiking, rather than something requiring a <br/>
permit, like geocaching or hunting?  We would also like for the <br/>
activity to be consistent in all state parks instead of letting each <br/>
park manager decide.  I wanted to tell him (but restrained myself) <br/>
about our experience at McKinney Falls SP.  We camped there for <br/>
several days and hiked most of the trails.  Everywhere we went, we <br/>
took a trash bag and a grabber tool and filled up the bag with drink <br/>
cans, food containers, plastic bags, etc.  When we placed our two <br/>
boxes, they were hidden very well and within a few feet of the <br/>
trail.  Someone made a point of finding our boxes and emailing us <br/>
that they violated their policy when, in my opinion, they could have <br/>
better used their time picking up trash.  Also, since there's a <br/>
difference of opinion, should we concentrate more on about what's <br/>
good about letterboxing instead of what's not good about geocaching? <br/>

&gt; spot education to prevent the same sort of problem from happening <br/>
again.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MIKE: MUCH AS I DO IN EL PASO NOW.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lucy:  That's how we know it will work - because YOU'VE made it <br/>
work there!<br/>
&gt; It's a bit of a jump, but these may be the sorts of measures that <br/>
allow us<br/>
&gt; freedom.  We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means <br/>
we all have<br/>
&gt; to be accountable to each other.   The problem here is that the <br/>
folks who<br/>
&gt; are planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the standards <br/>
we agree<br/>
&gt; to, and we have to account for that.<br/>

&gt; MIKE: THE FOREST USING LETTERBOXES TO DRAW VISITORS IS A GOOD <br/>
IDEA.  KNOWING<br/>

&gt; Lucy: I would think that's the concept that the discussion should <br/>
be brought<br/>
&gt; back to after any other point is made.  "We can help each other".  <br/>
I wonder<br/>

<p>These are all very good comments. I have been taking a cautious <br/>approach. You can argue with the umpire, but if he doesnt' like <br/>what you have to say, he has the authority to throw you out of the <br/>game, whether you are right or not. In Texas letterboxing, we have 
<br/>some very talented and experienced people, and if you think the <br/>aggressive approach is better, I yield to your negotiating <br/>experience. If we're going to do that, I suggest we come up with a <br/>comprehensive response. Barefoot Lucy, since you are obviously our

<br/>should probably be done this week, since he said they should have a <br/>policy written by September 1. What do you think? Should we let <br/>him know that we are looking to making letterboxing an approved <br/>activity, like camping or hiking, rather than something requiring a

<br/>trail. Someone made a point of finding our boxes and emailing us <br/>that they violated their policy when, in my opinion, they could have <br/>better used their time picking up trash. Also, since there's a <br/>difference of opinion, should we concentrate more on about what's

<br/>a LB, but<br/>&gt; it is less likely, especially if the clues are well-written.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; MIKE: ACTUALLY - I REALLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF DIFFERENCE HERE. IN <br/>MOST CASES<br/>&gt; THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY ROCKS TO HIDE IT UNDER.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: You gotta be kidding, right? Maybe there are only so many <br/>rocks, but<br/>&gt; there are millions of pine trees it could be behind!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ************************************************
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: Here's another difference between letterboxing and <br/>geocaching. We<br/>&gt; talk. Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and <br/>their means<br/>&gt; of disseminating information is not as efficient as ours. We have 
<br/>the<br/>&gt; national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and <br/>Houston,<br/>&gt; we have regional lists.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; MIKE: I HAVE TO DIFFER HERE. THERE ARE PROBABLY MORE GEOCACHERS <br/>IN THE<br/>
&gt; GEOCACHING FORMS AND MORE GEOCACHING FORUMS THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE. <br/>THERE ARE<br/>&gt; STATE AND LOCAL GROUPS AS WELL AS MORE THAN ONE NATIONAL GROUP. <br/>NOT ALL<br/>&gt; CACHERS BELONG OR PARTICIPATE. NEITHER DO ALL BOXERS.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: Again, you're right. You can't say ALL or NONE (but I <br/>didn't). What<br/>&gt; I find most interesting about your comment is that about every six <br/>months I<br/>&gt; google for lists and forums for geocaching and all I come up with 
<br/>are the<br/>&gt; Groundspeak forums, or Groundspeak-like forums. I have a horrible <br/>time with<br/>&gt; those - I don't know why - but maybe when things slow down again <br/>(if they<br/>&gt; ever do), I'll try them again.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; *************************<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: If we play on our effective communication, and if we <br/>do "education"<br/>&gt; on the lists sometimes (and since we are talking about state <br/>
parks, I<br/>&gt; suggest using the state list  this one), we can point to the fact <br/>that we<br/>&gt; keep our members up and running on best practices  i.e. not <br/>placing boxes<br/>&gt; in such a way as there is only one way in and one way out. 
<br/>Perhaps we can<br/>&gt; make a list of critical topics and discuss one a month, or have <br/>one person<br/>&gt; lead a discussion of them ( i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be <br/>willing to<br/>&gt; lead a discussion of LNT).
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; MIKE: IMPORTANT POINT. NOT EVERYONE IS ON THIS LIST. LIKE I HAD <br/>ONE<br/>&gt; CACHER DIG HOLES AROUND MY FAKE CACTUS - CAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW AND <br/>DIDN'T<br/>&gt; PARTICIPATE.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: Yep. BUT - by promoting education, we can express to them 
<br/>our<br/>&gt; commitment to "doing it right" and to playing by the rules so that <br/>maybe<br/>&gt; their rules can be a little looser if we are going to work to <br/>bring our<br/>&gt; group to the highest level possible. I think it's far more 
<br/>important to<br/>&gt; stress to "them" that not all letterboxers are in the right place <br/>to get the<br/>&gt; education, but that the ones who are on board with them, provided <br/>they don't<br/>&gt; get too screwy with their demands.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ***************************<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy: THEN  if we had one park or one person who agreed to be the<br/>&gt; letterboxing liaison, so that if they could not reach a box owner <br/>they could<br/>
&gt; contact that person who will try to get in touch with the owner <br/>through<br/>&gt; other means, or will come get the offending box, or will arrange <br/>for someone<br/>&gt; else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to loosening the 
<br/>rules for<br/>&gt; us. I think though, that we cannot put too much on the liaison  <br/>it has to<br/>&gt; be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" thing. But if the liaison is <br/>unable to reach<br/>&gt; the owner and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a 
<br/>box, he can<br/>&gt; contact the park and say "no luck here either  chunk it" and we <br/>can do some<br/>&gt; spot education to prevent the same sort of problem from happening <br/>again.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; MIKE: MUCH AS I DO IN EL PASO NOW.

&gt; &gt; &gt; talk. Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and<br/>
&gt; &gt; their means<br/>

have<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I find most interesting about your comment is that about every <br/>
six<br/>
&gt; &gt; months I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; google for lists and forums for geocaching and all I come up <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Groundspeak forums, or Groundspeak-like forums. I have a <br/>
horrible<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; *************************<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy: If we play on our effective communication, and if we<br/>
&gt; &gt; do "education"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the lists sometimes (and since we are talking about state<br/>
&gt; &gt; parks, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; suggest using the state list  this one), we can point to the <br/>
fact<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; keep our members up and running on best practices  i.e. not<br/>
&gt; &gt; placing boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in such a way as there is only one way in and one way out.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Perhaps we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; make a list of critical topics and discuss one a month, or have<br/>
&gt; &gt; one person<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lead a discussion of them ( i.e. since I teach LNT, I would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lead a discussion of LNT).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MIKE: IMPORTANT POINT. NOT EVERYONE IS ON THIS LIST. LIKE I HAD<br/>
&gt; &gt; ONE<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; CACHER DIG HOLES AROUND MY FAKE CACTUS - CAUSE HE DIDN'T KNOW <br/>
AND<br/>
&gt; &gt; DIDN'T<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; PARTICIPATE.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy: Yep. BUT - by promoting education, we can express to them<br/>
&gt; &gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; commitment to "doing it right" and to playing by the rules so <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their rules can be a little looser if we are going to work to<br/>
&gt; &gt; bring our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; group to the highest level possible. I think it's far more<br/>
&gt; &gt; important to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stress to "them" that not all letterboxers are in the right <br/>
place<br/>
&gt; &gt; to get the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; education, but that the ones who are on board with them, <br/>
provided<br/>
&gt; &gt; they don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get too screwy with their demands.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ***************************<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy: THEN  if we had one park or one person who agreed to be <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing liaison, so that if they could not reach a box <br/>
owner<br/>
&gt; &gt; they could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; contact that person who will try to get in touch with the owner<br/>
&gt; &gt; through<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other means, or will come get the offending box, or will <br/>
arrange<br/>
&gt; &gt; for someone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; else to pick it up, they might be more amenable to loosening <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; rules for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; us. I think though, that we cannot put too much on the <br/>
liaison <br/>
&gt; &gt; it has to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; be a "TRY" thing, not a "WILL" thing. But if the liaison is<br/>
&gt; &gt; unable to reach<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the owner and unable to handle a box or arrange for handling a<br/>
&gt; &gt; box, he can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; contact the park and say "no luck here either  chunk it" and <br/>
we<br/>
&gt; &gt; can do some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spot education to prevent the same sort of problem from <br/>
happening<br/>
&gt; &gt; again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MIKE: MUCH AS I DO IN EL PASO NOW.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy: That's how we know it will work - because YOU'VE made it<br/>
&gt; &gt; work there!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It's a bit of a jump, but these may be the sorts of measures <br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; allow us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; freedom. We are in a sense agreeing to self-police, which means<br/>
&gt; &gt; we all have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be accountable to each other. The problem here is that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; folks who<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; are planting but not on the lists may not be meeting the <br/>
standards<br/>
&gt; &gt; we agree<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to, and we have to account for that.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ****************<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; MIKE: THE FOREST USING LETTERBOXES TO DRAW VISITORS IS A GOOD<br/>
&gt; &gt; IDEA. KNOWING<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; THE TEXAS BUDGET, THAT SHOULD BE PUSHED.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy: I would think that's the concept that the discussion <br/>
should<br/>
&gt; &gt; be brought<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back to after any other point is made. "We can help each <br/>
other".<br/>
&gt; &gt; I wonder<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - if we were to pass a petition around for BT to use, would <br/>
that be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; beneficial? Hmmm...<br/>

<p><span>MIKE:  ALL TRUE IN A GENERAL SORT OF WAY.  
  SOME GEOCACHERS WRITE GOOD CLUES.  SOME LETTERBOXERS COULD USE 
  LESSONS.</span></p>
<p><span>Lucy:  That's a given.  Never can we say ALL geocachers and 
  NO letterboxers.  And the coolest caches I've found were the ones that 
  got me there and then talked me in.</span></p><span class="q">
<p>************<wbr/>*********<wbr/>*********<wbr/>*********<wbr/>**</p>
<p>Lucy:  With letterboxing, GOOD clues bring 
  you right on in to an exact location.<span>  </span>This isn't to say 
  that the same thing can't happen with a LB, but it is less likely, especially 
  if the clues are well-written. </p></span>
<p><span>MIKE: ACTUALLY - I REALLY DON'T SEE A LOT OF 
  DIFFERENCE HERE.  IN MOST CASES THERE ARE ONLY SO MANY ROCKS TO HIDE IT 
  UNDER.</span></p>
<p><span>Lucy:  You gotta be kidding, right?  Maybe there are only 
  so many rocks, but there are millions of pine trees it could be 
  behind!</span></p>
<p><span>************<wbr/>*********<wbr/>*********<wbr/>*********<wbr/>*********</span></p><span class="q">
<p>Lucy: Here's another difference between 
  letterboxing and geocaching.<span>  </span>We talk.<span>   
  </span>Yes, they talk too, but they talk more face-to-face and their means of 
  disseminating information is not as efficient as ours. <span>  </span>We 
  have the national list, the newboxers list, the state list, and in DFW and 
  Houston, we have regional lists. <span>  </span></p></span>
<p><span>MIKE: I HAVE TO DIFFER HERE.  THERE ARE 
  PROBABLY MORE GEOCACHERS IN THE GEOCACHING FORMS AND MORE GEOCACHING FORUMS 
  THAN YOU CAN IMAGINE.  THERE ARE STATE AND LOCAL GROUPS AS WELL AS MORE 
  THAN ONE NATIONAL GROUP.  NOT ALL CACHERS BELONG OR PARTICIPATE.  
  NEITHER DO ALL BOXERS. </span></p>
<p><span>Lucy: Again, you're right.  You can't say ALL or NONE (but I 
  didn't).  What I find most interesting about your comment is that about 
  every six months I google for lists and forums for geocaching and all I come 
  up with are the Groundspeak forums, or Groundspeak-<wbr/>like forums.  I 
  have a horrible time with those - I don't know why - but maybe when things 
  slow down again (if they ever do), I'll try them again. </span></p>
<p><span>************<wbr/>*********<wbr/>****</span></p><span class="q">
