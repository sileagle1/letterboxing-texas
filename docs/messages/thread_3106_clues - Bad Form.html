&gt;Isn't it considered bad form to publish clues to other people's <br/>

<div>I think that's a great idea, so that we can preserve some of the history of letterboxing in our state! Maybe we should put the clues to the <em>first </em>letterbox in our state in the file also - although it has long since disappeared - just as a historical note.</div>

<div>I think there is a big difference between broadly publishing clues to a box without the planter's permission and archiving the clues to a historic box in a place that only those known to share the hobby can reach.  I think that even if you did what you did without Eoghan's permission, he would certainly appreciate your intent and the forum you chose to exercise it, as well as the diligence you practiced in trying to reach him for permission.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In fact, thinking about Eoghan's boxes, I find it interesting how they have effectively become WOM clues that are passed WITHOUT the owner's involvement.  That has to be a sort of interesting twist, doesn't it?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think that publishing clues in the media without permission is seriously bad form and Puddle Splasher, I think you would be doing Cadenza a courtesy to let her know it was published and send her a copy.  Maybe she knew beforehand and maybe she didn't, but in any case, I'll bet she would like to have a copy of the article!
