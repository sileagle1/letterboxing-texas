It's killing me.  ;-p<br/>

Tut, tut, looks like rain out there, but I think Teepsman and I are <br/>

the past four years and rave about it.  He's a serious gardener.<br/>

<div>Hey Mo! If you decide to stop at one of those Whataburgers (one right up 75 in McKinney, you know), give me a call and I'll meet you over there - even if it is 3:00 a.m.</div>
