I've had a couple of inquiries about the status of our Texas T-shirt<br/>
order, so I thought I'd answer on the list in case anyone else was<br/>
wondering!  I phoned the company on Friday and they said the order was a<br/>
little delayed because of an onslaught of back-to-school orders. <br/>
I'll keep on them this week, and let you all know!<br/>
<br/>
Only a couple of you still need to send in a check - I know this is a<br/>
busy time for all of us who have kids, but I'd appreciate it as soon as<br/>
possible. I have written to remind those folks, so if you haven't had a<br/>
nagging email from me, then I have your payment!!! <br/>

SHIRT ORDERING INFO: As far as the shirts go, let's wait &amp; make sure<br/>
this first batch turns out to everyone's satisfaction! (Yikes! I'm<br/>
crossing my fingers you all are happy with them!)<br/>
It took a while to research the best (cheapest, but most reliable) place<br/>
to have them made &amp; then I had to start again from ground zero when the<br/>
first manufacturer apparently had some delivery problems.<br/>
I also stalled a little while because we kept adding new folks to this<br/>
list - which is GREAT NEWS! We went from an order of 35 shirts to 50<br/>
shirts.<br/>
<br/>
At this point (assuming these shirts meet approval!) all we have to do<br/>
is assemble an order of 6 shirts minimum at a time to submit, because<br/>
the design screen is made. <br/>
<br/>
Soooo- the bottom line is - as soon as everybody receives their shirts &amp;<br/>
we get some positive feedback, I'll offer to put in another order. By<br/>
that time this back-to-school rush will be over and the turnaround time<br/>
should really be 10 days.<br/>
