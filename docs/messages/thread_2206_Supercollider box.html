<div>Your memory is right on - gosh, I hadn't thought about that in ages!  That was really funny - after the ER visit was done anyway!  Of course, she was the same kiddo that rode her three wheeler down the stairs when she was a couple of years old (don't ask WHY I had the three wheeler upstairs in the first place - it had to have been one of those first child failures to think ahead).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That girl is a tough as nails die hard soccer goalie - and a dancer.  A camper/hiker/outdoorsman extraordinaire - and a makeup queen.  She's been on her own now for 8 months and struggling to make things work, and I'm really proud of her.  She finally got a pretty decent job working at Dillard's - and she learned she has to wear panty hose.  She called her old mom yesterday to remind her how to wear hose.  The day before she called to ask what toads eat.  Ya just never know what is going to happen with that girl next.
