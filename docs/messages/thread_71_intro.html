                    <div class="plaintext-content">hello!  We've been letterboxing for only a few months now, my <br/>
husband and two sons (6 and 7) and I.  And the dog ;)  We have only <br/>
been to look for the ones at Dana Peak Park in Harker Heights, <br/>
though there is another at Chalk Ridge (Stillhouse Hollow Lake) I <br/>
hope to look for soon.  It is a no-dog area and it closes every time <br/>
the terrorist alert goes up, so we haven't been there in years <br/>
although I remember it being a very pretty trail.  <br/>
<br/>
It is fun to see the names of people whose stamps I've seen in the <br/>
notebooks (like Baby Bear and Silver Eagle).  We met a Geocacher <br/>
while out this weekend, so I'm curious to look into that too.<br/>

Hopefully we'll be able to hide one ourselves before too long!<br/>

You just missed a great Lb picnic last weekend at Bastrop State Park. <br/>
You could have met Baby Bear and Silver Eagle in person!   <br/>

We also homeschool but live near Houston (as you can see by our trail <br/>

myself.  I call myself Texas Gal and I live in Belton.  I am real new <br/>
to letterboxing but find myself enjoying getting out and around in the <br/>
different parks with my 13 year old daughter who goes by "crazy bout <br/>
dragons". We are not real outdoorsy types but do enjoy the hiking and <br/>
seeing the wildlife.  On our first outing we saw a deer and some kind <br/>
of snake and scared up a fawn out of the bushes and so now we are <br/>
hooked.  We travel and box alot with Tx dragonfly so often you will <br/>
see all of our stamps in the log books.  We have requested the weekend <br/>
of the gathering off but at my office we never know until the last <br/>
minute whether or not what we request is what we actually get.  Makes <br/>
planning a life difficult. Hope to get to meet some of you at the <br/>
gathering if we get to attend.  Bear with us we are still learning all <br/>
the lingo and rules<br/>

Just so you know - not only is there a letterboxing<br/>
lingo, but there is a Texas letterboxing lingo as well<br/>
- a dialect I guess you could call it!<br/>
<br/>
Do a search in the archived messages on phrases like<br/>
LSS, BEA, GG...and make it a point to look for Silver<br/>
Eagle's and Baby Bear's story moments.  And if you see<br/>
reference to something you don't get, just ask!<br/>

<div>Hello,</div>
<div>We are a family of 3, and we live in East Texas - Tyler. We've been in this 
area for about a year. I recently came across an article in an old Family Fun 
magazine which piqued our interest in letterboxing. I visited the site listed 
(letterboxing.org) and found there quite a few right here in our neck of 
the woods. We thought we'd give it a go. So far it's been great getting us 
out and about. For most of the time we've lived here, we haven't ventured out 
much to "see the sights". We find we are now planning our jaunts around 
letterboxing opportunities - which is great! DS has had a ball carving stamps 
(although we haven't tackled planting any - yet). </div>
<div>We're looking forward to finding more!</div>
<div>Thanks,</div>

<div>Welcome to the Texas Letterboxing group JKC! You are lucky because there are some really great boxes in your neck of the woods. Last March, we had a Tx Letterboxers Gathering in Rusk and there are many boxes hidden in the Jacksonville, Rusk, Palestine area. I plan to get back down to that area later this fall to do some more boxing.</div>

<div>Does she really mean "12-step" or could she possible be referring to 12 paces? There is a difference, right? Glad to have you letterboxing in Texas with us!</div>

think you mentioned where you are from, and that might be helpful if <br/>
someone were interested in speaking to your group of Girl Scouts.  As <br/>
for the personal stamp, most people do make their own, but some are <br/>
store-bought and some folks design their own and have them made.  Any <br/>
of these methods will work just fine.  You might want to start with a <br/>
purchased stamp, then later carve your own.  This is a good place to <br/>
ask questions.  Letterboxers tend to be very friendly and willing to <br/>
help newcomers.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Howdy Misty, glad you took my suggestion and joined this group.  If I <br/>
remember correctly you are from Garland, so I would be surprised if <br/>
there weren't some boxes near you.  Hopefully some of the Girl Scout <br/>
Leaders on this list will chime in with suggestions and maybe some <br/>
local letterboxers can find the time to visit your troop.  If not, I <br/>
have a few suggestions. <br/>
<br/>
Several years ago I talked with a small group of Girl Scouts about <br/>
letterboxing by meeting at a park where one of my boxes was hidden.  <br/>
I started by explaining the concept of letterboxing, supplies needed <br/>
and even how to carve if they wanted to try.  Then I gave them the <br/>
clues to my box and we went looking for it.  The challenge with a <br/>
group is that it is hard to be stealthy when getting the box, so that <br/>
is why I chose one of mine to find, since if it became compromised I <br/>
could replace it myself.  Probably an even better plan would be to <br/>
place a box specifically for your troop to find.  This could be <br/>
something as simple as a store-bought stamp in a lock-n-lock box with <br/>
a notepad.  You could choose a local park and hide the box ahead of <br/>
time, print the clues, then hand them out when you meet.<br/>
<br/>
As far as basic supplies needed for your troop, you will need <br/>
personal stamps, logbooks (unlined is best) and ink pad.  As Boots <br/>
said, the stamps can be store-bought, and you could even go with just <br/>
one stamp and logbook for the whole troop.  Most girls will want to <br/>
choose there own stamp based on their personality, so I suggest going <br/>
to a craft store like Michael's and letting them pick out stamps by <br/>
looking at what is available.  You could also get your logbooks and <br/>
ink pads here (black or other colors).  Based on their stamp, they <br/>
will then pick a trail name (or vice-versa).  When they find the box <br/>
using the clues, they will stamp their personal stamp into the box <br/>
logbook and write their trail name and date, then stamp the box stamp <br/>
into their personal logbook with it's name and date.  I would stress <br/>
things like "Leave No Trace" and respect for the placer by being <br/>
stealthy when retrieving and replacing the box, and make sure the box <br/>
is rehidden better than found.  Many boxes go missing because of <br/>
careless finders and that is a crucial lesson to learn early.  But <br/>
most of all, keep it fun and make sure everyone has a good time.<br/>

<br/>
Glad you decided to try letterboxing. I am warning you, though, it is <br/>
adective. Silver Eagle gave you some good advice and suggestions. We <br/>
found a letterbox that was planted by some girlscouts in Wills Point <br/>
in June. It is called "Lester Park Letterbox". You can look it up on <br/>
Letterboxing.org or AtlasQuest.com. On Letterboxing.org, there is a <br/>
place at the top where it lists the planter. It says (contact the <br/>
Placer) I would like to suggest that you contact the leader (the <br/>
placer) of that group if you need to ask some questions about the <br/>
girlscouts letterboxing. Maybe she could answer your questions. She <br/>
seemed very nice when I contacted her. Lois<br/>
