Well you all, a letterboxing miracle happened this afternoon.  A <br/>
neighbor of mine from a couple streets back brought a package to my <br/>
door which had been mistakenly delivered to her house...IN NOVEMBER!  <br/>
I opened it, and it was the Texas PLB from monkeytoes!  Seems that <br/>
happy homeschoolers had mailed it in November, and somehow it wound <br/>
up at this woman's house.  She had been in the hospital having hip <br/>
replacement surgery, and then at her sister's house to recover until <br/>
just last week.  While she was gone one of her neighbors collected <br/>
her mail, and the PBL!  Who knows how many unknowing hands the little <br/>
package went through.  I am going to sit and go through the logbook, <br/>
stamp in, and I will send it on its way.  So monkeytoes, if you were <br/>
wondering what had happened to your unbelieveable stamp, now you <br/>
know!  It will be on its way soon!  -Mother of four<br/>

Hey, That's great!  This PLB thing is harder than people think.  I'm <br/>
glad you have such a nice neighbor.  I wonder if mine would do the <br/>
same?  Great save.<br/>
