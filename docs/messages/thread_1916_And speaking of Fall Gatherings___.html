&gt; <br/>
Well...I know this is kinda out of the way, but West Texas has ZERO <br/>
boxes!  And...there is a letterboxer who lives in Midland who would <br/>
probably be happy to maintain boxes if someone planted them!<br/>
<br/>
However, a word of caution...it is a LONG drive out there!  I'm <br/>
estimating that Midland is about 5 to 5 1/2 hours from Dallas/Fort <br/>
Worth.  And that's I-20 all the way!<br/>
<br/>
Just a thought.  <br/>
<br/>
Also..Mike from El Paso would probably be happy for some company.  <br/>
Although....Midland is about 6 hours from El Paso driving straight <br/>
across I-20!  Super long drive!<br/>
