<br/>Since I am new ay planting boxes I was wondering if this was common...<br/>
 <br/>
I have planted 3 boxes (The 4 C Trail, Go Crusaders!, Flying on the Trail).<br/>
 <br/>
Flying on the Trail was planted in Janurary of this year. It was hidden under a pile of rocks. About a month later it was missing. Found twice.<br/>
 <br/>
Go Crusaders! was planted in March of this year. It was hidden in a rockwall under a rock. About a month later it was missing. Found once and on the day I planted it.<br/>
 <br/>
The 4 C Trail is the only one I know of not missing. It has never been found and I haven't made time to check it.<br/>
 <br/>
I was wondering if this has happen to anyone elses boxes in my area? (Tyler, TX)<br/>
