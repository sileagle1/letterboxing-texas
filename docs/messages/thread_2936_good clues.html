Forestry  Looking Beyond the Trees <br/>
Connecticut State Forests - Seedling Letterbox Series Clues for Paugussett State Fores<br/>
Paugussett State Forest -<br/>
 the 25th State Forest<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Paugussett State Forest is approximately 2,000 acres and is located in Newtown. It consists of two main areas, the Upper and Lower Blocks.  The Upper Block is roughly 800 acres and was acquired in 1969 by the State through eminent domain for $1,100,000. The Lower Block is about 1,200 acres and has been acquired in phases since the 1940s. <br/>
The Forest is managed for sawtimber, firewood, wildlife habitat, and recreational activities such as hiking, hunting, bird-watching, and cross-country skiing. <br/>
Description: The letterbox is in the Upper Block of the Forest. Estimated time for round trip is 30 minutes. <br/>
Clues: The parking area for the Upper Block is at the end of Echo Valley Road in Newtown. Echo Valley Road is a dirt road that dead-ends in the Forest. You will see a brown State DEP sign at the intersection of Sanford Road and Echo Valley Road that directs you to the parking area. </div>

and recreational activities such as hiking, hunting, bird-watching, <br/>
and cross-country skiing. <br/>
&gt; Description: The letterbox is in the Upper Block of the Forest. <br/>
Estimated time for round trip is 30 minutes. <br/>
&gt; Clues: The parking area for the Upper Block is at the end of Echo <br/>
Valley Road in Newtown. Echo Valley Road is a dirt road that dead-<br/>
ends in the Forest. You will see a brown State DEP sign at the <br/>
intersection of Sanford Road and Echo Valley Road that directs you <br/>
to the parking area. <br/>
&gt; From the parking area, walk down the gravel woods road past the <br/>
green gate. This road is called Brody Road, named after Polly Brody, <br/>
a former member of the Newtown Conservation Commission.  Ms. Brody <br/>
was influential in convincing the State to acquire this property. <br/>
Follow Brody Road for about 1,000 feet to where a dirt road forks <br/>
off to the right. Take the right fork for about 750 feet.  If you go <br/>
too far, you will reach the intersection of the Blue Trail on the <br/>
right; if so, just backtrack about 100 feet. <br/>
&gt; At this point, on the left side of the road, there is an opening <br/>
in the stone wall. You will see a stand of tall, straight trees <br/>
about 6" in diameter. These trees are smaller than the surrounding <br/>
forest because this area was clearcut in 1984. After the timber <br/>
harvest, seed from nearby tulip poplar trees germinated in the <br/>
increased sunlight that reached the forest floor, and now we have a <br/>
young grove of healthy tulip poplars. <br/>
&gt; Shortly after the clearcut, the nuts of black walnuts were also <br/>
planted in the opening.  Very few of these survived, but there are <br/>
two walnuts that are growing well and competing with the fast <br/>
growing poplars. Can you find them? (Hint: the bark of the walnuts <br/>
is much rougher than the smooth-barked poplars. Also, a poplar tree <br/>
next to one of the walnuts was cut so you can count the growth rings <br/>
on the stump and determine the age of the tree). <br/>
&gt; The letterbox is located at the base of one of the two walnuts.<br/>
&gt;<br/>

<div>When I moved back to Texas a couple of years ago, I had thought about going to the "powers that be" in the state and seeing if I could work with them to develop such a program for the parks in our state. Of course, life happens, and I never did pursue the idea. You're a diplomatic guy, Boots... maybe you should take on the challenge! Our Texas group could certainly work with them to develop stamps for each of their parks, and provide the boxes, etc. to get them started. It always seemed logical to me that the Forestry Dept in Ct used letterboxing as a means to inform the public about the work as well as problems faced by their department. By hiding these stamps in each of their forests, they brought people into the forests, educated them, made them more environmentally aware, and in turn many more citizens are protective and supportive of the work they do. Now that's something our parks need! Because they select the location for the box, and move it every couple of years, it doesn't have a negative impact on a sensitive area. Just a thought.</div>

                    <html><body><div>Mike, I understand where you're coming from (yeah, all the way from El Paso with not even a mountain top view of our state capitol).  You, more than any of us here probably, can speak from experience.  Here's my question though:  what happens when the locals no longer have the leeway to "interpret" the policy?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the case of the park in your area, and in the case of Mission Tejas recently, the locals choose to work together with us instead of prohibiting us.  Then there are cases like McKinney Falls, where the locals have interpreted the policy in such a restrictive manner that no one but dedicated locals can plant there, and in Fairfield, where they apparently went in and yanked every box in the park without so much as a notice to the owners.  Who is to say that tomorrow they won't all play musical rangers and every park will have new rules?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is certainly more appealing to work with rangers face to face, and perhaps we should organize and actively do that, but I think we also need to be thinking about the eventuality of strongly worded, heavily enforced policy.  How can we get in their and guide it?  What CAN we do?  I do believe we would eventually have to face Austin ourselves, but how can we prepare?

<br/>&gt; the 25th State Forest<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Paugussett State Forest is approximately 2,000 acres and is <br/>located in Newtown. It consists of two main areas, the Upper and <br/>Lower Blocks. The Upper Block is roughly 800 acres and was acquired 
<br/>in 1969 by the State through eminent domain for $1,100,000. The <br/>Lower Block is about 1,200 acres and has been acquired in phases <br/>since the 1940s. <br/>&gt; The Forest is managed for sawtimber, firewood, wildlife habitat, 
<br/>and recreational activities such as hiking, hunting, bird-watching, <br/>and cross-country skiing. <br/>&gt; Description: The letterbox is in the Upper Block of the Forest. <br/>Estimated time for round trip is 30 minutes. 
<br/>&gt; Clues: The parking area for the Upper Block is at the end of Echo <br/>Valley Road in Newtown. Echo Valley Road is a dirt road that dead-<br/>ends in the Forest. You will see a brown State DEP sign at the <br/>intersection of Sanford Road and Echo Valley Road that directs you 
<br/>to the parking area. <br/>&gt; From the parking area, walk down the gravel woods road past the <br/>green gate. This road is called Brody Road, named after Polly Brody, <br/>a former member of the Newtown Conservation Commission. Ms. Brody 
<br/>was influential in convincing the State to acquire this property. <br/>Follow Brody Road for about 1,000 feet to where a dirt road forks <br/>off to the right. Take the right fork for about 750 feet. If you go <br/>too far, you will reach the intersection of the Blue Trail on the 
<br/>right; if so, just backtrack about 100 feet. <br/>&gt; At this point, on the left side of the road, there is an opening <br/>in the stone wall. You will see a stand of tall, straight trees <br/>about 6" in diameter. These trees are smaller than the surrounding 
<br/>forest because this area was clearcut in 1984. After the timber <br/>harvest, seed from nearby tulip poplar trees germinated in the <br/>increased sunlight that reached the forest floor, and now we have a <br/>young grove of healthy tulip poplars. 
<br/>&gt; Shortly after the clearcut, the nuts of black walnuts were also <br/>planted in the opening. Very few of these survived, but there are <br/>two walnuts that are growing well and competing with the fast <br/>growing poplars. Can you find them? (Hint: the bark of the walnuts 
<br/>is much rougher than the smooth-barked poplars. Also, a poplar tree <br/>next to one of the walnuts was cut so you can count the growth rings <br/>on the stump and determine the age of the tree). <br/>&gt; The letterbox is located at the base of one of the two walnuts.

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">I think I told the story of how one Geocacher started 
the whole flap.  That was in El Paso.  It is NEVER good when the 
owners/caretakers get involved.  It is easy to say NO.  It can be 
dangerous to say YES.  Nobody wants to stick a neck 
out.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">The reason that the "official" Texas policy seems 
slanted toward Geocaching is because once it became clear that the hobby wasn't 
going to fly under the radar anymore - Geocachers in Austin started a campaign 
with TPWD to work it out.  While the "rules" are somewhat restrictive, it 
is better than a flat-out ban!  Some choice.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">NOTE:  Geocaching has one rule that letterboxing 
does not, and it uncomplicates one of the problems letterboxing is going to 
have.  Vacation caches are NOT allowed.  If you cannot reasonably 
check on a cache do not place it.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">That said, you will always run in to "local 
interpitation" of the laws.  This is why Texans traveling thru Texas with a 
handgun in the car are routinely arrested even though traveling with a loaded 
handgun is legal in Texas - even without a license.  They "leave it up to 
the judge".  The judge in this case is the local park 
superintendent.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">I have been lucky in El Paso.  I am somewhat 
famous (notorious more likely) around this desert.  You-all know I am an 
outdoorsman.  I often call into a local Saturday talk show about the 
history and doings of El Paso.  They know me as Mike on the Mountain.  
They enjoy hearing where I am hiking that day.  I volunteer in the park, I 
guide hikes and clean up trash.... help the rangers etc.  So they know me 
and work with me.  I kinda volunteered to be the Geocaching contact for the 
park.  I did the same for the two letterboxes that are not mine in the 
park.  They all know of me, in all 4 state parks even though I only really 
volunteer in the local one.  And you-all remember the search for Hueco 
Tanks #2.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">The problem Letterboxers are experiencing now is 
something you-all are happy about.  GROWTH!  However - the larger the 
airplane the sooner the radar picks it up.  Like it or not - Letterboxing 
is now on the radar.  What happens now is up to a lot of things.  My 
best suggestion is to get to know the rangers in your local parks.  Foster 
a friendship.  Explain letterboxing to a ranger.  Let them come along 
on a hunt.  And be seen picking up trash in their park.  Become known 
as a good park visitor.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">If everyone took the time to do this in their local 
park, and vowed to "keep an eye" on the local letterboxes even if they don't 
belong to them, it might still work out.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">How to approach others above the local level?  I 
have found the best way is to start at the local level and win them over.  
Most of the higher-ups will make a decision when forced into it.  But they 
are somewhat reluctant to tell the local rangers how to run the park.  And 
if it does get kicked up, it helps to have the local crew put in a good word for 
you too.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">Maybe not what you wanted to hear.  But this is 
how I am existing out here.  The local rangers love having me and Parker 
patrolling the park.  With 37 square miles of mountain range and 3 rangers, 
they need all the trustworthy reliable help they can get.  I am 
trustworthy, reliable, and loyal.  I would make a good dog.  
&lt;grin&gt;  I wear camouflage when I hike, and I carry a radio.  I 
can be seen if I want to be seen.  But sometimes it pays to remain 
stealthy, and call in the report, then follow the lawbreaker until the Rangers 
get to them.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="252125323-18072007">My suggestion, start local.  Everyone pick a park 
and make a friend.  Do what you already do, watch out for your local boxes 
even if they are not yours.  The lucky fact is that I do both Letterboxing 
and Geocaching - so I cover both worlds.  Makes it easier on the 
rangers.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span class="252125323-18072007">Think it over.  Hope it helps.</span></div><!-- Converted from text/plain format --><br/>
