<br/>
I had thought my family was going to go down south for<br/>
Thanksgiving, but it looks like the guys are going on<br/>
a long hike, so my daughter and I are at loose ends. <br/>
I'm thinking we may head up your way for two or three<br/>
days.  Can you recommend some boxes?  Ideally no<br/>
extended hiking - she had another wreck this weekend<br/>
and I don't think she'll be up to serious hiking by<br/>
then.  I plan on coming up through Greenville and<br/>
possibly heading up to Denton briefly (to get that<br/>
infamous box that requires a Miata among other<br/>
things!), so I would prefer to stay to the North and<br/>
East of Dallas, unless you tell me there is a "can't<br/>
miss" one somewhere that I need to go out of my way to<br/>
get.  I'm looking at this huge list of boxes up there<br/>
and I can't imagine going up there and not getting<br/>
them all, but I have to be practical!<br/>
<br/>
I did notice that you changed the name of your Pretty<br/>
in Pink to Mary Kay.  I really wish you would keep the<br/>
Pretty in Pink name - I am not going to replace mine<br/>
and I did change the name.  I don't think it was found<br/>
even once.  It was one of my first boxes and badly<br/>
placed, so it was doomed before we ever walked away. <br/>
Live and learn.<br/>
<br/>
Well, I'm supposed to be working on the Pinewood Derby<br/>
which is this weekend - guess I'd better get back to<br/>
it before our Cubmaster passes by and finds me<br/>
dawdling!<br/>
