                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found Great Texas Mosquito Festival.  A lovely stamp, gorgeous<br/>
logbook and a nice hiding spot overlooking Buffalo Bayou.  Overall, a<br/>
fantastic box I highly recommend.<br/>
<br/>
However, due I am sure to the recent deluge, the inside of the box was<br/>
sopping wet.  The logbook, double bagged, was dry as a bone.  But, I<br/>
suspect the box itself wasn't water-tight (every now and again you get<br/>
a lemon).  So, I replaced the container with a lock-n-lock box I had<br/>
in my pack.  But, my box wasn't camo-taped.  So, if someone is going<br/>
to find this great box (and I highly recommend you do), please bring<br/>
along some camo tape and add it to the container!<br/>
<br/>
It's like a progressive dinner, but for letterboxing.  Thanks.<br/>

ps--we also planted a new box today, called The Eagle Has Landed. <br/>
Clues are posted on AQ &amp; LBNA.<br/>

<div>MissMoon says thanks. &lt;s&gt; I saw sopping wet and went.eeeeeeeeek. lol Doncha just love lock &amp; lock? There's one called snapware too, which seems to be just the same and work just as well. You can order them online as opposed to lock &amp; lock.</div>
