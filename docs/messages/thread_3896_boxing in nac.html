                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
Today we went out for a walk on this wonderful beautiful sunny warm (winter?) day.  We were just moseying around downtown and decided to check on a box that is there and we were so delighted to discover that a whole group of boxers had just found it yesterday!  And, these were names we did not recognize, even though they said "Nac".  It is really a fun delight to me, to have "cousins" out there in the world, whom I have not met, and may never meet, but still have something in common with.<br>
<br>
"having something in common with" complete strangers is a very gives-me-hope-for-the-world sort of feeing, I think.<br>
<br>
I love letterboxing!  :)<br>

I didn't really have that "shy with strangers" feeling. We had something in common so it was a very comfortable feeling.<br/><br/>Janet</span></span><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 255); font-weight: bold;"><span style="color: rgb(127, 0, 127);"><br/></span></span></td></tr></table><br/>
