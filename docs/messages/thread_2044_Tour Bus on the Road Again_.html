After a close call with a prairie fire in North  Richland Hills, the tour bus <br/>
stopped for awhile in Keller, then detoured to  Weatherford for its next <br/>
passenger: Oliver Loving, Dean of Texas Trail Drivers,  whose grave and historic <br/>
marker are in the Greenwood Cemetery (which is also  where you'll find the Tour <br/>
Bus).  <br/>
    To get there:  go to Weatherford to the Court  House (you can't miss <br/>
that!) and go north from the courthouse to Front  Street.   Turn right on Front <br/>
Street and enter the cemetery under  the old iron Greenwood Cemetery sign.  <br/>
Follow the road to the left around  the curve, stopping at Oliver Loving's grave <br/>
to read the historic marker and  check out the "Badge of Friendship" letterbox <br/>
placed there by the 4 Fitzs.   Continue on along that drive as it curves to an <br/>
intersection  where you'll go left a short way, then right a short distance.  <br/>
Watch  for the large Corn Littlefield monument and two large cedar trees near <br/>
the road,  with overgrown juniper shrubs and Johnson grass between them.   </div>
