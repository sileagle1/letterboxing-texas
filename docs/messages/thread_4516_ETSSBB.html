                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now hold on!  "innocent Baby Bears"?  May I remind you of who, in fact (or at least in suspicion) made me a ghost in the first place?  See "Murder at the Arboretum".  Who "Boiled IRA" at Telge Park?  Who "Burned IRA" at Palmetto SP?  Who fabricated a story called "I.R.A. Turkey" at Lost Maples? (That story BEARS reading!)  Now I can see that his cunning but devious nature has fooled you nice ladies, too.  Baby Bears are like baby snakes: they release all their venom due to a lack of maturity and possess a bent for mischief, all the while pretending to be cuddly and cute.  Oh, did I mention that he made up a story about my marriage to a slightly scorched 130 year old lady ghost just so he could make off with the wedding gifts?  I hope you didn't fall for that as well.  I would love to hunt him down, but bears happen to be protected by law in Texas.  Who made up that rule?  Obviously they haven't met the one that's been spotted in the Cypress woods. Anyway, bear meat isn't that good.  I only served that Bear Stew to y'all to raise a down payment on a new shotgun.  Never trust a bear.<br>

Of course you may join!  We will certainly let you know when the next meeting of the ETSSBB is.  Unfortunately, we may have to meet in secret so that certain clowns and ghosts don't find out about it in advance.  We don't want to put you in any danger.  <br>

&gt; &gt; Baby Bears. It has come to our attention that a certain ghost has taken to<br/>&gt; &gt; murdering innocent Baby Bears, using them as an ingredient in Bear Stew, and<br/>&gt; &gt; selling the stew for profit. This is outrageous, egregious, and all together<br/>
&gt; &gt; in bad taste. We sit in disbelief and horror that these types of acts can<br/>&gt; &gt; take place, with no consequences.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The charter members convened today in Kilgore, TX. Pictures of this<br/>
