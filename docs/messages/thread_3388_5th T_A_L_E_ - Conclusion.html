                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank You to everyone that could make it, and the wonderful food you <br/>
shared.   The event was a blast, and it was nice to get to spend time <br/>
talking to alot of you. Special thanks to Mr. Cobbler (LSS of BFL), <br/>
yum.   And to the winners of the Match Game, we enjoyed the Mead you <br/>
left behind at our campsite gathering!   <br/>
<br/>
Next year we plan on doing a ballot for "Letterbox of the Year - <br/>
2008", and will announce the winner at the event.  More details on <br/>
this will come later in the year.   I think all that have found the <br/>
following will agree that it deserved the 2007 award, so without <br/>
further delay, THE 2007 LETTERBOX OF THE YEAR goes to THE TEXIANS for <br/>
MURDER AT THE ARBORETUM.  I would have handed the certificate to the <br/>
winners at the event, but IMA Boxer stold it from me.  Anyway, <br/>
congradulations Texians for a great story and stamps.   <br/>
<br/>
One more thing.  While cleaning up I found some clues to boxes hidden <br/>
during event that said "only copy".   If anyone hid a box but does <br/>
not have their own clues to post it let me know and I may have them. <br/>
<br/>
Again, it was great to see you all, and hope to enjoy your company <br/>
again next year, or sooner on a trail somewhere.   <br/>

PS - Barefoot Lucy did snag the elusive Love Bunny. <br/>
