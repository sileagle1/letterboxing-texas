                    <html><body><p>What a lovely encounter, Origami. It's what makes letter boxing so very special. Regarding Zilker Park, several years ago AnnaBee planted a beautifully carved stamp box name Sakura in the Japanese garden area. It went missing. She recarved and replanted. It also went missing. I would encourage you to avoid the Botanical Garden. It is indeed very populated and often cleaned and plants (of the botanical variety) are redone and moved about. Plants (of the rubber medium variety) are very vulnerable there, in my opinion. </p><div>Wish I were more helpful.<br/><div>Other Austin boxer opinions?<br/><div><div>Bloomin Gramma Jo</div></div></div></div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>@Bloomin Gramma Jo - thanks for relaying AnnaBee's experience at ZBG!  My sense was that ZBG was just too well cared for and heavily visited to be a good planting - good to have confirmation.  And yes, meeting up with letterboxers while on the road is terrific fun!  Soto4 in Puyallup was wonderful - she has an amazing collection of retired stamps, plus she even set up a folding table in her front yard for ease of stamping.  Collecting her many Hello Kitty series of stamps was one of the highlights of our trip.</p><div><br/></div><div>@Silver Eagle - Thanks for the suggestion!  When I have some time I will head over to ANSC and check out the lay of the land.  </div><div><br/></div><div>Thanks!  Origami Hen</div></body></html>
