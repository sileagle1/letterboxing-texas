<div>So Janet, aren't you the contact person for Sprite's visit to Dallas? So what's up? Is she going to contact you when she is available to meet us at Uncle Julio's (sometime between Aug 9 - 15th) and you will let us know? I guess we could wait on Uncle's porch drinking margaritas starting around the 9th.</div>

<div>Okay.... I'm signed up and looking forward to it. I just announced to my husband that he will be in charge of babysitting our granddaughter for a few hours by himself since I had an EVENT to attend. We have her for five days while her parents are in Galveston, so he should be well trained by that afternoon on the care and feeding of a ten month old! Looking forward to meeting you.</div>
