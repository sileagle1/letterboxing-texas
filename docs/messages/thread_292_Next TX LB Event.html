BTW Monkeytoes & I have both sent boxes to the Monster Mash and my son<br>

I think you just need to make a date and hope that most people can come.<br>
There will never be a date that suits everyone.<br>
<br>
I'm ready to make our camping reservations. I'd be glad to send a check<br>
along to defray the initial cost.<br>

YIPEE!!!! I get to go to another LB event.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am ok with March 19. I think the reservations probably do need to be made<br>
now--or soon. As I need to reserve a campsite too, the sooner we know the<br>

My 2 cents...<br>
