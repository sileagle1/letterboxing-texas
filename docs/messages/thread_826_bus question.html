to put in the box? or do you mean how do you get the box if you are not <br>
FF? or something else?<br>
<br>
Don't give up on being a FF.  If it ends up floating around Houston for <br>
a while or coming back often, then more and more people will have the <br>
chance to get first on it (assuming the same people aren't going after <br>
it over and over again).<br>
<br>
As far as what you can do if you are not FF. . .well, really not much. <br>
. .unless you tag teamed with someone, paid someone off to stamp in <br>
when they have the box, followed them and hijacked the bus, stole it <br>
from their car/house/backpack, or some other creative endeavor. :p<br>
