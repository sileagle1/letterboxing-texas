<div>ok, so I have a question.  I thought of the supreme, must 
ride, has to be on a Texan bus passenger today when I should have been mopping 
the kitchen floor. So if one is not the first finder (which I'm quite sure I 
won't be) is there a way to get a "must ride" passenger on the bus?  I 
mean, a way other than a hijacking?  -Mother of

to put in the box? or do you mean how do you get the box if you are not <br/>
FF? or something else?<br/>
<br/>
Don't give up on being a FF.  If it ends up floating around Houston for <br/>
a while or coming back often, then more and more people will have the <br/>
chance to get first on it (assuming the same people aren't going after <br/>
it over and over again).<br/>
<br/>
As far as what you can do if you are not FF. . .well, really not much. <br/>
. .unless you tag teamed with someone, paid someone off to stamp in <br/>
when they have the box, followed them and hijacked the bus, stole it <br/>
from their car/house/backpack, or some other creative endeavor. :p<br/>
