logbooks?  I would love to spend a little time at the<br/>
gathering with someone who makes good ones.  Mine work<br/>
for the purpose and I've gotten pickier about paper<br/>
over time, but I would like to make better ones.  <br/>
<br/>
I've seen some I've liked in the wild, but looking at<br/>
logbooks wasn't really my focus at those moments, so I<br/>
didn't take the time to look at them well. <br/>
