<p>I love reading all this history and memories. It reminds me of a time when we had as much fun sitting at our computer screens sharing our adventures as we did actually letterboxing. The group was pretty small then, so after a day of letterboxing, we'd always come right home and share our sitrep, which quite often led to another round of fun and comments from the group.

<p>From: sileagle@windstream.net <br/>Sent: Nov 21, 2013 8:25 AM <br/>To: LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com <br/>Subject: [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Letterboxing Memories 6: Mysterious TX Boxers <br/><br/>Only in Texas have we had such a diverse set of mysterious letterboxers, and this is their story. It includes hyperlinks to specific posts, but it is more rewarding to go back and read all the related posts. You can do this by selecting View, then Message History and selecting the month and year for the desired posts. You can also search the Group by typing in a word or phrase at the top and clicking Search Groups.<br/><br/>This is my last planned memory, but at least it is a long one. I hope you have enjoyed them and will continue generating new ones. As usual, it is in the Files section: <br/><br/>http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/files/Letterboxing%20Memories<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/></p></body>
