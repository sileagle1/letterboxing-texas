remains of this letterbox.  I wouldn't think that particular location<br/>
would have gotten many random finders, but who knows?  Maybe a raccoon<br/>
(my nemeses) or a bad rehide.<br/>

Since he lasted less than 2 months, I probably won't replace him. <br/>
But, I might get inspired and change my mind.<br/>

<div>We almost went hunting for him today!  Thank goodness we changed our 
minds!!  We did find the Houston Hills Letterbox but not where it should 
have been.  It was actually scattered around the cement pipe that was 
mentioned in the clues.  At least all pieces were there.  After 
stamping in, I rehid it in what I assume was the original location and concealed 
it well!</div>
