the car while my husband and daughter put the<br>
finishing touches on her roller coaster she was<br>
building for physics class (due Monday, of course).  <br>
My son, bless his heart and choke him all at the same<br>
time, fell squarely in the middle of the roller<br>
coaster, demolishing it.  Back to square one with the<br>
coaster, and about 15 hours down the drain.  No Waco<br>
this weekend, no boxing...sigh!<br>
