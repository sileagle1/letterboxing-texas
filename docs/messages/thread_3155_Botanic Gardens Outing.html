                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am a member of the homeschool group who was planning an outing to the <br>
Botanic Gardens.  I sent a note to your moderator explaining how we <br>
would be going about searching for the boxes since there would be some <br>
new people with us.  There will also be some more experienced <br>
letterboxers in the group.<br>
<br>
There will be no more than one adult and two children at the box at one <br>
time and the rest of the group (a rather small one at that) would be a <br>
safe distance away and would look like any other group of children <br>
enjoying the gardens with their friends and parent(s).<br>
<br>
The logbooks would be handled only by one adult - no children will be <br>
touching anything to do with the boxes - and everything will be put <br>
back in place with the utmost care and concern for the safety and <br>
integrity of the box.<br>
<br>
There will be no stamping done on this day - if a family so desires, <br>
they may come back to the box at another time and leave their stamp.<br>
<br>
It was never my intent to cause any problems or trouble on any list(s), <br>
I only wanted to introduce my friends to this amazing adventure!<br>
<br>
I apologize for any misunderstandings that have come about and hope <br>
there are no ill feelings towards our home school group.  We have an <br>
amazing bunch of families and they are all very respectful of other <br>
people's property - no matter what activity we are doing.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your concern and enjoy your day.<br>

<div>As one of the planters of some of the Botanic Gardens boxes, I appreciate 
your response on this issue.  Of course, when we put a box out there and 
post clues, we lose control over what happens to it, but we can't help being a 
little protective of our creations, especially some that are our personal 
favorites or are in particularly vulnerable locations because of high traffic, 
enthusiastic groundskeepers, etc.  This summer has been particularly bad 
even for some long-time letterboxes; many of us lost boxes that had been in 
place for a couple of years or more to unusual flooding , and then we've 
experienced a recent rash of apparently-careless finders not taking care to 
reseal bags and boxes or to replace them carefully, with resulting destruction 
of logbooks or boxes, so I think we're all a little super-sensitive to any 
potential problems.   Obviously, you have planned carefully and this 
outing should be a good experience for everyone involved, and I want to express 
again my personal appreciation for your care.   Thank you, and enjoy 
the day!</div>
