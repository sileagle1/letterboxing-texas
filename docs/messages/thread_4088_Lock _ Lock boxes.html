                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it kind of depends on where you are.  I use to buy them at Target, but the one where we shop doesn't carry them anymore.  You can get certain sizes at Wal-Mart, but I find they come in a pack of 3 different sizes, and one is a very small round box.  The best bet is online, and that's usually where I get them.  I have bought them at www.heritagemint.com and I've heard you can get them at qvc.  They come in a lot of sizes, so the trick is finding the right size for a letterbox.  The one I like best is about 4 1/2" square and 1 1/2" deep, but I haven't been able to get that size lately.  I found one place where you can buy them already painted with camoflage paint,  see this link:<br/>

<br/>
The price for the boxes aren't bad, but the shipping may be prohibitive.  I'm not sure where they are shipping from.<br/>

<br/>
If you're near Houston or passing through, Super H Mart, at 1302 Blalock Rd. (west side of town, just off I-10), has an entire aisle dedicated to Lock &amp; Locks of every shape and size.<br/>
<br/>
They also have a fried chicken kiosk selling "chicken and joy".  Because who among us doesn't need more of both?<br/>
