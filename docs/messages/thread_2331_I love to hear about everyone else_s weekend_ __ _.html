<div>We WILL be in the Tuscany area!  After arriving in Rome on the 16th, we will spend a few days in Sienna and base our day trips from there, going to Florence and some of the smaller towns. Then we will go to Venice for a couple of days as well!  Guess I need to add "letterboxing stuff" to my list of what to pack!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

check for letterboxes.  There was one in the entire country, but 
Flash Dreamer planted two for us to find while we're here, so we 
have found three so far.  Also, we will be planting two before we 
leave, so hopefully there will be 5 here when you come.  By the way, 
Barefoot Lucy, the Italian mosquitoes did show up.  They are the 
ones that planted the first and second boxes in Italy, and they are 
really cool.  Check them out: they're called "On the Rim" and "Old 
World Charm" and are listed on LbNA (International).

&gt; My Thanksgiving weekend involved having all four of my wisdom 
teeth  pulled.  
&gt; The day before Thanksgiving...what was I thinking?  Talk  about a 
great 
&gt; weight loss program- it was really difficult trying to eat all of  
the tasty treats 
&gt; on Thanksgiving day, so I just gave up and fell asleep on the  
couch at my 
&gt; in-laws house!  The down side is that I signed up for the TXU  
Turkey Trot 10K 
&gt; in Houston and the dentist told me that I couldn't do it.   Bummer!
&gt;  
&gt; Friday morning I braved the malls ( couldn't find anyone who 
wanted to go  
&gt; with me!) and bought three pairs of boots at Macy's awesome sale, 
and two pair  
&gt; of pants for our upcoming trip to Italy.  My husband, who had been 
out  
&gt; running, decided to catch up with me at the mall and was amazed at 
all of my  
&gt; "Christmas shopping" until he found out it was all for me...
&gt;  
&gt; Runs for Chocolate  :)
