                    <html><body><p>Yes, I'm going to vent. If you don't like rants, don't read this. <br/><br/>Let me preface this by saying I really appreciate that everyone who actively participates on this list seems to recognize how nice a little courtesy is between boxers.<br/>
<br/>I had a great time going after the tour bus, even though it was hot and even though I didn't get it. It was a serendipitous bit of letterboxing I wasn't expecting to do today. Any day letterboxing, even if unsuccessful, is better than a day of housework, which is what I had in mind for the afternoon otherwise. As I mentioned in my message a few minutes ago, I got home and checked my mail to see who got it and when and then I went on to read my other letterboxing email. I had another message, a note from a finder, waiting for me. In fact, had two - on the same box - one from AQ and the other from LBNA. And it''s those messages I want to vent about...<br/>
<br/>It seems someone went and found my box at the Gus Engeling Nature Preserve and it was wet. Because it's bad form to forward a message to a group without permission from the writer, and because I don't have any intention of asking permission, I'll paraphrase. "The box is wet. Someone else left a note that it was wet when they found it back in March 2009." That was through a contact on LBNA. The contact from the listing on AQ was to the effect of "Placer needs to make repairs.". Not a kind word. Nothing like "sorry to let you know this, but ..." Not a word about how much they liked the park. How the stamp was cute. How they enjoyed the trip. All the sorts of comments I've gotten from so many of the other finders of this box. In fact, this box has proven to be one of my favorites because of the cool notes I get from finders about it. My family had a really good time the day we placed that box and so many other folks seem to have enjoyed finding it too. That makes a good box even better - the experiences that accompany it.<br/>
<br/>Admittedly, I knew the box was wet but I had forgotten about it. I should have made a special trip over to fix the log, or I should have noted on the listing that it was wet, but I just simply forgot about it. Thing is - the stamp is still there and intact, so any finder is able to get an imprint for themselves - they just can't leave one unless they leave a piece of paper of their own in the box. One of the biggest reasons I'm not planting much right now is BECAUSE I don't have the time to do proper maintenance on the boxes I have. Thankfully most boxers are prepared to do a little maintenance as they go, and my boxes have reaped the benefit of their kindness. However, I'll take responsibility for not being as good a boxer as I should be with respect to maintaining in the last year.<br/>
<br/>Still though, it galls me that someone would send a message like that to me or any other placer. As I read it, I felt I was being accused of leaving a wet box out there on purpose and they had been inconvienced by having to find a box in that condition. I like feedback on my boxes, am glad to hear when there is a problem or when a box is potentially missing, but I really don't appreciate reading a message that makes me feel my effort is being graded and deemed substandard.<br/>
<br/>Maybe they are just bad at composing email. Maybe they aren't graced with social niceties. Maybe they were in a hurry. Maybe I was in a grouchy mood (although I was coming off a pleasant run and looking forward to checking in, so I don't THINK that's the case). Maybe I'm feeling guilty for not getting out there to do the maintenance that was needed. Or maybe they ARE just rude. <br clear="all"/>
<br/>If it weren't for placers, there would be nothing for anyone to find.
Am I wrong in thinking that if you can't at least show a little appreciation for the effort even if not for the present condition, you shouldn't bother writing at all? I'll be interested in hearing other thoughts, even if you disagree with me.<br/>
<br/>I have to confess that it was not one of my finer moments when I responded with a message that read something like "I'm so glad you enjoyed the park and had a good time looking for it anyway. Thanks for letting me know its condition." Probably shouldn't have done that...too late now though.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi there,<br>
I haven't been around long, and I admit I have not placed a box yet, so I don't have that perspective, but I truly do not think that person meant to upset you.  They probably just thought you might want to know that your box needed some work to protect the thing you worked hard to create and place.  That's all.  I know I have gone to a couple boxes to find it cracked, etc., and always let the placer know this, if I don't have what is needed to fix it.  Of course, I always make sure to make positive comments also, but like you said, maybe they were in a hurry, or maybe it was their first time, or who knows what else.  I wouldn't stay upset about it much longer, there is just too much cool, great stuff to spend your time on.  Hopefully, my email has helped you to see things a little differently.  If not, I hope at least you get yourself feeling better.<br>

                    <html><body><p>Hi Alicia,<br/><br/>So there IS another late-nighter on right now! <br/><br/>Thanks for writing back. No worries - I won't/don't stay upset long about stuff like this. I have been around a long time relatively speaking (six years in September), and I've had far too many positive experiences in letterboxing to let one negative ruin it. BUT - a vent goes a long way toward forgetting about it!<br/>
<br/>You struck the gist of my issue in your response. You ARE new and you don't have the experience of planting, yet no one had to tell you that it's a good thing to make a positive comment when you have to report something not so great to a placer. That isn't a letterboxing thing - that's a common courtesy thing, isn't it?<br/>
<br/>One of my favorite things about letterboxing is the people. By and large, the people are courteous to one another and they appreciate the effort others put into the game at whatever level. When finders find boxes in poor condition, they do whatever they can with what they have to correct it. If a box is missing, they let the placer know. If newbies come along and ask questions, they help them. I don't know what it is about letterboxing that seems to attract those sorts of people, people who are a cut or two above the general population, but I like it. But because that's the type of folks you find in letterboxing, the ones that aren't quite so much that way really stick out. <br/>
<br/>You are very kind to want to make sure I don't let it get under my skin, and I really appreciate that!<br/><br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

<p>Yes, I'm going to vent.  If you don't like rants, don't read this. 
  <br/><br/>Let me preface this by saying I really appreciate that everyone who 
  actively participates on this list seems to recognize how nice a little 
  courtesy is between boxers.<br/><br/>I had a great time going after the tour

<p>Yes, I'm going to vent. If you don't like rants, don't read this. 
  <br/><br/>Let me preface this by saying I really appreciate that everyone who 
  actively participates on this list seems to recognize how nice a little 
  courtesy is between boxers.<br/><br/>I had a great time going after the tour 
  bus, even though it was hot and even though I didn't get it. It was a 
  serendipitous bit of letterboxing I wasn't expecting to do today. Any 
  day letterboxing, even if unsuccessful, is better than a day of housework, 
  which is what I had in mind for the afternoon otherwise. As I mentioned 
  in my message a few minutes ago, I got home and checked my mail to see who got 
  it and when and then I went on to read my other letterboxing email. I 
  had another message, a note from a finder, waiting for me. In fact, had 
  two - on the same box - one from AQ and the other from LBNA. And it''s 
  those messages I want to vent about...<br/><br/>It seems someone went and found 
  my box at the Gus Engeling Nature Preserve and it was wet. Because it's 
  bad form to forward a message to a group without permission from the writer, 
  and because I don't have any intention of asking permission, I'll 
  paraphrase. "The box is wet. Someone else left a note that it was 
  wet when they found it back in March 2009." That was through a contact 
  on LBNA. The contact from the listing on AQ was to the effect of "Placer 
  needs to make repairs.". Not a kind word. Nothing like "sorry to 
  let you know this, but ..." Not a word about how much they liked the 
  park. How the stamp was cute. How they enjoyed the trip. All 
  the sorts of comments I've gotten from so many of the other finders of this 
  box. In fact, this box has proven to be one of my favorites because of 
  the cool notes I get from finders about it. My family had a really good 
  time the day we placed that box and so many other folks seem to have enjoyed 
  finding it too. That makes a good box even better - the experiences that 
  accompany it.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I knew the box was wet but I had forgotten 
  about it. I should have made a special trip over to fix the log, or I 
  should have noted on the listing that it was wet, but I just simply forgot 
  about it. Thing is - the stamp is still there and intact, so any finder 
  is able to get an imprint for themselves - they just can't leave one unless 
  they leave a piece of paper of their own in the box. One of the biggest 
  reasons I'm not planting much right now is BECAUSE I don't have the time to do 
  proper maintenance on the boxes I have. Thankfully most boxers are 
  prepared to do a little maintenance as they go, and my boxes have reaped the 
  benefit of their kindness. However, I'll take responsibility for 
  not being as good a boxer as I should be with respect to maintaining in the 
  last year.<br/><br/>Still though, it galls me that someone would send a message 
  like that to me or any other placer. As I read it, I felt I was being 
  accused of leaving a wet box out there on purpose and they had been 
  inconvienced by having to find a box in that condition. I like feedback 
  on my boxes, am glad to hear when there is a problem or when a box is 
  potentially missing, but I really don't appreciate reading a message that 
  makes me feel my effort is being graded and deemed substandard.<br/><br/>Maybe 
  they are just bad at composing email. Maybe they aren't graced with 
  social niceties. Maybe they were in a hurry. Maybe I was in a 
  grouchy mood (although I was coming off a pleasant run and looking forward to 
  checking in, so I don't THINK that's the case). Maybe I'm feeling guilty 
  for not getting out there to do the maintenance that was needed. Or maybe they 
  ARE just rude. <br clear="all"/><br/>If it weren't for placers, there would 
  be nothing for anyone to find. Am I wrong in thinking that if you can't 
  at least show a little appreciation for the effort even if not for the present 
  condition, you shouldn't bother writing at all? I'll be interested in 
  hearing other thoughts, even if you disagree with me.<br/><br/>I have to confess 
  that it was not one of my finer moments when I responded with a message that 
  read something like "I'm so glad you enjoyed the park and had a good time 
  looking for it anyway. Thanks for letting me know its condition." 
  Probably shouldn't have done that...too late now though.<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot

<br/>It doesn't bother me that I didn't get a compliment, but that it was as though there was nothing at all good about the box since it was wet. Admittedly, I'm very much of the "all about the experience" camp and in our family, if we have fun going for the box, it doesn't ruin the experience for us if we find the box missing or in poor condition. I'll admit I don't understand the personality type that is devastated when things don't go as planned. <br/>

<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial">Not trying to make you mad, just trying to 
play devil's advocate. I always box with my children and their excitement level

their disappointment level is off the charts as well. We love to letterbox. But 
I can't imagine being angry because someone let me know there was a problem with 
my box. And their disappointment might have been what kept them from making a 
comment about how lovely your box was. It could have been one of those days 
where they didn't find any of the boxes they'd printed clues for, it was hot, 
they were tired and disappointed and just wanted to let you know you had a 
problem.</font></div>

not send you the note about your box.)</font></div>

<div>
<p>Yes, I'm going to vent. If you don't like rants, don't read this. 
  <br/><br/>Let me preface this by saying I really appreciate that everyone who 
  actively participates on this list seems to recognize how nice a little 
  courtesy is between boxers.<br/><br/>I had a great time going after the tour 
  bus, even though it was hot and even though I didn't get it. It was a 
  serendipitous bit of letterboxing I wasn't expecting to do today. Any 
  day letterboxing, even if unsuccessful, is better than a day of housework, 
  which is what I had in mind for the afternoon otherwise. As I mentioned 
  in my message a few minutes ago, I got home and checked my mail to see who got 
  it and when and then I went on to read my other letterboxing email. I 
  had another message, a note from a finder, waiting for me. In fact, had 
  two - on the same box - one from AQ and the other from LBNA. And it''s 
  those messages I want to vent about...<br/><br/>It seems someone went and found 
  my box at the Gus Engeling Nature Preserve and it was wet. Because it's 
  bad form to forward a message to a group without permission from the writer, 
  and because I don't have any intention of asking permission, I'll 
  paraphrase. "The box is wet. Someone else left a note that it was 
  wet when they found it back in March 2009." That was through a contact 
  on LBNA. The contact from the listing on AQ was to the effect of "Placer 
  needs to make repairs.". Not a kind word. Nothing like "sorry to 
  let you know this, but ..." Not a word about how much they liked the 
  park. How the stamp was cute. How they enjoyed the trip. All 
  the sorts of comments I've gotten from so many of the other finders of this 
  box. In fact, this box has proven to be one of my favorites because of 
  the cool notes I get from finders about it. My family had a really good 
  time the day we placed that box and so many other folks seem to have enjoyed 
  finding it too. That makes a good box even better - the experiences that 
  accompany it.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I knew the box was wet but I had forgotten 
  about it. I should have made a special trip over to fix the log, or I 
  should have noted on the listing that it was wet, but I just simply forgot 
  about it. Thing is - the stamp is still there and intact, so any finder 
  is able to get an imprint for themselves - they just can't leave one unless 
  they leave a piece of paper of their own in the box. One of the biggest 
  reasons I'm not planting much right now is BECAUSE I don't have the time to do 
  proper maintenance on the boxes I have. Thankfully most boxers are 
  prepared to do a little maintenance as they go, and my boxes have reaped the 
  benefit of their kindness. However, I'll take responsibility for 
  not being as good a boxer as I should be with respect to maintaining in the 
  last year.<br/><br/>Still though, it galls me that someone would send a message 
  like that to me or any other placer. As I read it, I felt I was being 
  accused of leaving a wet box out there on purpose and they had been 
  inconvienced by having to find a box in that condition. I like feedback 
  on my boxes, am glad to hear when there is a problem or when a box is 
  potentially missing, but I really don't appreciate reading a message that 
  makes me feel my effort is being graded and deemed substandard.<br/><br/>Maybe 
  they are just bad at composing email. Maybe they aren't graced with 
  social niceties. Maybe they were in a hurry. Maybe I was in a 
  grouchy mood (although I was coming off a pleasant run and looking forward to 
  checking in, so I don't THINK that's the case). Maybe I'm feeling guilty 
  for not getting out there to do the maintenance that was needed. Or maybe they 
  ARE just rude. <br clear="all"/><br/>If it weren't for placers, there would 
  be nothing for anyone to find. Am I wrong in thinking that if you can't 
  at least show a little appreciation for the effort even if not for the present 
  condition, you shouldn't bother writing at all? I'll be interested in 
  hearing other thoughts, even if you disagree with me.<br/><br/>I have to confess 
  that it was not one of my finer moments when I responded with a message that 
  read something like "I'm so glad you enjoyed the park and had a good time 
  looking for it anyway. Thanks for letting me know its condition." 
  Probably shouldn't have done that...too late now though.<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot

She was very excited, but started with "Lightning is okay" and went on to explain that she had finally gotten to see a Brown Recluse bite. I finally realized it had nothing to do with Lightning at all, but she was excited to finally see a BR bite in the flesh (so to speak). She knew it wouldn't really be a good bedside manner to show the boy how much fascination the source of his discomfort was giving her, so she called me to share it with me. Having a nurse for a friend, especially a nurse who likes to do wilderness stuff, is sort of like having cats. They get excited about the oddest things, and they want to share them with you.<br/>

I've been stung by flying insects and like you said, they do hurt, but they aren't unbearable. Somehow a scorpion just looks like it would be far more painful than a wasp.

<p></p><div><div></div><div class="h5">Wow - did they have any idea what might have stung you? That's a 
  yukky reaction! Was it purely a reaction to the toxin, or was it an 
  allergic reaction?<br/><br/>I can relate to not sleeping well - my shoulder hurt 
  all night last night, and of course, that was the side I wanted to sleep 
  on. Consequently, I stayed up late and got up early. It's gonna be 
  a long and unproductive day.<br/><br/>I got a phone call from my friend y'all 
  know as She Who Volunteers Me For Everything a few Monday mornings ago. 
  I almost ignored it because I was about to walk out the door to work and she 
  was calling on the house phone, but it hit me that since she was the camp 
  nurse where Lightning was at summer camp, I should probably answer it. 
  She was very excited, but started with "Lightning is okay" and went on to 
  explain that she had finally gotten to see a Brown Recluse bite. I 
  finally realized it had nothing to do with Lightning at all, but she was 
  excited to finally see a BR bite in the flesh (so to speak). She knew it 
  wouldn't really be a good bedside manner to show the boy how much fascination 
  the source of his discomfort was giving her, so she called me to share it with 
  me. Having a nurse for a friend, especially a nurse who likes to do 
  wilderness stuff, is sort of like having cats. They get excited about 
  the oddest things, and they want to share them with you.<br/><br/>Don't you just 
  wish you could find the creature and bite it 
  back???<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/>

<div>Vent away my friend Barefoot Lucy!  I'm sorry that has happen to one of your favorite boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I for one find it a privilege to do maintenance on boxes when I find that they need my help.  After all they were put with the purpose of showing us an area or special place that I probably wouldn't have ever gone to if I wasn't letterboxing.  I really feel that on going maintenance should be something that the finder should always come prepared for; after all the planter has given quite a bit already to give us the adventure free of charge.  The gift of thought and caring, creating and planting for the love of the hobby from a perfect stranger!   And I think it's just common sense to help out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My daughter who is 8, takes it seriously when we find a box that the previous finder did not leave hidden or sealed well or if it has a dirty stamp.  Recently we found a wet log book sealed up in a <strong>new</strong> freezer bag and torn pages of someones log book in the box to replace it and that at least 5 more finders stamped in after that.  Why would they just leave the logbook in the box to just mold?  In our pass experience a planter would much rather you rescue the wet log book for them than the leave it to ruin.   We have saved several logbooks in the past few months and were able to save pretty much all of the images in the logbooks for the planters.  And we have happily returned them to the planters free of charge!  Finders do have an responsibility to the boxes they find.... and making repairs and logging finds are the most important!!!</div>

I know how u feel. I have a box that is pretty remote and it took a year <br>
to get a first finder. I was so excited when I got a notification that <br>
it had been found! Until I opened the email and the finder commented <br>
that the box was on top of the ground and I should hide it better.  Duh! <br>
I put it on top of the ground. Under a bush, in a park and it couldn't <br>
be seen from any direction.  It survived in a public park for a year <br>
without being found or thrown out. (I checked on it about the 1 year <br>
mark.)  Luckily JBK found it next so I am sure it was rehidden <br>
correctly.<br>

ownership and possible use of a gun of any type is a very personal thing, and 
requires a great deal of fore-thought.  Being a retired soldier, from a 
family of police officers (My mother served too), I am quite comfortable with 
it, and I know what I can do, and how to do it.  I am proficient enough 
that I can devote my entire mind to the shoot - no-shoot solution and the weapon 
comes into engagement from muscle memory.</font></span></div>

  requires a great deal of fore-thought.  Being a retired soldier, from a 
  family of police officers (My mother served too), I am quite comfortable with 
  it, and I know what I can do, and how to do it.  I am proficient enough 
  that I can devote my entire mind to the shoot - no-shoot solution and the 
  weapon comes into engagement from muscle memory.</font></span></div>

limitations.  I haven't had time (or a free place) to practice before 
taking the class and testing.  I used to be a really good shot with my 
father's .357.  Well, I'd say &gt;85% accuracy in high school.  OK, so 
maybe that's a couple of decades removed.  And I don't have a spiffy purple 
gun (I guess my husband man enough to buy it!) - mine is a plain ol' .38 
special.  Thanks for the advice.  I'll be getting me some

  Re: [letterboxingtexas] Vent...<br/><br/>I apparently have taken the wrong tack 
  when it comes to personal safely. I only<br/>own a pistol. I would love to talk 
  with you sometime about such things. Lucky<br/>for you, you won't be making it 
  to my event next month. My husband would talk<br/>your ear off about it.
