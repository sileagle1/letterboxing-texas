                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently started working on a field guide of Texas<br>
letterboxes for my own use (although if you .  I've<br>
found it frustrating at times to not have a hard copy<br>
guide to grab and go with, so I thought I would<br>
download clues and put it into a backpack friendly<br>
format.  It wound up being a bigger project than I had<br>
thought it would be when I started it (I'm thinking<br>
now - DUUUHHH!), so I had set it aside for awhile, but<br>
Jeff's great website has spurred me back to action on<br>
it.<br>
<br>
Here's what I've been doing - I've copied clues from<br>
the LBNA website into Word and stripped the graphics<br>
off.  For the sake of tackling one challenge at a<br>
time, I've not worried about organization yet - just <br>
started a file for each region and left them listed by<br>
county.  I've copied the clues for each region into<br>
the same file.  I'll page break between each box so it<br>
will be one box per page.<br>
<br>
Now then - y'all think about if this were for your<br>
purposes (and I'd be willing to share the file after<br>
it's done, once I make sure I comply with LBNA's<br>
information usage policy - whatever that is!).  If you<br>
were inclined to use a field guide, what would you<br>
really like to see in it?  Lines for notes on each<br>
box's page?  Sorted differently?  Do you like the<br>
regions?  What size?  What format?<br>
<br>
Personally, I have had in mind a 9x7 inch notebook,<br>
although I'm not sure how conducive this size is to<br>
printing or copying.  This is the size I keep my bird<br>
guide in and it carries very well in a backpack (for<br>
day hiking anyway).  Copied front and back, one<br>
letterbox per page.  Plenty of margin space for notes<br>
(or as an alternative, lines on each page, but I<br>
prefer margin space).  I don't have a problem with the<br>
regions, and I think I would tab the guide by region<br>
and put an index at the front of each section and a<br>
copy of the map showing how the regions are broken<br>
down at the front of the book.  I'm kind of lukewarm<br>
on the counties, but I don't know how else I would<br>
sort it - maybe by town?  I think I would put a<br>
section at the back of the guide with some handy<br>
information that isn't clue-specific.  And the all<br>
important disclaimer.<br>
<br>
I'd love to hear what y'all think would be good to put<br>
into a field guide, what sort of information would be<br>
handy to have on the fly (you know, when you can't<br>
just pull the website because trees don't have<br>
internet connections????).<br>

<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My wife started out printing clue pages for boxes in the nearby area for towns that she recognized.  She put them in a 3 ring binder with 1 inch rings. </div>
<div> </div>
<div> We are in the Gulf Coast region which is not a compact region.  Not being native Texans, we have found that we are having to go look at a map to see where counties and towns are located.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have started just printing out the clue pages before we leave for a trip. After missing out on two letterboxes because we left the second page at home :-( , I now just copying the text to reduce the size so each box's clues are on one page.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>In terms of sorting, my tendency would be to use the regions on LBNA as most of us are already familiar with it, county and then city.   I would still want to look at a map since sorting cities alphabetically does not match their physical relationship to each other.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another posibility would be to group letterboxes by themes ( Texas History, Famous People, Cartoons, Wildlife, etc.).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have enjoyed Silver Eagle's suggested itinerary for letterboxers going to an area.  That may be worthwhile capturing.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Silver Eagle and I were visiting about when clue pages are removed from LBNA. One thing about capturing the clues in a field guide you maintain a record of the Texas letterboxes.  Even if a box is missing, the fact that someone place a box at a location is a recommendation for a trip to visit.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems like everybody is doing a lot of extra-curricular work out <br>
there.  A field guide, an Atlas , a new logo. Wow.<br>
  I wasn't sure which message to reply to so I ust picked this one.--<br>
Logo- I sent an email to the letterboxing.org webmaster asking <br>
permission to use their logo as part of our own.  I have yet to <br>
recieve a reply.<br>
<br>
Atlas- I forget to say in my last message that you can input my <br>
lowly, singular hide :(  Here's a link:<br>
http://letterboxing.org/BoxView.asp?boxnum=7384&boxname=Box_Kite<br>
<br>
I have others to hide, I just haven't found the time.  Maybe this <br>
week.<br>
<br>
Field guide- I think that is a great idea.  It seems like a lot of <br>
work though, especially with the (hopefully) constant addition of <br>
boxes. Organizationly, it seems like a nightmare. I like the idea of <br>
having each chapter contain one region. You could always <br>
crossreference by county and/or city in an index at the back <br>
refering to the page number.  <br>
I don't think it matters if you lined it or left margins.  I always <br>
put any notes in my personal logbook, next to the stamp. <br>
<br>
What I have done with my clues is this:<br>
Copy and paste the clues to a word document.  I put all the clues <br>
for a particular trip onto one page. I'm going to goliad soon and I <br>
have everything on a single page. It's easy to keep track of if not <br>
too pretty.  <br>
