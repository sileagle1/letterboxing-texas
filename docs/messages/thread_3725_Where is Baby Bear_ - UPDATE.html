&gt; I still can not find BB.  He said when he left he was going to the <br/>
&gt; place Sam Houston camped with his army on the way to San Jac.  I <br/>
did <br/>
&gt; not know this place, and questioned him, and he said as he ran out <br/>
&gt; the door, the Letterboxing Halloween park.  I have not heard from <br/>
&gt; him since, but did find a flier on my door that said "The Circus <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; come to Town"?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I called the police.  They traced his phone records and determined <br/>
&gt; the following time line:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4:40 - He walked from the historical marker to the right and <br/>
&gt; followed the wire fence to the creek.<br/>
&gt; 4:42 - At the creek, he walked through opening in fence and under <br/>
&gt; bridge.<br/>
&gt; 4:44 - He went straight ahead on trail for 35 steps.<br/>
&gt; 4:46 - He turned right and went up a trail for 18 steps.<br/>
&gt; 4:47 - He turned left and followed a faint trail for 14 steps<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point his phone went dead.   Hopefully someone will find <br/>
out <br/>
&gt; what happened and let me know.......<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone seen or heard from Baby Bear today?   He left the <br/>
house <br/>
&gt; &gt; earlier with his computer, and some containers, but I have not <br/>
&gt; been <br/>
&gt; &gt; able to reach him since.   I'm concerned, since he kept talking <br/>
&gt; about <br/>
&gt; &gt; some clown that keeps following him in a little car, and wearing <br/>
&gt; boxer <br/>
&gt; &gt; shorts.   Let me know if you have any updates.......<br/>
