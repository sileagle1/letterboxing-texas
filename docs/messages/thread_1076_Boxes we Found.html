                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday we spent the day in Galveston doing the dino - thing at <br>
Moody Gardens. I have to admit, I could not wait to finish Moody <br>
Gardens so we can find all our stamps we had planned.  LOL Then we <br>
found several stamps on the island:<br>
<br>
Kemp's Ridley<br>
Sea Aggies - thanks for the warning of mosquito's, even though the <br>
rain did not help matters<br>
Celtic Cross - that cementary is really amazing, it started to rain <br>
so we could not look around as much as we wanted to -- loved the <br>
Historical markers, very interested, we found another one who fought <br>
in the war of 1812.  Willis mausoleum was unbelievable <br>
craftsmanship!!!!!<br>
Sylvester - we actually found this one in the rain, and where this <br>
box is at the trees were are umbrellas - but boy did the mosquito's <br>
love us!!!!! I don't think any amount of bug spray would of stopped <br>
that many!!!  Nice place, I wish we could of spent more time.  Then <br>
after all the snake stories, I thought for sure a snake would slither <br>
out in front of us.<br>
<br>
Also found was Topaz Memorial Box - we found this on the way down at <br>
10 AM, good thing because we came back by to find Bravery at a park <br>
down the street - the dog racing was beginning to start - we would of <br>
never been able to stamp it.  I was amazed by your great stamp <br>
carving - actually all the stamps we did yesterday were great.   I <br>
would be interested in what kind of tools you use to stamp - and do <br>
you draw freehand or what.<br>
<br>
Well because of all these neat letterboxing we had a very enjoyable <br>
day with great family memories --  THANKS   ANITA<br>
