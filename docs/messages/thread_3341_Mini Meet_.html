                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, it sounds to me like there is enough interest in a mini-meet next <br>
Saturday, so let's just go ahead and make plans to do it! Cedar Ridge <br>
Nature Center around noon? Everyone just come and bring your picnic, <br>
stamps, and logbook! If you want to go out to the area (or the nearby <br>
State Park) and hide a letterbox in advance of the meet, just make a <br>
few copies of the clues to hand out to the boxers at the meet if you <br>
don't get a chance to post them before hand.<br>
<br>
There's a group of picnic tables just as you enter the Nature Center. <br>
We can set up there. I'll go ahead and announce it on AQ and you can <br>
sign up so that the personal travelers of those signed up and the local <br>
boxes will show up.<br>
<br>
Please "tune in" for any late breaking news (weather-wise) which may <br>
cause a postponment. <br>
<br>
Looking forward to seeing and meeting lots of area boxers!<br>
<br>
Oh and one last word. Please don't use this as an alternative to <br>
attending the state event at Bastrop! Believe me.. the state event is a <br>
much larger event and a whole big ol' bunch of fun! if there is anyway <br>
you can make it to Bastrop... be there! You will be happy you did.<br>
