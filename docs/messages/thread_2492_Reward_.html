</p><div>I was just reminded of one of the really great rewards of letterboxing today. I had received a message that my log books were full for my Artist Series at the Ft Worth Botanical Gardens, so I went down there today to add new log books to them. It was sunny and warm, and I so enjoyed sitting and reading the messages and seeing the stamps which filled the books. I was going to replace the log books and bring home the old ones so they wouldn't disappear, but after enjoying all the stamps &amp; messages from all over the country, I decided to leave them in the boxes along with the replacement books so future finders could enjoy the messages. It was a good reminder to me of how neat it is to take the time to write a message in log books. I'll do better!</div>

 I sure hope that we took the time that day to write a little note! I do remember that we visited in JULY and it was sooooo hot and humid that we were all dripping with sweat by 10 am.  YIKES!<br/>

 We also had my elderly mother with us. She usually thinks our hobbies tend to be silly and pointless, but she was so impressed with PuddleSplasher's carvings that she took quite an interest in boxing and even had me carve a stamp that she could plant in her hometown. It was a "banner letterboxing day" for the Busybeesfamily!!!<br/>

Thanks again, PuddleSplasher, for your great series!<br/>
