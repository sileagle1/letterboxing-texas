Actually, LBNA will do this, too.  You can select an option to have <br>
it email you every time someone logs a find.  It is a generic email, <br>
but at least you know someone has logged a find.  I used to have this <br>
on, but started getting too many emails to keep up with since I have <br>
so many boxes.  I still appreciate the emails I do get since the <br>
person usually has valid information about the box or just wants me <br>
to know they enjoyed it.<br>

<br>
<br>
And this is my main complaint about AQ and why I don't use it.  If it <br>
was set up as a front-end to LBNA and not as a separate repository <br>
for clues, then all the neat functions would apply to all boxes <br>
listed, not just the ones in AQ.  The way it is now, it feels like a <br>
competitor to LBNA since some people only put clues in AQ.  I made <br>
the decision not to post my clues in AQ since I don't have time to <br>
keep them in more than 1 place.  I also only log finds in LBNA for <br>
the same reason.  The webmasters for LBNA have made quite a few <br>
improvements in the past months and I am satisfied with it.  My <br>
personal feeling is that people should consider it the main place to <br>
post clues and AQ as secondary, unless they are purposefully trying <br>
to hide clues.  Unfortunately, many people are posting to AQ and only <br>
posting to LBNA if they remember to check the box that will do it for <br>
them.  I realize that eventually I will have to accept the fact that <br>
AQ is destined to become the clue repository of choice, but I have <br>
not given up yet.  The better option would be to add some of the neat <br>
search capabilities of AQ to LBNA, thus accessing more clues.<br>
I guess I'm so loyal to LBNA because over the years I have worked <br>
with all the webmasters to make it better, and I appreciate all their <br>
hard work for no pay.<br>
This is just my .02, and it does not mean I'm mad at anyone who feels <br>
different or prefers to use AQ.  When it's all said and done, I'm <br>
just happy there are clues somewhere and many great boxes to find!<br>
