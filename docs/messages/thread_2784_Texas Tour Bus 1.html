                    <html><body><div>Funny you should mention the TTB. I haven't gotten a clue for either bus in forever. Have I been booted from the clues on this group :) BL?</div> <div> </div> <div>But, a funny thing happened on AQ. A couple of weeks ago I was perusing the messages and saw a tour bus mentioned on the NH board. So, I checked it out. Seems David TeamNewHampshire (is that his official name?) heard about the TTB and decided to make one for up there. So, I had to subscribe to their board to follow it. It was fun, because I could make reference to knowing what he was talking about and drive the others crazy. You know how I am.</div> <div> </div> <div>Tonight he mentioned launching his bus, so I teased him and said ours was missing and accused him of kidnapping it. Of course he is in complete denial.</div> <div> </div> <div>I think that is so cool that the TTB was such a success that the idea is being adopted in other states. Wouldn't that be the coolest if each
 state got their own bus?</div> <div> </div> <div>Y'all have a wonderful Memorial weekend. If even it rains. I am having dental surgery tomorrow, so I'll be drooling on my pillow all weekend. Pray for me and my dentist :)</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Shelly Tallent &lt;baileys_bunch@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div> <div>Any updates on this bus?
