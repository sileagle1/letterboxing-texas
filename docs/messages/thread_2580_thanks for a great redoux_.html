they put into the gathering. It was much appreciated by our little <br/>
family of 'boxing novices. Thanks also to everyone else we met there <br/>
for their kindness and sincere welcoming of us newbies. It was great <br/>
to finally put some faces to those logged stamps we keep seeing on our <br/>
adventures. We had quite a few questions, but we never were made to <br/>
feel like 'dummies'. We had a grand day. We didn't find near as many <br/>
letterboxes as we had on our list, but it was fun chatting with <br/>
everyone. Besides, it will give us a reason to get back there- it's a <br/>
beautiful drive and a beautiful area.<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
JKC<br/>
