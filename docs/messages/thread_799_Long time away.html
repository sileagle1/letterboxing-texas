Hello eveyone.<br/>
<br/>
   It's been a while since I've posted but between work and sleeping <br/>
I'm trying to get my crawfish boil event planned.  I just wanted to <br/>
plug my buddy Ryan's clues site again Atlas Quest.com .  He just <br/>
updated it again and there is now a feature that alows you to add AQ <br/>
clues to LbNA with a click of a button.  I don't think it helps for <br/>
all the boxes already on LbNA and not on AQ but for future boxes <br/>
planted he has made it easier to post to both sites.  This feature was <br/>
the work of both sites working hand and hand to improve everyones <br/>
adventure in Letterboxing.  This just shows the two are not competing <br/>
but complementing each other.  <br/>
<br/>
This has been a Boxdn 60 seconds<br/>
