Well, last night I had a dream about it. Everything that could go wrong did!! At one point I was sitting at the table doing exchanges, it was set up to where you stamped in the logbook and then passed it to the next person. Well, my pile was getting bigger and bigger and bigger! Everyone started getting mad at me b/c I was holding everything up. Then all of a sudden I was stamping into some boxes but got the stamps and logbooks all mixed up. I couldn't tell which one went to which box or where they belonged! So I ended up shoving them in my purse and running! LOL I ran to a bathroom b/c I had to use the facilities. However all the stalls were full with letterboxers stamping their sig stamps on the stall walls! I was getting nervous b/c it was taking everyone so long and I really had to go. I just knew it was them getting back at me for taking so long with the exchanges. Well then Blue Butterfly found out that I had shoved the boxes into my purse and<br/>
 started yelling at me for stealing boxes. (Which is hilarious b/c if any of you have ever met Blue Butterfly there isn't a mean bone in her body. LOL) She demanded I give them back to her. When I went to reach for my purse I realized it had been stolen during the scary movie we had all went to see! When I told her my purse had been stolen she apologized for making me see that movie b/c it was so dumb. Then I woke up.<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm nervous about getting behind during the exchanges, going letterboxing and getting the boxes all mixed up, having to go to the bathroom, someone asking me to see a movie with them, and getting my purse stolen. Just thought I'd share all of that with you so if you see me looking nervous you know what I'm thinking. LOL<br/>

<p>You know how I sent out that email yesterday
talking about how excited I was about the gathering and how I had been packing
all day and getting ready for it?<br/>
Well, last night I had a dream about it. Everything that could go wrong did!!
At one point I was sitting at the table doing exchanges, it was set up to where
you stamped in the logbook and then passed it to the next person. Well, my pile
was getting bigger and bigger and bigger! Everyone started getting mad at me
b/c I was holding everything up. Then all of a sudden I was stamping into some
boxes but got the stamps and logbooks all mixed up. I couldn't tell which one
went to which box or where they belonged! So I ended up shoving them in my
purse and running! LOL I ran to a bathroom b/c I had to use the facilities.
However all the stalls were full with letterboxers stamping their sig stamps on
the stall walls! I was getting nervous b/c it was taking everyone so long and I
really had to go. I just knew it was them getting back at me for taking so long
with the exchanges. Well then Blue Butterfly found out that I had shoved the
boxes into my purse and<br/>
started yelling at me for stealing boxes. (Which is hilarious b/c if any of you
have ever met Blue Butterfly there isn't a mean bone in her body. LOL) She
demanded I give them back to her. When I went to reach for my purse I realized
it had been stolen during the scary movie we had all went to see! When I told
her my purse had been stolen she apologized for making me see that movie b/c it
was so dumb. Then I woke up.<br/>
<br/>
So now I'm nervous about getting behind during the exchanges, going
letterboxing and getting the boxes all mixed up, having to go to the bathroom,
someone asking me to see a movie with them, and getting my purse stolen. Just
thought I'd share all of that with you so if you see me looking nervous you
know what I'm thinking. LOL<br/>

<div>As for you, Blue Butterfly, yelling at either Perky P or PuddleSplasher, well, I don't know that would ever happen.  You don't yell at people.  I, however, often yell at PuddleSplasher and consider it my duty, my obligation and responsibility to do so, as her older, smarter, and much more beautiful sister.  </div>

<div>Perky P...I am so glad you are able to attend the event. I know there are a lot of boxers ready to exchange with The Rodger's 7 and meet your family! Just remember to breathe! It will be a lot of fun. That's a pretty scary dream you had, but alas, thankfully it is just that a dream. If it had Puddle Splasher in it it would have been a NIGHT MARE!! Whew! Are you ever lucky!!<br/>

Blue Butterfly who's halo isn't crooked today :)<br/>

&gt; If only I were a psychologist, Perky P, I'm sure I'd find that you are a very disturbed human. The only part of that dream I could even imagine to be accurate, is the description of Blue Butterfly yelling at you. I've seen her do that many times, and I assure you, it's not a pretty sight.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>We were the two wide eyed girls walking around and around that festival with tomatoes on our hats trying to look cool while looking and trying to decipher Barefoot Lucy's clues.  We finally found Booth 83 and Maydelle QueenBee's Mom ands after sighing with relief and telling her the letterboxer's bible verse correctly we were pumped.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then we got really lucky and we were adopted by perfect strangers...lol Maydelle QueenBee &amp; PrincessA !! lol I remember Pink Cookie whispering in my ear "Are we going to get in <em>THEIR</em> car??"  and me going against everything I had ever taught her about "<em>Stranger Danger"</em> saying back to her with a big smile "Why yes honey, they are Letterboxers too!!" and I said that without batting an eye!  Me not knowing the area at all it was a life saver for us...lol Pink Cookie and I had a great day of letterboxing with some wonderful gals!</div>

<div>And we might have been the last group to get to the restaurant to eat with everyone that afternoon.... but when we walked in the door it felt like a room full of family!  Everyone was so excited to meet us and we were so happy to put faces and trail names to owners of letterboxes that we had found on the trail and meet some of the names we had seen stamped in boxes too!  If this is your first event you will feel it too, just wait and see!</div>

<div>Hehe...  I don't think anyone could be more nervous than I was last summer when we went to our first event. Picture this now... I drove 3 hours to a town that I had never been to with the intention of meeting a bunch of people that I heard about on-line.  My friends thought I was crazy to take my daughter to a Tomato Festival to look for people I didn't know and tell them answers or ask them questions all for clues to a box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were the two wide eyed girls walking around and around that festival with tomatoes on our hats trying to look cool while looking and trying to decipher Barefoot Lucy's clues.  We finally found Booth 83 and Maydelle QueenBee's Mom ands after sighing with relief and telling her the letterboxer' s bible verse correctly we were pumped.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then we got really lucky and we were adopted by perfect strangers... lol Maydelle QueenBee &amp; PrincessA !! lol I remember Pink Cookie whispering in my ear "Are we going to get in <em>THEIR</em> car??"  and me going against everything I had ever taught her about "<em>Stranger Danger"</em> saying back to her with a big smile "Why yes honey, they are Letterboxers too!!" and I said that without batting an eye!  Me not knowing the area at all it was a life saver for us...lol Pink Cookie and I had a great day of letterboxing with some wonderful gals!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And we might have been the last group to get to the restaurant to eat with everyone that afternoon... . but when we walked in the door it felt like a room full of family!  Everyone was so excited to meet us and we were so happy to put faces and trail names to owners of letterboxes that we had found on the trail and meet some of the names we had seen stamped in boxes too!  If this is your first event you will feel it too, just wait and see!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are getting very excited to see our Letterboxing Friends and the meeting of new ones!</div>

So I may be asking some of you if I can tag along on Saturday, if ya'll don't mind. :)<br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Perky P<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- On Wed, 3/3/10, Tasha Morris &lt;keishkakeishka@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; From: Tasha Morris &lt;keishkakeishka@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] My excitement is now nervousness<br/>&gt; To: letterboxingtexas@ yahoogroups. com<br/>&gt; Date: Wednesday, March 3, 2010, 10:04 PM<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;   <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I'm getting so excited too!  I've been looking forward to this for months, and it was looking (for a while) like I wasn't going to get to come after all.  Then, VOILA!, everything has fallen into place in last 24 hours and I can come!  While Agent X won't be in tow, and Rastaman has other plans, I'm really looking forward to coming - even if it means getting up at (shudder!) 6 in the morning.  I won't be able to stay for the camp fires, but I'll get to box and meet letterboxing legends and see the TTB2!  Woohoo!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now, to find time between now and 6am Saturday to dig all of my answers out, print directions and ensure I have plenty of fresh ink!  I don't suppose any one who's coming would be willing to give me a quick in-person tutorial on markers?  I can't seem to ever get them to work for me when I'm on the trail.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Rogue Artist<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; From: Michelle Lockamy &lt;beachbumtx09@ yahoo.com&gt;<br/>&gt; To: letterboxingtexas@ yahoogroups. com<br/>&gt; Sent: Wed, March 3, 2010 9:38:24 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] My excitement is now nervousness<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;   <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Hehe...  I don't think anyone could be more nervous than I was last summer when we went to our first event. Picture this now... I drove 3 hours to a town that I had never been to with the intention of meeting a bunch of people that I heard about on-line.  My friends thought I was crazy to take my daughter to a Tomato Festival to look for people I didn't know and tell them answers or ask them questions all for clues to a box.  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; We were the two wide eyed girls walking around and around that festival with tomatoes on our hats trying to look cool while looking and trying to decipher Barefoot Lucy's clues.  We finally found Booth 83 and Maydelle QueenBee's Mom ands after sighing with relief and telling her the letterboxer' s bible verse correctly we were pumped.  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Then we got really lucky and we were adopted by perfect strangers... lol Maydelle QueenBee &amp; PrincessA !! lol I remember Pink Cookie whispering in my ear "Are we going to get in THEIR car??"  and me going against everything I had ever taught her about "Stranger Danger" saying back to her with a big smile "Why yes honey, they are Letterboxers too!!" and I said that without batting an eye!  Me not knowing the area at all it was a life saver for us...lol Pink Cookie and I had a great day of letterboxing with some wonderful gals!<br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; And we might have been the last group to get to the restaurant to eat with everyone that afternoon... . but when we walked in the door it felt like a room full of family!  Everyone was so excited to meet us and we were so happy to put faces and trail names to owners of letterboxes that we had found on the trail and meet some of the names we had seen stamped in boxes too!  If this is your first event you will feel it too, just wait and see!<br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; We are getting very excited to see our Letterboxing Friends and the meeting of new ones!<br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; C-U-Soon!!<br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Beach Bum TX &amp; Pink Cookie<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; From: Kristin Cox &lt;mrskristincox@ gmail.com&gt;<br/>&gt; To: letterboxingtexas@ yahoogroups. com<br/>&gt; Sent: Wed, March 3, 2010 6:05:10 PM<br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] My excitement is now nervousness<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;   <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I remember my first event and I was so scared I would have skipped it if I hadn't promised to bring my friends' daughters.  But it was so much fun!  JBK, Lucy and GG were so kind! But I missed getting to meet Perky P that time so I am excited to meet you this time!<br/>&gt; Maydelle QueenBee <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; On Mar 3, 2010 5:46 PM, "Barefoot Lucy" &lt;barefootlucy@ gmail.com&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;   <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Pam,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; You're so funny!  I can just see Blue Butterfly yelling, but I'll bet she doesn't yell with her mouth - I think she yells with her EYES!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I am a terribly slow stamper, so sit next to me.  Of course, we don't really do the assembly line type stamping - more like little mini-stampings all over the place.  And I always manage to stamp my own logbook at least once, get two or three stamps upside down (even when they have a little arrow on the backside pointing UP), and forget to stamp one logbook or another.  I've never run away with any boxes into the ladies' room though - that'll be a first if you do it!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It'sa gonna be fun, even if Blue Butterfly yells.  In fact, that might make it MORE fun!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; On Wed, Mar 3, 2010 at 8:17 AM, Pam Rodgers perky_p_99@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;  <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; You know how...-- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>&gt;<br/></p>
