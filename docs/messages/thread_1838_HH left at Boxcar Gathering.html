                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!  Hope the rest of your spring is going well.  It looks like<br/>
there's still a lot of boxing going on down there.<br/>
<br/>
I left 2 baseball hitch hikers during the gathering but forgot to<br/>
write down which boxes I left them in.  Did anyone pick them up?  If<br/>
so could you let me know where they were or are so I can post them.<br/>
<br/>
On that note, since Pete &amp; Wanda aren't keeping up with the new ones<br/>
where do you guys post them now?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
