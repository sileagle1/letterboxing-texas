aren't going to like me very much after I say it, but hopefully they
will read to the end before they make a permanent judgment of me. <br/><br/>Girl Scouts scare letterboxers.<br/><br/>"Why?" You ask... Or maybe, you're singing "Amen sistahhhh!"<br/><br/>Before
I explain, let me say that a few bad apples DO spoil the barrel. I,
and most letterboxers, realize that. I know of a few notable Girl
Scout leaders who are also outstanding letterboxers - Texas Pokey, Frog
Kisses, GingerCat, and I know there are others I am forgetting and
there are leaders whose habits I know nothing of.<br/><br/>My first
instinct, when someone announces they are a girl scout leader and they
are so excited about taking their troop letterboxing, is to batten down
my boxes. I can't tell you how many times I've followed the tell-tale
plethora of cutesy store-bought stamps with names signed with hearts
over the i's and lots of loopy letters, and found the box uncovered or
cracked a bit or baggies missing. The next hint is the logbook
consumed by said cutesy stamps, so that there are scarcely enough pages
for future visitors. And worse, the leaders rarely log the find and
inform the planter that they just took up 12 pages of a logbook with
said cutesy stamps. The logbook is less the issue that the box
uncovered, or things missing from it, or baggies unsealed or gone, or
the box not sealed properly. <br/><br/>My gut feeling is that the Girl
Scout program does a poor job of communicating to leaders the couple of
ideas that make letterboxing different than, say, bowling. <br/><br/>First
of all, visiting a letterbox is a little bit like visiting someone's
house - you ARE, after all, peeking at something made with someone's
own hand, something they've made available to you and others for your
enjoyment. If someone invited your troop to their home to view their
china doll collection, would you let the girls pick up all the dolls
and pass them around, and would you shrug it off if one of the girls
broke one of the dolls? <br/><br/>The other concept is that the girls
are sharing the box with others and they become a part of the
interpersonal dynamics of the box, so monopolizing it or not caring for
it properly cuts short the forward dynamic.<br/><br/>I'm very nearly
positive that the leaders who find themselves onto this or other lists
are not the problem leaders (I hold that the problem is NOT the girls,
but the leaders who manage the girls). If you are a girl scout leader
and you are here, you are probable trying to explore and learn about
the activity.<br/><br/>I've heard of far too many boxes that have been
ravaged by an enthusiastic troop. I've not had that problem with my
Girl Scout series (Yes, I do like Girl Scouts enough to plant a series
just for them), but my clues are restricted - you have to ask me for
them.<br/><br/>I would like to ask the Girl Scout leaders on this list to
comment on my observations.I don't care for this to become a flame
war, but I would love for us all to communicate positively and manage
to find a way to get through to the leaders who AREN'T on this list and
who are more likely part of the problem.<br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

<div>I think it's one of those things that you have to approach slowly. Not a one meeting, carve a stamp; next meeting, go find a box, kind of thing.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm a Girl Scout leader with 2 daughters in Girl Scouts, and I discovered letterboxing through a Girl Scout publication.  I've only done letterboxing with my own kids & not as a troop activity.  However, I can't see Girl Scout leaders making any more "mistakes" than any other person new to the sport.  If you want to ensure newcomers (Girl Scouts or otherwise) follow a particular etiquette for your box/logbook, why not include those instructions inside the box itself?<br>
<br>
As for "cutesy store-bought stamps" - my kids & I have used them.  It didn't have anything to do with our affiliation with Girl Scouts, but rather because, as newcomers, we needed to find a few boxes first to know anything about what we were supposed to be doing.  I'd never even seen a hand-carved stamp before finding my first letterbox, so making one before I started was out of the question.  My girls each log their finds (although we use as little space as possible) and sign their own names (in the loopy, heart-dotted style that is typical of school-aged girls).  They do the hard work to find the boxes just like anyone else - why wouldn't their stamps & signatures be valued as much as anyone's?<br>
<br>
My family was so excited about letterboxing a couple months ago, which is why I joined this group.  There is some great information to be had here, for sure, and you seem like a wonderful community of people.  But, as an outsider, I have to tell you that some of the posts I read seem so elitist...they have really soured my taste for the sport altogether.<br>

<br>
My recommendation would be to contact the Council in the areas that<br>
you've had problems with your boxes and ask/offer to do a presentation<br>
on boxing at a leaders' meeting.  Or, if there's a Council newsletter<br>
that goes to the leaders, write an article about boxing etiquette, and<br>
explain the problems you've seen when you submit the article to the<br>
editor.<br>
<br>
If I remember the boundaries correctly, and if I'm right in assuming<br>
that you've planted the majority of your boxes in your region, it's<br>
probably San Jacinto Council or Northeast Texas.<br>
<br>
And if you REALLY want to be proactive, you (and/or other like-minded<br>
boxers) could see about volunteering at Cadette Event - demonstrating<br>
carving techniques, talking about boxing etiquette, etc., directly to<br>
the girls who are interested.<br>
<br>
Some people are good at trail etiquette (boxing and otherwise), and<br>
some are not.  It's not always carelessness; sometimes it's outright<br>
cluelessness.  Cluelessness, IMO, can be helped with some thoughtful<br>
guidance and a desire to learn on the part of the beginner.  Over the<br>
two decades that I was involved with SJGSC, I met some leaders who<br>
really had it together and were very, very good at what they did, and<br>
I met some leaders who seemed to hate what they were doing.  The girls<br>
that were with the latter were equally unenthusiastic and I always<br>
wondered what they were doing in the woods if every last one of them<br>
wanted to be at the mall.<br>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">But yes, Ive done as youve suggested and have done classes for GS units on occasion and Ive contacted the local council folk to offer my time and put my name out there as one who is willing to go to various troops in my area, or to do breakouts at leader trainings.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Ive done this because 1) I really like scouts and scouting and I think scouts have a lot to offer to letterboxing and letterboxing has a lot to offer scouts, and 2) because it is a measure of self-preservation  if they understand the game better, they will be better letterboxers and local boxes will be safer.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Ive thoroughly enjoyed the opportunity to work with the girls (as a long-time Cub Scout leader, its refreshing to work with sweet girls instead of rough and tumble boys every now and then).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I would like to point out that the primary reason Girl Scouts catch the brunt of the complaint is because GSUSA actually has a letterboxing objective for the girls.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>I can promise you we would be having complaints about Boy Scouts, Cub Scouts, 4-Hers, church groups, and homeschool groups too, if they had an organized program that highlighted letterboxing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Most letterboxers dont WANT to be exclusionary toward any group, but they do want their boxes to be handled responsibly.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>Perhaps we CAN do a better job of reaching into the GS community and educating leaders.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>But you know, I think GS leaders who have gone to the trouble of educating themselves first would probably be much more effective in reaching other leaders.</p>

<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">Personally, I did not hear about Letterboxing from Girl Scouts; I had never heard of it until a new friend was telling me about it.  I started letterboxing with my daughter as a new hobby for us, not the troop.  I researched and surf the web for all the information I could find for months before I even considered giving it a try.    We were well prepared before we hit the trail to find that first box but that is just the way I am... not all are.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;"></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;"></span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;"><o>I am in the region of the Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas Council,  I am a Service Unit Member and Troop Leader </o></span>of 12 girls - from Daisies to Juniors.   Is Letterboxing  something that I think would be great for the girls to experience?..YES.   Would I tramp through the trails with 12 girls and 3 or 4 adults looking for a box? .. huh  NO.   I think if I decide to introduce my girls to Letterboxing it would be with boxes I made just for them to find on camping trips or boxes that I would plant just for "Girl Scouts".  Then if they wanted to expand the hobby further they would do so with their parents.</span><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;"><o> </o></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">As in any game or sport you have the good and the bad players.  So in Letterboxing that would include players from Girl Scouts; Boy Scouts; Home Schoolers; Church Groups; Newbie's and Oldies .  Any "group" that has game activities has those "un-educated" or the "just don't care" about the "rules" that will stand out in a crowd like a sore thumb. </span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">Being a "Newbie", every box that we have found so far (10) I have made an extra effort to make sure that everything is tidy and neat when we rehide.  I have replaced bags that were torn; cleaned very dirty stamps with wet paper towel's as suggested; contacted placers if the box was missing or log book filled; we even left blank index cards in one to help out.    We have hunted for boxes that havent been found in years to just practice with the clues.    I treat every box we find as if it was our own and I teach my daughter to "do unto other's as you would like other's to do to your's" motto.  She is only 7 and she understands this more than some adults do or ever will.</span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">If it is a really big issue for some...  A suggestion would be to put one of those restrictions on boxes that you do not want "Girl Scouts" or other "groups" to find. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt;FONT-FAMILY: Georgia;">That's just my view, </span></p>

Or, if there's a Council newsletter<br/>&gt; that goes to the leaders, write an article about boxing etiquette, and<br/>&gt; explain the problems you've seen when you submit the article to the<br/>&gt; editor.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If I remember the boundaries correctly, and if I'm right in assuming<br/>&gt; that you've planted the majority of your boxes in your region, it's<br/>&gt; probably San Jacinto Council or Northeast Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And if you REALLY want to be proactive, you (and/or other like-minded<br/>&gt; boxers) could see about volunteering at Cadette Event - demonstrating<br/>&gt; carving techniques, talking about boxing etiquette, etc., directly to<br/>&gt; the girls who are interested.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Some people are good at trail etiquette (boxing and otherwise), and<br/>&gt; some are not. It's not always carelessness; sometimes it's outright<br/>&gt; cluelessness. Cluelessness, IMO, can be helped with some thoughtful<br/>&gt; guidance and a desire to learn on the part of the beginner. Over the<br/>&gt; two decades that I was involved with SJGSC, I met some leaders who<br/>&gt; really had it together and were very, very good at what they did, and<br/>&gt; I met some leaders who seemed to hate what they were doing. The girls<br/>&gt; that were with the latter were equally unenthusiastic and I always<br/>&gt; wondered what they were doing in the woods if every last one of them<br/>&gt; wanted to be at the mall.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; wen<br/>&gt;<br/></p>

I know that I have been missing for awhile but my kids social schedules always seem to outrank mine. :)  My mom told me you were talking about me, so I thought I would drop by and see why.  I am glad that it is good stuff.<br>
<br>
My answers are very similar to several others.  I have a small troop 1 brownie, 5 Jrs & 1 Cadette.  We did discover letterboxing through the Cadette/Senior IP(Interest Project) High Tech Hide N Seek which which is designed for girls 6th grade and up.  We started with my daughter (horserider1) working on the IP.  We did alot of reading and research before I drove her out to find her first box - she even had carved her own stamp following directions on letterboxing.org using the end of a pencil.  It took off from there.  About 9 months after she started we did it as a troop activity  - she earned part of her Jr Aide badge by teaching the Jrs. and helping them earn their "Doing Hobbies" badge.  We only took our Troop to boxes we had planted and several of my girls have continued with their parents.  <br>
<br>
My suggestion for trying to get any new leaders educated about letterboxing would be to put together a "Letterboxing Program in a box".  Samples of what boxes and stamps look like could be included. All the service centers (there are 5 in the Northeast Texas council) have these "Programs in a Box" that leaders can check out for a deposit. <br>
 An example of one is:<br>
"OLDER GIRL RESOURCE BOX $25 ($20 refundable deposit; $5 nonrefundable fee = $25) <br>
Available at: All Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas Service Centers.<br>
<br>
All the Studio 2B resources to review for advisors and Girl Scout Cadettes, Seniors and Ambassadors. All current Focus Books are included to allow the girls a chance to browse and select activities that interest them, as well as the Girl Scout Silver and Gold Binder." <br>
<br>
The other idea is every year in August we get this lovely book called Connections that gives dates of training, council sponsered events, general program info, forms and such.  Maybe an informational page could be included in it.<br>

<div>I'm a Girl Scout leader with 2 daughters in Girl Scouts, and I discovered letterboxing through a Girl Scout publication. I've only done letterboxing with my own kids &amp; not as a troop activity. However, I can't see Girl Scout leaders making any more "mistakes" than any other person new to the sport. If you want to ensure newcomers (Girl Scouts or otherwise) follow a particular etiquette for your box/logbook, why not include those instructions inside the box itself?<br/><br/>As for "cutesy store-bought stamps" - my kids &amp; I have used them. It didn't have anything to do with our affiliation with Girl Scouts, but rather because, as newcomers, we needed to find a few boxes first to know anything about what we were supposed to be doing.. I'd never even seen a hand-carved stamp before finding my first letterbox, so making one before I started was out of the question. My girls each log their finds (although we use as little space as possible) and sign
 their own names (in the loopy, heart-dotted style that is typical of school-aged girls). They do the hard work to find the boxes just like anyone else - why wouldn't their stamps &amp; signatures be valued as much as anyone's?<br/><br/>My family was so excited about letterboxing a couple months ago, which is why I joined this group. There is some great information to be had here, for sure, and you seem like a wonderful community of people. But, as an outsider, I have to tell you that some of the posts I read seem so elitist...they have really soured my taste for the sport altogether.<br/><br/>Over &amp; out,<br/>Testa Rossa<br/><br/>--- In <a href="http://us.mc1100.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" ymailto="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@ yahoogroups. com</a>, Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@ ...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I have something to say, and I'm just gonna say

 <br/>&gt; I've heard of far too many boxes that have been ravaged by an enthusiastic<br/>&gt; troop. I've not had that problem with my Girl Scout series (Yes, I do like<br/>&gt; Girl Scouts enough to plant a series just for them), but my clues are<br/>&gt; restricted - you have to ask me for them.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I would like to ask the Girl Scout leaders on this list to comment on my<br/>&gt; observations. I don't care for this to become a flame war, but I would<br/>&gt; love for us all to communicate positively and manage to find a way to get<br/>&gt; through to the leaders who AREN'T on this list and who are more likely part<br/>&gt; of the problem.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone!!  I've been out of touch for a long while but still keeping up by reading the group digest.  My life's just been too crazy for the last few years to do much letterboxing.  Ironically, I've been kept busy doing some new demanding Girl Scout volunteer jobs.  One of those is as a San Jacinto Council trainer. <br>
<br>
For the past few years I have taught a letterboxing training at big leader training weekends.   We've retired that training for a while, but may offer it again in the future.  I took about 30 leaders at each training and went through the basics of letterboxing: all the etiquette & supplies.  I demonstrated how to carve a stamp and they created their own logbook and a small "stamp" using cut pieces of fun foam mounted to a film canister.   In the training I repeatedly stressed boxing responsibly!!  I suggested that when first learning, troops could divide in half and create their own temporary boxes for the other half to find.  My troop planted many boxes at the Girl Scout camps and encouraged troops to find those boxes if they want to box as a group - thereby keeping public boxes safe and less threatened by young inexperienced boxers, but still allowing the girls to enjoy the 'thrill of the hunt'.<br>
The program went over well and I think a lot of new informed boxing leaders came out of it.  We were doing pretty well stocking the camps with boxes, but then IKE sadly washed most of them away.  Hopefully we can get things going again this coming year now that the fallen trees and debris are mostly cleared.<br>
<br>
I have considered developing a Green Apple training (an online self guided mini-training that leaders can download and take on their own or present to a small group) for the council about letterboxing since it does seem to be gaining wider knowledge.   That way those interested might be exposed to more of the etiquette and it would be another opportunity to stress the responsibility involved.   But I don't want to open the door to more casual (i.e. not careful) boxers joining the sport.  But on the other hand, if they are already out there leaving boxes exposed and baggies unsealed, it might be a good way to get the message across to them to be responsible.  Any thoughts?  I certainly don't want to do anything that would be harmful to public boxes or offend my letterboxing friends.<br>

                    <html><body><p>As a Girl Scout leader, I have taken my girls letterboxing. What we did was have a troop stamp (and no, I'm not carving my stamps, sorry) that we put in the logbook. Then they put the letterbox stamp in THEIR books. It makes it a lot simpler -- mostly because I don't have to wait for them ALL to stamp in the book. When we go as a family, we all put our stamps in the logbook, but we can USUALLY fit it on one page. And, yes, they're cutesy store bought ones. ;) Anyway, just throwing out what we do in case it helps others to make suggestions. deb :)

<div></div>
<div>I won't bore you with all the details, but if you look back through the archives of this list, you can see that I've long been a proponent of letterboxing with scouts - if done responsibly. ThimbleCat, who I was so glad to see posted, was gracious enough to give me her outline that she has used when teaching Girl Scout leaders about letterboxing as I prepared a few years ago to talk to Girl Scouts about boxing.</div>
<div></div>
<div>You who are involved in Girl Scoutshave had some very good ideas in how to address the problems that arise as a result of poor leadership astroops box, but I still maintain that Y'ALL are the letterboxing world's best friend when it comes to reaching those leaders who need some "help". If GS is anything like CS, there ARE those leaders who cannot/will not ever be helped, but I'm betting there are those who unknowingly cause problems (cluelessness was the word BeachBum used). As I mentioned in my first post, I don't worry so much about the leaders that show up on the various boards - those leaders who stay on the boards and ask questions and listen to what letterboxers say are the ones who are doing a good job of leading GS as they learn about letterboxing. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyway, I appreciate all the comments that have come across. I hope we have all taken time to read them over and think how we can be part of the solution - I feel certain that if you are a GS leader and you want to tackle the challenge as you network with other leaders, you will have the support, encouragement, and assistance of other letterboxers who don't have an "in" in the GS community. I know I'll be glad to help in any way I can!</div>
<div></div>
<div>By the way, I do need to make one apology - I did not mean to incite the whole never-endingstore-bought vs carved stamp debate again. My only reason to bring that up was to point out that a whole passel of store-bought stamps in a logbook and laced with girly writing is a sure-fire sign a large troop has been through. I'm not faulting them for using store-boughts, not blaming them for writing like the girls they are - just making the point that they leave tell-tale evidence of who they are behind!</div>
<div></div>
<div>Anyway, if I've really made anyone angry or upset, that was not my intention. If you feel I owe you an apology, feel free to contact me off-list and I will gladly apologize to you if it means we can be friends.</div>

<div>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy"</div>
<div></div>
<div>P.S. Some folks seemed not to understand HOW the problem arises from Girl Scouts (or any large group of people), so I thought I would write a scenario that might help visualize:</div>
<div></div>
<div></div>
<div>GS leader hears about letterboxing and gets very enthusiastic about it and wants to share it with her girls right away. She goes and buys a bunch of store-bought stamps so she doesn't have to count on the parents to remember to go buy one themselves, she prints out some clues in a park nearby and makes enough copies for everyone, and at the next meeting she meets at the park and they all go letterboxing together - all 10 girls,4 adults (only two of which are leaders, which mean the other two are parents, who can be worse than scouts sometimes when it comes to managing them!), 3 siblings, and maybe even a dog or two. </div>
<div></div>
<div>They loudly (because a group of 10 girls MUST be loud!) proceed down trails looking for signs in the clues. One girl spots the tree described in the clues, hollers back for the rest of them and they all come running. Meanwhile the first girl takes off, hot on the trail of the box. She finds it, snags it and takes it back to the trail to display her triumph. They all sit down in the sidewalk to stamp in, but the first girl finishes first and gets bored waiting, so she heads off to figure out the next one. Meanwhile, as the girls are stamping in, they aren't paying real close attention and they wind up not leaving room for anyone else to stamp in on their same page. Next thing they know, they are out of pages, and there are still three girls left to stamp in. They stamp on the backs of pages, but they don't notice that it bleeds through. One of the girls gets smart and flips back to the very first of the book and stamps over the first finder's stamp - it was an old one anyway, so it should be okay. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Meanwhile, that poor little ol' girl that was last to stamp in was really bummed because everyone had run ahead and she was lagging behind - AND she's stuck with the box. She goes and tries to figure out where it came from, but she's not quite sure. She shoves it in a hole in a tree and hopes it's the right one. Hopefully she thinks to throw a few leaves over it. So on they go - and as they find more and more boxes, the excitement builds, andthe giddies strike,and then the fatigue starts to hit. They worry less about baggies or who has them and what goes in them. The box is already sealed up, so they just put the baggies in their pockets (theyknow their LNT)and don't see why it would matter if they were in there anyway- the box is made of plastic after all. </div>
<div></div>
<div>That poor little girl that was last at the first box has never managed to catch up, and in her frenzy to at least maybe get to be the finder of one box, she sort of puts the lid on and shoves it somewhere close to the hiding place again - the leader is, after all, rushing her to hurry up so she can keep an eye on the girls in the lead too. The day done, the leader tired and overwhelmed by trying to keep all those people corraled, calls letterboxing a done deal and moves on to campfire cooking or something else fun and entertaining. </div>
<div></div>
<div>This could be any group of kids, by the way, but we're trying to figure out a way to fix the bad rep Girl Scouts are getting...</div>
<div></div>
<div>You can see how it can happen - it's likely a well-meaning leader, but maybe not very good at planning ahead. The girls are probably pretty good girls, but they may not see the whole big picture of how their actions affect their surroundings. Maybe all these problems wouldn't arise on one outing, but you can see how the snowball effect can compound the issues as the trip carries on.</div>

                    <html><body><p>I think the key word here was <em><u>"group"</u></em> -- and as you so vividly painted, Lucy, it's likely the fact of any <em><u>group</u></em> of finders, especially if that group is mostly kids, that creates the situations that cause such negative feelings among letterboxers, and for exactly the reasons you described.  I've had the misfortune more than once of finding my own boxes sitting right out in the open, baggies open to the sky, no box top to be found anywhere, immediately next to a trail as I happened to be walking, only two days after planting the box (and after only one group of finders had stamped into the log).  <br/>
<br/>
Someone responded about an "elitist tone" on this list.  I can understand that, personally.  When a person creates a letterbox (by coming up with an original idea, carving a unique stamp, making a hand-made logbook, finding a just-right location that's interesting and fun for others to discover, covering the box with camo-tape or painting it to help disguise it in the wild, hiding the box where it can be safely retrieved without causing eco-damage and yet safely hidden, and then writing and posting clues that are possibly entertaining or informative and posting those clues on two sites, all of which costs in terms of time, effort, some money, and well, intellectual energy!), one feels some sort of artistic authorship and pride, yes, even <em>elitist</em> pride, in their creation.  One expects finders to enjoy the experience, but also to exercise some responsibility, too, and to respect the letterbox and the planter enough to be careful in finding, stamping, and !
replanting so that future finders can also enjoy the experience.  Maybe it is an elitist attitude, hoping that participants in the game will behave responsibly and respectfully and with care, but if so, then maybe it's an <em>appropriate</em> elitism.  <br/>
<br/>
I have found that when I create puzzle clues for boxes I'm particularly concerned about, maybe because of a sensitive location or a particularly meaningful stamp, the number of casual and careless finders drops to almost zero, so that's my preferred solution, and that certainly is elitist because it does restrict the finders to those who take the time to work out the puzzle.   I'm not sure that a little elitism is necessarily a bad thing. <br/>

Message: <br>
Dear Lonestar Quilter,<br>
I returned today from a camping trip at Lake Somerville with my campfire group.  As we were leaving I picked up a few unclaimed things on the campsite table: a plastic box, a booklet with Bluebonnet Quilt block series in a plastic bag and a stamp in a plastic bag.  I was just getting ready to send an email to the group when I read the note inside the box cover and found you on this site.  One of our kids must have found it, opened and put the contents on the table.  Is there an address I can send it to?  I live in Austin Texas.<br>
Thanks,<br>
Amy<br>
<br>
I sent her my address and expect to get my box back in a few days.  Maybe I'll replace it in a different place.<br>

<p>I thought I'd pass on a note that I got today concerning my letterbox at Lake Somerville called "Bluebonnet Square - Quilt Block Series".  It was reported missing a while back, then today I got this email:<br/>

Message: <br/>
Dear Lonestar Quilter,<br/>
I returned today from a camping trip at Lake Somerville with my campfire group.  As we were leaving I picked up a few unclaimed things on the campsite table: a plastic box, a booklet with Bluebonnet Quilt block series in a plastic bag and a stamp in a plastic bag.  I was just getting ready to send an email to the group when I read the note inside the box cover and found you on this site.  One of our kids must have found it, opened and put the contents on the table.  Is there an address I can send it to?  I live in Austin Texas.<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Amy<br/>
<br/>
I sent her my address and expect to get my box back in a few days.  Maybe I'll replace it in a different place.<br/>

&gt; Crawdaddy, you're right - my intent was NOT to offend, maybe to agitate a<br/>
&gt; bit for the sake of honest thought and discussion, but not to offend.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My thought in even posing the question was this:  Wouldn't you rather know<br/>
&gt; the perception and be a part of the solution?  I didn't create the<br/>
&gt; perception of Girl Scout troops in letterboxing, nor do I embrace it,<br/>
&gt; but the perception is still out there whether we want it to be or not.<br/>
&gt; Wouldn't it be much nicer to attack that perception with a wave of<br/>
&gt; ambassadorship and proactive education than to be victimized by it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I won't bore you with all the details, but if you look back through the<br/>
&gt; archives of this list, you can see that I've long been a proponent of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing with scouts - if done responsibly.  ThimbleCat, who I was so<br/>
&gt; glad to see posted, was gracious enough to give me her outline that she has<br/>
&gt; used when teaching Girl Scout leaders about letterboxing as I prepared a few<br/>
&gt; years ago to talk to Girl Scouts about boxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You who are involved in Girl Scouts have had some very good ideas in how to<br/>
&gt; address the problems that arise as a result of poor leadership as troops<br/>
&gt; box, but I still maintain that Y'ALL are the letterboxing world's best<br/>
&gt; friend when it comes to reaching those leaders who need some "help".  If GS<br/>
&gt; is anything like CS, there ARE those leaders who cannot/will not ever be<br/>
&gt; helped, but I'm betting there are those who unknowingly cause problems<br/>
&gt; (cluelessness was the word BeachBum used).  As I mentioned in my first post,<br/>
&gt; I don't worry so much about the leaders that show up on the various boards -<br/>
&gt; those leaders who stay on the boards and ask questions and listen to what<br/>
&gt; letterboxers say are the ones who are doing a good job of leading GS as they<br/>
&gt; learn about letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I appreciate all the comments that have come across.  I hope we have<br/>
&gt; all taken time to read them over and think how we can be part of the<br/>
&gt; solution - I feel certain that if you are a GS leader and you want to tackle<br/>
&gt; the challenge as you network with other leaders, you will have the support,<br/>
&gt; encouragement, and assistance of other letterboxers who don't have an "in"<br/>
&gt; in the GS community.  I know I'll be glad to help in any way I can!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; By the way, I do need to make one apology - I did not mean to incite the<br/>
&gt; whole never-ending store-bought vs carved stamp debate again.  My only<br/>
&gt; reason to bring that up was to point out that a whole passel of store-bought<br/>
&gt; stamps in a logbook and laced with girly writing is a sure-fire sign a large<br/>
&gt; troop has been through.  I'm not faulting them for using store-boughts, not<br/>
&gt; blaming them for writing like the girls they are - just making the point<br/>
&gt; that they leave tell-tale evidence of who they are behind!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, if I've really made anyone angry or upset, that was not my<br/>
&gt; intention.  If you feel I owe you an apology, feel free to contact me<br/>
&gt; off-list and I will gladly apologize to you if it means we can be friends.<br/>

&gt; "Not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.  Some folks seemed not to understand HOW the problem arises from Girl<br/>
&gt; Scouts (or any large group of people), so I thought I would write a scenario<br/>
&gt; that might help visualize:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GS leader hears about letterboxing and gets very enthusiastic about it and<br/>
&gt; wants to share it with her girls right away.  She goes and buys a bunch of<br/>
&gt; store-bought stamps so she doesn't have to count on the parents to remember<br/>
&gt; to go buy one themselves, she prints out some clues in a park nearby and<br/>
&gt; makes enough copies for everyone, and at the next meeting she meets at the<br/>
&gt; park and they all go letterboxing together - all 10 girls, 4 adults (only<br/>
&gt; two of which are leaders, which mean the other two are parents, who can be<br/>
&gt; worse than scouts sometimes when it comes to managing them!), 3 siblings,<br/>
&gt; and maybe even a dog or two.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; They loudly (because a group of 10 girls MUST be loud!) proceed down trails<br/>
&gt; looking for signs in the clues.  One girl spots the tree described in the<br/>
&gt; clues, hollers back for the rest of them and they all come running.<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile the first girl takes off, hot on the trail of the box.  She finds<br/>
&gt; it, snags it and takes it back to the trail to display her triumph.  They<br/>
&gt; all sit down in the sidewalk to stamp in, but the first girl finishes first<br/>
&gt; and gets bored waiting, so she heads off to figure out the next one.<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, as the girls are stamping in, they aren't paying real close<br/>
&gt; attention and they wind up not leaving room for anyone else to stamp in on<br/>
&gt; their same page.  Next thing they know, they are out of pages, and there are<br/>
&gt; still three girls left to stamp in.  They stamp on the backs of pages, but<br/>
&gt; they don't notice that it bleeds through.  One of the girls gets smart and<br/>
&gt; flips back to the very first of the book and stamps over the first finder's<br/>
&gt; stamp - it was an old one anyway, so it should be okay.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, that poor little ol' girl that was last to stamp in was really<br/>
&gt; bummed because everyone had run ahead and she was lagging behind - AND she's<br/>
&gt; stuck with the box.  She goes and tries to figure out where it came from,<br/>
&gt; but she's not quite sure.  She shoves it in a hole in a tree and hopes it's<br/>
&gt; the right one.  Hopefully she thinks to throw a few leaves over it.  So on<br/>
&gt; they go - and as they find more and more boxes, the excitement builds,<br/>
&gt; and the giddies strike, and then the fatigue starts to hit.  They worry less<br/>
&gt; about baggies or who has them and what goes in them.  The box is already<br/>
&gt; sealed up, so they just put the baggies in their pockets (they know their<br/>
&gt; LNT) and don't see why it would matter if they were in there anyway - the<br/>
&gt; box is made of plastic after all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That poor little girl that was last at the first box has never managed to<br/>
&gt; catch up, and in her frenzy to at least maybe get to be the finder of one<br/>
&gt; box, she  sort of puts the lid on and shoves it somewhere close to the<br/>
&gt; hiding place again - the leader is, after all, rushing her to hurry up so<br/>
&gt; she can keep an eye on the girls in the lead too.  The day done, the leader<br/>
&gt; tired and overwhelmed by trying to keep all those people corraled, calls<br/>
&gt; letterboxing a done deal and moves on to campfire cooking or something else<br/>
&gt; fun and entertaining.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This could be any group of kids, by the way, but we're trying to figure out<br/>
&gt; a way to fix the bad rep Girl Scouts are getting...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can see how it can happen - it's likely a well-meaning leader, but maybe<br/>
&gt; not very good at planning ahead.  The girls are probably pretty good girls,<br/>
&gt; but they may not see the whole big picture of how their actions affect their<br/>
&gt; surroundings.  Maybe all these problems wouldn't arise on one outing, but<br/>
&gt; you can see how the snowball effect can compound the issues as the trip<br/>
&gt; carries on.<br/>
