Did you know they have a 4th of July in Germany?  They sure do - it is on<br/>
every calendar.  Spelled 04 Juli.  It just isn't a holiday except on the<br/>
military bases.<br/>
<br/>
I do not think we are going to be doing any boxing over there.  I have not<br/>
been successful in finding any information about letterboxes in Germany, and<br/>
we already have a plate full for the 2+ weeks we will be there.  I do have 3<br/>
hikes planned though, and a lot of radio operating with my old friends.<br/>
Probably some hiking in conjunction with radio operating as that is popular<br/>
there.<br/>
<br/>
If you would like to see a little bit about where we are going, watch this<br/>
web cam.<br/>
http://www.leder-weiss.de/lederweisswebcamschweinfurt.html <br/>
<br/>
If you look at the right edge about half-way up, you will see a sidewalk<br/>
cafe.  I will certainly be having lunch there one day.  The building in the<br/>
top right with the spire is the City Hall.<br/>
<br/>
There are 3 summits I will climb.  The first is the Wasserkuppe.  It is the<br/>
highest summit in the Rhone Mountains of northern Bavaria.  Web Cam.<br/>
http://www.wasserkuppe.com/wetter.html <br/>
<br/>
The second summit I climb will be the Kreutzberg.  The reward for climbing<br/>
this one is the monk monastery at the top.  The beer!  The food is to die<br/>
for.  http://www.kreuzbergbier.de/content/kb_webcam.php <br/>
<br/>
The third summit has an old castle ruin and I just want to climb it to look<br/>
around.<br/>
<br/>
Right now in Germany sunrise is about 0430, and sunset about 2100.  I will<br/>
make use of every hour.<br/>
<br/>
Hope you-all have a safe and happy 4th.  I will not be thinking of you.<br/>
<grin>.<br/>

<div>Hi, Mike,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here is a German letterboxing website:  <a href="http://www.letterboxing-germany.de/index.html" title="http://www.letterboxing-germany.de/index.html">http://www.letterboxing-germany.de/index.html</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>In <a href="http://www.AtlasQuest.com">www.AtlasQuest.com</a>, under Simple 
Search, then under Area Search -- a search for Germany turns up 44 boxes.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I found 5 boxes in <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> by typing “Germany” 
in the Search Location box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have a great trip!</div>
