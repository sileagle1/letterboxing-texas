at the time, and decided that since I enjoy letterboxing so much, <br/>
and so does her son (my grandson), who goes with me frequently, that <br/>
she would get into it too. But after the one box, and the snafu with <br/>
the database, she began a new job, and got involved in show goats <br/>
and 4-H, so letterboxing fell by the wayside for her. I reminded her <br/>
for quite a while to pleeeease try again to post the clues, but she <br/>
had kind of fogotten what her original clues were, I think. I will <br/>
ask her again.  From what I remember, it was on the birding trail <br/>
with all those birdhouses, not too, too far in. I think it was on <br/>
the right, and behind? a tree. Not very helpful I know, but the best <br/>
I can do right now. Although we went there together, I didn't go <br/>
with her to hide it. I stayed in the car with the baby. And I don't <br/>
remember the name or theme of the box. <br/>

&gt; I hope to be coming to Choke Canyon the week of Thanksgiving,<br/>
&gt; so was wondering if this box (and any others not posted) will<br/>
&gt; be posted to LBNA soon?  Thanks.<br/>
