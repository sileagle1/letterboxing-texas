i have been out checking on my boxes today and wanted<br>
to take the extra moment to say thanks to everyone who<br>
has taken such good care of things over the past year.<br>
 each box i checked was still there, well covered, and<br>
dry!  "plays well with others" is what would make a<br>
great motto for the texas letterboxers.  :) <br>

I said sure, but I get to get one box. So, I chose my box and told her we were going to stop and get a handpressed burger and hand dipped shakes (don't worry, I'm sure they wash that hand in between). So, Friday night I went to Kia of Irving and purchased a new to me minivan. Well, lucky for me, it had to have the 30,000 mile service on it. So, they gave me a brand spanking new Kia Spectra to drive, with a full tank. I told the guy I 'had' to go to Terrell the next day and would pick up my car on the way back (you can not say I didn't warn them). </div> <div> </div> <div>So, at 8:30 I called mom and said to be waiting on the freeway we were on our way, lol. We made it to Terrell by 11:00 and did what we had to do there, which involved 3 bags.
 Did you know you could get 4 hollow bunnies, of a good size, for only 1.25? Or, you could get one of the same for .99. Yeah, we left with 4.</div> <div> </div> <div>I looked over at mom and saw a book in her purse. I said, "Don't think your going to read while I drive." She says, 'No, that's for while you are out hiking the trail. I'm going to stay in the car and read." I replied, "The box in the bathroom at the restaurant, silly."</div> <div> </div> <div>So, we made it to Ben Wheeler with absolutely no problems. I retrieved the box with no problems. I went up to the counter to order. I asked the lady if she could tell me which way was North. She pointed behind me. I asked her if she was sure that was North. She looked at me like she was thinking she shouldn't make any sudden movements. So, I said that I was here for the letterbox. She saw that I already had it and I said that I was hoping for an exchange. I explained that an exchange was kind of
 like exchanging business cards (good one Janet). So, she said that the boxer wasn't on till 2. I told her to tell her hi for me.</div> <div> </div> <div>We sat under Maggie's picture. Cassandra actually talked Maggie's ear off while we were there. She seemed to prefer Cassie, so I didn't interupt them. I let them have their time.</div> <div> </div> <div>We ordered one burger, to share and one order of fries and one of onion rings. Just let me tell you, those were the best onion rings I have had since Big Boy closed down. They were so yummy. I ate every one of them. And, the burger was so good, but I couldn't even eat the half I had (I blame the onion rings). Mom got the chocolate shake and we couldn't even finish that either.</div> <div> </div> <div>So, we left there and decided to find some fresh eggs. We saw a sign heading West on 64 (the road that Maggie's is on) and they were out of eggs. Canton weekend and all, I guess we were silly
 for even trying. The nice lady told us where we could find some. </div> <div> </div> <div>We took her directions and ended up in Edom (if there are any boxes there, I don't want to know until at least a month from now). We didn't find any fresh eggs. So, we asked how to get back to I-20. This lady told us what road to take. So, we drove back down to that road and turned right. Then, we drove until the road forked. We stopped and asked this lady? how to get to I-20. She breathed the 100 proof answer, "Y'all are going the wrong way. You have to go back that way about 20 miles." I think she was getting more beer at the convenience store. </div> <div> </div> <div>But, she gave us the correct directions. We had taken the wrong way in Edom. I took the first one and didn't see that it was going South. We ended up 31 and 314. The map says that it's St Louis St (or near there).
