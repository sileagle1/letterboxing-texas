<br>
I sent an email to CelticLion last month.  I have a logbook of theirs <br>
from the SSC box.  I had put a new logbook in their box and would like <br>
to send the old one to them.  I haven't heard anything yet and I see <br>
they haven't signed into AQ since Oct 07.<br>
<br>
I hope they are OK and if you know how to get ahold of them, please let <br>
them know I am looking for them.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Frogkisses<br>

<div><font size="2">When I have a full logbook in my letterboxes, I generally like to leave it and just add another one if space permits (personal preference), because many boxers enjoy taking the time to look through the old logbooks to see who has been there before them. Basically, unless the owner of the box has asked you to remove it, it's probably better to just leave it and try to notify the owner. If they don't respond, at least you've tried. One thing some boxers will do is carry a couple of extra logbooks with them in their backpack and leave the extra one in the box they've found in addition to the full logbook. Of course, many boxers do want to remove their full logbooks, but it's best to check with them before removing it.</font></div>

I believe their family is on a little break from letterboxing right now, but hopefully they will be back full force before long. They certainly add a lot to this sport. My suggestion would be to just return the logbook to the box next time you find yourself down that way.</font></div>

The only reason I removed it was that it was wet and the metal spiral <br>

add anything else as it was a very small container.  Normally, I <br>
would never remove the logbook, but I didn't want it to start <br>

Thanks for the advice.<br>

like a bigger problem.<br>
