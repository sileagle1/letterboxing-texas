Mike and Moni with Parker and Justin.  12 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday - 5 Aug 2006 and Sun - 6 Aug 2006.<br/>
<br/>
This is an extensive report.  We took over 250 photos, far to many to upload<br/>
to you via E-mail.  Moni made a short slideshow you can watch here.  <br/>
<br/>
http://www.photoshow.net/bonehenge/  Click on Flood damage.<br/>
<br/>
Entered park - checked in with Danny and Robert.  Robert asked for help in<br/>
assessing damage to the park and trails.<br/>
<br/>
#1.  Nature Walk.<br/>
<br/>
The Nature Walk is about 50% destroyed.  The bridge foundation is shakey and<br/>
obviously the pressure of the water rushing by has shifter the foundation.<br/>
In my opinion, it is not a danger, but will need repair in the future.  The<br/>
bench area is in good shape, but the wash-out cut away an area to the west<br/>
of the podium.  The left fork runs out in about 75 paces and falls off into<br/>
the wash-out.  The trail is totally unmarked from that point.  The right<br/>
fork runs along for a while in good shape.  The area where it used to cross<br/>
the wash is now a bit wider.  The trail can still be seen - and the stairs<br/>
are still sound.  Once up on the high ground to the west, damage is minimal<br/>
until nearing the 1/2 way point there the wash-out had its way with the<br/>
trail.  In my opinion, the nature walk will not be back the way it was for a<br/>
long time.<br/>
<br/>
#2.  End Loop Area.<br/>
<br/>
The End Loop was not in real bad shape.  The paved roads were fully passable<br/>
with any vehicle.  The roads could stand a cleaning/sweeping, but no damage<br/>
noticed.  The dirt/rock driving paths had mild to moderate erosion.  Still,<br/>
it would be passable to all but the smallest of vehicles.  There was some<br/>
erosion at the restroom sidewalk area.  This might be a priority, not<br/>
because it is dangerous, but because if not repaired it may worsen and crack<br/>
the slab.  There was moderate erosion at paths up to the large pavilion.  It<br/>
would stop wheelchairs, but not hikers.  <br/>
<br/>
#3.  Main Road.<br/>
<br/>
Following the main road from End Loop to the Ranger Booth - we discovered<br/>
several places where erosion on the west side of the road was excessive.  It<br/>
is clear that some of the pavement has crumbled into the wash-out.  These<br/>
areas should be marked with warning cones until repaired.  The worst was<br/>
near the Aztec Cave turn-off.  In my opinion, this will take more than<br/>
filling in the holes and repairing the pavement.  Doing this alone is only<br/>
asking for it to happen again.<br/>
<br/>
#4.  Aztec Cave Area and C-3-4-5.<br/>
<br/>
The trailhead to Aztec Cave is not passable to any but the most stout of<br/>
off-road vehicle.  Within 50 feet of the cable the wash-out is at least<br/>
knee-deep.  In one area it was up to my waste.  The wash is about 50 feet<br/>
across.  Once beyond this, the trail has mild to moderate erosion, as do<br/>
C-3&amp;4.  We did not go beyond there, but it appeared that the trail might<br/>
have yet more damage in the upper wash-out.  C-5 had mile to moderate<br/>
erosion, but was fully useable.<br/>
<br/>
#5.  C-1&amp;2 area.<br/>
<br/>
The road to C-1 and 2 is not passable.  The cable post needs resetting, it<br/>
will fall over soon.  Beyond the cable and into the first right turn there<br/>
is a huge wash-out to the left side.  The edge of this wash-out is a shear<br/>
drop and crumbling.  I would avoid vehicle traffic in this area.  We parked<br/>
there and hiked in to C-1 and 2.  Both C-1 and 2 showed mild erosion, but<br/>
nothing that would make them unusable except the need to back-pack gear up<br/>
to them.<br/>
<br/>
#6.  The parking area near the maintenance park.<br/>
<br/>
This area showed little damage.  Pavilion 13 had some minor erosion under<br/>
the concrete base.  This will need to be repaired, but in my opinion is no<br/>
danger at present.  The restroom door is coming lose at the upper hinge and<br/>
the door will not close properly.  I secured the door forcefully, cut you<br/>
cannot expect visitors to do that and it will blow open and damage the door.<br/>
The pavement could use a cleaning/sweeping.  <br/>
<br/>
#7.  Road to Cottonwood Springs Trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
This road could use a cleaning/sweeping overall.  In the dip beyond the<br/>
lower Sneeds Cory entrance there is significant pavement damage.  In my<br/>
opinion, the water probably got under the pavement there and lifted it.  It<br/>
is passable to all vehicles at this time, but will need some repairs or it<br/>
will get worse.  Perhaps a culvert should be placed underneath it to stop it<br/>
from happening again.  The parking area at the trailhead was OK.  The west<br/>
side was covered in a layer of fist-sized rocks.  I would not recommend<br/>
driving on it until swept clear.  The socks may cut tires, or if pressed<br/>
into the pavement may cause damage to the pavement.  Trail to upper Sneeds<br/>
OK.  Picnic area above Sneeds OK.  The road to that picnic area has mile do<br/>
moderate erosion, passable only with a high-profile vehicle.  We did not<br/>
hike farther, but optically we can see that the bridge to Mundy's Gap is<br/>
GONE!  We were not able to see where the bridge remains went to.<br/>
<br/>
#8.  Smugglers Pass West Fork.<br/>
<br/>
The trail from Smuggler's Pass to the Elephant's Trunk is about 50%<br/>
destroyed.  The trail starts west going down, then turns left.  At the left<br/>
turn there was a MASSIVE wash-out.  The trail is gone.  The bench is there,<br/>
but covered in plant debris.  Knowing this trail, I hugged the left wall of<br/>
the wash-out.  I found the place where the trail used to climb out, because<br/>
there were two wood-pole stair steps still attached to the anchors, but no<br/>
trail under them.  Parker enjoyed jumping over them.  The trail was in good<br/>
shape for a while, but soon was washed out again.  I was able to follow the<br/>
trail because I know it.  Others light get lost.  Where the trail turns<br/>
right and climbs the switchbacks up the red wall the severe damage ends.<br/>
The switchbacks up show mild to moderate erosion, but hikers will get<br/>
through.  Above that on the ridge-line, the trail was in good shape overall<br/>
- all the way to the elephant's trunk.<br/>
<br/>
#9.  General assessment.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like the park was hit hard.  Moni and I put 12 hours total into<br/>
gathering this data.  I (and Parker) are volunteers.  But most of the time I<br/>
come out so does Moni, and she picks up trash etc too.  Seems you should<br/>
call her a volunteer and count her hours too.  Also - I removed 3<br/>
geocaches/letterboxes - and notified the owners of the situation.  All is<br/>
well - they may be replaced once the park is back in operation.<br/>
<br/>
My work-week will not allow me to participate in much through the week.<br/>
Perhaps we can do more next weekend.  I will attempt to see if any of my<br/>
hiking friends will accompany me.  Please let me know what areas you would<br/>
like me to check on next.  You know my abilities, Ron Coleman - North<br/>
Franklin - Vinton Canyon - just let me know where you need my hiking and<br/>
observation skills.<br/>
