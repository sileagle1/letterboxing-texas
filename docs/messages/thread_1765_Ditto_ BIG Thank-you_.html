to remember. Stinky Monkey (Landen) and Roarin' Lion (Brenden) had a <br>
great time. As Lucy said,the kids were great! Ours were completly worn <br>
out when we got home. As we were getting ready for church this <br>
morning, Roarin' Lion said "can we go find some more clues?" They love <br>
it and so do we. Thanks for the kind welcome you all gave our team. <br>
Can't wait until we gather together again!<br>
