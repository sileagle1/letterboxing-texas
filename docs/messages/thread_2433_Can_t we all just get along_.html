<div>In the spirit of harmony and cooperation that defines the Texas 
Letterboxing group, I want to to aplogize if anything I said about not taking 
other people's letterboxes was offensive.  It certainly wasn't meant to 
be!  While I strongly believe that only the owner (that would be the 
carver, creator, placer) of the letterbox can decide to remove a letterbox, I'll 
admit that if I were boxing and saw a prairie fire about to swoop across the 
area, I'd grab that letterbox and take it with me as I ran.  Other than 
that (or a similarly drastic scenario), I'd rather try to perform whatever 
emergency rescue maintenance I could, and contact the placer.  I'd never 
arbitrarily take even a damaged box and then decide to turn it into a 
HH or cootie if the owners hadn't responded to me within a couple of 
weeks.  But that's just me.  We all have to use our own 
judgment to decide how best to respond to every situation (and we would all like 
to think everyone will use GOOD judgment if it's our own letterbox that is in 
question!).  I didn't intend to upset anyone or hurt anyone's feelings 
or abscribe malice to anyone's actions, which is why my message to Kim was 
sent privately and offline, rather than posted publicly on any list, 
since not everyone was aware of all the details of the issues anyway.  But 
since it became a public issue, I'm apologizing and wishing everyone a Happy and 
Prosperous New Year of Letterboxing Adventures!  --
