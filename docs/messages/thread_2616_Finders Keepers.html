Laura Janisch, a 23-year-old Houstonian and recent graduate of the University of Texas, solved clues that led her to the gold coin in her region, which happened to be the $1 million grand prize. Twenty-two other gold coins and one virtual gold coin, redeemable for amounts varying from $10,000 to $250,000, were also hidden in various locations throughout the United States and Canada.</font></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "><br/></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; "><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Helvetica">Janisch and her parents, who are big fans of Dr Pepper as well as avid geo-cachers, used clues revealed online at drpepper.com each day for the past 30 days to locate the coin, which was found near the Spirit of Confederacy statue in Sam Houston Park. The clues tested Laura's knowledge of geography, history and world events.</font></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font: normal normal normal 12px/normal Helvetica; min-height: 14px; "><br/></div><div style="margin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; "><font class="Apple-style-span" face="Helvetica">"We are thrilled to provide Dr Pepper drinkers with an unforgettable experience and a chance of a lifetime through the Dr Pepper HUNT FOR MORE promotion," said Andrew Springate, vice president of Dr Pepper marketing.
