Wouldn't it have been awesome if you just came across the coin while you were looking for a letterbox! It should have been a given that the $1MM coin was in Texas!<div><br/><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>PLANO, Texas, Feb. 23 /PRNewswire/ -- One clever scavenger hunt enthusiast and Dr Pepper fan has become America's newest millionaire through the Dr Pepper HUNT FOR MORE promotion. Laura Janisch, a 23-year-old Houstonian and recent graduate of the University of Texas, solved clues that led her to the gold coin in her region, which happened to be the $1 million grand prize. Twenty-two other gold coins and one virtual gold coin, redeemable for amounts varying from $10,000 to $250,000, were also hidden in various locations throughout the United States and Canada.</div><div><br/></div><div>Janisch and her parents, who are big fans of Dr Pepper as well as avid geo-cachers, used clues revealed online at drpepper.com each day for the past 30 days to locate the coin, which was found near the Spirit of Confederacy statue in Sam Houston Park. The clues tested Laura's knowledge of geography, history and world events.</div><div><br/></div><div>"We are thrilled to provide Dr Pepper drinkers with an unforgettable experience and a chance of a lifetime through the Dr Pepper HUNT FOR MORE promotion," said Andrew Springate, vice president of Dr Pepper marketing. "Laura outwitted the rest by solving clues to locate the gold coin in her region and ultimately, won $1 million."</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></div></body></html>
