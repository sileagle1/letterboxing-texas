                    <html><body><p>Ok.  So now I've been thinking about all the ways my own attitudes would have annoyed early boxers and it has been enlightening.  I haven't been around that long, so this is entirely based on my impressions.  Feel free to correct any misconceptions I have.</p><p> </p><p>These attitudes have been gleaned from the earlier post I linked, and also from other poking around in the archives, etc.</p><p> </p><p>Firstly, I've long held that it was best, not required, just best, to learn a little about carving before you planted your first box.  Many early boxers felt the stamp was beside the point, and bemoan the later tendency to equate the letterbox with the stamp and little else, that the carve has become the point.  They were just happy to have a box to find.  Driving awhile to find a box was not uncommon. So drive-bys just for the sake of finding a stamp would have been a little weird?  I'm assuming.  I support them, but for a different reason.  My best friend was in a wheelchair.  Had she still been alive when I started boxing, these would have been the only ones we could have done together.  I think about her all the time, and she has shaped my perspective on many things.  ANyway. I understand their point and the feelings behind it.</p><p> </p><p>I have a strong aversion to store-bought stamps.  Many of the early boxers had no such feelings.  Eoghan's boxes come immediately to mind.</p><p> </p><p>Many times, I've whined a little about stamping in, particularly multiple times on long series.  Early boxers loved the logbooks.  Boxes were few and far between and were visited by their owners.  When you stamped in, you took a few minutes to enjoy the logbook, looking to see who'd found your boxes and the comments they'd made.  People took the time to LEAVE comments, IN the logbook, not about the fabulous carve, per se, but about their experiences finding it.  This point was driven home to me when we found a box in Austin that had been found my many, many muggles, all of whom had added comments and then rehidden the logbook, instinctively realizing the essential qualities of the secret find.  It was awesome.  I'd love to post the photos we took, but I don't own the box, so you'll have to take my word for it that it was an intriguing find.</p><p> </p><p>Technically, a letterbox had to have a logbook.</p><p> </p><p>In a related concept, no one logged finds online, so you HAD to visit your box to see who'd been there. It was exciting not to know until you got there.</p><p> </p><p>Non-traditional boxes are considered by many not to be a true part of letterboxing: drive-bys, LTC's, postals, etc.</p><p> </p><p>Some old-timers don't even bother to log finds.  This of course puts them out of the running for any and all P- and F-count restricted boxes on AQ.</p><p> </p><p>Some are actually hostile to the idea of online logging in the first place and prefer to keep track of things in their own, personal logbooks.  This no doubt is also part of the aversion to the AQ way of doing things.</p><p> </p><p>Many believe strongly that "real" letterboxes must be unrestricted and freely available to everyone.</p><p> </p><p>The idea of sitting around the dining room table at an "event," and collecting stamps wouldn't be considered letterboxing by many.</p><p> </p><p>Hitchhikers were fun little treasures, and not PIA's.  Although I check the HHH close to home and take/leave HH's there, many more times I leave them in the boxes where I've found them, especially if they're (forgive me) "crappy carves."</p><p> </p><p>I have often said that if I wanted to be a "hiker," I'd join a hiking club.  But I'm not, I'm a boxer, and for me, finding a box is the entire point, and the hike is just gravy.  With lots of boxes WOM, it seems that a long, rambling trek without having a clue whether or not the box was actually there, was more the norm earlier on, and gratitude for the entire experience was the focus.  Um, oops?</p><p> </p><p>Some oldtimers feel that the launch of AQ put the focus on finds, rather than the experience.  They especially resent the fact that AQ is a money-making entity.  This also relates to the free and unrestricted access to boxes.  (This is a variation of the game I don't believe was a part of Dartmoor boxing thinking.  The stealth portion, however, has been assimilated as an essential component, but is rapidly disintegrating as more and more boxers have only the online experience boxing to get them started. Non-stealth boxing is fairly tolerated on the boards.  I would have at least fit in here with the long-timers on this one.)</p><p> </p><p>There was an emphasis on the location of the box, rather than the snazziness of the logbook or thef skill of the carver.  Having known nothing else, I'm thrilled with the art I'm seeing now.  I'm not sure this is a bad trend.  It just seems we can afford to be a little discerning now.</p><p> </p><p>I found Wanda &amp; Pete's information about the hats and how it relates to the premium hats on AQ to be a very interesting bit of letterboxing historical trivia.  I can also see<var id="yui-ie-cursor"></var>, under the circumstances and in consideration of their feelings for AQ, how it infuriates them.</p><p> </p><p>Many of these oldtimer voices are without representation on the boards, especially the LbNA/AQ split, which is danced around exquisitely by anyone who brings it up.  Ryan is careful not to say anything negative about LbNA, for one thing, as well he should.</p><p> </p><p>Some of my attitudes, I think, would have served me well had I started boxing in the beginning, like the stealth part, for sure, and my vocal belief that Ryan is not the first nor last word in letterboxing etiquette, but merely manages the site that he has created.  There is a difference.  But for the most part, I would not have fit in much, and that has given me pause.</p><p> </p><p>I'm sure those of you who've been around can correct any misconceptions that I have and perhaps add a few as well, especially since many of my sources aren't local to us.  It was an interesting experience being the newbie side of things, in terms of boxing style and attitudes, as I read this older stuff.  It's also fun to look at photos from some of the early events, where there were comparatively few people in attendance!</p> <div class="ygroups-quoted"><br/><br/>---In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/><div id="ygrps-yiv-1210044356"><div><div><span></span></div><div>

<p>I started letterboxing over ten years ago when I lived in Connecticut, so I'm pretty old school when it comes to my personal letterboxing style. Having said that, I've found that I'm a much happier person when I don't get too involved in judging how other people choose to letterbox (or hike, or camp, or study for a test, or shop, or..... well live their lives). I'm still pretty happy letterboxing in the same style I always have (although I'm now remiss in recording my finds over the last two years, and I think that's an important function of letterboxing to let the box owners know you've found their box). I just remembered someone requesting that I list my last plant on LBNA (it's only on AQ simple because I forgot to list it on both), so I'll do that. I don't really view LBing as a group sport (at least not for me), but I've always enjoyed the company of others at the events, and hearing from those who find my boxes. So it doesn't actually matter to me if others choose to letterbox differently than I do, as long as they respect my plants and don't send snarky emails to me. :) Puddle Splasher</p>

I will continue to do that, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to honor that unique part of local, as opposed to national, standards, however inconvenient you find it.  But I confess that I always found AQ to meet more of my needs, but rarely questioned whether they were “needs” or preferences, and thought I was humoring those who used LbNA, a bit patronizing in retrospect.  So I always kind of looked at LbNA as the red-haired stepchild, and like I was doing the old-timers a favor, out of respect and consideration.  That is, I did until I thought, for a brief moment, “If Baby Bear is posting all his clues on AQ, does that mean LbNA is going away?” and had a little panic attack.  That gave me pause; I wouldn’t have expected that.  I realized that most of the old, old history and boxes that are iffy, and many of the boxing coups I’ve had, have been finds on the old, “abandoned” boxes people are always complaining about on LbNA.  I realized I didn’t want, not really, AQ to have cornered the market, or for the whole thing to be mindless and foolproof, and that ferreting out old clues, wile PIA at times, is part of the set-up to the adventure.</span><span><o></o></span></p></div>
<div>
<p><span>Most of the time, I suspect I’m viewed on the AQ boards as somewhat old-fashioned and possibly even crabby.  Ahem. I think the hats &amp; stars are a little silly, but there’s just no getting around the ease with which we can communicate, at least superficially, and with which we can share, sort and categorize searches and clues and that it fosters the exchange of ideas, even stupid ones.  </span><span><o></o></span></p></div>
<div>
<p><span><o></o></span></p></div>
<div>
<p><span>To me, hybrids, for example, don’t educate cachers, they just enjoy them as a subset of caching, and all the unnecessary permission-seeking they do has not helped our hobby one bit, but outed it to muggles and left the impression that there are no standards.  Though accustomed to rules and their enforcement in their own hobby, they enjoy the relative freedom they have letterboxing to break what minimal standards there are.  God forbid you say that, though.  Hybrids are listed on caching sites, with co-ordinates and locations approved by moderators.  </span><span>These things completely disregard the most basic tenants of the hobby.  </span><span>I say this not to start another war or even a discussion, but merely as an example of my “old-fashioned-ness,” because it helps illustrate where I’m going next.  This geocacher/letterboxer dichotomy illustrates perfectly what I’m talking about. So grit your teeth, Dusty, corral the voices, and hang in there.  My views on this are well-known, and I’d like to be able to discuss them freely here with the understanding that this is not a personal attack, just a discussion of values, on a letterboxing forum started to foster the hobby of letterboxing. I'm just discussing the standards of our hobby, or what I consider to be a lack of them.</span><span><o></o></span></p></div>
<div>
<p><span>The more I started posting about things the mattered to me, the more out-of-step I felt. I've been deleted once and moved to Dead Lemurs twice! -- my personal red badge of (dis)courage. I believe in keeping the location of boxes secret.  It aggravates the hell out of me that boxers are intentionally seeking out the input and permission of non-boxers before planting, that boxes are being placed in scrapbooking stores, etc., where we have to out ourselves or shop, and I’ve felt many times that oldtimers are dropping the ball when they don’t say something about these and other things.  It seems to me at times that by their silence they are encouraging the deviations that the newer boxers are starting without really thinking about their relative merits.  I kept thinking, if they understood a little about the history, things would make more sense to them. And it never once occurred to me that no one else gave a @#"* about this stuff; I just thought they were too polite to say anything!  THEN I ran across some of Wanda &amp; Pete’s posts about letterboxing that make me seem like a poster child for the digital age! What a shocker!  </span><span><o></o></span></p></div>
<div>
<p><span>So while I’m moaning about hybrids and longing for the good old days of say, 5 years ago (!), ironically, many of my practices would utterly appall them.  They have 30,000 finds and they were boycotting events where hitchhikers weren't hidden properly in boxes, because that's how it's supposed to be DONE, and they despise AQ as a money-grubbing, well, I’ll post links at the bottom.  And here I couldn't care less about the little blighters! (hitchhikers) Their viewpoint is interspersed within the text, but it gives you an insight into the values of some of the founding fathers of our hobby, theirs and other big names whose autographs we should be seeking. The upshot of all this is that while the location of our boxes should be a secret, perhaps our history should be less so, and perhaps it’s time for the oldtimers to have some fireside chats about the good old days, including the part between LbNA and AQ, for starters, because within the context of current affairs, it makes little sense, but historically, it makes much more sense.  It’s not the forum moderators who are vanguards of respect and fairness and tolerance – it’s having a shared community.  Shared stories are the inculcators of shared culture.  Which parts of them we want to keep should be a matter of thoughtful consideration, rather than mindless defaulting.

</div><div>I started letterboxing over ten years ago when I lived in Connecticut, so I'm pretty old school when it comes to my personal letterboxing style. Having said that, I've found that I'm a much happier person when I don't get too involved in judging how other people choose to letterbox (or hike, or camp, or study for a test, or shop, or..... well live their lives). I'm still pretty happy letterboxing in the same style I always have (although I'm now remiss in recording my finds over the last two years, and I think that's an important function of letterboxing to let the box owners know you've found their box). I just remembered someone requesting that I list my last plant on LBNA (it's only on AQ simple because I forgot to list it on both), so I'll do that. I don't really view LBing as a group sport (at least not for me), but I've always enjoyed the company of others at the events, and hearing from those who find my boxes. So it doesn't actually
 matter to me if others choose to letterbox differently than I do, as long as they respect my plants and don't send snarky emails to me. :) Puddle Splasher</div>

<div class="yiv7071644480MsoNormal"><span>Very interesting.  I’d just like to point out that the lack of “rules and enforcement” pretty much guarantees the hobby will evolve and change over time.  Our hobby is rich and complex and will undoubtedly continue to have a wide variety of opinions and preferences.  Personally I like it that way as it keeps me from getting bored with it!  </span></div>

<div class="yiv7071644480MsoNormal"><span>That said, I think it would be very valuable to better capture the history of the hobby and make it more available to new boxers.  I would love to collect stories and find a way of sharing them.  There have been some great boxes and incidents at events which I think many of you would like to read about (if you don’t know them already!). (I’m thinking of Texas specifically here).  Any interest?</span></div>

</div><div>I started letterboxing over ten years ago when I lived in Connecticut, so I'm pretty old school when it comes to my personal letterboxing style. Having said that, I've found that I'm a much happier person when I don't get too involved in judging how other people choose to letterbox (or hike, or camp, or study for a test, or shop, or..... well live their lives). I'm still pretty happy letterboxing in the same style I always have (although I'm now remiss in recording my finds over the last two years, and I think that's an important function of letterboxing to let the box owners know you've found their box). I just remembered someone requesting that I list my last plant on LBNA (it's only on AQ simple because I forgot to list it on both), so I'll do that. I don't really view LBing as a group sport (at least not for me), but I've always enjoyed the company of others at the events, and hearing from those who find my boxes. So it doesn't actually
 matter to me if others choose to letterbox differently than I do, as long as they respect my plants and don't send snarky emails to me. :) Puddle Splasher</div>

<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>Very interesting.  I’d just like to point out that the lack of “rules and enforcement” pretty much guarantees the hobby will evolve and change over time.  Our hobby is rich and complex and will undoubtedly continue to have a wide variety of opinions and preferences.  Personally I like it that way as it keeps me from getting bored with it!  </span></div>

<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>That said, I think it would be very valuable to better capture the history of the hobby and make it more available to new boxers.  I would love to collect stories and find a way of sharing them.  There have been some great boxes and incidents at events which I think many of you would like to read about (if you don’t know them already!). (I’m thinking of Texas specifically here).  Any interest?</span></div>

<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>I’ve always been interested in the whole LbNA/AQ split, but never knew that much about it.  I post my clues to LbNA out of respect to the boxers who use it ex-clue-sively, as a nod of reverence for the founders of boxing in TX and as a nod to our history here. I will continue to do that, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to honor that unique part of local, as opposed to national, standards, however inconvenient you find it.  But I confess that I always found AQ to meet more of my needs, but rarely questioned whether they were “needs” or preferences, and thought I was humoring those who used LbNA, a bit patronizing in retrospect.  So I always kind of looked at LbNA as the red-haired stepchild, and like I was doing the old-timers a favor, out of respect and consideration.  That is, I did until I thought, for a brief moment, “If
 Baby Bear is posting all his clues on AQ, does that mean LbNA is going away?” and had a little panic attack.  That gave me pause; I wouldn’t have expected that.  I realized that most of the old, old history and boxes that are iffy, and many of the boxing coups I’ve had, have been finds on the old, “abandoned” boxes people are always complaining about on LbNA.  I realized I didn’t want, not really, AQ to have cornered the market, or for the whole thing to be mindless and foolproof, and that ferreting out old clues, wile PIA at times, is part of the set-up to the adventure.</span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>Most of the time, I suspect I’m viewed on the AQ boards as somewhat old-fashioned and possibly even crabby.  Ahem. I think the hats &amp; stars are a little silly, but there’s just no getting around the ease with which we can communicate, at least superficially, and with which we can share, sort and categorize searches and clues and that it fosters the exchange of ideas, even stupid ones.  </span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>To me, hybrids, for example, don’t educate cachers, they just enjoy them as a subset of caching, and all the unnecessary permission-seeking they do has not helped our hobby one bit, but outed it to muggles and left the impression that there are no standards.  Though accustomed to rules and their enforcement in their own hobby, they enjoy the relative freedom they have letterboxing to break what minimal standards there are.  God forbid you say that, though.  Hybrids are listed on caching sites, with co-ordinates and locations approved by moderators.  </span><span>These things completely disregard the most basic tenants of the hobby.  </span><span>I say this not to start another war or even a discussion, but merely as an example of my “old-fashioned-ness,” because it
 helps illustrate where I’m going next.  This geocacher/letterboxer dichotomy illustrates perfectly what I’m talking about. So grit your teeth, Dusty, corral the voices, and hang in there.  My views on this are well-known, and I’d like to be able to discuss them freely here with the understanding that this is not a personal attack, just a discussion of values, on a letterboxing forum started to foster the hobby of letterboxing. I'm just discussing the standards of our hobby, or what I consider to be a lack of them.</span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>The more I started posting about things the mattered to me, the more out-of-step I felt. I've been deleted once and moved to Dead Lemurs twice! -- my personal red badge of (dis)courage. I believe in keeping the location of boxes secret.  It aggravates the hell out of me that boxers are intentionally seeking out the input and permission of non-boxers before planting, that boxes are being placed in scrapbooking stores, etc., where we have to out ourselves or shop, and I’ve felt many times that oldtimers are dropping the ball when they don’t say something about these and other things.  It seems to me at times that by their silence they are encouraging the deviations that the newer boxers are starting without really thinking about their relative merits.  I kept thinking, if they understood a little about the history, things
 would make more sense to them. And it never once occurred to me that no one else gave a @#"* about this stuff; I just thought they were too polite to say anything!  THEN I ran across some of Wanda &amp; Pete’s posts about letterboxing that make me seem like a poster child for the digital age! What a shocker!  </span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>So while I’m moaning about hybrids and longing for the good old days of say, 5 years ago (!), ironically, many of my practices would utterly appall them.  They have 30,000 finds and they were boycotting events where hitchhikers weren't hidden properly in boxes, because that's how it's supposed to be DONE, and they despise AQ as a money-grubbing, well, I’ll post links at the bottom.  And here I couldn't care less about the little blighters! (hitchhikers) Their viewpoint is interspersed within the text, but it gives you an insight into the values of some of the founding fathers of our hobby, theirs and other big names whose autographs we should be seeking. The upshot of all this is that while the location of our boxes should be a secret, perhaps our history should be less so, and perhaps it’s time for the oldtimers to have some fireside
 chats about the good old days, including the part between LbNA and AQ, for starters, because within the context of current affairs, it makes little sense, but historically, it makes much more sense.  It’s not the forum moderators who are vanguards of respect and fairness and tolerance – it’s having a shared community.  Shared stories are the inculcators of shared culture.  Which parts of them we want to keep should be a matter of thoughtful consideration, rather than mindless defaulting.

<p>Placidity... hmmmmm. Not sure that's the word I would use, and  my letterboxing style certainly couldn't be described as "willy-nilly".  It's just that over the years, I've seen a lot of anger displayed on this and other boards due to people disagreeing with each other's opinions, and have learned to be more accepting of the diversity on the letterboxing sites. However, I agree that open discussions of the relativity of advances in letterboxing are good.  We've all seen advances in technology over the years, most of which I certainly embrace, and some of which don't work for me so I ignore them. I'm simple saying what works for me and isn't offensive or hurting anyone else, shouldn't be an issue for anyone else. Also, I was speaking in general terms about "snarky emails" - I've never received one from anyone I've ever personally met. I'm sure anyone who has ever planted a box, has received those irritating emails from people who have a list of complaints about their boxes, clues, location etc. I DO appreciate finders letting me know if their is an issue with my box or clues so I can address those (just got one this week). I'm just referring to those very few people who are unnecessarily rude. The problem with the internet is you just can't see that someone may be smiling as they are typing, and black letters on a white screen can be awfully harsh at times. </p>

<div>I started letterboxing over ten years ago when I lived in Connecticut, so I'm pretty old school when it comes to my personal letterboxing style. Having said that, I've found that I'm a much happier person when I don't get too involved in judging how other people choose to letterbox (or hike, or camp, or study for a test, or shop, or..... well live their lives). I'm still pretty happy letterboxing in the same style I always have (although I'm now remiss in recording my finds over the last two years, and I think that's an important function of letterboxing to let the box owners know you've found their box). I just remembered someone requesting that I list my last plant on LBNA (it's only on AQ simple because I forgot to list it on both), so I'll do that. I don't really view LBing as a group sport (at least not for me), but I've always enjoyed the company of others at the events, and hearing from those who find my boxes. So it doesn't actually matter to me if others choose to letterbox differently than I do, as long as they respect my plants and don't send snarky emails to me. :) Puddle Splasher</div>

<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>I’ve always been interested in the whole LbNA/AQ split, but never knew that much about it.  I post my clues to LbNA out of respect to the boxers who use it ex-clue-sively, as a nod of reverence for the founders of boxing in TX and as a nod to our history here. I will continue to do that, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to honor that unique part of local, as opposed to national, standards, however inconvenient you find it.  But I confess that I always found AQ to meet more of my needs, but rarely questioned whether they were “needs” or preferences, and thought I was humoring those who used LbNA, a bit patronizing in retrospect.  So I always kind of looked at LbNA as the red-haired stepchild, and like I was doing the old-timers a favor, out of respect and consideration.  That is, I did until I thought, for a brief moment, “If Baby Bear is posting all his clues on AQ, does that mean LbNA is going away?” and had a little panic attack.  That gave me pause; I wouldn’t have expected that.  I realized that most of the old, old history and boxes that are iffy, and many of the boxing coups I’ve had, have been finds on the old, “abandoned” boxes people are always complaining about on LbNA.  I realized I didn’t want, not really, AQ to have cornered the market, or for the whole thing to be mindless and foolproof, and that ferreting out old clues, wile PIA at times, is part of the set-up to the adventure.</span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>Most of the time, I suspect I’m viewed on the AQ boards as somewhat old-fashioned and possibly even crabby.  Ahem. I think the hats &amp; stars are a little silly, but there’s just no getting around the ease with which we can communicate, at least superficially, and with which we can share, sort and categorize searches and clues and that it fosters the exchange of ideas, even stupid ones.  </span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>To me, hybrids, for example, don’t educate cachers, they just enjoy them as a subset of caching, and all the unnecessary permission-seeking they do has not helped our hobby one bit, but outed it to muggles and left the impression that there are no standards.  Though accustomed to rules and their enforcement in their own hobby, they enjoy the relative freedom they have letterboxing to break what minimal standards there are.  God forbid you say that, though.  Hybrids are listed on caching sites, with co-ordinates and locations approved by moderators.  </span><span>These things completely disregard the most basic tenants of the hobby.  </span><span>I say this not to start another war or even a discussion, but merely as an example of my “old-fashioned-ness,” because it helps illustrate where I’m going next.  This geocacher/letterboxer dichotomy illustrates perfectly what I’m talking about. So grit your teeth, Dusty, corral the voices, and hang in there.  My views on this are well-known, and I’d like to be able to discuss them freely here with the understanding that this is not a personal attack, just a discussion of values, on a letterboxing forum started to foster the hobby of letterboxing. I'm just discussing the standards of our hobby, or what I consider to be a lack of them.</span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>The more I started posting about things the mattered to me, the more out-of-step I felt. I've been deleted once and moved to Dead Lemurs twice! -- my personal red badge of (dis)courage. I believe in keeping the location of boxes secret.  It aggravates the hell out of me that boxers are intentionally seeking out the input and permission of non-boxers before planting, that boxes are being placed in scrapbooking stores, etc., where we have to out ourselves or shop, and I’ve felt many times that oldtimers are dropping the ball when they don’t say something about these and other things.  It seems to me at times that by their silence they are encouraging the deviations that the newer boxers are starting without really thinking about their relative merits.  I kept thinking, if they understood a little about the history, things would make more sense to them. And it never once occurred to me that no one else gave a @#"* about this stuff; I just thought they were too polite to say anything!  THEN I ran across some of Wanda &amp; Pete’s posts about letterboxing that make me seem like a poster child for the digital age! What a shocker!  </span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>So while I’m moaning about hybrids and longing for the good old days of say, 5 years ago (!), ironically, many of my practices would utterly appall them.  They have 30,000 finds and they were boycotting events where hitchhikers weren't hidden properly in boxes, because that's how it's supposed to be DONE, and they despise AQ as a money-grubbing, well, I’ll post links at the bottom.  And here I couldn't care less about the little blighters! (hitchhikers) Their viewpoint is interspersed within the text, but it gives you an insight into the values of some of the founding fathers of our hobby, theirs and other big names whose autographs we should be seeking. The upshot of all this is that while the location of our boxes should be a secret, perhaps our history should be less so, and perhaps it’s time for the oldtimers to have some fireside chats about the good old days, including the part between LbNA and AQ, for starters, because within the context of current affairs, it makes little sense, but historically, it makes much more sense.  It’s not the forum moderators who are vanguards of respect and fairness and tolerance – it’s having a shared community.  Shared stories are the inculcators of shared culture.  Which parts of them we want to keep should be a matter of thoughtful consideration, rather than mindless defaulting.

<div>Well said, Puddle Splasher!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I’ve been letterboxing a while, and from coast-to-coast.  I started 
out on LbNA and resisted AtlasQuest as long as I could.  I thought it was 
way too technical.  When I ran out of boxes to look for on LbNA, I 
begrudgingly forced myself to figure out AQ.  Once I figured it out, I 
really enjoyed some of the features.  Still do.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A couple of the features I enjoy on AQ are the event listings and letterbox 
trading cards (LTCs).  Going to events and meeting others that enjoy 
letterboxing validates my hobby!  And if they bring hand carved stamps for 
me to enjoy, well, bravo!  It may not be “letterboxing” in the traditional 
sense, but it is appreciating others’ artwork.  LTCs aren’t letterboxing 
either, but I get to enjoy carvings by letterboxers in parts of the country I 
probably won’t get to.  I have learned so much about carving from these 
little pieces of art.  And I get to participate even when it is too hot to 
go outside.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One thing I’ve learned is that not all letterboxes are for everyone. I know 
I don’t like letterboxes in public places, but I still plant them.  I’m not 
crazy about puzzles, but I respect that others may be.  The list goes on 
and my point is that I enjoy seeing the diversity and appreciate how clever and 
creative some folks are.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking forward to TALE 11!</div>

<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>I’ve always been interested in the whole LbNA/AQ split, but 
never knew that much about it.  I post my clues to LbNA out of respect to 
the boxers who use it ex-clue-sively, as a nod of reverence for the founders of 
boxing in TX and as a nod to our history here. I will continue to do that, and I 
don’t think it’s unreasonable to honor that unique part of local, as opposed to 
national, standards, however inconvenient you find it.  But I confess that 
I always found AQ to meet more of my needs, but rarely questioned whether they 
were “needs” or preferences, and thought I was humoring those who used LbNA, a 
bit patronizing in retrospect.  So I always kind of looked at LbNA as the 
red-haired stepchild, and like I was doing the old-timers a favor, out of 
respect and consideration.  That is, I did until I thought, for a brief 
moment, “If Baby Bear is posting all his clues on AQ, does that mean LbNA is 
going away?” and had a little panic attack.  That gave me pause; I wouldn’t 
have expected that.  I realized that most of the old, old history and boxes 
that are iffy, and many of the boxing coups I’ve had, have been finds on the 
old, “abandoned” boxes people are always complaining about on LbNA.  I 
realized I didn’t want, not really, AQ to have cornered the market, or for the 
whole thing to be mindless and foolproof, and that ferreting out old clues, wile 
PIA at times, is part of the set-up to the adventure.</span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>Most of the time, I suspect I’m viewed on the AQ boards as 
somewhat old-fashioned and possibly even crabby.  Ahem. I think the hats 
&amp; stars are a little silly, but there’s just no getting around the ease with 
which we can communicate, at least superficially, and with which we can share, 
sort and categorize searches and clues and that it fosters the exchange of 
ideas, even stupid ones.  </span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>To me, hybrids, for example, don’t educate cachers, they 
just enjoy them as a subset of caching, and all the unnecessary 
permission-seeking they do has not helped our hobby one bit, but outed it to 
muggles and left the impression that there are no standards.  Though 
accustomed to rules and their enforcement in their own hobby, they enjoy the 
relative freedom they have letterboxing to break what minimal standards there 
are.  God forbid you say that, though.  Hybrids are listed on caching 
sites, with co-ordinates and locations approved by moderators.  
</span><span>These things completely 
disregard the most basic tenants of the hobby.  </span><span>I say this not to start another war or even a discussion, 
but merely as an example of my “old-fashioned-ness,” because it helps illustrate 
where I’m going next.  This geocacher/letterboxer dichotomy illustrates 
perfectly what I’m talking about. So grit your teeth, Dusty, corral the voices, 
and hang in there.  My views on this are well-known, and I’d like to be 
able to discuss them freely here with the understanding that this is not a 
personal attack, just a discussion of values, on a letterboxing forum started to 
foster the hobby of letterboxing. I'm just discussing the standards of our 
hobby, or what I consider to be a lack of them.</span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>The more I started posting about things the mattered to me, 
the more out-of-step I felt. I've been deleted once and moved to Dead Lemurs 
twice! -- my personal red badge of (dis)courage. I believe in keeping the 
location of boxes secret.  It aggravates the hell out of me that boxers are 
intentionally seeking out the input and permission of non-boxers before 
planting, that boxes are being placed in scrapbooking stores, etc., where we 
have to out ourselves or shop, and I’ve felt many times that oldtimers are 
dropping the ball when they don’t say something about these and other 
things.  It seems to me at times that by their silence they are encouraging 
the deviations that the newer boxers are starting without really thinking about 
their relative merits.  I kept thinking, if they understood a little about 
the history, things would make more sense to them. And it never once occurred to 
me that no one else gave a @#"* about this stuff; I just thought they were too 
polite to say anything!  THEN I ran across some of Wanda &amp; Pete’s posts 
about letterboxing that make me seem like a poster child for the digital age! 
What a shocker!  </span><span></span></div></div>
<div>
<div class="yiv7863156370MsoNormal"><span>So while I’m moaning about hybrids and longing for the good 
old days of say, 5 years ago (!), ironically, many of my practices would utterly 
appall them.  They have 30,000 finds and they were boycotting events where 
hitchhikers weren't hidden properly in boxes, because that's how it's supposed 
to be DONE, and they despise AQ as a money-grubbing, well, I’ll post links at 
the bottom.  And here I couldn't care less about the little blighters! 
(hitchhikers) Their viewpoint is interspersed within the text, but it gives you 
an insight into the values of some of the founding fathers of our hobby, theirs 
and other big names whose autographs we should be seeking. The upshot of all 
this is that while the location of our boxes should be a secret, perhaps our 
history should be less so, and perhaps it’s time for the oldtimers to have some 
fireside chats about the good old days, including the part between LbNA and AQ, 
for starters, because within the context of current affairs, it makes little 
sense, but historically, it makes much more sense.  It’s not the forum 
moderators who are vanguards of respect and fairness and tolerance – it’s having 
a shared community.  Shared stories are the inculcators of shared 
culture.  Which parts of them we want to keep should be a matter of 
thoughtful consideration, rather than mindless defaulting. So take a quick peek 
from their posts on the LA-LA (Lifetime Achievement Letterboxing Awards):

<div>I try to avoid commenting too often on any of these lists (or anywhere online, for that matter), just to keep myself out of the spotlight and avoid invoking controversy (I know you are laughing at that one, PuddleSplasher), but I do feel obligated to chime in on this discussion, Wry Me and others, so here goes:  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've been letterboxing just about as long as PuddleSplasher has (my sister, she introduced me to LBing about a month after she discovered it in Connecticut, and that fall I found my first 6 or 7 boxes while visiting her there and then discovered a few here in the DFW area when I returned home and was hooked -- I think we are both actually going on 10 years this fall, PS, since that was fall of 2004 according to my journal and logbook, but then, who's counting?  Not ME.)  But at that, we've been at this game long enough I guess we may be considered "old letterboxers" too -- in more ways than one, actually.  And yes, my F count is way above 1000 somewhere, pretty respectable although certainly not in the astronomical range of W&amp;P or other more devoted and intense boxers.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I admit to being something of a Letterbox Snob -- I'd personally prefer to be considered a Discerning Letterboxer -- I'm pretty happy to ignore boxes that just don't interest me enough to seek them out -- Wry Me, for many of the reasons you suggested, to be honest.  Initially, I was so excited to have a letterbox ANYWHERE within a reasonable distance (100 miles or so?) that I'd go back again and again if necessary to complete my search.  But no more.  Now there are many boxes, and I've been disappointed often enough after finding them to become more "selective" in my letterboxing activities.  I still seek out clues for any area I intend to travel to -- on both sites. AQ and LBNA, to avoid missing something really good -- and then as often as not, keep only the clues to the ones that promise an interesting discovery, location, or worthwhile find.  Last trip through Colorado and New Mexico about a month ago, I convinced my LSS to detour 100 miles out of the way for one that really sounded promising -- location, stamp, backstory -- only to be disappointed -- no box, long hard drive with no scenic views, clues should have probably archived long ago or at least box listed as missing/inactive/retired, obviously!  Ready to give up LBing at that point.  But even so, I've just carved another stamp and am preparing a box to plant in a couple of weeks on my next trip hiking in the mountains in a couple of weeks and think I have just the place in mind to plant it.  So obviously, I'm not finished with letterboxing quite yet.  I'm one of those who keeps my own records of PFX counts etc., just to sort of keep track with where and what and who I've found, and always try to contact the placer to let them know I've found the box and the status thereof, try to avoid snarky messages (although, yes, PS, I admit to snarkyness as my own natural attitude, sorry).  I don't log Attempts (even on that 100 mile disappointment), knowing that it's often the kiss of death for a box.  I sorta wish someone had already done so on that one, although I still might have gone there anyway.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't like hybrids -- they seem to be geocaches with a LB afterthought, usually to me anyway; I don't bother with "boxes" planted inside a store or business and I'll leave off the search if the location seems poorly thought out -- especially dangerous (not extreme, I'd go for that, but just taking me into a place that gives me bad feelings of dangerous); I will look for drive-bys especially on a road trip, if it's where I'm going anyway, and I do like a good hike -- if it's in an area where I'm looking for a good hike or trail or destination.  I have made many of my boxes "Puzzles" -- usually easy ones -- hoping to attract only letterboxers careful enough to use stealth and protect the box and not descend with a large group of home-schoolers or girl scouts and risk losing the box to lack of discretion or careful replacement.  I also make simple and more obvious clues for boxes that are in more scenic or interesting places to allow finders to pursue them more easily.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My own attitudes about letterboxing pretty much remain the same as when I began:  I like good stamps, like notes and comments in logbooks, try to collect and keep all my logbooks wherever my far-flung boxes may be (pretty much across the country, wherever I go), and don't really consider LTCs and Fleas and Exchanging stamps as Letterboxing, although I'm not averse to adding those beautiful stamps to my own logbook and meeting the people who made them.  But those are peripheral to the hobby, in my personal view.  Nice, but not really finding a letterbox somewhere in the woods.  I definitely prefer handcarved stamps, even poorly carved attempts, over a collection of cute commercial stamps.  Just my preference, try not to be a snob about this part.  Love a really creative, clever letterbox (one I found near Moab, UT stands out in my mind as the most creative, unique, and rewarding discovery yet:  filled with about 10 little handcarved Anasazi drawings, each glued to a small rock -- Rock Art!) and on a ledge above a canyon near real ancient rock art.  Great find!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't care what others choose to do as long as they don't try to make me do it their way or expose my boxes to risk through carelessness or ruin the game by trying to control it.  I like many of the other "older" letterboxers I've met through this list and at may of the events -- those older than I in this game especially, and respect their practices and wish we could all just GET ALONG and leave each other to play as we choose without anyone trying to direct us -- my own Snarky attitude coming out again.  I'm not in this for entertainment value, just for letterboxing.  This is a pretty old game, going back to the Dartmoor origins, and it works best when it remains out of the spotlight and remains an individual, personal, stealthy activity -- at least that's how I like it best.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And there it is, my comments.  You may now hit Delete and ignore everything I've said.  And I'll continue happily and quietly to letterbox as I choose.  I'll be planting a new box later this month -- not in Texas, but in a mountain area on a beautiful little trail!</div>

<div>I started letterboxing over ten years ago when I lived in Connecticut, so I'm pretty old school when it comes to my personal letterboxing style. Having said that, I've found that I'm a much happier person when I don't get too involved in judging how other people choose to letterbox (or hike, or camp, or study for a test, or shop, or..... well live their lives). I'm still pretty happy letterboxing in the same style I always have (although I'm now remiss in recording my finds over the last two years, and I think that's an important function of letterboxing to let the box owners know you've found their box). I just remembered someone requesting that I list my last plant on LBNA (it's only on AQ simple because I forgot to list it on both), so I'll do that. I don't really view LBing as a group sport (at least not for me), but I've always enjoyed the company of others at the events, and hearing from those who find my boxes. So it doesn't actually matter to me if others choose to letterbox differently than I do, as long as they respect my plants and don't send snarky emails to me. :) Puddle Splasher</div>

<div class="MsoNormal"><span>Very interesting.  I’d just like to point out that the lack of “rules and enforcement” pretty much guarantees the hobby will evolve and change over time.  Our hobby is rich and complex and will undoubtedly continue to have a wide variety of opinions and preferences.  Personally I like it that way as it keeps me from getting bored with it!  </span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span></span></div>
<div class="MsoNormal"><span>That said, I think it would be very valuable to better capture the history of the hobby and make it more available to new boxers.  I would love to collect stories and find a way of sharing them.  There have been some great boxes and incidents at events which I think many of you would like to read about (if you don’t know them already!). (I’m thinking of Texas specifically here).  Any interest?</span></div>

Breathe XV" event just 2 months ago, some of my favorite memories were getting to know some of the legends of letterboxing like Der Mad Stamper, Jay Drew, and Brian of Team Green Dragon.  Their stories of the early days were quite entertaining and gave me a whole new respect for what they did to get this hobby started.  Another good source for information is the Interview Series by Mark Pepe.  He took the time to interview 11 early letterboxers and posted it on his website:  http://interviewseries.blogspot.com/</p><p><br/></p><p>As a moderator and owner of this Yahoo Group I usually try to keep the peace and don't always post exactly what I'm feeling, so I have been guilty of "dropping the ball" by not complaining about things I don't like about the current state of letterboxing.  I have occasionally voiced my opinion about things (e.g. State Park permits) in the past, but unless you go back and read all the posts of this Group you won't know about them.  I don't post too many opinions any more because I don't want to bore people who have been around a long time who have heard it all before, but that means newer people never hear it.  I think this is why you don't hear other oldtimers speak out much any more, along with the fact that we have come to realize it does no good.  Most people are going to do what they want to do no matter what they hear, and I guess in some cases this is ok.</p><p><br/></p><p>It is often mentioned that letterboxing has no rules and I guess that is true to an extent, but it does have a set of norms that early letterboxers were expected to follow (e.g. stealth, non-commercialization) and it is the flaunting of these norms that gets them upset.  As the hobby continues to grow and new people with creative ideas come along, the norms get stretched to the point that new norms are created that irk early boxers but seem perfectly fine to the new boxers.  I think this is the crux of the discord and to help older boxers get past this feeling that letterboxing is "going to hell", we need to look back at our own history.  When letterboxing was first "discovered" by America, those early boxers took norms that had been around for decades in England and stretched the hell out of them, probably pissing off British boxers in the process.  To the Brits, posting clues on an Internet site was sacrilege, but to us it seemed like a great idea whose time had come.  So, even though I bemoan some of the changes that are taking place in letterboxing, I have come to realize that it is evolving just like it did 15 years ago and that it is a different letterboxing world now.  I can either take my stamps and go home or accept it and continue letterboxing the way I want to.  However, I do agree that learning the early history of letterboxing is still important, and I will try to share what little knowledge I have.  It is hard to write down so maybe the best way is to just talk about it next time I see any of you interested at the next event.  In the mean time, you can see a little of my history in the document I wrote during my 5th anniversary of letterboxing and placed in the Files section of this List:  http://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/letterboxingtexas/files, SE-BB_lbanniversary5.doc.</p><p><br/></p><p>Now for my confessions:</p><p><br/></p><p>Even though I admit AQ is nice for some things (e.g. Event listings, box searches) I will never accept it because I disagree with Ryan's commercialization of letterboxing.  It also doesn't help that I don't like Ryan personally, either.</p><p><br/></p><p>I don't like Government entities (like State Parks) interfering with my life or knowing too much about me, so I will never accept permits.</p><p><br/></p><p>I don't like Geocaching because it negatively impacts letterboxing.  If they would just eliminate their need to take things from caches, I think we could all get along much better.  Letterboxing was first, so I think they need to change their rules, not us.</p><p><br/></p><p>Even if I disagree with y'all on some things, I still enjoy being part of this group and I hope we all continue boxing together, even if we do it differently.<br/></p><p><br/></p><p>Silver Eagle  <br/></p><p><br/></p><p><br/></p> <div class="ygroups-quoted"><br/><br/>---In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt;

<div class="ygrps-yiv-476736180MsoNormal">I’ve always been interested in the whole LbNA/AQ split, but
never knew that much about it.<span>  </span>I post my
clues to LbNA out of respect to the boxers who use it ex-clue-sively, as a nod
of reverence for the founders of boxing in TX and as a nod to our history here.
I will continue to do that, and I don’t think it’s unreasonable to honor that
unique part of local, as opposed to national, standards, however inconvenient
you find it.<span>  </span>But I confess that I always found
AQ to meet more of my needs, but rarely questioned whether they were “needs” or
preferences, and thought I was humoring those who used LbNA, a bit patronizing
in retrospect.<span>  </span>So I always kind of
looked at LbNA as the red-haired stepchild, and like I was doing the old-timers
a favor, out of respect and consideration.<span> 
</span>That is, I did until I thought, for a brief moment, “If Baby Bear is posting
all his clues on AQ, does that mean LbNA is going away?” and had a little panic
attack. <span> </span>That gave me pause; I wouldn’t
have expected that.<span>  </span>I realized that most
of the old, old history and boxes that are iffy, and many of the boxing coups I’ve
had, have been finds on the old, “abandoned” boxes people are always complaining
about on LbNA.<span>  </span>I realized I didn’t want,
not really, AQ to have cornered the market, or for the whole thing to be
mindless and foolproof, and that ferreting out old clues, wile PIA at times, is
part of the set-up to the adventure.</div>
<div class="ygrps-yiv-476736180MsoNormal">Most of the time, I suspect I’m viewed on the AQ boards as
somewhat old-fashioned and possibly even crabby.<span>  Ahem. </span>I think the hats &amp; stars are a little
silly, but there’s just no getting around the ease with which we can
communicate, at least superficially, and with which we can share, sort and categorize
searches and clues and that it fosters the exchange of ideas, even stupid ones.<span>  </span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-476736180MsoNormal"><span></span> </div><div class="ygrps-yiv-476736180MsoNormal">To me, hybrids, for example, don’t educate
cachers, they just enjoy them as a subset of caching, and all the unnecessary
permission-seeking they do has not helped our hobby one bit, but outed it to
muggles and left the impression that there are no standards.<span>  </span>Though accustomed to rules and their
enforcement in their own hobby, they enjoy the relative freedom they have
letterboxing to break what minimal standards there are.<span>  </span>God
forbid you say that, though.<span>  </span>Hybrids are
listed on caching sites, with co-ordinates and locations approved by moderators.<span>  </span><span>These things completely disregard the most basic
tenants of the hobby.<span>  </span></span>I say this
not to start another war or even a discussion, but merely as an example of my “old-fashioned-ness,”
because it helps illustrate where I’m going next.<span>  </span>This geocacher/letterboxer dichotomy
illustrates perfectly what I’m talking about. So grit your teeth, Dusty, corral the voices, and
hang in there.<span>  </span>My views on this are
well-known, and I’d like to be able to discuss them freely here with the
understanding that this is not a personal attack, just a discussion of values, on
a letterboxing forum started to foster the hobby of letterboxing.<span> I'm just discussing the standards of our hobby, or what I consider to be a </span>lack of them.</div>
<div class="ygrps-yiv-476736180MsoNormal">The more I started posting about things the mattered to me,
the more out-of-step I felt.<span> I've been deleted once and moved to Dead Lemurs twice! -- my personal red badge of (dis)courage. </span>I believe
in keeping the location of boxes secret.<span> 
</span>It aggravates the hell out of me that boxers are intentionally seeking
out the input and permission of non-boxers before planting, that boxes are
being placed in scrapbooking stores, etc., where we have to out ourselves or shop, and I’ve felt many times that oldtimers are dropping the ball when they
don’t say something about these and other things.<span>  </span>It seems
to me at times that by their silence they are encouraging the deviations that the newer boxers are starting without really thinking
about their relative merits.<span>  </span>I kept
thinking, if they understood a little about the history, things would make more
sense to them. And it never once occurred to me that no one else gave a @#"* about this stuff; I just thought they were too polite to say anything!<span>  </span>THEN I ran across some of
Wanda &amp; Pete’s posts about letterboxing that make me seem like a poster
child for the digital age! What a shocker!<span> 
</span></div>
<div class="ygrps-yiv-476736180MsoNormal">So while I’m moaning about hybrids and longing for the good
old days of say, 5 years ago (!), ironically, many of my practices would utterly appall them.  They have 30,000 finds and they were boycotting events where hitchhikers weren't hidden properly in boxes, because that's how it's supposed to be DONE, and they despise AQ as
a money-grubbing, well, I’ll post links at the bottom. <span> And here I couldn't care less about the little blighters! (hitchhikers) </span>Their viewpoint is interspersed within the
text, but it gives you an insight into the values of some of the founding
fathers of our hobby, theirs and other big names whose autographs we should be seeking. The upshot of all this is that while the location of our
boxes should be a secret, perhaps our history should be less so, and perhaps it’s
time for the oldtimers to have some fireside chats about the good old days,
including the part between LbNA and AQ, for starters, because within the context
of current affairs, it makes little sense, but historically, it makes much more
sense.<span>  </span>It’s not the forum moderators who
are vanguards of respect and fairness and tolerance – it’s having a shared
community.<span>  </span>Shared stories are the
inculcators of shared culture.<span>  Which parts of them we want to keep should be a matter of thoughtful consideration, rather than mindless defaulting. </span>So take a

                    <html><body><p>I've been letterboxing since I found out about it almost 8 years ago, so I'm not a pioneer, although I'm definitely an old-timer.  Letterboxing in the US is a relatively new activity and continues to evolve as technology evolves and new people join us in the game.  Unlike Mike, I am optimistic about the future of letterboxing and I think talking among ourselves, or venting, or whatever we're doing, is a healthy thing.  Most of us will continue doing what we do, no matter what others do, and I see nothing wrong with that.  I never met a letterboxer I didn't like (although I've never met the Green Tortuga), and that probably says something about the kind of people that are attracted to letterboxing: we have something in common.  If you choose to hide a box in a public place, that's fine with me, but I'll probably not go out of my way to find it.  If you want to call your box "Hello Kitty" and don't have a really interesting story about your cat, that's fine with me, but I'll probably not find it.  But then, I don't expect everyone to be interested in every box I place, but that's just human nature and shows that we are as diverse as we are alike.  I don't get out as much as I use to as I get older, but I enjoy the times when I do and I hope you all keep placing boxes for me to find.  I don't care which site you use, I'll find them either way.  There's this ap called Clue Tracker that makes it really easyI</p> <div class="ygroups-quoted"><br/><br/>---In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/><div id="ygrps-yiv-1007818891"><style><!--

I will still have the opportunity to catch K0BFL on the ham radio though.</span></p><p><span>  </span></p><p><span>Mike - El Paso.<span>  </span>AKA Desert_Warrior.</span></p><p><span>  </span></p><div><div><p><b><span>From:</span></b><span> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com [mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com] <b>On Behalf Of </b>sileagle@windstream.net<br/><b>Sent:</b> Monday, October 28, 2013 10:20<br/><b>To:</b> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/><b>Subject:</b> [letterboxingtexas] RE: history</span></p></div></div><p>  </p><p><span>I don't post too many opinions any more because I don't want to bore people who have been around a long time who have heard it all before, but that means newer people never hear it.  I think this is why you don't hear other oldtimers speak out much any more, along with the fact that we have come to realize it does no good.  Most people are going to do what they want to do no matter what they hear, and I guess in some cases this is ok.</span></p><p><span>I don't like Government entities (like State Parks) interfering with my life or knowing too much about me, so I will never accept permits.</span></p><p><span>Silver Eagle  </span></p></div></div></div></body></html>
