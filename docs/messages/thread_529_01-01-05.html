Hi Y'all, <br/>
   I just had to go see what was so hot about Houston, so I carved <br/>
some time out this weekend to go see. There was no way I could get <br/>
to all 500,000 boxes in the area, so I just got a few.<br/>
<br/>
Blessing Box: found, slightly damp full log book, Thank you for the <br/>
espinas<br/>
Hershey Kiss: Oh, nice box, nice walk. damp full logbook. I left a <br/>
little bit of myself there.<br/>
Hot Air: Cute stamp in a nice area. At the meet can we talk about <br/>
how far is a 1/2 mile, and how to measure 10 yards? <br/>
Texas Titmouse, lake Texarkana: Didn't find, but did not have to pay <br/>
entrance fee.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for a nice weekend.<br/>
<br/>
WOW<br/>
MOM<br/>
