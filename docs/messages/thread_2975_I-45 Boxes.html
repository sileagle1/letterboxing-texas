"This "Bear on a Tear" is hiding in the Praire Branch area of<br>

keeping the location of his den secret.<br>
***Only bonafide LBNA or AQ members will be allowed to pay him a visit***"<br>

"As letterboxes in this park seem to go missing clues will only be<br>
sent to registered LBNA or AQ users. Email me with your trail name and<br>
I will send you the clue. Thanks, Norasta"<br>

Being that I'm not a member and it said that, I figured I didn't<br>
qualify.  Either way, we had plenty of other ones to stop at, and I<br>
understand their reasoning if they are coming up missing often. <br>
Re-carving a stamp over and over has to get frustrating.<br>

She only asks that you contact her through the LbNA website, which <br>
means you would have to be a member.  She'll then send you the clues <br>

Very nice boxes and worth the effort of asking for clues.  Baby Bear <br>

<p>I'm not sure... I was just going by what the information said in 
  the<br/>clue area:<br/><br/>"This "Bear on a Tear" is hiding in the Praire Branch 
  area of<br/>Huntsville State Park. As bears aren't allowed in the park we 
  are<br/>keeping the location of his den secret.<br/>***Only bonafide LBNA or AQ 
  members will be allowed to pay him a visit***"<br/><br/>and<br/><br/>"As 
  letterboxes in this park seem to go missing clues will only be<br/>sent to 
  registered LBNA or AQ users. Email me with your trail name and<br/>I will send 
  you the clue. Thanks, Norasta"<br/><br/>Being that I'm not a member and it said 
  that, I figured I didn't<br/>qualify. Either way, we had plenty of other ones 
  to stop at, and I<br/>understand their reasoning if they are coming up missing 
  often. <br/>Re-carving a stamp over and over has to get 
  frustrating.<br/><br/>aymztx<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,
