keeping the location of his den secret.<br/>

Being that I'm not a member and it said that, I figured I didn't<br/>

understand their reasoning if they are coming up missing often. <br/>
Re-carving a stamp over and over has to get frustrating.<br/>

She only asks that you contact her through the LbNA website, which <br/>

Very nice boxes and worth the effort of asking for clues.  Baby Bear <br/>

&gt; Those two boxes were placed by Norasta, who now lives in Canada.  <br/>
&gt; She only asks that you contact her through the LbNA website, which <br/>
&gt; means you would have to be a member.  She'll then send you the clues <br/>
&gt; through either LbNA or Atlas Quest, so you have to have a trail <br/>
&gt; name.  We found that she answered very promptly with the clues.  <br/>
&gt; Very nice boxes and worth the effort of asking for clues.  Baby Bear <br/>
&gt; has a box there and I don't think he's had any problems.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ahhhh...yes, Huntsville has horrible luck with boxes, I remember <br/>
&gt; that now<br/>
&gt; &gt; from when I got the clues to those boxes.  Wasn't it that you had <br/>
&gt; to have<br/>
&gt; &gt; planted a box so they could log on to LBNA, find your box on <br/>
&gt; there, and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; email you the clues through Contact the Placer?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   The two that required membership for clues were "Bear on a <br/>
&gt; Tear" and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Ukpik and Aqilgieq". It seems that boxes tend to go missing in <br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; area often(it says this in the area where the clue normally <br/>
&gt; would be),<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; so I think they were just trying to be cautious.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the tip on hitting both sites!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds like you were looking on AQ if Silver Eagle's box <br/>
&gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; come up.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are still quite a few Texas letterboxers who only list <br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing.org (LBNA), and some who only list on AQ, so don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forget to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look on both sites if you want to get ALL the boxes. It sounds <br/>
&gt; like you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; might still have some more to find around Lake Bardwell too!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Don't be discouraged by Scarlet Pimpernel, it took quite a few <br/>
&gt; of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; several<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; months to solve. Keep at it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You mention that some of the clues required you to be a paid <br/>
&gt; member<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of LBNA,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I'm curious which ones. To my knowledge, LBNA doesn't <br/>
&gt; require<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; membership, paid or otherwise, to find clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are quite a few boxes in the area you are talking about <br/>
&gt; going next<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekend. You can do a county search on LBNA or a city search <br/>
&gt; on AQ.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did most of the ones that come up when you do the I-45 <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from Dallas to Huntsville. Silver Eagle didn't show up on my <br/>
&gt; list, or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would have squeezed it in. I also didn't do Scarlet <br/>
&gt; Pimpernel (I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried for two days to figure out the clues and got stuck on <br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumbled lines), the ennis one near lake bardwell(we went <br/>
&gt; back down 287<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so we didn't take 45 down that far) and the two that <br/>
&gt; required you to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be a paid member of LBNA to get the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We will be heading to mineola, then canton this weekend. <br/>
&gt; Since there<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is no area search.. if any of you know of any boxes within a <br/>
&gt; few miles<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of hwy 80 from dallas to mineola or between mineola and <br/>
&gt; canton, please<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; let us know. Otherwise, I'll probably be doing alot of gps <br/>
