<div>When I read dewberry's 
thank you this morning it made me think about how meeting other letterboxers 
adds a whole new dimension to the pastime.  Anyone who has had to try to 
motivate hot, tired, thirsty kids just a little farther down the trail knows 
that letterboxing with kids isn't always what it appears to be in Family Fun 
articles.  Then you have a great morning like today...I hauled all the kids 
over to Edith Moore to find Dewberry's "Mia's Grasshopper".  It was COOL 
out, and we had enough snacks with us, and everyone was in a good mood, we had a 
delightful morning.  The real Mia (my 3 year old) was very happy with her 
grasshopper.  Dewberry has planted several boxes with my kids in mind, as I 
have tried to do for her, and it makes it so much more fun when the kids are 
looking for a box that has clues or a stamp or a place special for them.  I 
encourage everyone to try to come to the Book Gathering in October, Texas 
letterboxers are a great bunch of people to know!
