Hi Barefoot Lucy,  Thanks for the reply and your digging..lol!  <br/>
Yes'mam, I had tried through AQ, I make sure to update the planters<br/>
every time we find and don't find boxes.  I will try on LBNA as well and<br/>
I will take your advice and give them a while to reply.  I wouldnt mind<br/>
"adopting"  but that is a wait and see for the next 9 months.   I was<br/>
really worried that someone would find the box after us and would think<br/>
that we had stolen the log book even though I left a note in the box.<br/>

&gt; Interesting. I decided I would do a little digging about brandyfern to<br/>
see<br/>
&gt; what I could find.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; First off, the last time she logged on to AQ was February of this year<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; the last time she logged on to LBNA was April of 07. They joined this<br/>
list<br/>
&gt; in April of 07, but have never posted and are set to nomail, so they<br/>
aren't<br/>
&gt; receiving these messages either.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I'm guessing you tried to contact brandyfern through AQ. They have a<br/>
&gt; different address on LBNA, so you could try contacting them through<br/>
their<br/>
&gt; box listings there.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Three months isn't a terribly long time for someone not to log on to<br/>
one of<br/>
&gt; the websites. And a week isn't a real long time for someone not to<br/>
respond<br/>
&gt; to an email. It appears they are a teacher in Dallas, so I wouldn't be<br/>
&gt; surprised if they don't get more responsive after school is out.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If it were me, I would try to contact them through LBNA and again<br/>
through<br/>
&gt; AQ. Set the book aside. Then try them again in a month or so. If you<br/>
&gt; don't get a response then, do what you want (but personally, I<br/>
wouldn't mind<br/>
&gt; just setting it off to the side for a few months).<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; The standard time before a box is considered abandoned is one year on<br/>
both<br/>
&gt; AQ and LBNA. If brandyfern doesn't log on in that length or respond to<br/>
&gt; emails, you might consider adopting the boxex. In the meantime, you've<br/>
done<br/>
&gt; a good deed and you should feel really good about that!<br/>

Yes, we're signed up for the Tomato Fest Challenge but I think it may be a little over our "newbie" heads ...lol.  I was planning on writing you for some of those resources you mentioned... We would like to meet some fellow letterboxers!<br/>

&gt; You know, I see where you are coming from about someone thinking you had<br/>
&gt; stolen the logbook, but I don't think that should be a real worry.  One<br/>
&gt; thing I have noticed over the years is that there is a basic assumption of<br/>
&gt; trustworthiness among letterboxers.  Of course, there are exceptions to<br/>
&gt; every rule, but by and large, letterboxers (I'm talking about folks who<br/>
&gt; stick with it, not necessarily those who try it for a day or two and lose<br/>
&gt; interest - I don't think they get a firm enough grasp to understand the<br/>
&gt; forward impact of their actions) care what they are doing and try to do<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So much of what happens while we're out boxing is judgment and the best we<br/>
&gt; can do is put ourselves in the shoes of the placer, and to a lesser extent<br/>
&gt; of future finders, and ask ourselves what the best course of action would<br/>
&gt; be.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Say, I see you are signed up for the Tomato Fest Challenge - I'm looking<br/>
&gt; forward to meeting you!<br/>

Thank you so much for sending me the pictures of your letterboxing adventure on the trail where my Moose Series is located at Lake Grapevine. I loved getting to enjoy the trail through your "eyes". I very much appreciate your detailed sitreps about my boxes. I think you're a real asset to the letterboxing community and I'm looking forward to seeing you at the T.F.<br/>
