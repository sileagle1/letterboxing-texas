Hi Barefoot Lucy,  Thanks for the reply and your digging..lol!  <br>
Yes'mam, I had tried through AQ, I make sure to update the planters<br>
every time we find and don't find boxes.  I will try on LBNA as well and<br>
I will take your advice and give them a while to reply.  I wouldnt mind<br>
"adopting"  but that is a wait and see for the next 9 months.   I was<br>
really worried that someone would find the box after us and would think<br>
that we had stolen the log book even though I left a note in the box.<br>
<br>

Yes, we're signed up for the Tomato Fest Challenge but I think it may be a little over our "newbie" heads ...lol.  I was planning on writing you for some of those resources you mentioned... We would like to meet some fellow letterboxers!<br>

Thank you so much for sending me the pictures of your letterboxing adventure on the trail where my Moose Series is located at Lake Grapevine. I loved getting to enjoy the trail through your "eyes". I very much appreciate your detailed sitreps about my boxes. I think you're a real asset to the letterboxing community and I'm looking forward to seeing you at the T.F.<br>
