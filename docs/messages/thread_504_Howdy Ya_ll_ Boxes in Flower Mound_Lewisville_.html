Hello All,<br>
Papa Woodwose here. My family and I are boxers in the MD area. We've <br>
got a couple planted up there, and hunt when we can. I am a native <br>
Texan, and return each year to visit family at the holidays, we are <br>
spending 3 weeks in Flower Mound visiting with the my 12yr old boy, <br>
Dinobrains Woodwose. So.....I was wondering if there might be any <br>
Word Of Mouth boxes in this immediate area. I have found a few on the <br>
LBNA site in Carrolton, but none in Lewisville/Flower Mound. We do <br>
have plans to plant a couple here, (stay tuned...), but I was hoping <br>
to hunt locally for the preteens in our crew. So if ya might pass one <br>
on, and wish to due it privately, send it on to the email. And if <br>
there are any local boxers, who might suggest a good site for a new <br>
one, pass that on as well. And for FYI, two of our proposed places <br>
are "the" Flower Mound, and Gerault Park,(as we are all members of <br>
the Gerault clan, this last one is really important to us.)<br>
Hope to hear from ya'll, <br>
Peace and Happy Holidays,<br>
Shane "Papa Woodwose" Odom<br>
