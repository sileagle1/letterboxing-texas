were there recently and, even with the cool weather, the mosquitos <br>
were plentiful.  A nice little mild freeze might help and it looks <br>
like we ould get one in Coldspring tonight (don't know about <br>
Cypress). If you've been letterboxing for less than a year, you might <br>
not know that Telge Park is where all the Halloween boxes are.<br>
