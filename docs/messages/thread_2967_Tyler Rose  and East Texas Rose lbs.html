I checked the tyler rose box today, and sad to say, the stamp was not <br>
in the film case.  I looked around some and couldn't find it on the <br>
ground or in the rocks.  Also, the white rock was not in the wall.  I <br>
couldn't find it anywhere.  I looked around for any rock I could put in <br>
its place, and there was not a loose rock to be found. The box is <br>
tucked in the crevice, so it shouldn't be able to fall out.  I covered <br>
it with a couple leaves for some added safety, but sure would like to <br>
see a rock back over it.  I'll try to find and take one there if I get <br>
a chance, but I'm afraid a return trip might not be for a while.<br>
<br>
Also, while I was there, I checked Atoy Adventure's East TX rose, since <br>
I had found it in the past and there was a concern that it was <br>
missing.  The box is still in place.  There was a groundsman working <br>
his way toward me, so I didn't take the box out to check the contents, <br>
but it is definately in place.<br>
