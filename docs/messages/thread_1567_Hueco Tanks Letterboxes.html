&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *****Exactly.  To an outsider, we look like<br/>
&gt; litterbugs! <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; As a matter of fact, I had a meeting with the Site Superintendent <br/>
out at<br/>
&gt; Hueco Tanks today.  At first, it WAS looked upon as litter.  <br/>
Somebody left<br/>
&gt; litter in their park!<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Fortunately - the head ranger is a good friend of mine from a <br/>
previous park.<br/>
&gt; He spoke up, and defended Geocaching and by the fact that <br/>
Letterboxing is<br/>
&gt; much the same - letterboxing was defended too.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So as I stated in a previous message - what the rangers go along <br/>
with is<br/>
&gt; rarely reversed by the boss.  And so it went today.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I gave the boss a short presentation about Geocaching and <br/>
Letterboxing.  I<br/>
&gt; then notified her that there were two abandoned letterboxes on <br/>
site.  It was<br/>
&gt; my intention to recover them and either move them to good (read <br/>
SAFE) areas,<br/>
&gt; or remove them completely.  I produced the clues.  She, I , and <br/>
the head<br/>
&gt; ranger studied the clues.  It appears that both letterboxes are <br/>
now in<br/>
&gt; restricted access areas.  The park was too busy today for a ranger <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; personally guide me in those areas for locating the boxes.  But the<br/>
&gt; Superintendent promised to work with me as soon as things returned <br/>
to<br/>
&gt; normal.  I (and my wife) was put through the orientation video and <br/>
given a<br/>
&gt; registration card.  I was asked for and provided personal contact<br/>
&gt; information.  And I was promised that arrangements for me to come <br/>
back and<br/>
&gt; complete this task would be worked out.  I was to have a ranger <br/>
assigned to<br/>
&gt; work with me in completing this task.  I am looking forward to it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I believe that had I not had a previous friendship struck up with <br/>
the head<br/>
&gt; ranger there, it might not have gone as well.  There are over 3500 <br/>
Indian<br/>
&gt; pictures on the rocks out there.  They are VERY serious about <br/>
protecting<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; If a few people would like to E-mail the superintendent a note of <br/>
thanks - I<br/>
&gt; can provide her E-mail address.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I will say this again.  Proactively working with the rangers is <br/>
far better<br/>
&gt; than waiting for them to discover letterboxing accidentally.  But <br/>
in the end<br/>
&gt; - you must do what you think is right for your area.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; This is how my Sunday went!<br/>
