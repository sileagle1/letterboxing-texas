<div>Monkeytoes,</div>
<div>I am so glad to see that Maggies Meat Market 
is still in business.  I had been wondering about it.  They have 
absolutely THE BEST banana pudding I have ever eaten!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have you tried the tamales from Ventura's on 
Rio Grande, just west of DeTar?  How about Halepaska's for 
pastries?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I haven't tried the other places you 
mentioned.  I was in Victoria Thursday and ate at Hunan's for lunch...my 
favorite chinese place in town.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for a very good page about 
Victoria.  I think it is a beautiful city.  I nearly always come in on 
Vine St. just to look at the old homes.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How do you know so much about Victoria?  Maggie's actually had a <br/>
fire a few months ago.  They were closed for repairs until just <br/>
recently.  They did a little remodelling while they were at it and <br/>
now everything is back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
Excellent suggestion on Hallepaska's.  I'll have to add it on there <br/>
as a breakfast option.  I have tried Ventura's, but La Hacienda puts <br/>
them to shame.<br/>
<br/>
For Oriental cuisine, we go to Dragon Palace in the HEB shopping <br/>
center on Navarro.  I'll have to add that too for more variety.<br/>
<br/>
If you like the old homes, you should take the historical driving <br/>
tour.  I'm not sure where the actuall starting point is, but you <br/>
can't miss the signs driving through Old Victoria.  I'll find out <br/>
where to stop and list that, too.<br/>
