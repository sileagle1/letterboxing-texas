                    <div class="plaintext-content">What dawned as an ugly day turned out beautifully!  Thankfully, letterboxers<br>
are hardy souls, so no one was put off by the stormy weather.  While we had<br>
clouds most of the day, we had only occasional very light showers and the<br>
temperature was as perfect as we could have hoped.<br>
<br>
Lightning and I hit the door about 8:45 after waiting out the rain for a bit<br>
and checking out the weather.  We met TrailCat at the Old North Church about<br>
10:00.  Lightning went and explored the big part of the cemetery while<br>
TrailCat found Tres Cruces in the older part, which she had never realized<br>
was there.<br>
<br>
We went from there to Millard's Crossing, which was deserted for once, and<br>
quickly found Little Church at Millard's Crossing with a very nice stamp by<br>
Josephine.  Lightning insisted on exploring some of the little buildings<br>
there, so we did a bit of a history tour with him.  That's a neat little<br>
village, if you ever get a chance to go there while visiting Nacogdoches.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We also had a wonderful day boxing in Nac.  Thanks to Barefoot Lucy <br>
for coordinating the not-a-gathering, and to all of the placers for <br>
their great boxes!<br>
<br>
The day was off to a late start when my 20-year old alarm clock <br>
didn't go off at the set time of 5:15 a.m.  This clock is so old that <br>
it has fingernail grooves in the buttons to set the hour and minute.  <br>
And regardless of the set time, it now only seems to go off at 6:00 <br>
a.m. (my regular weekday wake-up time).  Whether or not I actually <br>
turn on the alarm, it goes off at 6:00 a.m.  weekends and holidays <br>
included.<br>
<br>
When I woke up at 6:00 a.m. (the time I should have been leaving the <br>
house), the first things to cross my consciousness were a loud clap <br>
of thunder and bright flash of lightening.  That couldn't be good.  I <br>
quickly turned on the TV and found a news report promising that, <br>
although severe, the storm would move quickly through the area <br>
leaving only an 80% chance of light rain for the rest of the day.  <br>
Like Lucy said, we letterboxers are a hardy bunch, so we decided that <br>
the trip was still a go.  After showering and dressing in record <br>
time, I called Runs for Chocolate to let her know we were running <br>
late.   Unfortunately she was already on her way to our pre-arranged <br>
meeting location, so she had to wait for almost an hour while I <br>
navigated my way across Houston, past several weather-related traffic <br>
accidents.  Sorry RFC!<br>
<br>
We finally headed toward Nacogdoches, with SoccerChik blissfully <br>
sleeping in the back seat while RFC and I happily munched on her <br>
amazing pumpkin-chocolate chip mini-muffins and tried to solve the <br>
clues for the Marvels letterbox.  We reached Nac around 10:00 and <br>
being rather OCD in my boxing style, I had the day planned out  we <br>
would start with the out-lying areas, then go to the north side of <br>
town and work our way south. <br>
<br>
We woke up SoccerChik when we reached the SFA Experimental Forest.  <br>
This is a beautiful little park with a very nice trail system that <br>
RFC thinks she'd like to revisit for a workout.  Look for us in the <br>
visitor's log.  We enjoyed the natural beauty of the forest while <br>
locating Lucy Locket's "Vivaldi's Winter", Baby Bear's "Letterboxing <br>
 So Easy a Caveman Can Do It", and Silver Eagle's "Sam-I-Am" (where <br>
we picked up the Tickastic HH).  We got a little wet from a very <br>
brief sprinkling of rain, but then the sun came out and the rest of <br>
the day was perfect letterboxing weather.  <br>
<br>
Next we headed over to Lake Nacogdoches and picked up Ashby's "Peace <br>
Now" and "Dragon by the Lake" -- both very nice boxes with sweet <br>
dedications to some important folks in her life.  We took a few <br>
minutes to enjoy the scenic overlook of the lake and take a couple of <br>
photos (in spite of our having humidity inspired hair-do's in all of <br>
them).<br>
<br>
Our next stop was at the Old North Church where we convinced <br>
SoccerChik to overcome her cemetery phobia and found Blue <br>
Butterfly's "Tres Cruces" while learning some fascinating history <br>
about the church and cemetery from the historical plaque and grave <br>
markers.  We briefly stopped at the Millard's Crossing historical <br>
village, but were unable to retrieve the box because a tour had just <br>
started.  We decided to come back later and headed to Maroney Park to <br>
find Ashby's "Krewe d'etat".  Our only question:  Do they publish an <br>
instruction book for those exercise stations?  LOL!  Hoping enough <br>
time had passed, we went back to the historical village to <br>
attempt "Little Church at Millard's Crossing".  The tour was just <br>
finishing and we decided to grab the box and stamp-in in the car.  <br>
RFC ran over to the church, wrestled with a 5-pound chunk of <br>
concrete, and tried to be discrete dashing back to the car with a <br>
rather large plastic box in-hand, while SoccerChik and I howled with <br>
laughter at her antics.  I tried to snap a photo of her running to <br>
the car, but was laughing too hard to hold the camera steady.  Sorry <br>
to laugh at your expense RFC, but it was priceless!  Her efforts were <br>
well worth it though, as the carving by Josephine was superb!  As <br>
much as we wanted to stay and explore the quaint little village, we <br>
were on a mission.   We swung by Pecan Park, and unsuccessfully tried <br>
to find Atoy Adventurer's "Pecan Paradise", but enjoyed watching the <br>
co-eds play Frisbee golf.<br>
<br>
Our next stop was SFA main campus where we discovered the campus was <br>
overrun with visitors and since we were unable to look for Atoy <br>
Adventurers' "Charlotte's Web" or "SFA Flower Power" due to the <br>
crowds we stopped for a quick lunch.  Afterward we found the area for <br>
Barefoot Lucy's "Go Jacks!" to be deserted, but alas, no box.  At the <br>
SFA Arboretum we were pleasantly surprised to discover such a <br>
fabulous little sanctuary.  We ooh'd and aah'd over the orange <br>
honeysuckle that smelled just like Juicy Fruit gum and the banana <br>
bush with a sweet heavenly fragrance that is so exquisite as to be <br>
indescribable.   We were afraid that we'd have to take RFC to the <br>
emergency room for inhaling too many banana blossoms!  Although the <br>
park was busy, we were able to look for "Texas Blueberry Festival" <br>
planted by Lucy Locket, but were not able to locate the box.  <br>
<br>
Since we still had a little time before meeting everyone else, we <br>
drove to the Ruby M. Mize Azalea Garden only to find the parking lot <br>
full, and to realize that we could have simply crossed a bridge from <br>
the arboretum.  We returned to the arboretum and entered the garden <br>
where we were overwhelmed by the magnificent display of Texas' <br>
largest azalea garden in full bloom.  The dedication plaque aptly <br>
exclaims "The kiss of the sun for pardon, the song of the birds for <br>
mirth; One's nearer God's heart in a garden, than anywhere else on <br>
earth."  We wandered around for a while in awe of the incredible <br>
variety of color before looking for the two boxes Enaj planted <br>
there.  When we arrived at the spot where we knew "Confetti" box was <br>
located, there were a couple of women taking photos of two little <br>
girls, but we were relieved to hear them say they had run out of <br>
film.  "Gee, that's too bad see ya!"   But they really wanted a few <br>
more shots.  I suggested they run to the nearest drugstore for more <br>
film.  "See ya!"  But they prefer to send their film to one of those <br>
places that returns free film with their photos.  Maybe they could go <br>
buy a disposable camera?  "See ya!"  But they didn't trust those.  <br>
Sigh!   What if I use my digital camera to take a couple of pictures <br>
and email them to you?  Great idea!  I strategically positioned the <br>
little girls and distracted the women away from the box while RFC and <br>
SoccerChik retrieved it and stamped in.  Yeah!   Next we found the <br>
tree where "Monkey Business" box was hidden.  Fortunately there was <br>
no one around, so SoccerChik and RFC took turns crawling under the <br>
azalea bushes to look for the box while I kept lookout for muggles.  <br>
Neither one could find it, and since we couldn't come up with a <br>
convincing cover story for WHY they were crawling under the bushes, <br>
we decided to give up before someone came along.<br>
<br>
By then it was time to meet everyone at Java Jack's.  It was really <br>
nice to meet those east Texas boxers whose names we've heard, but <br>
haven't previously had the pleasure to meet:  JBKokopelli, Ashby, <br>
Josephine and Trail Cat.  It was also nice to meet new boxer Dave and <br>
see him take such an interest in learning about this hobby/obsession <br>
of ours.  And of course seeing Barefoot Lucy and Gryzzled Gryphon is <br>
like seeing old friends again.  Now Lucy's already told you about <br>
some of the methods we employed in trying to get Green Shirt Guy to <br>
leave, but she neglected to mention a couple of the suggestions that <br>
were discarded:  Instead of sending SoccerChik over to flirt with GS <br>
Guy, we thought perhaps Mr. Gryphon should go flirt with him (GG <br>
declined to participate in that particular suggestion).  Or we could <br>
have started throwing things around the room (food fight anyone?).   <br>
In the end we decided that even if GS Guy learned about letterboxing, <br>
he would never make a very good boxer because he simply couldn't take <br>
a subtle (or not so subtle) hint.  <br>
<br>
After leaving Java Jack's, we wanted to try the Lanana Creek Trail <br>
letterboxes before it got too dark.  We stopped by the soccer fields <br>
for Trail Cat's "Happy Trails to You" and almost lost SoccerChik who <br>
wanted to find a pick-up game. Then we went back to Liberty Hall <br>
where a party was in full swing.  The food smelled incredible, and we <br>
tried to get SoccerChik to use her improving Spanish language skills <br>
to get us invited to dinner, but she wasn't cooperating.  So we <br>
headed down the trail and quickly found "Naturally Musical" <br>
and "Vivaldi's Summer" where we replaced the container and added a <br>
new logbook for Lucy Locket.  We continued down the trail to Zion <br>
Hill Baptist Church cemetery where we found Ashby's "Number Four".  <br>
As we were stamping in, we heard what sounded like a child laughing, <br>
but didn't see anyone around.  I said maybe it was a ghost, since we <br>
were at a cemetery.  (Dumb of me, now I'll NEVER get SoccerChik to <br>
another cemetery box!)  It was rapidly approaching dusk, so we <br>
finished up in a hurry and headed back toward the car.  We were <br>
walking side-by-side on the trail talking about the day, when <br>
suddenly SoccerChik screamed!  I looked at her and saw a man standing <br>
RIGHT behind her I screamed Runs for Chocolate screamed.  Turns out <br>
it was just a college student out for his evening run  (and since we <br>
were blocking the entire trail he tapped SoccerChik on the shoulder <br>
and said "excuse me"...causing the uproar).  The poor guy apologized <br>
all over himself "I'm sorry I'm SO sorry I'm REALLY sorry!"   <br>
After he went by we got the giggles.  We were still laughing when a <br>
few minutes later our friendly jogger had reached the end of the <br>
trail and was returning in our direction.  He was wearing a red <br>
shirt, so we saw him from quite a distance, but even so he starting <br>
calling out to us from about 50 yards away.  "It's okay It's me <br>
again I'm coming back by."    Poor thing - we scared him as much as <br>
he scared us.  <br>
<br>
Great weather Great boxes Great company... Great fun.  We had such <br>
a wonderful time in Nacogdoches we can't wait to return and explore <br>
more of the town and hopefully more boxes will be planted by then.  <br>
Thanks again to everyone who contributed their time and talents for <br>
our girl's day out!<br>

<div>Thanks to Barefoot Lucy for coordinating the non-event in Nac on 
Saturday!  Thanks to all of the boxers who planted boxes in Nac. It was 
great to see some stamps by  boxers in another part of the state! 
 Thanks to Sandibox and Soccerchik for letting me crash their "girls 
outing" and letting me catch a ride with them!  Sandibox did an 
awesome job recapping our day.  We really did have a fun time chatting and 
laughing our way across East Texas.  That poor, poor runner boy...he will 
probably never run on the Lanana Creek Trail again!  :)</div>

<div> </div>
<div>You really do have to bring SoccerChik to Rusk to box at Jim Hogg State Historical Site - there is a story about a pond that used to be there until a child drowned in it and the locals blew the dam up so the pond would drain and no one could drown there again.  It is rumored that children can be heard laughing there even still.  If you bring her, I really want to go with y'all, okay?  And after that, we can take her to Killough Monument and I can tell the story of the Killough Massacre - I love telling that story at the site and it can be really scary by virtue of being told on the spot.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Not to pick on SoccerChik, because she really is a great young lady.  She just fits in so well with whoever she is hanging out with, doesn't she?  It looked like the three of y'all made quite a team!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And I enjoyed looking at RFC's exquisite first logbook - it's funny how everyone's perception of what the logbook is "supposed" to be is different.  It was clear evidence that she jumps in with both feet - my first logbook was a spiral index card book because I didn't want to invest a lot if I didn't like letterboxing.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess we'll never know exactly who Green Shirt Guy would have responded to, will we?  I knew I was forgetting a couple of tactics, so I'm glad you filled those in!</div>

<br/>largest azalea garden in full bloom. The dedication plaque aptly <br/>exclaims "The kiss of the sun for pardon, the song of the birds for <br/>mirth; One's nearer God's heart in a garden, than anywhere else on 
<br/>earth." We wandered around for a while in awe of the incredible <br/>variety of color before looking for the two boxes Enaj planted <br/>there. When we arrived at the spot where we knew "Confetti" box was 
<br/>located, there were a couple of women taking photos of two little <br/>girls, but we were relieved to hear them say they had run out of <br/>film. "Gee, that's too bad see ya!" But they really wanted a few 
<br/>more shots. I suggested they run to the nearest drugstore for more <br/>film. "See ya!" But they prefer to send their film to one of those <br/>places that returns free film with their photos. Maybe they could go 
<br/>buy a disposable camera? "See ya!" But they didn't trust those. <br/>Sigh! What if I use my digital camera to take a couple of pictures <br/>and email them to you? Great idea! I strategically positioned the 
<br/>little girls and distracted the women away from the box while RFC and <br/>SoccerChik retrieved it and stamped in. Yeah! Next we found the <br/>tree where "Monkey Business" box was hidden. Fortunately there was 
<br/>no one around, so SoccerChik and RFC took turns crawling under the <br/>azalea bushes to look for the box while I kept lookout for muggles. <br/>Neither one could find it, and since we couldn't come up with a <br/>convincing cover story for WHY they were crawling under the bushes, 
<br/>we decided to give up before someone came along.<br/><br/>By then it was time to meet everyone at Java Jack's. It was really <br/>nice to meet those east Texas boxers whose names we've heard, but <br/>haven't previously had the pleasure to meet: JBKokopelli, Ashby, 
<br/>Josephine and Trail Cat. It was also nice to meet new boxer Dave and <br/>see him take such an interest in learning about this hobby/obsession <br/>of ours. And of course seeing Barefoot Lucy and Gryzzled Gryphon is <br/>
like seeing old friends again. Now Lucy's already told you about <br/>some of the methods we employed in trying to get Green Shirt Guy to <br/>leave, but she neglected to mention a couple of the suggestions that <br/>were discarded: Instead of sending SoccerChik over to flirt with GS 
<br/>Guy, we thought perhaps Mr. Gryphon should go flirt with him (GG <br/>declined to participate in that particular suggestion). Or we could <br/>have started throwing things around the room (food fight anyone?). <br/>In the end we decided that even if GS Guy learned about letterboxing, 
<br/>he would never make a very good boxer because he simply couldn't take <br/>a subtle (or not so subtle) hint. <br/><br/>After leaving Java Jack's, we wanted to try the Lanana Creek Trail <br/>letterboxes before it got too dark. We stopped by the soccer fields 
<br/>for Trail Cat's "Happy Trails to You" and almost lost SoccerChik who <br/>wanted to find a pick-up game. Then we went back to Liberty Hall <br/>where a party was in full swing. The food smelled incredible, and we 
<br/>tried to get SoccerChik to use her improving Spanish language skills <br/>to get us invited to dinner, but she wasn't cooperating. So we <br/>headed down the trail and quickly found "Naturally Musical" <br/>
and "Vivaldi's Summer" where we replaced the container and added a <br/>new logbook for Lucy Locket. We continued down the trail to Zion <br/>Hill Baptist Church cemetery where we found Ashby's "Number Four". 
<br/>As we were stamping in, we heard what sounded like a child laughing, <br/>but didn't see anyone around. I said maybe it was a ghost, since we <br/>were at a cemetery. (Dumb of me, now I'll NEVER get SoccerChik to 
<br/>another cemetery box!) It was rapidly approaching dusk, so we <br/>finished up in a hurry and headed back toward the car. We were <br/>walking side-by-side on the trail talking about the day, when <br/>suddenly SoccerChik screamed! I looked at her and saw a man standing 
<br/>RIGHT behind her I screamed Runs for Chocolate screamed. Turns out <br/>it was just a college student out for his evening run (and since we <br/>were blocking the entire trail he tapped SoccerChik on the shoulder <br/>
and said "excuse me"...causing the uproar). The poor guy apologized <br/>all over himself "I'm sorry I'm SO sorry I'm REALLY sorry!" <br/>After he went by we got the giggles. We were still laughing when a 
<br/>few minutes later our friendly jogger had reached the end of the <br/>trail and was returning in our direction. He was wearing a red <br/>shirt, so we saw him from quite a distance, but even so he starting <br/>calling out to us from about 50 yards away. "It's okay It's me 
<br/>again I'm coming back by." Poor thing - we scared him as much as <br/>he scared us. <br/><br/>Great weather Great boxes Great company... Great fun. We had such <br/>a wonderful time in Nacogdoches we can't wait to return and explore 
<br/>more of the town and hopefully more boxes will be planted by then. <br/>Thanks again to everyone who contributed their time and talents for <br/>our girl's day out!<br/><br/></p></div><span style="COLOR: white" width="1">
