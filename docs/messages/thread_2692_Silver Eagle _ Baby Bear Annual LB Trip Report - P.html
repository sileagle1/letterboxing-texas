                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">The next morning we awoke to rain pelting the tent, so we stayed<br/>
put contemplating our options for about an hour.  The rain slowed<br/>
down so we decided to head out with raingear on.  I told Baby<br/>
Bear we would have to cut some boxes off the itinerary  because<br/>
of our late start, but he said no way, so we decided to go with<br/>
the route as planned and see what happened.  Our first few boxes<br/>
were in the Rusk area, including The Haunted Trail.  This was<br/>
especially eerie since it was pretty dark and dreary back in <br/>
the woods, and I kept looking over my shoulder to make sure nobody<br/>
was following us.  It felt like the trees had eyes, but we found<br/>
the boxes without incident and continued on toward New Summerfield.<br/>
<br/>
We soon realized that getting to many of the boxes that day was<br/>
going to be a challenge because of the slick dirt roads and many<br/>
confusing county roads (is is 3514 or 3715?).  Most of the clues<br/>
are very descriptive about where to go, but they assume you are<br/>
only going to that box.  We were trying to string a bunch together,<br/>
so getting from one box to another would take us on some interesting<br/>
"shortcuts".  I had mapped our route using Microsoft Streets &amp; Trips<br/>
and it does a pretty good job for the most part.  However, it tries<br/>
to get you from one place to another the fastest way, no matter<br/>
how bad the road is.  Since we did not have a real detailed map<br/>
of the area, we had to use its recommendations with a grain of<br/>
salt and check it against the clues to see if it made sense.  Baby<br/>
Bear did a great job navigating as I followed his directions and<br/>
we found most of the places, sometimes on the first try.<br/>
<br/>
We also soon realized that we would be visiting a lot of cemeteries!<br/>
This actually worked out well since nobody was ever around and the<br/>
boxes were fairly quick to find.  We found several series of boxes,<br/>
including JB's Tribute To Joan and Tatertx's Pooh.  We did not<br/>
have any problems to speak of, but at one cemetery we had a bull<br/>
stare us down from across the fence while getting a box.  Later <br/>
that day, as we were going down yet another county road to yet<br/>
another cemetery, we suddenly realized it was the same cemetery<br/>
we had been to that morning, with the same bull staring us down!<br/>
Evidently I had not realized both boxes were in the same cemetery, <br/>
so I had routed us to it at two different times.  We got a good<br/>
laugh at that and at the bull.  I also finally realized that the<br/>
bull probably didn't like my fanny pack, since it is red.  Feeling<br/>
like conquering matadors we pushed on to Jacksonville.<br/>
<br/>
Our first stop was Love's Lookout for the February Holiday Series,<br/>
and by luck the sun decided to come out.  This is a great place<br/>
with a beautiful view, especially when the weather is clear,<br/>
and I talked Baby Bear into actually sitting down and eating lunch<br/>
at a table instead of in the car while driving.  Of course that <br/>
meant we had to do the boxes even quicker.  Running back up that<br/>
hill was worth the view, though.<br/>
<br/>
After a few other boxes in town we stopped at the HH Hostel and<br/>
left one, took one and stamped in a few others.  Next it was on<br/>
to Nichols Green Park I and II for the many boxes there.  What a<br/>
great park and much bigger than I realized!  Since it was not too<br/>
late in the day, I started to think we might complete the itinerary<br/>
after all.  We just had a few more cemeteries on our way back to <br/>
Rusk, then a box in Dialville.  We needed gas and ice, so we<br/>
decided to stop in Rusk to eat and get resupplied, then head to<br/>
the last box.  We got there right at dusk and made it back to<br/>
camp on the last drops of daylight, exhausted but happy.  We fell<br/>
asleep with visions of cemeteries and county roads dancing in our<br/>
heads.<br/>
<br/>
The next day was cold (47) but dry so we broke camp and headed to<br/>
Palestine.  Barefoot Lucy's box at Davey Dogwood Park sounded hard<br/>
to find from the clues, so I was glad it was barely light by the<br/>
time we arrived at the park.  Since we planned to hide boxes at<br/>
the park, we tried to keep track of what roads we took to<br/>
finally find BL's parking area so we could put them in our clues.<br/>
I hope BL doesn't mind that we gave a little more description for<br/>
our boxes, but you can always just use her clues and not ours<br/>
if you want to have our experience.  Another great park, and the<br/>
dogwoods were awesome!  We stopped in town for another of her<br/>
boxes (Columbia) at a neat little park, then headed for I45 and<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
We stopped at Boggy Creek SP so I could get Baby Bear's box, then<br/>
went on to Madisonville for the boxes by Boots and Quilter.  We <br/>
decided to get Sarah's Flag first, since it was beyond town, and<br/>
come back for the others.  As Baby Bear started reading the clues<br/>
for directions he came to the part that said "go 2.3 miles down the<br/>
dirt road directly into the cemetery, but be careful if it has<br/>
rained recently".  We both looked at each other and said "this<br/>
could be interesting".  The road was pretty slick and I was a<br/>
little worried at times since I don't have 4-wheel drive, but<br/>
we were in an Expedition that should be able to handle it.  At one <br/>
point a group of cows were blocking the road and I thought we were <br/>
going to have to play matador again, but with some gentle honking <br/>
we got them to move and made it to the cemetery.  We thought we   <br/>
might be first finders since the box is fairly new and the road is <br/>
so daunting.  We should not have been surprised, however, when we <br/>
saw Gryzzled Gryphon had already been there.  I would love to hear <br/>
him tell the story of how he got his cranberry PT Cruiser down that <br/>
road!  The box is great and tells an interesting story about a woman<br/>
lost to history for most of us.  I am grateful Quilter brought us to<br/>
Sarah's final resting place.<br/>
<br/>
We headed back to Madisonville, skirting the cows again, where we<br/>
would find 2 more boxes and I would place one.  I had originally<br/>
created my Mushroom Capital box several months ago when Madison<br/>
county had no boxes, but by the time we got there Boots had already<br/>
place a mushroom box.  His is named different and is a much better<br/>
stamp, but I placed mine anyway.  Then it was on to Huntsville where<br/>
we got another Boots box at the cemetery with Sam Houston.  I also<br/>
put a new box at his Memorial park since my original Steamboat Sam<br/>
box went missing.  <br/>
<br/>
Our final stop was Huntsville SP, where I needed to get Baby Bear's<br/>
box and the newest one from Norasta.  Baby Bear graciously walked<br/>
the 3+ miles with me to get his box, then we both got the other one<br/>
on a 2+ mile trail.  Both are still there with no finders, so <br/>
hopefully the curse of that park is over.  Tired and ready to<br/>
get home, we skipped the planned boxes in Woodlands and headed for<br/>
the house, arriving at dinner time, reluctant to enter the Real <br/>
World again.  We had to go from being two boys getting dirty on<br/>
an adventure to responsible adults again, and it was tough.  We<br/>
are already looking forward to the next trip!<br/>
<br/>
We want to thank all that placed boxes for us to find.  Without<br/>
you, the trip would not have been half as fun.  Our final tally:<br/>
<br/>
Miles Driven:  over 900<br/>
Boxes Found:  over 100<br/>
Boxes Placed:  14 between us<br/>
Injuries: 1 near scorpion sting and one near snake encounter<br/>
