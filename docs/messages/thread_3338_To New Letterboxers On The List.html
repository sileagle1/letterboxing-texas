                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently a new letterboxer on this List departed with the explanation <br/>
that a lot of time was spent on "inside circle" talk among old <br/>
friends, and they didn't feel included.  It made me wonder how many <br/>
other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so let me give <br/>
y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/>
<br/>
First off, let me just say that the people on this List are some of <br/>
the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to newcomers.  <br/>
When a new person posts, they almost always greet them warmly.  I <br/>
have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me just say <br/>
belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"!<br/>
<br/>
Now it is true that many of us share a long history and have <br/>
some "inside" jokes, but rather than feel excluded, I urge you to ask <br/>
for explanations when you don't understand something.  I realize many <br/>
people don't like to post comments for fear of being ridiculed like <br/>
on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us.  The only reason <br/>
not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/>
<br/>
Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and actually <br/>
meet some of the boxers on this List.  So I would like to formally <br/>
invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) coming <br/>
up in 2 weeks.  I will post the web links at the bottom of this <br/>
note.  A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at these Events <br/>
and you could be a part of it.  Even though you might not feel part <br/>
of our past, you can start including yourself in our future, and I <br/>
encourage you to do so.<br/>
<br/>
It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels excluded, <br/>
and that would be great.  However, if this isn't the case, I hope I <br/>
have made you feel a little bit more welcome.  Either way, TX <br/>
Letterboxers are special, no matter what anyone says!<br/>

loving reading the posts. I'm a brand new letterboxer.<br/>
Actually I had heard about letterboxing a year ago and<br/>
tried to go find one, but for my first time out I<br/>
wasn't able to find it. So I got discouraged. A few<br/>
days ago I decided to try it again in a different<br/>
area. We found 3! (Thanks to bluebutterfly for great<br/>
hiding places and wonderful boxes) now I'm completely<br/>
and totally hooked! We went back out the next day and<br/>
found 5 more! LOL I find myself really struggling not<br/>
to go outside right now in the pouring rain to go hunt<br/>
some more. LOL<br/>
<br/>
This has been so great for us. My husband and I have 5<br/>
kids that we homeschool, so this has been a great<br/>
family activity for us to do. Very educational too<br/>
visiting some of these historical places. :) Our<br/>
trailname is The Rodgers 7.<br/>
<br/>
I can tell we still have alot to learn like the<br/>
meaning of all the differnt types of boxes.<br/>
(Hitchikers, travelers, virtual boxes etc. I don't<br/>
know what those are.) Plus after reading the post<br/>
about "What's in your bag?" I've realized I need to do<br/>
some major shopping. I only carried with me our stamp,<br/>
1 ink pad, log book, and pen.<br/>
<br/>
I look forward to learning from you veterans. I so<br/>
wish I could attend the gathering on the 1st, but we<br/>
already have plans for that day. :( Perhaps I can make<br/>
the next one.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>If you've found some of Blue Butterfly's boxes. you MIGHT be in my area.  Do you care to tell us what general area you are in?  Just curious...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are times I simply can't stand to stay inside in the rain.  Once my kids, SJZ and Lightning, and I were letterboxing in Nacogdoches when a thunderstorm hit.  We were in a groove and there are so many cool boxes over there.  We got to the Stephen F Austin Experimental Forest and it was pouring down rain.  Normally we're pretty democratic while we're letterboxing and majority rules (that isn't to say the odd man out doesn't have the right to rebut and persuade), but both of the kids voted against getting out.  I just couldn't stand the thought of NOT getting the boxes there, so I told them they could stay in the car and I would go get the boxes and be back in a bit.  They couldn't stand me being out there by myself, so we donned plastic rain ponchos and headed into the woods.  We got to the first box and realized it was going to be quite a challenge to keep everything dry while we logged in, so we worked it out where we made a canopy of our ponchos and we each took a role in the process so that at no time did we have to drop our ponchos.  Aside from the fits of giggling, we managed quite well and had it to an art form when we got to the second box!  We rehid the second one and dropped our ponchos and ran for the car, not caring at that point if we got wet.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So sometimes...you just gotta do what you gotta do.</div>

<div>WELCOME to the Rodgers 7! Lucky you, you're in an area that is rich is letterboxes and good letterboxers. You will pick up lots of great ideas and info from the boxes you find as well as messages on this list. I'm sorry you won't be able to attend the TALE this year; I can't tell you how much I am looking forward to seeing everyone and meeting lots of new boxers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Boxing in the rain? Just do it (as Nike encourages)! One of my favorite and most memorable letterboxing adventures was letterboxing with Viewfinder in the pouring rain in Maine, following very fresh, very deep (meaning large animals) moose and wolf tracks on the trail. We got lost, but accidentally found the letterbox anyway, then proceeded to get lost again on the way back to the trail head. We went directly to a little cafe in Ranger, Maine to dry off and have a warm bowl of soup and struck up a conversation with the people at the table beside us, only to find out they were from Grand Prairie, Texas (just a few miles down the road). We shared pictures on our digital cameras of "their moose sightings" to "our moose sighting". I'll never forget a single detail of that fabulous day (from the bright red canoe upside down on the banks of the foggy lake) to the puddle of rain dripping off my hair onto the wooden floor in the restaurant! One of the bumper stickers we saw from time to time said, "If you haven't hiked in the rain, you haven't seen Maine!" Go hiking in the rain.... you'll love it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Again, WELCOME!</div>
<div>Aptly,</div>
<div>Puddle Splasher</div>

     You will find this list full of info about letterboxing. Feel <br/>
free to ask any questions you might have as there is a great amount <br/>
of boxing experience here and we all were newboxers at one time, so <br/>
we understand and want to help. <br/>

                    <html><body><p>SE,<br/><br/>Good post! When I started in August 2006 I had a lot of questions. I guess the anonymity of the computer made me brave. Y'all didn't know me, so I couldn't embarrass myself. I've learned so much from this list that I wouldn't have learned anywhere else. I even tried the new boxer's list. It's a good list, but I like the local list for my purposes.<br/><br/>I learned about BEA's, LSS's (and even learned I'm living with one, whooda thunk?), Moose do stay in Texas. And, most of all, friends that I have yet to meet.<br/><br/>I'd also like to welcome all the new peeps on the list, I've been a bit lax in that department, not to mention I was gone from phones and computers for a whole wonderful week.<br/><br/>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Silver Eagle &lt;sileagle@alltel.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Recently a new letterboxer on this List departed with the explanation <br/> that a lot of time was spent on "inside circle" talk among old <br/> friends, and they didn't feel included.  It made me wonder how many <br/> other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so let me give <br/> y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/> <br/> First off, let me just say that the people on this List are some of <br/> the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to newcomers.  <br/> When a new person posts, they almost always greet them warmly.  I <br/> have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me just say <br/> belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"<wbr/>!<br/> <br/> Now it is true that many of us share a long history and have <br/> some "inside" jokes, but
 rather than feel excluded, I urge you to ask <br/> for explanations when you don't understand something.  I realize many <br/> people don't like to post comments for fear of being ridiculed like <br/> on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us.  The only reason <br/> not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/> <br/> Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and actually <br/> meet some of the boxers on this List.  So I would like to formally <br/> invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) coming <br/> up in 2 weeks.  I will post the web links at the bottom of this <br/> note.  A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at these Events <br/> and you could be a part of it.  Even though you might not feel part <br/> of our past, you can start including yourself in our future, and I <br/> encourage you to do so.<br/> <br/> It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels excluded, <br/> and that would be great. 
 However, if this isn't the case, I hope I <br/> have made you feel a little bit more welcome.

<div>Maybe we could move El Paso a little closer by doing a "Texas Tummy Tuck", but then those in the Alpine or Midland/Odessa area may get caught in the zipper and be a little annoyed. I guess you're just going to have to get that Jeep running and drive out here next year for the Sixth Annual Texas LBing Event.</div>

<p>SE,<br/><br/>Good post! When I started in August 2006 I had a lot of questions. I guess the anonymity of the computer made me brave. Y'all didn't know me, so I couldn't embarrass myself. I've learned so much from this list that I wouldn't have learned anywhere else. I even tried the new boxer's list. It's a good list, but I like the local list for my purposes.<br/>
<br/>I learned about BEA's, LSS's (and even learned I'm living with one, whooda thunk?), Moose do stay in Texas. And, most of all, friends that I have yet to meet.<br/><br/>I'd also like to welcome all the new peeps on the list, I've been a bit lax in that department, not to mention I was gone from phones and computers for a whole wonderful week.<br/>

<div>Recently a new letterboxer on this List departed with the explanation <br/> that a lot of time was spent on "inside circle" talk among old <br/> friends, and they didn't feel included.  It made me wonder how many <br/>
 other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so let me give <br/> y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/> <br/> First off, let me just say that the people on this List are some of <br/> the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to newcomers.  <br/>
 When a new person posts, they almost always greet them warmly.  I <br/> have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me just say <br/> belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"!<br/> <br/> Now it is true that many of us share a long history and have <br/>
 some "inside" jokes, but
 rather than feel excluded, I urge you to ask <br/> for explanations when you don't understand something.  I realize many <br/> people don't like to post comments for fear of being ridiculed like <br/> on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us.  The only reason <br/>
 not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/> <br/> Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and actually <br/> meet some of the boxers on this List.  So I would like to formally <br/> invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) coming <br/>
 up in 2 weeks.  I will post the web links at the bottom of this <br/> note.  A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at these Events <br/> and you could be a part of it.  Even though you might not feel part <br/>
 of our past, you can start including yourself in our future, and I <br/> encourage you to do so.<br/> <br/> It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels excluded, <br/> and that would be great. 
 However, if this isn't the case, I hope I <br/> have made you feel a little bit more welcome.  Either way, TX <br/> Letterboxers are special, no matter what anyone says!<br/> <br/> Silver Eagle<br/> <br/> Event registration on AQ:  <br/>

<div>In the beginning of letterboxing in Texas, boxers were few and far and so were boxes.  Being in a state as big as Texas, it was a wonder we were able to find each other at all, much less to find each others' boxes! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shortly before the second annual gathering - this time of year, I suppose - we had some boxes come up missing, mainly in the DFW area.  We were all concerned about it because it was hard enough getting boxes out there to have them disappear as well.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now realize that several things were happening at about the time of this story - Gryzzled Gryphon's sig stamp had begun to show up in our logbooks and we were driven to distraction trying to figure out who he was, some of us had been doing some research regarding the pre-Silver Eagle/Baby Bear days of letterboxing, and - most importantly to this story - some boxes had gone missing in the DFW area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ruby Tuesday, of whom y'all have heard so much recently, was a force to be reckoned with and she had turned her attention to discovering the identity of Gryzzle Gryphon.  In fact, she and her family had created a box to trap the poor GG.  She even told of sitting in the car with Cactus Licker (her youngest son) and watching the box with binoculars - now realize, this must have been very important to her because she was a woman with a lot of irons in the fire and I'm sure there were other things she could have been doing with her time.  Despite the heavy attention on that box by Celtic Lions, it STILL went missing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so did some other DFW area boxes.  After much discussion, we decided these boxes were stolen by aliens.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At about the same time, Ruby and I had gotten very interested in the ladies who preceded SE and BB in letterboxing by about a year and a half perhaps.  They were all artists who liked experimenting with alternative media and letterboxing was right down their alley.  The problem was, they couldn't stand to see boxes go missing, but disappear they did and their precious art was gone.  They considered letterboxing to be a failure for them, although we are so glad they gave it a shot! We learned quite a lot about them by reading the archives on the Big List and googling to find other bits and pieces of information.  And we learned that the first gathering in Bastrop was not, in fact, the first gathering!   Nooooo!  In fact, the DFW ladies had all gotten together at a Crescent City Bakery, which was not too far from where at least some of their boxes had gone missing.  Ruby wanted to have a get-together at that same bakery, but as I recall it never happened.  BUT - her sleuthlike mind developed a connection and she posed her theory to the rest of us.  It WAS aliens who stole the boxes, but not just any aliens - these aliens liked beignets!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now as I mentioned, the second annual gathering was approaching - a memorable event at Brazos Bend State Park.  Several things happened at this event, including attendance by Wanda of Wanda and Pete fame, a monstrous deluge which Lightning and I will personally never forget, two wild nights of night boxing which Silver Eagle and Baby Bear can attest to, and the attendance by our good friend, BoxDN.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>BoxDN, being a good New Orleansian (hey jbanana - is that the right term?), volunteered to fix a fine breakfast for all of us of - BEIGNETS!  He was a man of his word and he warmed us up from the inside out with beignets and good coffee.  What a guy!  He also volunteered to coordinate a diplomatic effort between the aliens and we, Texas letterboxers.  He brought with him an emissary from the aliens and he hung out everywhere BoxDN went.  We were starting to soften up a bit toward the alien emissary; that is, until we had casualties right at the gathering!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Back to Ruby - Ruby and the Celtic Lions had put together an unbelievably amazing game of letterboxing Clue.  It was a game of a magnitude that only Ruby, and probably Dewberry, could derive.  Some of the boxes, which depicted locations and suspects and weapons, were hidden in the park.  And a box went missing.  You cannot say that we are not competitive - it was a wild game of folks determined to win, win, win.  But while we are competitive, we are also fiercely aware of the rules and determined to play fairly to win fair and square.  I believe to this day that this was not a case of sneakiness by a boxer, and everyone who was there will say the same thing.  We all - to a person - believe the box was abducted by aliens.  We spread out and looked for it, but it was - GONE.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Things didn't look good for the emissary and even BoxDN turned on him.  He was hung in effigy and his body never left the park.  It was a justifiable action by a mob intent on justice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so you see, that is why Beignet-Eating Aliens, BEAs, are a part of Texas letterboxing history.  We must never forget so that we are always vigilant.</div>

<div>At about the same time, Ruby and I had gotten very interested in the ladies who preceded SE and BB in letterboxing by about a year and a half perhaps.  They were all artists who liked experimenting with alternative media and letterboxing was right down their alley.  The problem was, they couldn't stand to see boxes go missing, but disappear they did and their precious art was gone.  They considered letterboxing to be a failure for them, although we are so glad they gave it a shot! We learned quite a lot about them by reading the archives on the Big List and googling to find other bits and pieces of information.  And we learned that the first gathering in Bastrop was not, in fact, the first gathering!   Nooooo!  In fact, the DFW ladies had all gotten together at a Crescent City Bakery, which was not too far from where at least some of their boxes had gone missing.  Ruby wanted to have a get-together at that same bakery, but as I recall it never happened.  BUT - her sleuthlike mind developed a connection and she posed her theory to the rest of us.  It WAS aliens who stole the boxes, but not just any aliens - these aliens liked beignets!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now as I mentioned, the second annual gathering was approaching - a memorable event at Brazos Bend State Park.  Several things happened at this event, including attendance by Wanda of Wanda and Pete fame, a monstrous deluge which Lightning and I will personally never forget, two wild nights of night boxing which Silver Eagle and Baby Bear can attest to, and the attendance by our good friend, BoxDN.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>BoxDN, being a good New Orleansian (hey jbanana - is that the right term?), volunteered to fix a fine breakfast for all of us of - BEIGNETS!  He was a man of his word and he warmed us up from the inside out with beignets and good coffee.  What a guy!  He also volunteered to coordinate a diplomatic effort between the aliens and we, Texas letterboxers.  He brought with him an emissary from the aliens and he hung out everywhere BoxDN went.  We were starting to soften up a bit toward the alien emissary; that is, until we had casualties right at the gathering!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Back to Ruby - Ruby and the Celtic Lions had put together an unbelievably amazing game of letterboxing Clue.  It was a game of a magnitude that only Ruby, and probably Dewberry, could derive.  Some of the boxes, which depicted locations and suspects and weapons, were hidden in the park.  And a box went missing.  You cannot say that we are not competitive - it was a wild game of folks determined to win, win, win.  But while we are competitive, we are also fiercely aware of the rules and determined to play fairly to win fair and square.  I believe to this day that this was not a case of sneakiness by a boxer, and everyone who was there will say the same thing.  We all - to a person - believe the box was abducted by aliens.  We spread out and looked for it, but it was - GONE.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Things didn't look good for the emissary and even BoxDN turned on him.  He was hung in effigy and his body never left the park.  It was a justifiable action by a mob intent on justice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so you see, that is why Beignet-Eating Aliens, BEAs, are a part of Texas letterboxing history.  We must never forget so that we are always vigilant.</div>

 friends, and they didn't feel included.  It made me wonder how many <br/> other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so let me give <br/> y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/> <br/> First off, let me just say that the people on this List are some of <br/> the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to newcomers.  <br/> When a new person posts, they almost always greet them warmly.  I <br/> have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me just say <br/> belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"<wbr/>!<br/> <br/> Now it is true that many of us share a long history and have <br/> some "inside" jokes, but rather than feel excluded, I urge you to ask <br/> for explanations when you don't understand something.  I realize many <br/> people don't like to post comments for fear of being ridiculed like <br/> on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us.  The only reason <br/> not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/> <br/> Another way to feel
 included is to attend a Gathering and actually <br/> meet some of the boxers on this List.  So I would like to formally <br/> invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) coming <br/> up in 2 weeks.  I will post the web links at the bottom of this <br/> note.  A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at these Events <br/> and you could be a part of it.  Even though you might not feel part <br/> of our past, you can start including yourself in our future, and I <br/> encourage you to do so.<br/> <br/> It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels excluded, <br/> and that would be great.  However, if this isn't the case, I hope I <br/> have made you feel a little bit more welcome.  Either way, TX <br/> Letterboxers are special, no matter what anyone says!<br/> <br/> Silver Eagle<br/> <br/> Event registration on AQ:  <br/> <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=508">http://www.atlasque<wbr/>st.com/events/<wbr/>event.html?<wbr/>gEventId=<wbr/>508</a><br/> <br/> Event website information:  <br/> <a href="http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/Events/TALE05/">http://www.geocitie<wbr/>s.com/sileagle1/<wbr/>Events/TALE05/</a><br/> <br/> </div> </div> <!--End group email --> </blockquote><br/><p>

<div>
<div>
<div>Well.  Gather round children, because it's STORYTIME!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the beginning of letterboxing in Texas, boxers were few and far and so were boxes.  Being in a state as big as Texas, it was a wonder we were able to find each other at all, much less to find each others' boxes! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Shortly before the second annual gathering - this time of year, I suppose - we had some boxes come up missing, mainly in the DFW area.  We were all concerned about it because it was hard enough getting boxes out there to have them disappear as well.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now realize that several things were happening at about the time of this story - Gryzzled Gryphon's sig stamp had begun to show up in our logbooks and we were driven to distraction trying to figure out who he was, some of us had been doing some research regarding the pre-Silver Eagle/Baby Bear days of letterboxing, and - most importantly to this story - some boxes had gone missing in the DFW area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ruby Tuesday, of whom y'all have heard so much recently, was a force to be reckoned with and she had turned her attention to discovering the identity of Gryzzle Gryphon.  In fact, she and her family had created a box to trap the poor GG.  She even told of sitting in the car with Cactus Licker (her youngest son) and watching the box with binoculars - now realize, this must have been very important to her because she was a woman with a lot of irons in the fire and I'm sure there were other things she could have been doing with her time.  Despite the heavy attention on that box by Celtic Lions, it STILL went missing!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so did some other DFW area boxes.  After much discussion, we decided these boxes were stolen by aliens.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At about the same time, Ruby and I had gotten very interested in the ladies who preceded SE and BB in letterboxing by about a year and a half perhaps.  They were all artists who liked experimenting with alternative media and letterboxing was right down their alley.  The problem was, they couldn't stand to see boxes go missing, but disappear they did and their precious art was gone.  They considered letterboxing to be a failure for them, although we are so glad they gave it a shot! We learned quite a lot about them by reading the archives on the Big List and googling to find other bits and pieces of information.  And we learned that the first gathering in Bastrop was not, in fact, the first gathering!   Nooooo!  In fact, the DFW ladies had all gotten together at a Crescent City Bakery, which was not too far from where at least some of their boxes had gone missing.  Ruby wanted to have a get-together at that same bakery, but as I recall it never happened.  BUT - her sleuthlike mind developed a connection and she posed her theory to the rest of us.  It WAS aliens who stole the boxes, but not just any aliens - these aliens liked beignets!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now as I mentioned, the second annual gathering was approaching - a memorable event at Brazos Bend State Park.  Several things happened at this event, including attendance by Wanda of Wanda and Pete fame, a monstrous deluge which Lightning and I will personally never forget, two wild nights of night boxing which Silver Eagle and Baby Bear can attest to, and the attendance by our good friend, BoxDN.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>BoxDN, being a good New Orleansian (hey jbanana - is that the right term?), volunteered to fix a fine breakfast for all of us of - BEIGNETS!  He was a man of his word and he warmed us up from the inside out with beignets and good coffee.  What a guy!  He also volunteered to coordinate a diplomatic effort between the aliens and we, Texas letterboxers.  He brought with him an emissary from the aliens and he hung out everywhere BoxDN went.  We were starting to soften up a bit toward the alien emissary; that is, until we had casualties right at the gathering!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Back to Ruby - Ruby and the Celtic Lions had put together an unbelievably amazing game of letterboxing Clue.  It was a game of a magnitude that only Ruby, and probably Dewberry, could derive.  Some of the boxes, which depicted locations and suspects and weapons, were hidden in the park.  And a box went missing.  You cannot say that we are not competitive - it was a wild game of folks determined to win, win, win.  But while we are competitive, we are also fiercely aware of the rules and determined to play fairly to win fair and square.  I believe to this day that this was not a case of sneakiness by a boxer, and everyone who was there will say the same thing.  We all - to a person - believe the box was abducted by aliens.  We spread out and looked for it, but it was - GONE.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Things didn't look good for the emissary and even BoxDN turned on him.  He was hung in effigy and his body never left the park.  It was a justifiable action by a mob intent on justice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so you see, that is why Beignet-Eating Aliens, BEAs, are a part of Texas letterboxing history.  We must never forget so that we are always vigilant.</div>

give <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; First off, let me just say that the people on this List are some of <br/>

newcomers.  <br/>
&gt; When a new person posts, they almost always greet them warmly.  I <br/>
&gt; have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me just say <br/>
&gt; belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now it is true that many of us share a long history and have <br/>
&gt; some "inside" jokes, but rather than feel excluded, I urge you to <br/>
ask <br/>
&gt; for explanations when you don't understand something.  I realize <br/>
many <br/>
&gt; people don't like to post comments for fear of being ridiculed like <br/>
&gt; on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us.  The only <br/>
reason <br/>
&gt; not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and actually <br/>
&gt; meet some of the boxers on this List.  So I would like to formally <br/>
&gt; invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) <br/>
coming <br/>
&gt; up in 2 weeks.  I will post the web links at the bottom of this <br/>
&gt; note.  A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at these <br/>
Events <br/>
&gt; and you could be a part of it.  Even though you might not feel part <br/>
&gt; of our past, you can start including yourself in our future, and I <br/>
&gt; encourage you to do so.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels <br/>

&gt; &gt;  &gt; Recently a new letterboxer on this List departed with the <br/>
&gt; &gt;  explanation <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; that a lot of time was spent on "inside circle" talk among old <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; friends, and they didn't feel included.  It made me wonder how <br/>
&gt; many <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so let <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; &gt;  give <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; First off, let me just say that the people on this List are <br/>
some <br/>
&gt; of <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to <br/>
&gt; &gt;  newcomers.  <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; When a new person posts, they almost always greet them <br/>
warmly.  <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me just <br/>
&gt; say <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"!<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Now it is true that many of us share a long history and have <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; some "inside" jokes, but rather than feel excluded, I urge you <br/>
&gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt;  ask <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; for explanations when you don't understand something.  I <br/>
realize <br/>
&gt; &gt;  many <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; people don't like to post comments for fear of being ridiculed <br/>
&gt; like <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us.  The only <br/>
&gt; &gt;  reason <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and <br/>
&gt; actually <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; meet some of the boxers on this List.  So I would like to <br/>
&gt; formally <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) <br/>
&gt; &gt;  coming <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; up in 2 weeks.  I will post the web links at the bottom of <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; note.  A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at these <br/>
&gt; &gt;  Events <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; and you could be a part of it.  Even though you might not feel <br/>
&gt; part <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; of our past, you can start including yourself in our future, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; I <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; encourage you to do so.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels <br/>
&gt; &gt;  excluded, <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; and that would be great.  However, if this isn't the case, I <br/>
&gt; hope I <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; have made you feel a little bit more welcome.  Either way, TX <br/>
&gt; &gt;  &gt; Letterboxers are special, no matter what anyone says!<br/>

&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Recently a new letterboxer on this List departed with the <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; explanation <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; that a lot of time was spent on "inside circle" talk among <br/>
old <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; friends, and they didn't feel included. It made me wonder <br/>
how <br/>
&gt;   &gt; many <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so <br/>
let <br/>
&gt;   me <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; give <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; First off, let me just say that the people on this List are <br/>
&gt;   some <br/>
&gt;   &gt; of <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; newcomers. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; When a new person posts, they almost always greet them <br/>
&gt;   warmly. <br/>
&gt;   &gt; I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me <br/>
just <br/>
&gt;   &gt; say <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"!<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Now it is true that many of us share a long history and <br/>
have <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; some "inside" jokes, but rather than feel excluded, I urge <br/>
you <br/>
&gt;   &gt; to <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; ask <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; for explanations when you don't understand something. I <br/>
&gt;   realize <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; many <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; people don't like to post comments for fear of being <br/>
ridiculed <br/>
&gt;   &gt; like <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us. The <br/>
only <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; reason <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy lurking.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; actually <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; meet some of the boxers on this List. So I would like to <br/>
&gt;   &gt; formally <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event <br/>
(TALE) <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; coming <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; up in 2 weeks. I will post the web links at the bottom of <br/>
&gt;   this <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; note. A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at <br/>
these <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; Events <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; and you could be a part of it. Even though you might not <br/>
feel <br/>
&gt;   &gt; part <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; of our past, you can start including yourself in our <br/>
future, <br/>
&gt;   and <br/>
&gt;   &gt; I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; encourage you to do so.<br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; excluded, <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; and that would be great. However, if this isn't the case, I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; hope I <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; have made you feel a little bit more welcome. Either way, <br/>
TX <br/>
&gt;   &gt; &gt; &gt; Letterboxers are special, no matter what anyone says!<br/>

&gt; Hmmm...I wonder if anyone considered her as a suspect in your <br/>
murder - from<br/>
&gt; what I've heard of your personality, your wife might have more <br/>
incentive for<br/>
&gt; creating your demise than anyone else!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Recently a new letterboxer on this List departed with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explanation<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that a lot of time was spent on "inside circle" talk among<br/>
&gt; &gt; old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friends, and they didn't feel included. It made me wonder<br/>
&gt; &gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other new boxers on this List might feel the same way, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; let<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; y'all my thoughts just in case.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; First off, let me just say that the people on this List <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best you will find anywhere, and are very friendly to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; newcomers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When a new person posts, they almost always greet them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; warmly.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been lax about doing that and I apologize, so let me<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; belatedly "welcome all new letterboxers"!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now it is true that many of us share a long history and<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some "inside" jokes, but rather than feel excluded, I urge<br/>
&gt; &gt; you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for explanations when you don't understand something. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; realize<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people don't like to post comments for fear of being<br/>
&gt; &gt; ridiculed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the Big List, but there is no reason to fear us. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not to post is if you just don't want to and enjoy <br/>
lurking.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another way to feel included is to attend a Gathering and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; meet some of the boxers on this List. So I would like to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; formally<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invite everyone to attend the TX Annual Letterbox Event<br/>
&gt; &gt; (TALE)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coming<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up in 2 weeks. I will post the web links at the bottom of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; note. A lot of the "inside" jokes and stories happen at<br/>
&gt; &gt; these<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Events<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and you could be a part of it. Even though you might not<br/>
&gt; &gt; feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of our past, you can start including yourself in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; future,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encourage you to do so.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's possible I have wasted these words since nobody feels<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excluded,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that would be great. However, if this isn't the case, <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hope I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have made you feel a little bit more welcome. Either way,<br/>
&gt; &gt; TX<br/>
