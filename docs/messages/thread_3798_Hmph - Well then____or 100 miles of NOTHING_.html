<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, windows rolled down, music blaring..nice ride down Highway 69...Oh, and this was kind of funny.  Did you know they actually have signs on the highway that point to the forest?  BootsTex, you have lots of forests down where you are, so you should keep your eyes open for them.  This one was a big green highway sign that says "Forest ==&gt;" somewhere just north of Wells and a good way south of Alto.  Yep.  I had not ever noticed the sign before, but then I usually don't look for the forest from Highway 69.  So we - being very good at following directions - hooked a quick right and went in search of the forest.  We knew we were getting close because we passed the Forest Civic Center, and then the Forest Baptist Church.  We did indeed finally come to the forest and kept noticing the huge root balls of overturned timber, almost like dominoes along the road.  Evidence of chain saw crews all along the way.  As we drew closer, a nagging thought kept passing through my mind, but I dismissed it - over and over again.  We finally got to Kennard, and then Ratcliff, and noticed bunches of Forestry Service trucks everywhere.  We came to the southern end of the 4C and stopped at the trailhead to take a look - and saw it - the sign that said "4C Trail Closed - As of Oct 2 - FM225"  We couldn't believe it.  Closed?  Maybe the trail was open a little further north.  Or maybe we could just camp at Ratcliff and hike around the lake in the morning.  We drove back to Ratcliff and found it was closed too!  So off we went in search of an open trailhead, but with no luck.  Mission Tejas? We could hike their behind the fence trail and their public trails.  Closed too - but while I already knew that (I had visited their website thinking about the gathering), Fearless Fox didn't and he had to find out for himself.  It was closed when he checked too.  So up the road we went - on and on.  Checking every 4C trailhead all the way up to Neches Bluff.  Closed.  Closed.  Closed.  And they were very diligent about marking it AND had put up fresh signs yesterday complete with the road each sign was on and the side of the road it belonged to!  Fearless Fox wanted to camp anyway just inside the trailhead at Neches Bluff and then get up in the morning and clear trail for them, but I suggested we might want to tell them we were doing that, instead of just assuming they would be cool with it.  Not to mention - we were hammocking and Neches Bluff is very steep and it didn't seem sensible to hang a hammock on trees that had recently been tested by high winds and growing on the sides of hills without at least being able to examine them in the light of day.  So off we went - frustrated and tired of being in the cars.  We thought about Fairchild State Forest but had no idea if it would be open, and She Who Volunteers Me For Everything was having a hard time with her internet connection so she was no help and we had hardly any cell phone signal anyway to call anyone else, so we finally dragged our tails off back to the house with a stop at Blockbuster for a lame-o sci-fi movie which Fearless Fox and Lightning are watching and I refuse to on principle if nothing else.    <br clear="all"/>
</div>
<div>Now THAT was frustrating - at this point we won't have another opportunity until gun season has started and we'll have the added challenge of dodging hunters.  I think I'm going to write my state legislators and suggest they move hunting season to the summertime when I don't like to hike.  Anybody with me?  Please?</div>

<div>Nice weather, signs of fall, a serendipitous free weekend, not quite 
  hunting season (okay, it's bow season) in the national forests...we 
  packed up our backpacks and headed ourselves out to do a short overnighter on 
  the 4C Trail near Mission Tejas as an outdoor season opening shakedown.  
  Six miles or so was all we would do, through Big Slough - reputed to be the 
  prettiest part of the trail - with an overnight on the trail and home by noon 
  tomorrow in time for Trail Whale to come visit.  We jumped in our two 
  rides so that we could leave one vehicle on the other end of the hike and 
  drove our merry way down toward Alto and then points west.  We plan to 
  complete the 4C twice before spring, which means probably 8 trips out there if 
  we do the trail in four pieces each time, so this time I was going

  69...Oh, and this was kind of funny.  Did you know they

  you have lots of forests down where you are, so you should keep your eyes open 
  for them.  This one was a big green highway sign that says "Forest 
  ==&gt;" somewhere just north of Wells and a good way south of Alto.  
  Yep.  I had not ever noticed the sign before, but then I usually 
  don't look for the forest from Highway 69.  So we - being very good at 
  following directions - hooked a quick right and went in search of the 
  forest.  We knew we were getting close because we passed the Forest Civic 
  Center, and then the Forest Baptist Church.  We did indeed finally come 
  to the forest and kept noticing the huge root balls of overturned timber, 
  almost like dominoes along the road.  Evidence of chain saw crews all 
  along the way.  As we drew closer, a nagging thought kept passing through 
  my mind, but I dismissed it - over and over again.  We finally got to 
  Kennard, and then Ratcliff, and noticed bunches of Forestry Service trucks 
  everywhere.  We came to the southern end of the 4C and stopped at the 
  trailhead to take a look - and saw it - the sign that said "4C Trail Closed - 
  As of Oct 2 - FM225"  We couldn't believe it.  Closed?  Maybe 
  the trail was open a little further north.  Or maybe we could just camp

We could hike their behind the fence trail and their public trails.  Closed too - but while I already knew that (I had visited their website thinking about the gathering), Fearless Fox didn't and he had to find out for himself.  It was closed when he checked too.  So up the road we went - on and on.  Checking every 4C trailhead all the way up to Neches Bluff.  Closed.  Closed.  Closed.  And they were very diligent about marking it AND had put up fresh signs yesterday complete with the road each sign was on and the side of the road it belonged to!  Fearless Fox wanted to camp anyway just inside the trailhead at Neches Bluff and then get up in the morning and clear trail for them, but I suggested we might want to tell them we were doing that, instead of just assuming they would be cool with it.  Not to mention - we were hammocking and Neches Bluff is very steep and it didn't seem sensible to hang a hammock on trees that had recently been tested by high winds and growing on the sides of hills without at least being able to examine them in the light of day.  So off we went - frustrated and tired of being in the cars.  We thought about Fairchild State Forest but had no idea if it would be open, and She Who Volunteers Me For Everything was having a hard time with her internet connection so she was no help and we had hardly any cell phone signal anyway to call anyone else, so we finally dragged our tails off back to the house with a stop at Blockbuster for a lame-o sci-fi movie which Fearless Fox and Lightning are watching and I refuse to on principle if nothing else.    <br clear="all"/>
</div>
<div>Now THAT was frustrating - at this point we won't have another opportunity until gun season has started and we'll have the added challenge of dodging hunters.  I think I'm going to write my state legislators and suggest they move hunting season to the summertime when I don't like to hike.  Anybody with me?  Please?</div>

<div>I do have to say, those "Forest" signs cracked me up. Only in Texas would they have to have signs to let people know where the forest was. Maybe they figure that people could not see the forest through the trees. Okay, I'm cracking myself up again. I've got to stop that.</div>

<div>Nice weather, signs of fall, a serendipitous free weekend, not quite hunting season (okay, it's bow season) in the national forests...we packed up our backpacks and headed ourselves out to do a short overnighter on the 4C Trail near Mission Tejas as an outdoor season opening shakedown.  Six miles or so was all we would do, through Big Slough - reputed to be the prettiest part of the trail - with an overnight on the trail and home by noon tomorrow in time for Trail Whale to come visit.  We jumped in our two rides so that we could leave one vehicle on the other end of the hike and drove our merry way down toward Alto and then points west.  We plan to complete the 4C twice before spring, which means probably 8 trips out there if we do the trail in four pieces each time, so this time I was going to scope out hiding spots and plant boxes on the next trip through, hopefully in time for the gathering!</div>

I haven't noticed those signs around here.  Maybe I just can't see the <br>
forest signs for the trees.  In my old hometown of Midland, we used to <br>
go to Cloudcroft or Ruidoso for a nice weekend trip to the mountains <br>
and forests.  It was either a 2 hour drive to the lake or a 4 hour <br>
drive to the mountains.  Back then, and maybe still, Midland had more <br>
boats per capita than any town in Texas. We used to go to a lake at <br>
Imperial (look it up) and water ski.  The water was so salty you could <br>
almost walk on it, so water skiing was pretty easy.<br>
