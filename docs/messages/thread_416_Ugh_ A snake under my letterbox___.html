This afternoon my granddaughter and I went to get a photo of 'Flat <br/>
Stanlie' and two Barbie dolls going letterboxing. Um...yeah, that's <br/>
another reason people think I'm weird...<br/>
<br/>
 Anyway, I went to my nearest, and easiest to deal with, letterbox <br/>
between Skidmore and Beeville. I told Shabree to pose the dolls near <br/>
the hiding place next to a bush and some curbing while I took the <br/>
piece of paver off of the top of the ground, and took the small <br/>
letterbox out from underneath. Down in the hole, partially hidden by <br/>
the rocks I lined the hole with was some kind of small snake. He <br/>
never moved the whole time. We moved our photo shoot over slightly <br/>
and I warned Shabree not to make many vibrations - like jumping or <br/>
kicking the curbing or anything. I quickly laid out the contents of <br/>
the box, arranged them nicely and got a couple of shots, with <br/>
Stanlie, Barbie and um...Barbie looking like they were perusing the <br/>
contents. Then I carefully moved Flat Stanlie over to peer down the <br/>
hole and got a photo of her looking at the snake. Hopefully the <br/>
snake will show up in the picture. After that, I placed the <br/>
letterbox back on/above the snake, replaced the broken paver and we <br/>
moved on.<br/>
<br/>
I have no idea what kind it was. It was all curled up and partially <br/>
hidden. It was about as big around as my finger, and maybe not quite <br/>
a foot long, if I had to guess. It was patterned and kind of <br/>
black,gray,brown dirt colored. I couldn't see it's tail at all to <br/>
look for rattles. I'm thinking - hoping - it is just a rat snake of <br/>
some kind. But whether anyone searches for that box or any other, be <br/>
sure to BE CAREFUL. <br/>
<br/>
I noticed someone new had signed that logbook, so checked my <br/>
hitchhiker hostel too....a double hole. I was really, really careful <br/>
and lightfingered getting those bigger boxes out of those bigger <br/>
hiding places and checking them. No snakes there though, thankfully.<br/>

I haven't seen many snakes. What I have seen is salamanders!  At first <br/>
only noticed them in woodsy areas - like trails and such. They were <br/>
EVERYWHERE this weekend in Memorial Park.  Today even saw one at the <br/>
house where they have never been.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone else noticing them?<br/>
