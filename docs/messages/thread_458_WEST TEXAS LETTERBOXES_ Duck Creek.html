None of the original Dallas boxes exist anymore and I can't<br>
contact the ladies that placed them.  I guess they got tired<br>
of waiting for others to join the fun and quit.  If you<br>
were able to find the boxes before they went missing, I would<br>
love to see the stamp images.  Maybe if you come to the<br>
Event you can bring them.<br>

I found that one in March '01 and even then the clues were a little<br>
off and the box itself was well concealed. Benches mentioned in the<br>
clue had been removed and we had to navigate based on where we thought<br>
they might have been. the 'path to the right' wasn't much more than a<br>
slightly eroded drainage. When I found the box it was barely visible.<br>
The low area is flood prone and the white rocks were barely visible<br>
above the surface of the mud. the box was full of water, but the log<br>
book was mostly dry. I rehid it as well as I found it, which might<br>
have been too well. Another heavy flood since then may have buried it<br>
completely. Or washed it away. I remember that one pretty well. I'd<br>
hidden a few before then, but that was my first find.<br>
I'd love to make it to an event sometime, but don't think I'll be back<br>
in the Austin area for awhile. Too bad. I'd really like to find all<br>
the new boxes there!<br>
