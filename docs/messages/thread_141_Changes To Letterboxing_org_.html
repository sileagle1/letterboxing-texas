to revamp the letterboxing.org site and I was thinking<br/>
now might be a good time to ask for things we want changed.<br/>
One thing I would recommend is changing the regions of<br/>
TX so they make more sense.  Currently the Coastal Region<br/>
covers an area from Brownsville to Orange, which makes it<br/>
hard for somebody coming to Houston to narrow their search<br/>
for local boxes.  Also, the North region extends too far<br/>
south.  I would like to see the following 6 Regions:<br/>
Panhandle, Northeast, Southeast, South, Central &amp; West.<br/>
Let me know what you think and if we get a consensus I<br/>
will map out the counties I think should go into each of<br/>
my regions and send it to the webmasters.<br/>
Also, I encourage each of you to give any input you have<br/>
for improvements to the webmasters.  I have already told them<br/>
I would like to see several things fixed before adding new<br/>
things (e.g. Louisiana &amp; International boxes not showing up).<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You know, you really have a good point about the<br/>
regions.  I was pinpointing boxes on a state map this<br/>
past weekend and was really confused by the regions. <br/>
It never occurred to me to pipe in about that problem.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I do think that it should be us on this list<br/>
discussing and agreeing on regions and presenting in<br/>
one voice to the webmasters.  There is no way they can<br/>
understand about the peculiar challenges we have in<br/>
defining regions in Texas.  We have a much better idea<br/>
what the logical divisions would be.<br/>
<br/>
I agree with you about East Texas.  It shouldn't be<br/>
long - it should be squarish and should extend almost<br/>
to Dallas and South to Angelina County (Lufkin). I'm<br/>
squarely in the middle of what is typically thought of<br/>
as East Texas, and yet I have to flip between two<br/>
regions to get local boxes. Houston's area should<br/>
extend up to Angelina County and West to not far<br/>
beyond Houston.  Austin's area should include San<br/>
Antonio - that's probably the most awkwardly divided<br/>
region, at least in my opinion.   Possibly it should<br/>
include Bryan and Waco?  It really kind of looks like<br/>
we should have one additional region.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that non-Texas folks struggle with the idea<br/>
that one of our regions is as big as most of their<br/>
whole states!<br/>
<br/>
As to other improvements, I would just "somehow" like<br/>
to be able to highlight certain boxes and flip through<br/>
them without having to go back to the region page and<br/>
click.<br/>
<br/>
My first thoughts...I'm sure y'all will have lots more<br/>
that will make me think even more!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for getting the ball rolling, Silver Eagle!<br/>

<br/>
Why regions?  Why not be able to search by county or even a group of counties?  Why not have the system show you which <br/>
counties have boxes, not which regions?  Since, IMNSHO, regions are inaccurate as not every county in that region may <br/>
have boxes in it.<br/>
<br/>
(IMNSHO = In My Not So Humble Opinion)<br/>
