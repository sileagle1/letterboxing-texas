                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well we've had a wonderful visit with the TTB2 at our house. We had so much fun looking at the stamps and reading the log book, it is really an awesome box. They turned out to be pleasant guests at Easter, helped bake cakes for 2 birthday parties and also helped out with cleaning trash up in the neighborhood for Earth Day. I also had them do some gardening in my yard to keep them busy. But after almost 3 weeks, it was time to kick them out and send them on their way. Since we had such a nice visit I decided to carve a caricature of the bus in rubber. <br/>
<br/>
After saying goodbye, they piled into their bus and started putt-putting up the North Central Expressway. I quietly tailed them to the Dayspring Nature Preserve in Allen, TX (622 Rainforest Ln) where they started driving on the sidewalk on the left of the playground, swerving around children and scaring moms. I ran after them, heading right at the split and went 50 steps to a point where there are two trees opposite one another on each side of the path and turned to the right to see them setting up camp on the left side of a tree with 3 trunks. I decided to park my memorial letterbox right under them and asked them to leave it be for future letterboxers to find.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure they are looking for a new family to host them for May Day and Cinco de Mayo so if you are looking for some house guests, have fun searching for that bunch of free loaders. <br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; and send them on their way. Since we had such a nice visit I decided to<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; carve a caricature of the bus in rubber.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; After saying goodbye, they piled into their bus and started putt-putting<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; up the North Central Expressway. I quietly tailed them to the Dayspring<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature Preserve in Allen, TX (622 Rainforest Ln) where they started driving<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; on the sidewalk on the left of the playground, swerving around children and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; scaring moms. I ran after them, heading right at the split and went 50 steps<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to a point where there are two trees opposite one another on each side of<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the path and turned to the right to see them setting up camp on the left<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; side of a tree with 3 trunks. I decided to park my memorial letterbox right<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; under them and asked them to leave it be for future letterboxers to find.<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; I'm sure they are looking for a new family to host them for May Day and<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Cinco de Mayo so if you are looking for some house guests, have fun<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; searching for that bunch of free loaders.<br/>

&gt; I am very pleased to report that I will be keeping my head (and therefore
my<br/>

&gt; buyer's remorse as I stretch out my fatigued muscles and rub my ringing<br/>
&gt; ears. The rest of you must be much more athletic than I had realized;<br/>
&gt; dragging that darned bus out of the woods, hitching it to my minivan,
towing<br/>
&gt; the sucker all the way back home, and then unhitching everything again...<br/>
&gt; oy! On top of all that, I must say that this bus is fast approaching
unsafe<br/>
&gt; occupancy levels (I mean really... everyone on *top* of each other like<br/>
&gt; that?!) and should probably be reported to the authorities. That is, if
the<br/>
&gt; authorities were able to hear me above all of the shouting, laughing,<br/>
&gt; carousing, and generalized shenanigans going on in there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm pretty sure these "guests" of mine will be sleeping out in
the chicken<br/>
&gt; coop tonight. Maybe the chickens will teach them some manners!<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; Well we've had a wonderful visit with the TTB2 at our house. We
had so<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; much fun looking at the stamps and reading the log book, it is
really an<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; awesome box. They turned out to be pleasant guests at Easter,
helped bake<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; cakes for 2 birthday parties and also helped out with cleaning
trash up in<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; the neighborhood for Earth Day. I also had them do some gardening
in my yard<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; to keep them busy. But after almost 3 weeks, it was time to kick
them out<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; and send them on their way. Since we had such a nice visit I
