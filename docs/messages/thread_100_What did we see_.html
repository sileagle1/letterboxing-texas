Where I live in Sugar Land near the Brazos River we currently<br>

I know they are around.  The few I have seen appear more<br>

tusks and smelled bad, they were probably javelinas.<br>
Either way, I bet it was fun to see them, and you now<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We live in Cherokee County, and we have quite a few of<br>
what I assume to be javelinas here too.  It's a big<br>
thing to go hawg huntin' (not hog hunting) around<br>
here!<br>
My husband was on a bent to kill one a couple of years<br>
ago, and learned that they are apparently somewhat<br>
shy, but agressive when confronted.  He never actually<br>
killed one, or even saw one while hunting, although<br>
the guys that took him out hunting swore by their<br>
large population (my husband has the same effect on<br>
fish - they could bite all day, but the minute he<br>
throws a hook in the water, the fish are nowhere to be<br>
found).  I've been shown evidence of their rooting<br>
several times and have seen them dead in the back of<br>
pickups, but have only caught fleeting glimpses of<br>
them.  I know we would've loved to see what you saw!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We live in South Texas and my DH is a hawg hunter.  I go out with <br>
him and I enjoy going with him, but don't like to watch the kill.  <br>
But, skin it, clean it, and I'll eat it, the ribs are to die for <br>
when bbq'd!!!  Just a young one, tho.  Less than 100 lbs.  Wild <br>
ferral hogs can come in any color...just like domesticated hogs. We <br>
hunt in the fields here with the farmer's blessings.  A band of hogs <br>
can ruin by rooting a field of milo, corn, onions, spinach, <br>
watermelons literally over night!!!  Hogs can be very agressive.  I <br>
have seen men in the ER that tangled with a hog when hunting. Wanna <br>
see the pic of one hanging on my wall? DH won a contest with this <br>
boar with the length of the tusks and it's weight. Email me <br>
privately.<br>
<br>
Javelina's are a rodent of sorts.  Their babies are cute...yellow <br>
striped.  But don't get near them!!!  Mama will eat your lunch!  <br>
<br>
Wanna see javelinas and deer and turkeys?  Go to Choke Canyon State <br>
Park Calliham Unit. http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/choke/ <br>
And while there check out the Lb's there and in Three Rivers.  <br>
Dancing Ducks and Southern Magnolia.  I think I read that Ali's Lb <br>
is missing.<br>
<br>
Check out this website for some info on hogs. Has pics. You can also <br>
do a search and check out some of the hawg hunting sites.  But <br>
beware some of these can be pretty graphic.<br>
