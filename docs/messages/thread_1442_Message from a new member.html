                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi - I just joined Letterboxing in Texas today.  My daughter lives in<br>
the Dallas area and I hope to visit there and hunt for letterboxes in<br>
Texas sometime with her.  I have been an avid letterboxer since 2000 -<br>
see my boxes online under 2bentriders on LBNA.  <br>
<br>
Currently I am working on a doctoral degree at Ball State University<br>
in Indiana and would like your help on my research.  You are invited<br>
to participate in a web-based survey looking at the profiles and<br>
behaviors of individuals who participate in letterboxing. This<br>
research is being conducted as part of a doctoral dissertation about<br>
the activity of letterboxing. Any visitor 18 years of age and older<br>
may complete the survey, and all responses are anonymous. To<br>
voluntarily participate, go to<br>
http://portal.bsu.edu/inqsit/inqsit.cgi/fink and select<br>
`letterboxing'and 'continue'. Use your trail name or a pseudonym to<br>
sign in. For more information about this research project, please<br>
contact the Primary Investigator - Marisa Fink, Ball State University,<br>
AC 414, 2000 W. University Avenue, Muncie, IN 47306, 765.285.1962,<br>
marisafink@bsu.edu. Thank you for your participation. (Note: If you<br>
participated in the pilot study for this research in February 2005,<br>
you may also participate in this study).<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
