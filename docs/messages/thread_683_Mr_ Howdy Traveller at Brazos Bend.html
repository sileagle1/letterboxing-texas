Our "Traveller" Mr. Howdy will be accompanying us to the Brazos Bend <br>
event.  We hope all of you will stop by and say hello to him.  You'll <br>
have to find him first.<br>
<br>
He will be guarding our campsite.<br>
Though some may think he's a grizzly ol' sheriff, he's really quite <br>
friendly.<br>
You'll recognize him by his outfit.<br>
Orange shirt<br>
Blue jeans<br>
Plaid bandana<br>
Incedentally, he's blonde<br>
His stamp and pad are in his backpack<br>
<br>
Drop in and say hello.  If we aren't at the camp, feel free to stamp <br>
your book and don't forget to stamp Mr. Howdy's.<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
