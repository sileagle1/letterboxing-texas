                    <html><body><div>Thanks Boots, it was a lot of work but totally worth it! We had letterboxers from 29 states attend and I think all of them had a great time. It was also nice to be able to show off our state and its talented boxers, like Boots Tex, who carved the Event stamp. I uploaded an image of it to the Live &amp; Breathe XX photo album. Many other great stamps were carved by Open Space, Mosaic Butterfly, Wry Me, PI Joe &amp; Baby Bear, plus other people in and outside of Texas, but you will have to go find the boxes to see what they look like. We were able to leave most of them in the park, so you should have plenty to do this winter.</div><div><br/></div><div>Silver Eagle<br/> </div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>There's one thing about the event that I regret and I think I should mention it.  The Saturday night music and band, in my opinion, wasn't promoted enough, maybe not at all.  When the program started, I got the impression that the music was all recorded and the program was all about the dance lessons.  I didn't realize that there would be a live band.  I still haven't seen anything about the band or the musicians mentioned.  I was talking to Bell Motel Sunday morning and she told me that the band was made up of some of the best musicians in Austin, which is saying a lot.  Lone Star Quilter and I didn't feel like dancing (I'm getting too old), so we didn't stay.  If I had known more about the band, I would have stayed for the music.  Bell Motel told me the name of the band, but I couldn't remember it when I got home, but I thought it was something like Texas Swingers or Lone Star Swingers or something like that, so I googled "Austin band Texas Swingers" and the word "swingers", much to my surprise, took me to a side of Austin of which I was not aware!  I never did find the band I was looking for, but I'd like to know more about them.  I would have liked to make a poster for them.</p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>

                    <html><body><div>I agree and it was a shame more people didn't come to hear them play. Even those that did were mostly just stamping away instead of trying to dance or listen to the band. I went up to the band after they took a break to apologize for low turnout and assure them it wasn't because we didn't appreciate their talent. I had fun and even though I don't dance much I tried to dance with several ladies since there were so few men out there, but most had already left. Tell LSQ she owes me a dance.</div><div><br/></div><div>Silver Eagle<br/></div></body></html>
