                    <div class="plaintext-content">I should first introduce myself...I am Ruth ("Mother of four").  I am <br>
a Texan by choice.  I moved to Houston twelve years ago from Michigan <br>
to get some Teaching experience.  I was planning on staying a year or <br>
two, but I fell in love with an Aggie, got married, and the rest is <br>
history.  Now I can't imagine living anywhere else in the world.  I <br>
am the mother of four little Texans ranging in age from 7 to 1.  We <br>
started letterboxing back in November after reading an article about <br>
it in Family Fun Magazine.  We found our first boxes in Brazos Bend, <br>
and have been enthusiasts of the hobby ever since.<br>
<br>
We spent this beautiful day hiking in Sam Houston looking for the <br>
Lone Star Hiker box (which we found, safe and sound)and the Blue <br>
Norther box (which eluded us).  This brings me to my plea.  We <br>
counted and recounted steps...I'm sure we had the right stump.  I <br>
know Birds of a Feather found this box just a couple of days ago <br>
(actually, oddly enough, we were planning on looking for these boxes <br>
the same day you all found them, but the rain kept us away.) I was <br>
wondering if there is any help out there for us.  The clues say that <br>
the box is hidden under some "back scraps" on the left side of the <br>
stump.  We really searched, but found nothing.  The Lone Star Hiker <br>
box was really buried in the top of the stump...we had to dig it out <br>
with a stick.  The stumps there are really decaying and crumbly.  I <br>
wonder if Baby Bear's box is also buried rather than just covered.  <br>
We would love to go back and search for this box again if anyone has <br>
any help to offer.  Thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for giving <br>
us a lovely day in the woods (and puddles and streams!)<br>
