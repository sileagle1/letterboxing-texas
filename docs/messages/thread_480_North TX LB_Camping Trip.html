Earlier this week, Baby Bear and I realized we had 2 1/2<br/>
days of available time away from our non-letterboxing families,<br/>
so we decided to go on a power letterboxing trip to North Texas <br/>
and do a little camping.  I don't necessarily recommend doing<br/>
it this way, but if you don't have much time and want to<br/>
cover a lot of territory, a trip like this is the only option.<br/>
We left before dawn on Thursday and headed up toward Waco area,<br/>
boxing in the dark on the way.  We had a momentary setback<br/>
when we got to Mother Neff SP only to find it flooded &amp; closed,<br/>
but we kept heading north, boxing at several parks on the way<br/>
to Fort Worth.  We just made it to the Fort Worth Nature Center &amp; <br/>
Wildlife Refuge before it closed, so were able to place new boxes<br/>
in a great park.  We then did some after-dark boxing in the<br/>
downtown area, which made it easy to park and be discreet, but<br/>
a little difficult to find landmarks.  After a full day, we<br/>
headed for Cedar Hill SP on the outskirts of Dallas to camp<br/>
and get ready for the next full day in Dallas.  We got up before<br/>
dawn to find ice on our tent, so we hid two boxes in the park to<br/>
warm up before leaving to find as many boxes in Dallas area that <br/>
we could.  We managed to find most of the boxes (except the two <br/>
in downtown), though the last few were in the dark again, before<br/>
heading south to camp at Fairfield Lake SP.  We barely made it<br/>
before they closed the gate at 10:00 and I was beat.  After <br/>
setting up the tent I went straight to bed, but Baby Bear had<br/>
realized he did not have a box to place in that park so he stayed<br/>
up carving a stamp to place the next morning.  When I woke up<br/>
(again before dawn), I found a masterpiece stamp of our trip<br/>
waiting my inspection.  What a trooper!  After finding<br/>
Barefoot Lucy's box and placing our own it was time to head for<br/>
home, boxing the Huntsville/Montgomery/Magnolia area on the way.<br/>
The final tally was over 50 finds, 4 new placed for me and 6 new<br/>
placed for Baby Bear, and we both replaced several of our old<br/>
boxes that had gone missing.  We enjoyed all the boxes and though<br/>
we did not get to spend much time in the places they were located,<br/>
we enjoyed them, too.  If nothing else, we now have places we<br/>
want to go back to and spend more time with our families.  Thanks<br/>
to all who placed boxes for giving us the incentive to do this <br/>
trip.  We were a little leary of hunters in the parks and being<br/>
mistaken for prowlers at night, but it worked out great!<br/>
