                    <html><body><div>I would love to have any you are willing to part with!  I started carving last night, just any boy type thing I could think of.  Duplication won't be a problem since they will all be different duplicates.  Attendance will probably be around 140 (plus their dads, who won't have their own stamps), so I have a LONG way to go!  I'm going to show some friends of mine how to carve I think, and get them going on it too.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The more I'm thinking about this, the more I realize what this event is going to amount to - it's like a big gathering with a bunch of folks who don't know anything about letterboxing!  With attendance of about 140 boys, I will plant about 15 boxes, then I have to sort out and copy the clues.  My thought is to give each boy three clues, so that they all aren't trampling each other in each session.  If they finish their three, they can get more.  And that all means after the event I have to pick up 15 boxes too!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If anybody just thought it would be cool to come out and hang out with a bunch of boys and help with this event, that would be awesome too, or even just the hiding of during the week prior (hint, hint!).<br/><br/> </div>

<p>I like that idea, but I'm just not sure timewise - we will have about 30 boys in each one hour craft session, ranging in ages from 6-11.  The one hour will be for the craft portion.  They'll definitely need to make a logbook because the logbook will also serve a couple of other purposes during the day.  From the craft session, they'll be getting a rundown on LB'ing, then moving on to LNT, and then to Map and Compass.  Letterboxing is sort of the vehicle for learning these outdoor skills, as opposed to being the activity itself.  <br/><br/>
