I have only found one box that wasn't a micro box and in my opinion it <br/>
was a mini.  :-)  What size is generally used.   I know everyone does <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Box sizes do vary greatly.  It depends on the area where you are going <br/>
to be planting the box.  For urban areas, you see a lot of micros or <br/>
minis, because the surrounding areas usually do not offer that great <br/>
of cover.  I like, when possible, to plant a slightly bigger box, and <br/>
have, even in urban areas, because they will carry a hitchhiker and <br/>
offer more room for stamping bigger signature stamps.  <br/>
<br/>
However, our first box was only hidden 7 months ago, so I don't have a <br/>
good sample on if the bigger ones go missing more frequently (we have <br/>
only lost one box in that time--a normal sized one, but one we chose a <br/>
spectacularly bad hiding place for).  Someone who has been hiding <br/>
boxes longer might have a better feel for if there is a true <br/>
correlation between box size and missing boxes.<br/>
<br/>
I think for boxes you plant on vacation or far from home, the most <br/>
important thing to do is to plant it in a very sturdy, waterproof box <br/>
that's easy to seal, with more pages in the log book than you think <br/>
you'll need.  That is not the time for the cheapest box.  We have only <br/>
included a stamp pad one time, because we thought the stamp needed to <br/>
be a particular color.  From what I read on other boards, stamp pads <br/>
often cause more trouble than they're worth, and most finders bring <br/>
markers or their own inkpads.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps,<br/>

I plant in a sandwich sized box myself, although I'm<br/>
having an internal debate about needing to go smaller<br/>
to minimize the impact on the natural environment. <br/>
The box I use is about as large as anything I've<br/>
found.  I wouldn't go with anything taller than a<br/>
sandwich sized box because the higher the profile of<br/>
the box the harder it is to hide.  One thing I've<br/>
found that seems to have worked very well is a small<br/>
nalgene bottle.  It's a little awkward to squeeze the<br/>
stamp and log into, but it's really just a matter of<br/>
rolling them like you would a film canister box. <br/>
Also, the top tightens down really well so it seems to<br/>
be impervious to leakage.<br/>
<br/>
I used to put ink pads, but I had one that looked like<br/>
it had exploded in the box.  Fortunately, I had<br/>
everything bagged so nothing was destroyed.  After<br/>
that experience, and after listening to everyone else<br/>
and realizing that most boxers carry either stamp pads<br/>
or markers with them, I decided I could forego the<br/>
stamp pad - the nice thing is, it also cuts the cost<br/>
of placing a box!<br/>

<div>Granted, I am relatively new to this letterboxing thing, but all the boxes we have found have been in sandwich sized ziploc plastic tupperware like containers.  I like it when the planters put their log book in a ziploc baggie and their stamp in a separate baggie.  Makes it cleaner and keeps them dry.  I don't find many boxes with a stamp pad included, I usually bring my own.  Hadn't thought about a marker so that's a great idea as well.  I would think a stamp pad would dry out?</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my opinion, stamp pads in boxes are truly, truly<br/>
more trouble than they are worth!  You're right they<br/>
DO dry out, as well as puke all over the place as was<br/>
my experience.  If you opt not to leave a stamp pad,<br/>
but you do want to have your stamp stamped in certain<br/>
colors, include the suggested colors in your clues. <br/>
Silver Eagle's Sam I Am has just that and I was glad<br/>
to know in advance what colors to bring.  Otherwise,<br/>
someone is going to come along who only has a black<br/>
stamp pad and they're going to really muddy up the<br/>
stamp for everyone who follows!<br/>
<br/>
As far as bagging, it doesn't take long to figure out<br/>
that double bagging is a really good idea!  I try not<br/>
to use just regular baggies anymore, although I did<br/>
for awhile - I prefer freezer baggies now.  Some folks<br/>
bag their boxes inside and out, but in my opinion,<br/>
putting a box in a baggie makes it more susceptible to<br/>
discovery because the outer baggie will fold and bend<br/>
and the edges catch light if it happens not be<br/>
completely covered.  Also, the outer baggie is bound<br/>
to keep some air and it makes the box slightly larger<br/>
than it needs to be.  I can see why some boxers do it<br/>
though - it's an added layer of protection from the<br/>
elements.<br/>

I would say "Take them with you...", but then I<br/>
envision a stealthy boxer with a squad of high energy<br/>
cheerleaders with megaphones traipsing along behind...<br/>

Hmmm...maybe not!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is true that many urban boxes are microboxes, using film canisters, however, I have <br/>
found a delightful range of containers on the hunt. There is no standard - you make <br/>
the rules - that is what makes it fun. I assure you that we will enjoy any box you <br/>
place. Think about what you want. Will you return to check on your box, perhaps to <br/>
enjoy the variety of stamps and comments, or is this a one time visit to the area? If <br/>
you are going to "maintain" the box by revisiting, perhaps a bigger box would be <br/>
more satisfying. Of course this means that more thought should surround its <br/>
placement. The main thing is to follow your bliss - whether the number is many or <br/>
few, we welcome you.<br/>

<div>The size and kind of box really depends on where and how you want to hide it. You have to have a general idea of where you want to put them. Smaller is usually better. </div>
