                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello... newbie here!  I'm a teacher and I really needed something for the family to do that was inexpensive, relatively close to home, and would get us out of the house.  I knew about geocaching, but wasn't ready to plop down money for a handheld GPS system.  While I was researching geocaching I stumbled upon Letterboxing.  Being a history nut I fell head over heals in love with the idea of Letterboxing.  So, this week the family and I started letterboxing.   After a quick trip to Joanns Fabric and Craft we ended up with a cute stamp and ink for less than $1.50.  What hobby can you start for $1.50?  Come on, you can't beat that!  <br/>
<br/>
We are having a great time scurrying around Houston.  We have found parks we never even knew existed!   The family is working on being discreet and subtle when we find a Letterbox, so we do apologize in advance for our squeals of laughter and delight.  <br/>
<br/>
On a final note, we appreciate the time, thought, and skill it took to create the stamps and place the boxes.  We are also grateful for those that have replied to our emails or guestbook logs after we have reported our finds.<br/>

See you on the trail<br/>
