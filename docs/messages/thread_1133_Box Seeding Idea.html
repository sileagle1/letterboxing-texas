                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've just had a thought - and it gets even more dangerous - I want to throw<br>
it out for comments!<br>
<br>
Last March we collected the most wonderful, creative and clever stamps from<br>
about 20 Texas letterboxers (including honorary Texans from LA!) and put<br>
together a crazy Wild West CLUE game to play at the Brazos gathering.<br>
For those of you who missed the event, SilverEagle has posted a photo of the<br>
clue stamps display in the group photo album under the caption TLRE.<br>
<br>
After the gathering I had thought we would offer to share the collection<br>
with other gatherings around the country - we had one group in California<br>
very interested in borrowing them for their Goldrush event, but sadly the<br>
organizer had a death in the family and plans fell through. I've offered the<br>
collection of 35 stamps to a couple other groups for their gatherings, but<br>
the "Wild West" theme seems to throw them! ( Go figure!!!)<br>
<br>
Sooo...on the heels of Barefoot Lucy's "barn raising" idea, I want to<br>
suggest that we send these delightful stamps back out into the state,<br>
specifically to "seed" barren areas. For example, Catpawz had mentioned that<br>
she travels to Lubbock once a month or so - perhaps she'd be willing to take<br>
3 or 4 boxes to plant? <br>
<br>
We would bring 4 or 5 boxes to Waxahachie to plant, of course!<br>
<br>
I still owe two out-of-state boxers, Wanda (of Wanda&Pete) and Scarab (who<br>
inspired the whole CLUE game and suggested most of the titles) a booklet of<br>
the WildWestClues - somehow as soon as I remember that I need to do that, I<br>
forget again....obvious senility! I'm copying them both on this note to<br>
pressure myself into DOING it!<br>
<br>
Any comments, thoughts or suggestions?<br>
<br>
