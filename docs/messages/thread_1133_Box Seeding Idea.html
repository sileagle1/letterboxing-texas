                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've just had a thought - and it gets even more dangerous - I want to throw<br/>
it out for comments!<br/>
<br/>
Last March we collected the most wonderful, creative and clever stamps from<br/>
about 20 Texas letterboxers (including honorary Texans from LA!) and put<br/>
together a crazy Wild West CLUE game to play at the Brazos gathering.<br/>
For those of you who missed the event, SilverEagle has posted a photo of the<br/>
clue stamps display in the group photo album under the caption TLRE.<br/>
<br/>
After the gathering I had thought we would offer to share the collection<br/>
with other gatherings around the country - we had one group in California<br/>
very interested in borrowing them for their Goldrush event, but sadly the<br/>
organizer had a death in the family and plans fell through. I've offered the<br/>
collection of 35 stamps to a couple other groups for their gatherings, but<br/>
the "Wild West" theme seems to throw them! ( Go figure!!!)<br/>
<br/>
Sooo...on the heels of Barefoot Lucy's "barn raising" idea, I want to<br/>
suggest that we send these delightful stamps back out into the state,<br/>
specifically to "seed" barren areas. For example, Catpawz had mentioned that<br/>
she travels to Lubbock once a month or so - perhaps she'd be willing to take<br/>
3 or 4 boxes to plant? <br/>
<br/>
We would bring 4 or 5 boxes to Waxahachie to plant, of course!<br/>
<br/>
I still owe two out-of-state boxers, Wanda (of Wanda&amp;Pete) and Scarab (who<br/>
inspired the whole CLUE game and suggested most of the titles) a booklet of<br/>
the WildWestClues - somehow as soon as I remember that I need to do that, I<br/>
forget again....obvious senility! I'm copying them both on this note to<br/>
pressure myself into DOING it!<br/>
<br/>
Any comments, thoughts or suggestions?<br/>
<br/>

&gt; that it can be  <br/>
&gt; sort of a challenge to get all the stamps in the<br/>
&gt; series from around  <br/>
&gt; the state. . .<br/>

&gt; &gt; I've just had a thought - and it gets even more<br/>
&gt; dangerous - I want  <br/>
&gt; &gt; to throw<br/>
&gt; &gt; it out for comments!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Last March we collected the most wonderful,<br/>
&gt; creative and clever  <br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps from<br/>
&gt; &gt; about 20 Texas letterboxers (including honorary<br/>
&gt; Texans from LA!)  <br/>
&gt; &gt; and put<br/>
&gt; &gt; together a crazy Wild West CLUE game to play at<br/>
&gt; the Brazos gathering.<br/>
&gt; &gt; For those of you who missed the event, SilverEagle<br/>
&gt; has posted a  <br/>
&gt; &gt; photo of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; clue stamps display in the group photo album under<br/>
&gt; the caption TLRE.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After the gathering I had thought we would offer<br/>
&gt; to share the  <br/>
&gt; &gt; collection<br/>
&gt; &gt; with other gatherings around the country - we had<br/>
&gt; one group in  <br/>
&gt; &gt; California<br/>
&gt; &gt; very interested in borrowing them for their<br/>
&gt; Goldrush event, but  <br/>
&gt; &gt; sadly the<br/>
&gt; &gt; organizer had a death in the family and plans fell<br/>
&gt; through. I've  <br/>
&gt; &gt; offered the<br/>
&gt; &gt; collection of 35 stamps to a couple other groups<br/>
&gt; for their  <br/>
&gt; &gt; gatherings, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; the "Wild West" theme seems to throw them! ( Go<br/>
&gt; figure!!!)<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sooo...on the heels of Barefoot Lucy's "barn<br/>
&gt; raising" idea, I want to<br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest that we send these delightful stamps back<br/>
&gt; out into the state,<br/>
&gt; &gt; specifically to "seed" barren areas. For example,<br/>
&gt; Catpawz had  <br/>
&gt; &gt; mentioned that<br/>
&gt; &gt; she travels to Lubbock once a month or so -<br/>
&gt; perhaps she'd be  <br/>
&gt; &gt; willing to take<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3 or 4 boxes to plant?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; We would bring 4 or 5 boxes to Waxahachie to<br/>
&gt; plant, of course!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I still owe two out-of-state boxers, Wanda (of<br/>
&gt; Wanda&amp;Pete) and  <br/>
&gt; &gt; Scarab (who<br/>
&gt; &gt; inspired the whole CLUE game and suggested most of<br/>
&gt; the titles) a  <br/>
&gt; &gt; booklet of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the WildWestClues - somehow as soon as I remember<br/>
&gt; that I need to do  <br/>
&gt; &gt; that, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; forget again....obvious senility! I'm copying them<br/>
&gt; both on this  <br/>
&gt; &gt; note to<br/>
&gt; &gt; pressure myself into DOING it!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Any comments, thoughts or suggestions?<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks!<br/>
