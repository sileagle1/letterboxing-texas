We are having an absolute BLAST here.  The weather has been perfect, and<br>

different too.   With the end of the cold ear and the falling of the wall,<br>

I had forgotten how beautiful the forests here are.  We took a short hike<br>

letterboxing so far - but we did bring it along.<br>

Hope you all are well.<br>
