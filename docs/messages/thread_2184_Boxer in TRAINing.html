<br/>
I was just cleaning up Dad's mailbox (trying to teach Mom how to use<br/>
the computer!) and I came across a few unread digests from this group.<br/>
 He loved this group, and was always saying "Did you read that post,<br/>
oh, wait that might have been on the TX list...".  Or else he would<br/>
tell me about messages he received from one of you - particularly<br/>
Barefoot Lucy.  He was always talking about you (do you detect a bit<br/>
of jealously in my words??   (-:  just kidding!).<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I just wanted to say hi - thank you all for your thoughts,<br/>
both spoken and unspoken. I posted a few pics here for you to put a<br/>
face behind the name.  Some you may have seen on AQ, but a few are<br/>
scanned out of this album of TX letterboxing.  I hope I didn't post<br/>
any spoilers!  I didn't say where they were taken.<br/>

&gt; Fungus Woman is a long-distance friend of mine and TeamKing.  Her dad<br/>
&gt; was a great, enthusiastic boxer.  He also loved postal boxes, and was<br/>
&gt; eager to see the variety of stamps featured in them.  Every now and<br/>
&gt; again, you would see his stamp in your PLB log, but usually he just<br/>
&gt; silently played the game.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He was a member of this list, and although he never posted, he avidly<br/>
&gt; read every message.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you came to the Texas gathering, he had sent a bingo stamp carved<br/>
&gt; for the Event.  It was the line drawing of a steam engine.  I sent it<br/>
&gt; back to him, with the log, and he was thrilled to see everyone who<br/>
&gt; stamped in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Although I never met him, he sounds like a great guy.  I know he has a<br/>
&gt; terrific daughter, and that's a legacy in and of itself.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>We are so glad you stopped by here!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After Dewberry described which stamp had been provided by your dad, I found it in my logbook and marked it.  I still am amazed by the number of boxers, him included, who wanted to participate in our gathering and so sent marvelous stamps for us to enjoy.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wish I had had an opportunity to meet your dad.  He boxed within an hour's drive of me, and in fact, found some boxes in Nacogdoches where my mother lives.  It would've been cool to exchange with him!  Still though, what a unique legacy we letterboxers can leave as we make our marks as we go through an area.  It sure made me more mindful of taking the time to leave notes in logbooks!
<br/><br/>Thanks for giving us the opportunity to "meet him" in person.  </div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

about joining the TexasLb group in honor of Boxer!  And happy to add <br/>
that we are part of his Texas family that brought him south on those <br/>
great Texas Lb adventures -- rain, sleet, snow, ... or hurricanes!  <br/>
Thanks to all for the kind words as our beloved Boxer headed to <br/>
travels on the fast tracks of higher adventures.  Godspeed ...... Zepe<br/>
