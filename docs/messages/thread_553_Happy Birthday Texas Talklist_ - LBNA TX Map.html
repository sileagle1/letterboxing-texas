No, the current LBNA TX Map is still the old one.  I submitted<br>
the map we all agreed on almost 1 year ago, but despite my<br>
nagging Wes has still not made the change on the main site.<br>
I finally gave up bugging him because I was afraid he would<br>
get mad and never do it.  Not sure what we can do.<br>
For myself, I printed out the map I created (found in the<br>
Files section as txregions.jpg) and store all Tx clues in<br>
a notebook according to its regions, not the ones on LBNA.<br>
I try to keep up with clues via What's New so I don't have<br>
to look in the LBNA Regions at all.<br>
