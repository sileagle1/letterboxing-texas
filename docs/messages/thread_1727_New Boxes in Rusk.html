because of our business, but we are planning to get up there in the <br/>
next few days to place a couple of letterboxes in honor of the event.  <br/>
Watch for clues to "The General Sherman" and "Underground Railroad", <br/>
which should be posted by next Monday.  I hope we can find a place to <br/>
hide them without stumbling over someone else's box.  That park will <br/>
no doubt have boxes hidden everywhere.  Anyway, keep an eye out for <br/>
the clues just in case you need a couple of more boxes in your logbook.<br/>
Wish we could meet you all, have fun!<br/>
