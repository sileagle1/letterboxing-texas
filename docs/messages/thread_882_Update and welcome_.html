                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am so behind!  First off, welcome to all the new people.  We're <br/>
very glad to have you, but would be gladder if you placed boxes in <br/>
the Victoria area.  I'll gladly find them and take care of them for <br/>
you.<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, a box update.  It's not good news.  I went to the Rob and <br/>
Bessie Welder Park in Sinton and found 3 out of 6 boxes.<br/>
<br/>
Hikers Maze- Found but wet.  Excellent hide!<br/>
Looping Lassos series:<br/>
#1- Not found :(  I'm sure I had the right tree, but I didn't see <br/>
any box. The vines were pretty thick so I could have over looked it.<br/>
#2- Found but wet.  Great detail in such a miniscule stamp! It was <br/>
kind of exposed, so I put some debris over it. <br/>
#3-Found, but only slightly wet.  The logbook was dry, but the <br/>
little purple pieces of paper were washed out.  Whatever was written <br/>
on them is long gone.<br/>
#4 and #5- Missing.  I'm abslutely possitive I had the right trees, <br/>
but all I found was a lizard and a beer bottle.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry guys.  I wish I had had the time to dry out your boxes, but I <br/>
was only passing through.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the update, Monkeytoes. I need to get over to Welder Park <br/>
A.S.A.P. and take care of those boxes. Baby Bear, when I go over, I'll <br/>
dry yours out too. <br/>
<br/>
I want to say welcome to all the new boxers too. And although I don't <br/>
think I have seen them here in the group, I 'found' three more <br/>
letterboxers, who are from Sequin, that signed into my Watchful Birds <br/>
letterbox. So, slowly but surely, letterboxing is growing in Texas.<br/>
