                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, my son and I got out of the house again today<br/>
and this time we headed to Fairfield, Wortham, Mexia,<br/>
and Groesbeck.  We just got back in and I'm really,<br/>
really tired - a lot tireder today than I was<br/>
yesterday!  Lightning decided today that he wants to<br/>
go by Struck by Lightning, and I'm afraid to ask why<br/>
because I have a feeling it reflects on how he feels<br/>
after two days of breakneck letterboxing with good ol'<br/>
Mom.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm also making a note to compare my height to Baby<br/>
Bear's at the gathering, because although I didn't<br/>
think he was that much taller than me, I'm starting to<br/>
wonder because his steps are wayyyy longer than mine! <br/>
What was funny was watching Lightning try to step it<br/>
out since mine kept coming up short...like even<br/>
shorter legs were going to make it work out just<br/>
right?  Thankfully, Baby Bear always gives really good<br/>
landmarks, so even if steps don't work out just right,<br/>
you can get close enough to spot his description of<br/>
the area. <br/>
<br/>
We headed to Fairfield to snag Silver Eagle's and Baby<br/>
Bear's boxes they planted there last year.  I suddenly<br/>
realized it really was only a little over a year ago<br/>
that I actually discovered a real log entry in one of<br/>
my boxes - Fairfield's Oh Deer! ... As slow as my<br/>
first year in letterboxing was, this past year has<br/>
been pretty eventful.  <br/>
<br/>
Well...we pulled in to the park and I went through my<br/>
clues to pull the two for Fairfield, only to discover<br/>
that my printer had stuttered out Silver Eagle's<br/>
Horton so badly that it was illegible.  We really,<br/>
really need to come up with a letterboxing hotline so<br/>
that we can make a phone call and get those clues when<br/>
things like this happen.  Regular people just don't<br/>
understand when you call them in a frenzy asking them<br/>
to log on to the website and painstakingly read you<br/>
the clues.  In fact, today I couldn't even find anyone<br/>
to take my call and I'm thinking it is because they<br/>
knew what I was out doing, so they suspected why I was<br/>
calling!<br/>
<br/>
So off we went to find Baby Bear's TX Tour - 12/4. <br/>
I'm fairly sure I found the right tree, but being only<br/>
5'5" myself, looking into the hole in the tree at 5'<br/>
didn't work too well and I didn't have a Miata in my<br/>
pocket to pull up to the tree.  Unfortunately,<br/>
Lightning is still too short to be much good, even<br/>
when he stood on my knee to look in.  This is what<br/>
cinched needing to compare heights with Baby Bear.  No<br/>
problem here though - I've already figured out who I'm<br/>
going to drag - I mean invite - along on our next<br/>
foray to Fairfield, and he's 7' 6", so he should be<br/>
able to do the trick!  It was, as Fairfield always is,<br/>
a nice hike.  Lake is really low though.<br/>
<br/>
We jumped in the car and made the short trip to<br/>
Wortham and checked in at T-Dog's Blind Lemon<br/>
Jefferson.  Neat box.  I'm going to buy a CD because I<br/>
love blues and I feel I should have a copy of one of<br/>
his CD's since I've now got the commemorative stamp<br/>
image.  I was a little put off by the fact that T-Dog<br/>
led us right through the cemetery, traipsing around<br/>
the graves, but after the journey was over, I realized<br/>
I had developed a sense of history I didn't have<br/>
before.  Having been a first grader in Baton Rouge<br/>
when desegregation was being enforced and coupled with<br/>
mandatory bussing, I've always felt I was sitting in a<br/>
very small seat on the front row watching the racial<br/>
issues of the 60's and sensing the profound unfairness<br/>
of the times, but my experience finding Blind Lemon<br/>
Jefferson gave me another layer of understanding I<br/>
hadn't previously considered.<br/>
<br/>
Off we went to Mexia and on to the Confederate Reunion<br/>
Grounds.  I still can't get over how many really cool<br/>
parks are day trips for me.  We found Val Verde Cannon<br/>
and Confederate Flag and these were GREAT locations. <br/>
We actually took a little time to relax and kick back<br/>
here - boy was it a nice place for that!  We also<br/>
found Something Fishy here and we'll be taking it and<br/>
dropping it off soon - what is the saying about guests<br/>
and fish?  After three days they both start to stink? <br/>
We won't be keeping it too long.<br/>

stamps I have done and add to them..<br/>

<br/>
<br/>
For your year in Letterboxing..  I have to agree with everything you said!<br/>
I especially like the question about big and small.  I guess that is a lot<br/>
of the reason I letterbox with my kids, is for those moments.  Sure, most of<br/>
the time I have to DRAG them away from the electronics, but in the end they<br/>
always have a good time.  And, I always learn something new about them!  <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Baby Bear must have VERY long legs, but I think I have him almost to a<br/>
science now, he is almost two of my steps!  I noticed he was tall at the<br/>
gathering, but GEEZ!  Still, it has become a game to me to figure out how<br/>
many steps it is for me hee hee...<br/>

<div>Lucy, I really loved reading about your adventures and realized that those 
are all day trips from my direction, also!  So that means there's lots more 
boxes out there that I haven't even thought about finding yet (including those 
in Fairfield, since when I went there last spring, yours was the only box there

Hi, I'm a new member to this board, I am the "T-Dog" who planted that <br/>
letterbox... (of course, I joined to see your sitrep!)  I'm sorry to <br/>
have made you go traipsing around the graves in the cemetary, I <br/>
figured they were the best available landmarks.  I tried to be <br/>
respectful while at the same time paying homage to a favorite <br/>
musician.  I've seen clues for letterboxes in graveyards where they <br/>
have the box hidden in part of a monument before, and I definitely <br/>
did not want to do anything like that, so I put it discreetly on the <br/>
periphery of the graveyard.   I really like visiting Lemon Jefferson <br/>
out there, it's a very peaceful spot.  (Unless I bring my guitar <br/>
along--then you can hear Blind Lemon spinning in his grave!)<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't bought a CD yet, I'd recommend this one:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-<br/>
/B000000XW6/qid=1135974097/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/103-6742792-5091059?<br/>
v=glance&amp;s=music&amp;n=507846<br/>
<br/>
I've seen a few "best of" CD's of his, but this one truly does have <br/>
some of his "best" songs on it.  (I have the complete boxed set, <br/>
myself.)  If you get it check out "Matchbox Blues", "Pennitentiary <br/>
Blues", "Jack O' Diamonds," and his notorious "Black Snake Moan"  <br/>
(called "black snake woman" on this one for some weird reason.) Since <br/>
he's one of the earliest recording artists, you're going to hear a <br/>
bunch of hiss and pop on any recording... I think it adds to the <br/>
character!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Off we went to Mexia and on to the Confederate Reunion<br/>
&gt; Grounds.<br/>
<br/>
I've seen that place going to and from the site of my letterbox, I'll <br/>
have to go hunting for boxes there next time I'm out in that neck of <br/>
the woods!<br/>
<br/>
Since this is my first post to the board, I should add that I <br/>
letterbox under the name "T-Dog" and have planted two boxes so far, <br/>
both near the graves of some legendary blues artists.  I've found one <br/>
box so far, in Lakeway, TX, where I live.  Hopefully, I'll be out <br/>
finding more soon!<br/>

I hate that I left you with the idea that I didn't see<br/>
the value of visiting each of the gravestones.  Yes,<br/>
while I was put off by it at first, by the time we<br/>
finished the box, I was totally impressed with the<br/>
selections you used to guide us through the cemetery<br/>
to Blind Lemon's headstone.  <br/>
<br/>
I like cemetery boxes - when they are well-done. <br/>
Usually, I don't like being encouraged to walk through<br/>
and among the headstones because it seems<br/>
disrespectful to the folks who are buried there and<br/>
who aren't the subject of the box.  HOWEVER, in the<br/>
case of your box, you used some really good graves<br/>
that were interesting to read and pointed up the<br/>
culture of service and dedication to their country<br/>
that blacks felt, even when their country didn't feel<br/>
the same toward them.  In the end, I thought yours was<br/>
an excellent cemetery box and it honored not only<br/>
Blind Lemon Jefferson, but also some folks I never<br/>
would've known before.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess that points up something I've realized<br/>
since I started letterboxing.  You gotta have an open<br/>
mind.  If I had allowed my first impression to dictate<br/>
whether we went ahead and did the box or not, we<br/>
really would've missed out.  <br/>
<br/>
It is indeed a peaceful location and I'm always a<br/>
little surprised by the odd places we can find<br/>
tributes to people who have made a major contribution<br/>
to some element of our culture.  Maybe you and I will<br/>
have to meet out there sometime with our guitars...<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the suggestion for a CD.  I'll have to<br/>
check it out.  I haven't bought a good blues CD in<br/>
ages!<br/>
<br/>
Now that you've joined, I hope you'll stick around,<br/>
and again, nice job on the box!<br/>

<p><span>&gt; Wortham and checked in at T-Dog's Blind Lemon<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>&gt; his CD's since I've now got the commemorative stamp<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; image.  I was a little put off by the fact that T-Dog<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; led us right through the cemetery, traipsing around<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; the graves, but after the journey was over, I realized<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; I had developed a sense of history I didn't have<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; before.  Having been a first grader in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Baton Rouge</st1:place></st1:city><o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; when desegregation was being enforced and coupled with<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; mandatory bussing, I've always felt I was sitting in a<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; very small seat on the front row watching the racial<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; issues of the 60's and sensing the profound unfairness<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; of the times, but my experience finding Blind Lemon<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>&gt; <st1:place w:st="on">Jefferson</st1:place> gave me another layer
of understanding I<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<div>I've never thought there was anything wrong with walking through a cemetery to find a box. I don't think it's disrespectful at all. I think it's the atttitude of whoever is doing the walking that is going to shine through, and I don't think most boxers are the kind of people who would be disrespectful or not think about where they are. I love cemeteries and always feel a connection to the past when I'm in one. I look at the names and dates on the headstones and wonder about the people buried there,  think about their lives. </div>

the two I've done so far have both been in cemetaries.  (Both honor <br/>
blues musicians who are no longer with us.)  I'd feel weird looking <br/>
for a box that hidden somehow in someone's grave or marker, or if the <br/>
clues were somehow disrespectful, but other than that, I personally <br/>
feel it's OK.  <br/>
<br/>
The Blind Lemon Jefferson letterbox was my first box I've planted, <br/>
and, in hindsight, I could have done better on my clues.   I probably <br/>
should have figured out a way to make a puzzle of it, instead, I gave <br/>
compass directions, counted paces, and used a few stones as landmarks.<br/>

<br/>
I didn't go about picking any particular folks, but I did try to find <br/>
interesting bits on the stones.  I'm sure that graveyard has lots of <br/>
remarkable people buried there and countless untold stories!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I like cemetery boxes - when they are well-done. <br/>
&gt; Usually, I don't like being encouraged to walk through<br/>
&gt; and among the headstones because it seems<br/>
&gt; disrespectful to the folks who are buried there and<br/>
&gt; who aren't the subject of the box.  HOWEVER, in the<br/>
&gt; case of your box, you used some really good graves<br/>
&gt; that were interesting to read and pointed up the<br/>
&gt; culture of service and dedication to their country<br/>
&gt; that blacks felt, even when their country didn't feel<br/>
&gt; the same toward them.  In the end, I thought yours was<br/>
&gt; an excellent cemetery box and it honored not only<br/>
&gt; Blind Lemon Jefferson, but also some folks I never<br/>
&gt; would've known before.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
<br/>
Thank you.  It was always my intention to honor Jefferson, but you're <br/>
right, the cemetary tells a story all it's own!<br/>

&gt; &gt; I hate that I left you with the idea that I didn't<br/>
&gt; see<br/>
&gt; &gt; the value of visiting each of the gravestones. <br/>
&gt; Yes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; while I was put off by it at first, by the time we<br/>
&gt; &gt; finished the box, I was totally impressed with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; selections you used to guide us through the<br/>
&gt; cemetery<br/>
&gt; &gt; to Blind Lemon's headstone.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I didn't go about picking any particular folks, but<br/>
&gt; I did try to find <br/>
&gt; interesting bits on the stones.  I'm sure that<br/>
&gt; graveyard has lots of <br/>
&gt; remarkable people buried there and countless untold<br/>
&gt; stories!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
**********I think that's what made it that much<br/>
better.  Their names meant nothing, but their<br/>
"stories" did.<br/>
