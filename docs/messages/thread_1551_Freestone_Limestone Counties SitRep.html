                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, my son and I got out of the house again today<br>
and this time we headed to Fairfield, Wortham, Mexia,<br>
and Groesbeck.  We just got back in and I'm really,<br>
really tired - a lot tireder today than I was<br>
yesterday!  Lightning decided today that he wants to<br>
go by Struck by Lightning, and I'm afraid to ask why<br>
because I have a feeling it reflects on how he feels<br>
after two days of breakneck letterboxing with good ol'<br>
Mom.  <br>
<br>
I'm also making a note to compare my height to Baby<br>
Bear's at the gathering, because although I didn't<br>
think he was that much taller than me, I'm starting to<br>
wonder because his steps are wayyyy longer than mine! <br>
What was funny was watching Lightning try to step it<br>
out since mine kept coming up short...like even<br>
shorter legs were going to make it work out just<br>
right?  Thankfully, Baby Bear always gives really good<br>
landmarks, so even if steps don't work out just right,<br>
you can get close enough to spot his description of<br>
the area. <br>
<br>
We headed to Fairfield to snag Silver Eagle's and Baby<br>
Bear's boxes they planted there last year.  I suddenly<br>
realized it really was only a little over a year ago<br>
that I actually discovered a real log entry in one of<br>
my boxes - Fairfield's Oh Deer! ... As slow as my<br>
first year in letterboxing was, this past year has<br>
been pretty eventful.  <br>
<br>
Well...we pulled in to the park and I went through my<br>
clues to pull the two for Fairfield, only to discover<br>
that my printer had stuttered out Silver Eagle's<br>
Horton so badly that it was illegible.  We really,<br>
really need to come up with a letterboxing hotline so<br>
that we can make a phone call and get those clues when<br>
things like this happen.  Regular people just don't<br>
understand when you call them in a frenzy asking them<br>
to log on to the website and painstakingly read you<br>
the clues.  In fact, today I couldn't even find anyone<br>
to take my call and I'm thinking it is because they<br>
knew what I was out doing, so they suspected why I was<br>
calling!<br>
<br>
So off we went to find Baby Bear's TX Tour - 12/4. <br>
I'm fairly sure I found the right tree, but being only<br>
5'5" myself, looking into the hole in the tree at 5'<br>
didn't work too well and I didn't have a Miata in my<br>
pocket to pull up to the tree.  Unfortunately,<br>
Lightning is still too short to be much good, even<br>
when he stood on my knee to look in.  This is what<br>
cinched needing to compare heights with Baby Bear.  No<br>
problem here though - I've already figured out who I'm<br>
going to drag - I mean invite - along on our next<br>
foray to Fairfield, and he's 7' 6", so he should be<br>
able to do the trick!  It was, as Fairfield always is,<br>
a nice hike.  Lake is really low though.<br>
<br>
We jumped in the car and made the short trip to<br>
Wortham and checked in at T-Dog's Blind Lemon<br>
Jefferson.  Neat box.  I'm going to buy a CD because I<br>
love blues and I feel I should have a copy of one of<br>
his CD's since I've now got the commemorative stamp<br>
image.  I was a little put off by the fact that T-Dog<br>
led us right through the cemetery, traipsing around<br>
the graves, but after the journey was over, I realized<br>
I had developed a sense of history I didn't have<br>
before.  Having been a first grader in Baton Rouge<br>
when desegregation was being enforced and coupled with<br>
mandatory bussing, I've always felt I was sitting in a<br>
very small seat on the front row watching the racial<br>
issues of the 60's and sensing the profound unfairness<br>
of the times, but my experience finding Blind Lemon<br>
Jefferson gave me another layer of understanding I<br>
hadn't previously considered.<br>
<br>
Off we went to Mexia and on to the Confederate Reunion<br>
Grounds.  I still can't get over how many really cool<br>
parks are day trips for me.  We found Val Verde Cannon<br>
and Confederate Flag and these were GREAT locations. <br>
We actually took a little time to relax and kick back<br>
here - boy was it a nice place for that!  We also<br>
found Something Fishy here and we'll be taking it and<br>
dropping it off soon - what is the saying about guests<br>
and fish?  After three days they both start to stink? <br>
We won't be keeping it too long.<br>

<br>
For your year in Letterboxing..  I have to agree with everything you said!<br>
I especially like the question about big and small.  I guess that is a lot<br>
of the reason I letterbox with my kids, is for those moments.  Sure, most of<br>
the time I have to DRAG them away from the electronics, but in the end they<br>
always have a good time.  And, I always learn something new about them!  <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
Baby Bear must have VERY long legs, but I think I have him almost to a<br>
science now, he is almost two of my steps!  I noticed he was tall at the<br>
gathering, but GEEZ!  Still, it has become a game to me to figure out how<br>
many steps it is for me hee hee...<br>

Hi, I'm a new member to this board, I am the "T-Dog" who planted that <br>
letterbox... (of course, I joined to see your sitrep!)  I'm sorry to <br>
have made you go traipsing around the graves in the cemetary, I <br>
figured they were the best available landmarks.  I tried to be <br>
respectful while at the same time paying homage to a favorite <br>
musician.  I've seen clues for letterboxes in graveyards where they <br>
have the box hidden in part of a monument before, and I definitely <br>
did not want to do anything like that, so I put it discreetly on the <br>
periphery of the graveyard.   I really like visiting Lemon Jefferson <br>
out there, it's a very peaceful spot.  (Unless I bring my guitar <br>
along--then you can hear Blind Lemon spinning in his grave!)<br>
<br>
If you haven't bought a CD yet, I'd recommend this one:<br>
<br>
http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-<br>
/B000000XW6/qid=1135974097/sr=8-3/ref=pd_bbs_3/103-6742792-5091059?<br>
v=glance&s=music&n=507846<br>
<br>
I've seen a few "best of" CD's of his, but this one truly does have <br>
some of his "best" songs on it.  (I have the complete boxed set, <br>
myself.)  If you get it check out "Matchbox Blues", "Pennitentiary <br>
Blues", "Jack O' Diamonds," and his notorious "Black Snake Moan"  <br>
(called "black snake woman" on this one for some weird reason.) Since <br>
he's one of the earliest recording artists, you're going to hear a <br>
bunch of hiss and pop on any recording... I think it adds to the <br>
character!<br>
<br>
> Off we went to Mexia and on to the Confederate Reunion<br>
> Grounds.<br>
<br>
I've seen that place going to and from the site of my letterbox, I'll <br>
have to go hunting for boxes there next time I'm out in that neck of <br>
the woods!<br>
<br>
Since this is my first post to the board, I should add that I <br>
letterbox under the name "T-Dog" and have planted two boxes so far, <br>
both near the graves of some legendary blues artists.  I've found one <br>
box so far, in Lakeway, TX, where I live.  Hopefully, I'll be out <br>
finding more soon!<br>

I hate that I left you with the idea that I didn't see<br>
the value of visiting each of the gravestones.  Yes,<br>
while I was put off by it at first, by the time we<br>
finished the box, I was totally impressed with the<br>
selections you used to guide us through the cemetery<br>
to Blind Lemon's headstone.  <br>
<br>
I like cemetery boxes - when they are well-done. <br>
Usually, I don't like being encouraged to walk through<br>
and among the headstones because it seems<br>
disrespectful to the folks who are buried there and<br>
who aren't the subject of the box.  HOWEVER, in the<br>
case of your box, you used some really good graves<br>
that were interesting to read and pointed up the<br>
culture of service and dedication to their country<br>
that blacks felt, even when their country didn't feel<br>
the same toward them.  In the end, I thought yours was<br>
an excellent cemetery box and it honored not only<br>
Blind Lemon Jefferson, but also some folks I never<br>
would've known before.<br>
<br>
And I guess that points up something I've realized<br>
since I started letterboxing.  You gotta have an open<br>
mind.  If I had allowed my first impression to dictate<br>
whether we went ahead and did the box or not, we<br>
really would've missed out.  <br>
<br>
It is indeed a peaceful location and I'm always a<br>
little surprised by the odd places we can find<br>
tributes to people who have made a major contribution<br>
to some element of our culture.  Maybe you and I will<br>
have to meet out there sometime with our guitars...<br>
<br>
Thanks for the suggestion for a CD.  I'll have to<br>
check it out.  I haven't bought a good blues CD in<br>
ages!<br>
<br>
Now that you've joined, I hope you'll stick around,<br>

<div>I've never thought there was anything wrong with walking through a cemetery to find a box. I don't think it's disrespectful at all. I think it's the atttitude of whoever is doing the walking that is going to shine through, and I don't think most boxers are the kind of people who would be disrespectful or not think about where they are. I love cemeteries and always feel a connection to the past when I'm in one. I look at the names and dates on the headstones and wonder about the people buried there,  think about their lives. </div>

Thanks, and nice to meet you too!  Hopefully, I'll be able to <br>
contribute more to the hobby in the near future.  ;)<br>

the two I've done so far have both been in cemetaries.  (Both honor <br>
blues musicians who are no longer with us.)  I'd feel weird looking <br>
for a box that hidden somehow in someone's grave or marker, or if the <br>
clues were somehow disrespectful, but other than that, I personally <br>
feel it's OK.  <br>
<br>
The Blind Lemon Jefferson letterbox was my first box I've planted, <br>
and, in hindsight, I could have done better on my clues.   I probably <br>
should have figured out a way to make a puzzle of it, instead, I gave <br>
compass directions, counted paces, and used a few stones as landmarks.<br>

I didn't go about picking any particular folks, but I did try to find <br>
interesting bits on the stones.  I'm sure that graveyard has lots of <br>
remarkable people buried there and countless untold stories!<br>

Thank you.  It was always my intention to honor Jefferson, but you're <br>
right, the cemetary tells a story all it's own!<br>

**********I think that's what made it that much<br>
better.  Their names meant nothing, but their<br>
"stories" did.<br>
