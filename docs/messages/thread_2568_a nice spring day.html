<div>Dear Lucy,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It has been sort of a 
tough day around our house today, and it was a real delight to read your account 
of your adventures this afternoon.  I thought Love's Lookout was a 
spectacular place, but standing and looking out there was not nearly as much fun 
as reading about you and your happy mishaps and childhood memories.  I am 
going to ask once again, when are those memoirs coming out?  You are moving 
up on my list of favorite authors, and you don't even have anything in print 
(yet!)  your fan-MO5</div></body></html>
