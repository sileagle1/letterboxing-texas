                    <div class="plaintext-content">As the person who couldn't find The Valentine's box, I'm relieved it<br/>
was there.  That is also one reason why I never report boxes as<br/>
missing and always assume it's our error and that we just couldn't<br/>
find it.<br/>
<br/>
It's funny how sometimes you can't figure out straight-forward clues<br/>
and sometimes cryptic clues make all the sense in the world.  I think<br/>
when you have found a number of boxes by a particular planter, you<br/>
have a better understanding of how they think and then their clues<br/>
make a little more sense.<br/>
<br/>
For that particular box, my engineer husband was feeling frustrated by<br/>
the tallest point part of the clue for the box...Me?  I was busy<br/>
trying to keep the kids from falling on the broken glass that was all<br/>
over that pile.  So it's fair to say we didn't give that one our best<br/>
shot.  Definitely user error.<br/>
<br/>
Happy new year!<br/>

<div class="gmail_quote">YES!  What Dewberry said - on all points.  Yep, yep.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">When I start having trouble finding a box, I try to remember how dead certain I was that one of Lucy Locket's boxes was missing and I told her so.  She was puzzled since Blue Butterfly had just found it the day before, and sure enough someone else found it right after I had been there, so clearly it had been me.  When I went back, I stepped back from the clues and wiped my mind clean of my previous assumptions, and it was as clear as day what she was talking about - and while I had found a way to make the clues work "exactly", there was another way to work the clues that slid right into place perfectly and led me to the box.  My way was dead-on, but the right way was deader-on.
</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">There are a few boxers whose boxes I have found enough of that I can pretty much say "this doesn't seem right", or "I think they meant that...", and sometimes I can even spot the hiding spot from a distance because it just "looks like" a so-and-so hiding spot.  It's really odd to go to a different area and look for boxes by someone completely different.  It's much more challenging because for one thing, I'm not familiar with the area and for another, I'm not familiar with the planter.
</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Yep, I always assume it was me unless I know for certain it was something else (as with JBK's box in Rusk that was in pieces that I found).</div>
