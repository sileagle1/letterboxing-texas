<div>Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter....I went and picked up the 
railroad monopoly boxes in Tomball for dear Dewberry today, and had a chance to 
see you stamps in the logbooks...they are great!  I can't imagine how long 
it takes LSQ to color her stamp.  We are really looking forward to finding 
some of your boxes over the weekend.  I LOVE the boot stamp...I have a five 
year old who has worn nothing on his feet but an old garage sale pair of cowboy 
boots for the last 3 years.  We actually call him "Boots".  Great 
job!  MO5</div></body></html>

while, but we don't get in any hurry.  We enjoy all the boxes we find <br/>
and appreciate those of you who hide them.  What a great sport!<br/>
