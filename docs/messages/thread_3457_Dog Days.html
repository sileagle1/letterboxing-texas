<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Thank you so much to 
Boots Tex, LSQ, and dewberry for a GREAT time yesterday!  Daddy of Five 
said he thought it was the best yet (though I suspect this is because I didn't 
have to arrive early to help set up leaving him on kid duty.)  Double Lake 
is such a pretty spot, we are planning a fall camping trip there, we just didn't 
have enough time to really get out on the trails.</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">On the way home 
yesterday I was thinking how lucky I am to have stumbled on letterboxing.  
It has given me the chance to meet so many great people whom I otherwise would 
have never had the chance to know.  It is amazing how many creative people 
are out there lurking behind funny names.</font></div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">As I sit here with my 
coffee I am dreaming of a Red Barn cinnamon roll, I know what Boots Tex will 
have to bring to all future gatherings!  Thanks again for such a great day 
out!  MO5</font></div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who came to the Dog Days at Double Lake event <br>
yesterday.  A big thanks to dewberry for all the hard work and the <br>
great dog boxes she gathered from all over for our letterboxing <br>
pleasure, and the fun boxes she carved and made available at the <br>
pavilion.  If you didn't get those out on the Lone Star Trail, you <br>
missed out.  Thanks also to those of you who came by the Red Barn to <br>
partake in Cinnamon Rolls and coffee.  (Does this sound like an <br>
acceptance speech?).  Anyway, everyone seemed to have a great time <br>
and that's the whole purpose, isn't it?  Today, after our family left <br>
to make their way back home, we had a relaxing time at Double Lake, <br>
stamping into the 19 boxes we didn't already have.  It was a <br>
beautiful day and we saw not a single other person.  We did see a few <br>
deer and spent about five minutes watching a lovely Pileated <br>
Woodpecker working for his dinner on a dead log about 10 feet away <br>
from us.  We need to get an accurate count, but offhand, we figure <br>
there are about 32 letterboxes in the park and on the Lone Star Trail <br>
within 1/2 mile of the park.  There are 5 more if you don't mind <br>
walking a little farther down the trail, so it's a great letterboxing <br>
destination and a beautiful place. Y'all come back and see us <br>
sometime.<br>

Today, after our family <br/>left <br/>&gt; to make their way back home, we had a relaxing time at Double Lake, <br/>&gt; stamping into the 19 boxes we didn't already have. It was a <br/>&gt; beautiful day and we saw not a single other person. We did see a <br/>few <br/>&gt; deer and spent about five minutes watching a lovely Pileated <br/>&gt; Woodpecker working for his dinner on a dead log about 10 feet away <br/>&gt; from us. We need to get an accurate count, but offhand, we figure <br/>&gt; there are about 32 letterboxes in the park and on the Lone Star <br/>Trail <br/>&gt; within 1/2 mile of the park. There are 5 more if you don't mind <br/>&gt; walking a little farther down the trail, so it's a great <br/>letterboxing <br/>&gt; destination and a beautiful place.
