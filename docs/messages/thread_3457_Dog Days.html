<div>Thank you so much to 
Boots Tex, LSQ, and dewberry for a GREAT time yesterday!  Daddy of Five 
said he thought it was the best yet (though I suspect this is because I didn't 
have to arrive early to help set up leaving him on kid duty.)  Double Lake 
is such a pretty spot, we are planning a fall camping trip there, we just didn't 
have enough time to really get out on the trails.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the way home 
yesterday I was thinking how lucky I am to have stumbled on letterboxing.  
It has given me the chance to meet so many great people whom I otherwise would 
have never had the chance to know.  It is amazing how many creative people 
are out there lurking behind funny names.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I sit here with my 
coffee I am dreaming of a Red Barn cinnamon roll, I know what Boots Tex will 
have to bring to all future gatherings!  Thanks again for such a great day 
out!  MO5</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone who came to the Dog Days at Double Lake event <br/>
yesterday.  A big thanks to dewberry for all the hard work and the <br/>
great dog boxes she gathered from all over for our letterboxing <br/>
pleasure, and the fun boxes she carved and made available at the <br/>
pavilion.  If you didn't get those out on the Lone Star Trail, you <br/>
missed out.  Thanks also to those of you who came by the Red Barn to <br/>
partake in Cinnamon Rolls and coffee.  (Does this sound like an <br/>
acceptance speech?).  Anyway, everyone seemed to have a great time <br/>
and that's the whole purpose, isn't it?  Today, after our family left <br/>
to make their way back home, we had a relaxing time at Double Lake, <br/>
stamping into the 19 boxes we didn't already have.  It was a <br/>
beautiful day and we saw not a single other person.  We did see a few <br/>
deer and spent about five minutes watching a lovely Pileated <br/>
Woodpecker working for his dinner on a dead log about 10 feet away <br/>
from us.  We need to get an accurate count, but offhand, we figure <br/>
there are about 32 letterboxes in the park and on the Lone Star Trail <br/>
within 1/2 mile of the park.  There are 5 more if you don't mind <br/>
walking a little farther down the trail, so it's a great letterboxing <br/>
destination and a beautiful place. Y'all come back and see us <br/>
sometime.<br/>

<p>Thanks to all you you who put on this event. It was Fast and 
        <br/>Furious, and a lot of fun. Still dreaming about those cinnamon 
        <br/>rolls!! My wife loved the one I brought home. For those who have 
        <br/>not been to Double Lake, go, it is a great outdoors place, and now 
        <br/>has tons of letterboxes!<wbr/>!! Until next time, later.<br/><br/>Baby

        Thanks to everyone who came to the Dog Days at Double Lake event 
        <br/>&gt; yesterday. A big thanks to dewberry for all the hard work and 
        the <br/>&gt; great dog boxes she gathered from all over for our 
        letterboxing <br/>&gt; pleasure, and the fun boxes she carved and made 
        available at the <br/>&gt; pavilion. If you didn't get those out on the 
        Lone Star Trail, you <br/>&gt; missed out. Thanks also to those of you 
        who came by the Red Barn <br/>to <br/>&gt; partake in Cinnamon Rolls and 
        coffee. (Does this sound like an <br/>&gt; acceptance speech?). Anyway, 
        everyone seemed to have a great time <br/>&gt; and that's the whole 
        purpose, isn't it? Today, after our family <br/>left <br/>&gt; to make 
        their way back home, we had a relaxing time at Double Lake, <br/>&gt; 
        stamping into the 19 boxes we didn't already have. It was a <br/>&gt; 
        beautiful day and we saw not a single other person. We did see a <br/>few 
        <br/>&gt; deer and spent about five minutes watching a lovely Pileated 
        <br/>&gt; Woodpecker working for his dinner on a dead log about 10 feet 
        away <br/>&gt; from us. We need to get an accurate count, but offhand, we 
        figure <br/>&gt; there are about 32 letterboxes in the park and on the 
        Lone Star <br/>Trail <br/>&gt; within 1/2 mile of the park. There are 5 
        more if you don't mind <br/>&gt; walking a little farther down the trail, 
        so it's a great <br/>letterboxing <br/>&gt; destination and a beautiful 
        place. Y'all come back and see us <br/>&gt; sometime.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
