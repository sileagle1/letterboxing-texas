<br/>
We were successful in finding Safety Town and The Petting Zoo in a very <br/>
nice park. We also looked for Flowers in the Park (unsuccessful),<br/>
         and Silly Old Moose (I wanted to get my stepdaughter a moose <br/>
stamp and knew that most of them were unreachable right now, but alas, <br/>
we couldn't get to this box either due to high water blocking the <br/>
path).   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again.<br/>
