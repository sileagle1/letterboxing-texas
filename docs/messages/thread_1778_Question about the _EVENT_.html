                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi gang.  Judging from the post-event comments, it sounds like <br/>
everyone had a great time in spite of the weather.  Kissin' Fishies <br/>
(Wes and Grace mand Mr. Howdy) really regret that we had to miss for <br/>
the first time.  Did our campsite come in handy?  We instructed the <br/>
people at the park to make sure that only letterboxers (Barefoot Lucy, <br/>
Silver Eagle or Baby bear) were authorized to distribute the site to <br/>
one of our own.  Hope that's what really happened.  Any idea about <br/>
another event soon?<br/>
