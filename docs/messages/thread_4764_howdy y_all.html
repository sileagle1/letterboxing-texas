</div><div><br/></div><div>Traditionally (at least for the last couple of years), the Tomato Fest Challenge is a bit of a mystery until the day of, or the day before. You have to come prepared for just about anything that might come your way and you have to be ready to go by the seat of your pants. BUT - don't let this intimidate you because this is how it usually goes: You show up with whatever information has been previously provided to you, get your bearings and hit the ground running. Before you know it, you bump into other letterboxers (or people who appear might be letterboxers). You tell them who you are, tell them you are new, and they grab you up and help you out. Also, I will be on the Festival site most of the day, and this year we will have a whole TFC team on hand to help. If you can't find me for a face-to-face question, I'll be available by phone and I'll give you my phone number for free - you dont' even have to earn it (I did think about making it an objective, but too many letterboxers have it already so it would be unfair to those who don't). I really want you to succeed, but I don't want it to be easy. </div>
<div><br/></div><div>NOW - this year there is a competitive element. I'm not gonna give you details, but there it is. You'll be competing with other teams.

your way and you have to be ready to go by the seat of your pants.  BUT -
don't let this intimidate you because this is how it usually goes:  You
show up with whatever information has been previously provided to you, get your
bearings and hit the ground running.  Before you know it, you bump into
