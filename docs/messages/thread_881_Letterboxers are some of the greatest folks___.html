Oooh, very cool!  I've been to Galveston twice, and would love an<br>
excuse to explore more of that area.  Thanks for the info!<br>

We had a blast in Galveston - and our letterboxing adventures were almost<br>
all due to your efforts, so we owe you! (CactusLicker and The Gentleman are<br>
dying to get back to SeaWolf park because the fishing is supposed to be<br>
superb!).<br>
<br>
While in Galveston, we found Hawk's Celtic Cross (that area was hauntingly<br>
beautiful and poignant), Hawk's Sea Aggie (we enjoyed our campus tour and<br>
the Aggies in the family LOVED that stamp!), and Hawk's Topaz Memorial Box<br>
(As fervent dog lovers, we were touched by the story and our hearts go out<br>
to Krohm).<br>
<br>
The Gentleman, Cactus and I dug deep to find TeamKing's Tribute#7 - (while<br>
Flicker & Tenderfoot devoted themselves to hardcore shopping on the Strand)<br>
but with no luck! We loved the area, so all was not lost..it was a nice<br>
break from the heat!<br>
<br>
SilverEagle's Brown Bomber box was fun to find (educational, of course!) and<br>
an added treat to collect that stamp since we had enjoyed watching those<br>
creatures a few days earlier. <br>
<br>
Incidentally, CactusLicker won $72.00 at the Greyhound races and is willing<br>
to share his somewhat bizarre betting theories...;-)!!!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>
