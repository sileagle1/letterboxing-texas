The letterbox is in place and I finished all the clues and the write up <br>
last night. Now I just need to post them. Hopefully I will have time <br>
tonight at work. It was a pleasure meeting all of you at the park on <br>
Friday. I did not get to get to all the boxes due to lack of time but <br>
when I pick up the kids on Easter Sunday hopefully I will have time to <br>
finish getting the others there in Van.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks Again,<br>
