                    <div class="plaintext-content">That really, really is a bummer!  I'm so sorry for you<br>
- but I know what you mean!<br>
<br>
The only stamp my husband has ever carved, and our<br>
first box to plant, went missing also.  It was in a<br>
pretty secluded place, but it appeared that there had<br>
been a big cleanup and my box apparently was a<br>
casualty of it.  Somehow, we just haven't had a taste<br>
to replace it.  I think I could bear other boxes going<br>
missing, but that was "the first".  <br>
<br>
Let me encourage you to keep the faith - someone WILL<br>
come and find your boxes - there WILL be visitors to<br>
your area that care to find your gift.  Just as I was<br>
bummed to find our first box was missing (and, by the<br>
way, it had never to my knowledge been found), I can<br>
remember being ecstatic when I went to check a box,<br>
fully expecting to find that the log was empty as<br>
usual, and discovered not one or two, but three<br>
visitors to it.  I had quite a long wait, and several<br>
checks, but it finally happened, and it was worth the<br>
waiting!  <br>
<br>
I wish I lived a little closer to you because I would<br>
go find your boxes just to give you that feeling! <br>
There are boxers closer to you and I'll bet you won't<br>
have to wait much longer before you find visitors.  If<br>
not, I'll be swinging down that way in a few months<br>
and I'll gladly hunt them down and stamp them with<br>
enthusiasm!<br>
<br>
As to the bug thing, I'm not myself especially<br>
susceptible to insects (must not be sweet enough), but<br>
I was privvy to a discussion recently among some<br>
scouters who claim that eating a sulfur tablet the<br>
night before you go out will ward off biting insects. <br>
I would imagine it wards off most anything once you<br>
start sweating sulfur, but hey...if it works, just get<br>
everyone else to take one too and you can stink in<br>
unison!<br>

<br>
Let me just echo Lucy here - have faith! Keep placing boxes and they will<br>
come! It seemed like forever that we were the only boxers in the DFW area,<br>
but then Kantexan & the Samuraistampers started up - then Catpawz - then<br>
Viewfinders...there are actually boxes within driving distance which we<br>
haven't had time to hunt down!<br>
<br>
In the meantime, if you're just going crazy waiting, you might consider<br>
Postal Letterboxing! Granted, there's no hike involved, and no challenge to<br>
finding the boxes, but it's a great offshoot of the main<br>
sport/activity/hobby. <br>
We first started PLBing because for the first 6 months, there was only one<br>
letterbox within an hour's drive of us and we were desperate to try to see<br>
lots of other stamps and logbooks and get to know other boxers.<br>
It became not only a valuable education in letterboxing skills such as<br>
carving, but also a great grounding in letterboxing etiquette. And we had<br>
the opportunity to get to know folks from all over the country and to see<br>
their signature stamps.<br>
<br>
Might be something fun for you to take part in until those other boxers<br>
start springing up in your neighborhood!<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

I am in your area and am in the process of moving from Vidor to Nederland so<br>
I have not got the chance to find your boxes yet. I have been so busy<br>
moving. But, don't fear, I will try to get out there within the week and<br>
find them--I have been itching to get to them since I saw you post the<br>
clues. What was the name of the one that is missing-- I will try to visit<br>
the other 2. I was so excited to see someone else from this area planting<br>
boxes! But, I just have been so busy with the move....<br>
Sincerely,<br>

I haven't given up, don't worry :). It just hacked me off that my <br>
FIRST box is now gone. Ugh.<br>
<br>
We've already placed a new box up here in Lewisville - the city's <br>
first. And we've found about 8 up here so far. We just haven't done <br>
any boxing as of late - although we have ample opportunity.<br>
<br>
I don't see any problems with it, but I don't want to do any PLBs. I <br>
don't have the money for the postage and I would quite prefer the <br>
hiking (bites and all - it comes with the territory).<br>

<div>I think your Lewisville letterbox must be the one I'm carrying clues around 
with me for, just so the next time I'm even anywhere close I can go find 
it.  So far, the clues have travelled quite a bit around the DFW area, but 
just not close enough to Lewisville, but I will get there.  In the

letterboxes I've planted - I think you'll enjoy the areas (but just don't try 
walking the Bear Creek Trail in the heat of the day - too hot!  Do that one 
early in the morning, later in the evening (even after dusk, with a flashlight 
maybe - a couple of those boxes are far enough off the trail to be a little

2.<br>
Woo! Thanks for the areas for your boxes. I'll have to be sure to <br>

<div>What a bummer about your box!! I'm getting ready to plant my first one, and I know I will be sick if someone rips it off!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For bug deterrent, I use Repel, a plant-based lemon eucalyptus insect repellent. It doesn't smell all that great, which surprised me, as I thought lemon-eucalyptus sounded pretty nice, but it does work, and has no deet. I bought it at Academy.</div>

<div>I'll think of something. I want honest people, you</div>

It's water-based, so your body flushes out the excess.<br>
I take a bunch the night before boxing, and I don't<br>
need repellent. The only problem is that the mosquitos<br>
still swarm near you and drive you nuts as you wipe<br>
sweat out of your eyes and try to pry open a container<br>

  &gt; It was the first in my hometown. And the first I<br/>&gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  done. I mean, come on!! There is information in it<br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; I wrote NOT TRASH on it.<br/>&gt; &gt; Animals couldn't have moved it, I 
  took a stick and<br/>&gt; &gt; swung it around in the hole and felt 
  nothing.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I don't think it was even a month 
  old.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; How frustrating! The other two in the area 
  are<br/>&gt; &gt; *amazingly enough* still there but untouched. We<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  have<br/>&gt; &gt; virgin boxes out there!!!<br/>&gt; &gt; Jefferson county, 
  Nederland and Port Neches. Easy<br/>&gt; &gt; finds. You know you want to find 
  them. If you are<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; first finder, let me know and 
  I'll ... I don't<br/>&gt; know.<br/>&gt; &gt; I'll think of something. I want 
  honest people, you<br/>&gt; &gt; know. So don't pretend you found it/them. 
  :)<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I have been itching like MAD since about two 
  weeks<br/>&gt; &gt; ago<br/>&gt; &gt; on our last boxing hike. There's nothing I 
  can do<br/>&gt; &gt; about that now ... But, I would like to know if<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; there<br/>&gt; &gt; are some SAFE no-bug stuff. You know, no deet. 
  I<br/>&gt; &gt; know<br/>&gt; &gt; I should look it up on the internet or 
  something,<br/>&gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; I thought I'd get some REAL product 
  opinions from<br/>&gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; guys.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  Thanks!<br/>&gt; &gt; Lena<br/>&gt; &gt; Strawberry6703<br/>&gt; &gt;
