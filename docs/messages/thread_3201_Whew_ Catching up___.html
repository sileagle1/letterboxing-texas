                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well I just got back in town from a wonderful three day vacation (and for my<br/>
family, three days is a LONG vacation!).<br/>
<br/>
We had originally planned to go to Ponca, AR, our new favorite hideout with<br/>
lots of short (2-6 mile) but interesting hikes and a great little town deep<br/>
in the mountains that you would barely notice if you weren't paying<br/>
attention.  We were even going to stay in high style, renting bunks in a<br/>
bunkhouse instead of camping and hammocking, as we usually do.<br/>
Unfortunately, we got that respiratory yukkiness that has been going around<br/>
everywhere it seems, and Fearless Fox was the last in our house to get it.<br/>
He was barely back on his feet by Wednesday, and certainly not well enough<br/>
for us to drive 8 hours and then not be able to hike (and honestly, I'm not<br/>
really sure I was up for it either, even though the worst of it had run its<br/>
course with me a week earlier).  Sadly, we abandoned our plans.<br/>
<br/>
BUT - there we were, we had fiercely protected four days for ourselves, set<br/>
funds aside for it, and nothing to do.  Having been sick for a couple of<br/>
weeks and having had a hard month schedule-wise and another hard month<br/>
approaching, we were desperate to get out of town, so we decided to head to<br/>
The Space Center in Houston, one of our favorite places to visit on a whim.<br/>
The last time we were there (we think) was when Columbia was flying its last<br/>
mission, and we had even signed the Welcome Home card for them, which they<br/>
obviously never got.  We were long overdue for a visit!<br/>
<br/>
So after doing the basic planning to make the trip happen, the next thing I<br/>
did was to start looking for clues for the trip down there.  Fearless Fox is<br/>
usually pretty tolerant of my letterboxing on trips, but for whatever reason<br/>
he didn't seem so game for making a lot of stops along the way, so even<br/>
though I downloaded clues for every little town on Highway 59 between Lufkin<br/>
and Houston, and threw in 'Coldspring for good measure, I wasn't banking on<br/>
much more than catching a few around The Space Center.<br/>
<br/>
Now on this note, I have to say to you Houstonians:  I really can't seem to<br/>
crack the code for grouping boxes in Houston.  Once I'm inside the loop, I'm<br/>
lost as far as how to find boxes close to where I'm going to be.  To make<br/>
things worse, I've actually boxed a little, or at least researched boxes, on<br/>
the west side, but the east side is definitely beyond me and of course, we<br/>
were staying to the east.  Consequently, I gave up trying to find boxes in<br/>
Houston proper and skipped over Houston and found boxes right around<br/>
Webster.  Every time I go through this exercise, I understand fully why<br/>
Dewberry and others swear by AQ for locating boxes.  If the planter has used<br/>
any sort of an address on their clues, it makes it very clean to look for<br/>
boxes in a given area.  Anyway, I'm not complaining but if y'all ever figure<br/>
out a way to index all those clues, I'm sure a lot of folks would send up<br/>
cheers!  Wow.  Amazing how many boxes ar in Houston!<br/>
<br/>
As we were driving down to Houston Thursday, I made a few mild suggestions<br/>
of places to stop, each coincidentally convenient to letterbox locations,<br/>
but I got no response.  Finally I made one last attempt to imply the need<br/>
for a detour by pointing at a green highway sign and saying, "Oh look!<br/>
There's where you exit for Coldspring".  and at the next sign,  "Coldspring,<br/>
why that's where BT and LSQ live.  There are a LOT of letterboxes that<br/>
way!"  And as we rolled past the cutoff, I plastered my face to the window<br/>
and said "Hey, look Lightning, I think I see one of those boxes from here!"<br/>
No bites.  I gotta work on my technique.<br/>
<br/>
Now I failed to mention that I wasn't the only one in the car with an<br/>
agenda.  We've already gotten a little Christmas money and Lightning<br/>
negotiated with Fearless Fox to go in halves on a Wii game system.  It seems<br/>
like everywhere we've stopped has said they "just sold the last one."<br/>
Consequently, every time I mentioned "there's a box in this town", Lightning<br/>
was also sayng something like "I wonder if they have a Best<br/>
Buy/Walmart/Circuit City/Target/KMart in this town."  You can imagine that<br/>
Fearless Fox was ready to put us both out on the side of the road.<br/>
<br/>
So anyway, we got ourselves through Houston and I was figuring us to be<br/>
checked into our hotel and ready to play by about 2 p.m. - 3 hours of<br/>
boxing, more if the light held out and I pushed a bit!  Just as we cleared<br/>
the south side of the loop and had ourselves pointed in the right direction,<br/>
FF noticed a sign that said "San Jacinto Monument".  Earlier in the trip,<br/>
when I wasn't scoping out letterboxes, he had talked about going there with<br/>
his family when he was a kid.  By the time we saw that sign, I felt a little<br/>
guilty about being so relentless, so I suggested we go.  I only had to say<br/>
it once!  We had to make several quick turns, but we found ourselves on the<br/>
road to Pasadena and he handed over his cell phone so I could get online and<br/>
look to see if there were boxes at San Jacinto.  As I was quickly working on<br/>
LBNA, he was bemoaning the fact we hadn't seen any more signs since the last<br/>
ones and Lightning was grousing about the fact that we hadn't seen a Best<br/>
Buy in quite awhile.  Just as FF was about to give up and ask directions, we<br/>
spotted another sign and we made a fast right and were off and running<br/>
again.  Meanwhile, I had spotted three boxes around the monument.  We<br/>
whipped into the park entrance, only to find it was - CLOSED.  Closed?<br/>
Finally we remembered we were travelling on Thanksgiving and those people<br/>
probably wanted to stay home.  We thought about parking and walking to the<br/>
monument, but the sign didn't give us the idea that would be very smart, so<br/>
we pulled away and continued down the road to drive in front of the<br/>
Battleship Texas, which was also closed.  Fearless Fox showed Lightning<br/>
several features about the boat and then we proceeded ahead and realized we<br/>
were about to take a ferry ride if we didn't turn around.  Well - we love<br/>
ferries!  It wasn't a hard decision to go ahead and jump on the ferry, so we<br/>
waited in anticipation for the very small ferry boat.  Like very small.  As<br/>
in - it holds about sixteen cars, in very close quarters.  Nothing like the<br/>
Bolivar ferry.  We were at the very front of the boat and the water was a<br/>
little choppy.  Oh well.  Too late to turn around.  We just kept reminding<br/>
ourselves that we LOVE ferries.  It finally occurred to us to wonder where<br/>
we were going on the ferry.  We debated asking the attendant, but opted<br/>
against looking ignorant while we were captive to the boat.  It was a fun<br/>
little ride and we drove happily off the boat, looking around for any<br/>
indication of where we were.  We finally stopped and got a really bad map,<br/>
but it was good enough for us to figure out that we could continue along and<br/>
eventually swing back up toward Webster and NASA.<br/>
<br/>
As we drove along, I got back on task and began pointing out little towns<br/>
with letterboxes.  Finally, we wound up at our hotel directly across from<br/>
the gates of The Space Center.  There was a Luby's nearby so we decided we<br/>
would indulge in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, even if it wasn't<br/>
home-cooked.  Now there we were, 200 miles from home on a holiday and eating<br/>
at a Luby's, and who should I run into but my old boss.  There are few<br/>
people in this world that I would actively avoid, but she's one of them.<br/>
Long story, not pretty, but I just don't care to see her again.  And yet,<br/>
there she was!  I knew she lived in Houston now, but I would've thought she<br/>
would have gone home to Palestine for the holiday.  I managed to steer<br/>
around her, but the irony of it struck me as funny.  She and I used to<br/>
travel extensively together and every time we were on the road together<br/>
something weird like that would happen to us.  We once busted two people -<br/>
we each knew one of them - having a tryst in Austin, where they thought they<br/>
were easily safe from prying eyes!<br/>
<br/>
We got settled into our hotel and tucked ourselves away for the night, and<br/>
while the guys watched a movie and shopped Friday morning ads, I inventoried<br/>
my LB backpack, located nearby boxes on the map, and walked to CVS for a<br/>
good map (which they didn't have) and a few supplies to round things out.  I<br/>
returned to the room to learn that Lightning and Fearless Fox had decided<br/>
that it would be good for Lightning and me to get up at 4:30 a.m. to head to<br/>
Walmart, where they were presumed to have quite a few Wii's at 5 a.m.  I<br/>
learned long ago never to miss meetings if I didn't want to get volunteered,<br/>
but I didn't know I couldn't venture away from my family for a few minutes!<br/>
Considering that Fearless Fox was getting even, I accepted my fate but put<br/>
it on Lightning to wake me up and secretly hoping his alarm wouldn't go off<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I awoke about 4:15 the next morning and realized I was just a few short<br/>
minutes from having to get up IF Lightning woke up.  I covered my head and<br/>
managed to go back to sleep, and only fainly heard the alarm and realized I<br/>
would soon be prodded out of bed.  The nudge never came!  He had slept<br/>
through the alarm.  What I first considered to be my good luck I later<br/>
learned to be my undoing.  If only I had sucked it up and gotten him out of<br/>
bed, we could almost certainly have gotten the infernal game and been done<br/>
with it so we could concentrate on finding letterboxes.  Instead he turned<br/>
up the heat for the remainder of the trip.<br/>
<br/>
Fearless Fox wouldn't get up to go pre-dawn shopping, but he did manage to<br/>
make sure we were up and rearing to go so that we arrived at The Space<br/>
Center at 9 a.m. sharp.  We were the very first guests in the door!  We<br/>
began working our way around the place, visiting new exhibits and revisiting<br/>
the old ones we knew Lightning would especially like.  By the time the place<br/>
filled up and we had spent nearly $50 for lunch, we had done everything we<br/>
wanted to do, including a mid-morning tram ride on a cold windy morning.<br/>
Bracing!  The Space Center really is a fun place to visit, but I kept<br/>
thinking that I was glad I had only one kid with me - some of the leaders in<br/>
our pack have suggested bringing the boys down there for a sleepover hosted<br/>
by the SC.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, Fearless Fox was willing to consider letterboxing.  In fact, I had<br/>
managed to get his attention by reading one of The Hoppers clues about a<br/>
Stonehenge.  He kept bringing that particular box up, so I took the hint and<br/>
suggested we try that one first.  We found our way to the park, and we were<br/>
a little skeptical when comparing our first impressions to what we had read<br/>
in the clues.  We got out of the car and began following directions,<br/>
noticing as we did that a fairly large group of presumably related people<br/>
had just arrived witha dog and a young woman with a dog was there and she<br/>
was pitching balls to the dog.<br/>
<br/>
We carefully read the inscription, and then Fearless Fox decided we should<br/>
do the labrynth, so we did.  We were intent on finding out way through, when<br/>
we discovered that one of the dogs was magic - he sensed we were in the<br/>
labrynth and came and found us.  He kept coming back over and over.  I tried<br/>
to follow him to see if he knew the correct way out, but he didn't or at<br/>
least he wasn't interested in helping.  We seemed to be pretty much<br/>
invisible to the other dog since he did nothing but chase balls and return<br/>
them to his Girl.  Finally we solved the labrynth and followed directions.<br/>
I still really don't know if I felt tranquil or dizzy, but either way, it<br/>
was a pretty cool feeling.  On we went about the clues, detouring only to go<br/>
to the echo dome where the Dog of the Balls had been barking and his Girl<br/>
had only just gotten him quiet.  When we got there, we started barking<br/>
madly, and he started barking again.  The Girl wasn't real happy with us,<br/>
but we seemed to have made friends with the Dog.<br/>
<br/>
Off we went again to look for the box, finding our way to the crop circle<br/>
thing.  From there it was no big deal to find the box, so we grabbed it and<br/>
all logged in.  Sadly, this nice little stamp is currently in three pieces,<br/>
but otherwise in great shape.  There had even been an entry earlier the same<br/>
day from someone who was just trying it out.<br/>

 trying it out. </div> <div> </div> <div>From there, we went to Challenger 7 Memorial Park.  We managed to find The Doubtful Guest, then the NASA Hitchhiker Hostel.  The hostel had quite a bit of moisture in it - I cannot for the life of me figure out how, since it is a LNL.  Because I didn't expect to find a problem, I didn't pay much attention to how it was sealed when I opened it.  Nearly every HH was anywhere from damp to wet - only the one in the film canister was good.  We wound up taking a fistful of HH's back to our hotel room to dry out and rebag, with the intention of taking them back this morning when we returned to the park.   </div> <div> </div> <div>From NASA HHH, we went on to try to find one of the two near the playground - we knew we didn't have time for both.  It was very dusky by then and I was skeptical we could find either, but Fearless Fox was determined to press on.  We were hampered by our lack of
 compass (I have GOT to get a new compass for scouts so I don't have to keep borrowing my LB compass) and extremely heavy cloud cover, but FF had connected via cell phone with a very detailed map that allowed us to orient ourselves based on landmarks we could see directly and also identify on the map - I'm talking like, we could see the playground equipment and the drainage ditch and even the path we needed to take on the web-based map. During the last moment of daylight, I memorized the remainder of the clue and we hustled ourselves on down the path in hopes we could spot trees at 20 deg.  Sure enough, there was just enough light that we were fairly certain we had spotted the location, then the question was who was going to stick their hand down a dark hole.  I was digging for my leather gloves, when FF remembered that his phone does video and so has a strong light to go with it.  He video'd our operation and illuminated it at the same time.  I
 gotta have one of those phones! </div> <div> </div> <div>We returned from whence we came, and as we emerged from the path we saw that the ranger was talking to a sheriff's deputy, both in their respective vehicles.  They were apparently sizing up our car, the only one in the parking lot, because the ranger drove across and circled it, and I'm sure took down our license plate, then returned to the deputy's car for a moment then left.  Now we knew it was only about 6:15 and the gate at the front of the park said the park hours were until 7, but it really WAS awfully dark and I couldn't imagine why anyone but a drug dealer or a letterboxer would want to be in a dark park.  Knowing we had plenty of time, Fearless Fox and I walked over to the bathroom and as we did, the deputy spotlighted us.  He must've decided we looked decent, because he didn't approach us.  We quickly took care of business and returned to our car and left.  He stayed where
 he was, apparently guarding a back entrance to the park to make sure no one else came in.  We left the park, seeing not another soul as we drove through it, and checked again as we were leaving to make sure we didn't misread the closing time, but sure enough it said 7.   </div> <div> </div> <div>After all that activity and almost having to get up at 4:30 in the morning, I was really tired, so I took a nap until 8:30 and then got up and went to work on those HH's.  Most of them were in pretty good shape, except for being damp, so I fanned them out and left them alone for the night.  A couple of them were worse off, and one of them was, for all intents and purposes, ruined.  I am still really puzzled how so much moisture got inside the LNL - all I can figure is one of the latches wasn't rsealed properly.  All of the baggies had something wrong with them - they were either tattered, or had gaps in the seal.  Some of them were
 rolled up in other containers, and sometimes rolling baggies makes them gap, but it was odd to see so many problems inside what should have been a reliable container.  It drove home to me how important it is to have a good first defense, a good backup defense, and a good layout besides.   </div> <div> </div> <div>So after being startled awake by Lightning rolling out of his bed at the infamous 4:30 a.m., we managed to go back to sleep for a little while, until we woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to do some more boxing, and work our way back to the ferry for another ride back over to the San Jacinto monument before going home via every Best Buy/Walmart/<wbr/>KMart/Target/<wbr/>Circuit City, and now, Game Stop.  I threw open the curtains in our hotel room - to see a curtain of rain falling and to feel the cold coming off the window glass.    I happily announced I had ponchos for all, and heard two groans of support.  As I was
 taking a load of stuff to our car, I rubbed my eye and tore my contact lens and that was the moment I knew our trip was over - no contact, no seeing.    No seeing, no letterboxing.  I could almost hear (cause I sure couldn't see) Lightning jumping up and down with joy since that meant more time to spend searching stores for Wii's.  FF opted to forego San Jacinto - and we headed back up to East Texas, stopping in every town with a shopping center to check for Wii's.  I had to explain to Lightning why towns like Wells and Alto don't have Walmarts.  It never occurred to him that every town doesn't have at least that!  I slept while we drove so I Fearless Fox could relax and drive instead of being startled every time I jumped because something came into my myopic vision. </div> <div> </div> <div>SO- we didn't find many boxes, but all the ones we found were worth finding.  I did wind up bringing all those HH's back home
 with me thanks to being distracted by blindness and bad weather, so I'm arranging to swap some with Hoppers to restock that HHH.  I might carve some new ones to send along, if I can get a new contact on Monday! </div> <div></div> </div> <!--End group email --> </blockquote><br/><p>

<div>No, we never did get a Wii.  If she's interested in selling it, I'm interested in buying it.  The ony reason I think they might use it more is that they walk around practicing their "Wii moves" so they won't be wiinies when they finally get their Wii.

<div>Well I just got back in town from a wonderful three day vacation (and for my family, three days is a LONG vacation!).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had originally planned to go to Ponca, AR, our new favorite hideout with lots of short (2-6 mile) but interesting hikes and a great little town deep in the mountains that you would barely notice if you weren't paying attention.  We were even going to stay in high style, renting bunks in a bunkhouse instead of camping and hammocking, as we usually do.  Unfortunately, we got that respiratory yukkiness that has been going around everywhere it seems, and Fearless Fox was the last in our house to get it.  He was barely back on his feet by Wednesday, and certainly not well enough for us to drive 8 hours and then not be able to hike (and honestly, I'm not really sure I was up for it either, even though the worst of it had run its course with me a week earlier).  Sadly, we abandoned our plans.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - there we were, we had fiercely protected four days for ourselves, set funds aside for it, and nothing to do.  Having been sick for a couple of weeks and having had a hard month schedule-wise and another hard month approaching, we were desperate to get out of town, so we decided to head to The Space Center in Houston, one of our favorite places to visit on a whim.  The last time we were there (we think) was when Columbia was flying its last mission, and we had even signed the Welcome Home card for them, which they obviously never got.  We were long overdue for a visit! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So after doing the basic planning to make the trip happen, the next thing I did was to start looking for clues for the trip down there.  Fearless Fox is usually pretty tolerant of my letterboxing on trips, but for whatever reason he didn't seem so game for making a lot of stops along the way, so even though I downloaded clues for every little town on Highway 59 between Lufkin and Houston, and threw in 'Coldspring for good measure, I wasn't banking on much more than catching a few around The Space Center.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now on this note, I have to say to you Houstonians:  I really can't seem to crack the code for grouping boxes in Houston.  Once I'm inside the loop, I'm lost as far as how to find boxes close to where I'm going to be.  To make things worse, I've actually boxed a little, or at least researched boxes, on the west side, but the east side is definitely beyond me and of course, we were staying to the east.  Consequently, I gave up trying to find boxes in Houston proper and skipped over Houston and found boxes right around Webster.  Every time I go through this exercise, I understand fully why Dewberry and others swear by AQ for locating boxes.  If the planter has used any sort of an address on their clues, it makes it very clean to look for boxes in a given area.  Anyway, I'm not complaining but if y'all ever figure out a way to index all those clues, I'm sure a lot of folks would send up cheers!  Wow.  Amazing how many boxes ar in Houston! 
<br clear="all"/><br/>As we were driving down to Houston Thursday, I made a few mild suggestions of places to stop, each coincidentally convenient to letterbox locations, but I got no response.  Finally I made one last attempt to imply the need for a detour by pointing at a green highway sign and saying, "Oh look!  There's where you exit for Coldspring".  and at the next sign,  "Coldspring, why that's where BT and LSQ live.  There are a LOT of letterboxes that way!"  And as we rolled past the cutoff, I plastered my face to the window and said "Hey, look Lightning, I think I see one of those boxes from here!"  No bites.  I gotta work on my technique. 
<br/><br/>Now I failed to mention that I wasn't the only one in the car with an agenda.  We've already gotten a little Christmas money and Lightning negotiated with Fearless Fox to go in halves on a Wii game system.  It seems like everywhere we've stopped has said they "just sold the last one."  Consequently, every time I mentioned "there's a box in this town", Lightning was also sayng something like "I wonder if they have a Best Buy/Walmart/Circuit City/Target/KMart in this town."  You can imagine that Fearless Fox was ready to put us both out on the side of the road. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, we got ourselves through Houston and I was figuring us to be checked into our hotel and ready to play by about 2 p.m. - 3 hours of boxing, more if the light held out and I pushed a bit!  Just as we cleared the south side of the loop and had ourselves pointed in the right direction, FF noticed a sign that said "San Jacinto Monument".  Earlier in the trip, when I wasn't scoping out letterboxes, he had talked about going there with his family when he was a kid.  By the time we saw that sign, I felt a little guilty about being so relentless, so I suggested we go.  I only had to say it once!  We had to make several quick turns, but we found ourselves on the road to Pasadena and he handed over his cell phone so I could get online and look to see if there were boxes at San Jacinto.  As I was quickly working on LBNA, he was bemoaning the fact we hadn't seen any more signs since the last ones and Lightning was grousing about the fact that we hadn't seen a Best Buy in quite awhile.  Just as FF was about to give up and ask directions, we spotted another sign and we made a fast right and were off and running again.  Meanwhile, I had spotted three boxes around the monument.  We whipped into the park entrance, only to find it was - CLOSED.  Closed?  Finally we remembered we were travelling on Thanksgiving and those people probably wanted to stay home.  We thought about parking and walking to the monument, but the sign didn't give us the idea that would be very smart, so we pulled away and continued down the road to drive in front of the Battleship Texas, which was also closed.  Fearless Fox showed Lightning several features about the boat and then we proceeded ahead and realized we were about to take a ferry ride if we didn't turn around.  Well - we love ferries!  It wasn't a hard decision to go ahead and jump on the ferry, so we waited in anticipation for the very small ferry boat.  Like very small.  As in - it holds about sixteen cars, in very close quarters.  Nothing like the Bolivar ferry.  We were at the very front of the boat and the water was a little choppy.  Oh well.  Too late to turn around.  We just kept reminding ourselves that we LOVE ferries.  It finally occurred to us to wonder where we were going on the ferry.  We debated asking the attendant, but opted against looking ignorant while we were captive to the boat.  It was a fun little ride and we drove happily off the boat, looking around for any indication of where we were.  We finally stopped and got a really bad map, but it was good enough for us to figure out that we could continue along and eventually swing back up toward Webster and NASA.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we drove along, I got back on task and began pointing out little towns with letterboxes.  Finally, we wound up at our hotel directly across from the gates of The Space Center.  There was a Luby's nearby so we decided we would indulge in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, even if it wasn't home-cooked.  Now there we were, 200 miles from home on a holiday and eating at a Luby's, and who should I run into but my old boss.  There are few people in this world that I would actively avoid, but she's one of them.  Long story, not pretty, but I just don't care to see her again.  And yet, there she was!  I knew she lived in Houston now, but I would've thought she would have gone home to Palestine for the holiday.  I managed to steer around her, but the irony of it struck me as funny.  She and I used to travel extensively together and every time we were on the road together something weird like that would happen to us.  We once busted two people - we each knew one of them - having a tryst in Austin, where they thought they were easily safe from prying eyes! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got settled into our hotel and tucked ourselves away for the night, and while the guys watched a movie and shopped Friday morning ads, I inventoried my LB backpack, located nearby boxes on the map, and walked to CVS for a good map (which they didn't have) and a few supplies to round things out.  I returned to the room to learn that Lightning and Fearless Fox had decided that it would be good for Lightning and me to get up at 4:30 
a.m. to head to Walmart, where they were presumed to have quite a few Wii's at 5 a.m.  I learned long ago never to miss meetings if I didn't want to get volunteered, but I didn't know I couldn't venture away from my family for a few minutes!  Considering that Fearless Fox was getting even, I accepted my fate but put it on Lightning to wake me up and secretly hoping his alarm wouldn't go off  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I awoke about 4:15 the next morning and realized I was just a few short minutes from having to get up IF Lightning woke up.  I covered my head and managed to go back to sleep, and only fainly heard the alarm and realized I would soon be prodded out of bed.  The nudge never came!  He had slept through the alarm.  What I first considered to be my good luck I later learned to be my undoing.  If only I had sucked it up and gotten him out of bed, we could almost certainly have gotten the infernal game and been done with it so we could concentrate on finding letterboxes.  Instead he turned up the heat for the remainder of the trip. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox wouldn't get up to go pre-dawn shopping, but he did manage to make sure we were up and rearing to go so that we arrived at The Space Center at 9 a.m. sharp.  We were the very first guests in the door!  We began working our way around the place, visiting new exhibits and revisiting the old ones we knew Lightning would especially like.  By the time the place filled up and we had spent nearly $50 for lunch, we had done everything we wanted to do, including a mid-morning tram ride on a cold windy morning.  Bracing!  The Space Center really is a fun place to visit, but I kept thinking that I was glad I had only one kid with me - some of the leaders in our pack have suggested bringing the boys down there for a sleepover hosted by the SC.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, Fearless Fox was willing to consider letterboxing.  In fact, I had managed to get his attention by reading one of The Hoppers clues about a Stonehenge.  He kept bringing that particular box up, so I took the hint and suggested we try that one first.  We found our way to the park, and we were a little skeptical when comparing our first impressions to what we had read in the clues.  We got out of the car and began following directions, noticing as we did that a fairly large group of presumably related people had just arrived witha dog and a young woman with a dog was there and she was pitching balls to the dog.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We carefully read the inscription, and then Fearless Fox decided we should do the labrynth, so we did.  We were intent on finding out way through, when we discovered that one of the dogs was magic - he sensed we were in the labrynth and came and found us.  He kept coming back over and over.  I tried to follow him to see if he knew the correct way out, but he didn't or at least he wasn't interested in helping.  We seemed to be pretty much invisible to the other dog since he did nothing but chase balls and return them to his Girl.  Finally we solved the labrynth and followed directions.  I still really don't know if I felt tranquil or dizzy, but either way, it was a pretty cool feeling.  On we went about the clues, detouring only to go to the echo dome where the Dog of the Balls had been barking and his Girl had only just gotten him quiet.  When we got there, we started barking madly, and he started barking again.  The Girl wasn't real happy with us, but we seemed to have made friends with the Dog. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Off we went again to look for the box, finding our way to the crop circle thing.  From there it was no big deal to find the box, so we grabbed it and all logged in.  Sadly, this nice little stamp is currently in three pieces, but otherwise in great shape.  There had even been an entry earlier the same day from someone who was just trying it out. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>From there, we went to Challenger 7 Memorial Park.  We managed to find The Doubtful Guest, then the NASA Hitchhiker Hostel.  The hostel had quite a bit of moisture in it - I cannot for the life of me figure out how, since it is a LNL.  Because I didn't expect to find a problem, I didn't pay much attention to how it was sealed when I opened it.  Nearly every HH was anywhere from damp to wet - only the one in the film canister was good.  We wound up taking a fistful of HH's back to our hotel room to dry out and rebag, with the intention of taking them back this morning when we returned to the park.  
</div>
<div> </div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO- we didn't find many boxes, but all the ones we found were worth finding.  I did wind up bringing all those HH's back home with me thanks to being distracted by blindness and bad weather, so I'm arranging to swap some with Hoppers to restock that HHH.  I might carve some new ones to send along, if I can get a new contact on Monday!

<div></div> <div>Well I just got back in town from a wonderful three day vacation (and for my family, three days is a LONG vacation!).</div> <div> </div> <div>We had originally planned to go to Ponca, AR, our new favorite hideout with lots of short (2-6 mile) but interesting hikes and a great little town deep in the mountains that you would barely notice if you weren't paying attention.  We were even going to stay in high style, renting bunks in a bunkhouse instead of camping and hammocking, as we usually do.  Unfortunately, we got that respiratory yukkiness that has been going around everywhere it seems, and Fearless Fox was the last in our house to get it.  He was barely back on his feet by Wednesday, and certainly not well enough for us to drive 8 hours and then not be able to hike (and honestly, I'm not really sure I was up for it either, even though the worst of it had run its course with me a week earlier).  Sadly, we abandoned our
 plans.   </div> <div> </div> <div>BUT - there we were, we had fiercely protected four days for ourselves, set funds aside for it, and nothing to do.  Having been sick for a couple of weeks and having had a hard month schedule-wise and another hard month approaching, we were desperate to get out of town, so we decided to head to The Space Center in Houston, one of our favorite places to visit on a whim.  The last time we were there (we think) was when Columbia was flying its last mission, and we had even signed the Welcome Home card for them, which they obviously never got.  We were long overdue for a visit!  </div> <div> </div> <div>So after doing the basic planning to make the trip happen, the next thing I did was to start looking for clues for the trip down there.  Fearless Fox is usually pretty tolerant of my letterboxing on trips, but for whatever reason he didn't seem so game for making a lot of stops along the way, so even
 though I downloaded clues for every little town on Highway 59 between Lufkin and Houston, and threw in 'Coldspring for good measure, I wasn't banking on much more than catching a few around The Space Center.   </div> <div> </div> <div>Now on this note, I have to say to you Houstonians:  I really can't seem to crack the code for grouping boxes in Houston.  Once I'm inside the loop, I'm lost as far as how to find boxes close to where I'm going to be.  To make things worse, I've actually boxed a little, or at least researched boxes, on the west side, but the east side is definitely beyond me and of course, we were staying to the east.  Consequently, I gave up trying to find boxes in Houston proper and skipped over Houston and found boxes right around Webster.  Every time I go through this exercise, I understand fully why Dewberry and others swear by AQ for locating boxes.  If the planter has used any sort of an address on their clues,
 it makes it very clean to look for boxes in a given area.  Anyway, I'm not complaining but if y'all ever figure out a way to index all those clues, I'm sure a lot of folks would send up cheers!  Wow.  Amazing how many boxes ar in Houston!  <br clear="all"/><br/>As we were driving down to Houston Thursday, I made a few mild suggestions of places to stop, each coincidentally convenient to letterbox locations, but I got no response.  Finally I made one last attempt to imply the need for a detour by pointing at a green highway sign and saying, "Oh look!  There's where you exit for Coldspring".  and at the next sign,  "Coldspring, why that's where BT and LSQ live.  There are a LOT of letterboxes that way!"  And as we rolled past the cutoff, I plastered my face to the window and said "Hey, look Lightning, I think I see one of those boxes from here!"  No bites.  I gotta work on my technique.  <br/><br/>Now I failed to mention
 that I wasn't the only one in the car with an agenda.  We've already gotten a little Christmas money and Lightning negotiated with Fearless Fox to go in halves on a Wii game system.  It seems like everywhere we've stopped has said they "just sold the last one."  Consequently, every time I mentioned "there's a box in this town", Lightning was also sayng something like "I wonder if they have a Best Buy/Walmart/<wbr/>Circuit City/Target/<wbr/>KMart in this town."  You can imagine that Fearless Fox was ready to put us both out on the side of the road.  </div> <div> </div> <div>So anyway, we got ourselves through Houston and I was figuring us to be checked into our hotel and ready to play by about 2 p.m. - 3 hours of boxing, more if the light held out and I pushed a bit!  Just as we cleared the south side of the loop and had ourselves pointed in the right direction, FF noticed a sign that said "San Jacinto Monument".  Earlier in the trip, when I
 wasn't scoping out letterboxes, he had talked about going there with his family when he was a kid.  By the time we saw that sign, I felt a little guilty about being so relentless, so I suggested we go.  I only had to say it once!  We had to make several quick turns, but we found ourselves on the road to Pasadena and he handed over his cell phone so I could get online and look to see if there were boxes at San Jacinto.  As I was quickly working on LBNA, he was bemoaning the fact we hadn't seen any more signs since the last ones and Lightning was grousing about the fact that we hadn't seen a Best Buy in quite awhile.  Just as FF was about to give up and ask directions, we spotted another sign and we made a fast right and were off and running again.  Meanwhile, I had spotted three boxes around the monument.  We whipped into the park entrance, only to find it was - CLOSED.  Closed?  Finally we remembered we were travelling on
 Thanksgiving and those people probably wanted to stay home.  We thought about parking and walking to the monument, but the sign didn't give us the idea that would be very smart, so we pulled away and continued down the road to drive in front of the Battleship Texas, which was also closed.  Fearless Fox showed Lightning several features about the boat and then we proceeded ahead and realized we were about to take a ferry ride if we didn't turn around.  Well - we love ferries!  It wasn't a hard decision to go ahead and jump on the ferry, so we waited in anticipation for the very small ferry boat.  Like very small.  As in - it holds about sixteen cars, in very close quarters.  Nothing like the Bolivar ferry.  We were at the very front of the boat and the water was a little choppy.  Oh well.  Too late to turn around.  We just kept reminding ourselves that we LOVE ferries.  It finally occurred to us to wonder
 where we were going on the ferry.  We debated asking the attendant, but opted against looking ignorant while we were captive to the boat.  It was a fun little ride and we drove happily off the boat, looking around for any indication of where we were.  We finally stopped and got a really bad map, but it was good enough for us to figure out that we could continue along and eventually swing back up toward Webster and NASA.   </div> <div> </div> <div>As we drove along, I got back on task and began pointing out little towns with letterboxes.  Finally, we wound up at our hotel directly across from the gates of The Space Center.  There was a Luby's nearby so we decided we would indulge in a traditional Thanksgiving dinner, even if it wasn't home-cooked.  Now there we were, 200 miles from home on a holiday and eating at a Luby's, and who should I run into but my old boss.  There are few people in this world that I would actively avoid,
 but she's one of them.  Long story, not pretty, but I just don't care to see her again.  And yet, there she was!  I knew she lived in Houston now, but I would've thought she would have gone home to Palestine for the holiday.  I managed to steer around her, but the irony of it struck me as funny.  She and I used to travel extensively together and every time we were on the road together something weird like that would happen to us.  We once busted two people - we each knew one of them - having a tryst in Austin, where they thought they were easily safe from prying eyes!  </div> <div> </div> <div>We got settled into our hotel and tucked ourselves away for the night, and while the guys watched a movie and shopped Friday morning ads, I inventoried my LB backpack, located nearby boxes on the map, and walked to CVS for a good map (which they didn't have) and a few supplies to round things out.  I returned to the room to learn
 that Lightning and Fearless Fox had decided that it would be good for Lightning and me to get up at 4:30  a.m. to head to Walmart, where they were presumed to have quite a few Wii's at 5 a.m.  I learned long ago never to miss meetings if I didn't want to get volunteered, but I didn't know I couldn't venture away from my family for a few minutes!  Considering that Fearless Fox was getting even, I accepted my fate but put it on Lightning to wake me up and secretly hoping his alarm wouldn't go off   </div> <div> </div> <div>I awoke about 4:15 the next morning and realized I was just a few short minutes from having to get up IF Lightning woke up.  I covered my head and managed to go back to sleep, and only fainly heard the alarm and realized I would soon be prodded out of bed.  The nudge never came!  He had slept through the alarm.  What I first considered to be my good luck I later learned to be my undoing.  If only I had
 sucked it up and gotten him out of bed, we could almost certainly have gotten the infernal game and been done with it so we could concentrate on finding letterboxes.  Instead he turned up the heat for the remainder of the trip.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Fearless Fox wouldn't get up to go pre-dawn shopping, but he did manage to make sure we were up and rearing to go so that we arrived at The Space Center at 9 a.m. sharp.  We were the very first guests in the door!  We began working our way around the place, visiting new exhibits and revisiting the old ones we knew Lightning would especially like.  By the time the place filled up and we had spent nearly $50 for lunch, we had done everything we wanted to do, including a mid-morning tram ride on a cold windy morning.  Bracing!  The Space Center really is a fun place to visit, but I kept thinking that I was glad I had only one kid with me - some of the leaders in our pack have suggested
 bringing the boys down there for a sleepover hosted by the SC.   </div> <div> </div> <div>Finally, Fearless Fox was willing to consider letterboxing.  In fact, I had managed to get his attention by reading one of The Hoppers clues about a Stonehenge.  He kept bringing that particular box up, so I took the hint and suggested we try that one first.  We found our way to the park, and we were a little skeptical when comparing our first impressions to what we had read in the clues.  We got out of the car and began following directions, noticing as we did that a fairly large group of presumably related people had just arrived witha dog and a young woman with a dog was there and she was pitching balls to the dog.   </div> <div> </div> <div>We carefully read the inscription, and then Fearless Fox decided we should do the labrynth, so we did.  We were intent on finding out way through, when we discovered that one of the dogs was magic -
 he sensed we were in the labrynth and came and found us.  He kept coming back over and over.  I tried to follow him to see if he knew the correct way out, but he didn't or at least he wasn't interested in helping.  We seemed to be pretty much invisible to the other dog since he did nothing but chase balls and return them to his Girl.  Finally we solved the labrynth and followed directions.  I still really don't know if I felt tranquil or dizzy, but either way, it was a pretty cool feeling.  On we went about the clues, detouring only to go to the echo dome where the Dog of the Balls had been barking and his Girl had only just gotten him quiet.  When we got there, we started barking madly, and he started barking again.  The Girl wasn't real happy with us, but we seemed to have made friends with the Dog.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Off we went again to look for the box, finding our way to the crop circle thing.  From
 there it was no big deal to find the box, so we grabbed it and all logged in.  Sadly, this nice little stamp is currently in three pieces, but otherwise in great shape.  There had even been an entry earlier the same day from someone who was just trying it out.  </div> <div> </div> <div>From there, we went to Challenger 7 Memorial Park.  We managed to find The Doubtful Guest, then the NASA Hitchhiker Hostel.  The hostel had quite a bit of moisture in it - I cannot for the life of me figure out how, since it is a LNL.  Because I didn't expect to find a problem, I didn't pay much attention to how it was sealed when I opened it.  Nearly every HH was anywhere from damp to wet - only the one in the film canister was good.  We wound up taking a fistful of HH's back to our hotel room to dry out and rebag, with the intention of taking them back this morning when we returned to the park.   </div> <div> </div> <div>From NASA HHH, we
 went on to try to find one of the two near the playground - we knew we didn't have time for both.  It was very dusky by then and I was skeptical we could find either, but Fearless Fox was determined to press on.  We were hampered by our lack of compass (I have GOT to get a new compass for scouts so I don't have to keep borrowing my LB compass) and extremely heavy cloud cover, but FF had connected via cell phone with a very detailed map that allowed us to orient ourselves based on landmarks we could see directly and also identify on the map - I'm talking like, we could see the playground equipment and the drainage ditch and even the path we needed to take on the web-based map. During the last moment of daylight, I memorized the remainder of the clue and we hustled ourselves on down the path in hopes we could spot trees at 20 deg.  Sure enough, there was just enough light that we were fairly certain we had spotted the location, then the question was who
 was going to stick their hand down a dark hole.  I was digging for my leather gloves, when FF remembered that his phone does video and so has a strong light to go with it.  He video'd our operation and illuminated it at the same time.  I gotta have one of those phones!  </div> <div> </div> <div>We returned from whence we came, and as we emerged from the path we saw that the ranger was talking to a sheriff's deputy, both in their respective vehicles.  They were apparently sizing up our car, the only one in the parking lot, because the ranger drove across and circled it, and I'm sure took down our license plate, then returned to the deputy's car for a moment then left.  Now we knew it was only about 6:15 and the gate at the front of the park said the park hours were until 7, but it really WAS awfully dark and I couldn't imagine why anyone but a drug dealer or a letterboxer would want to be in a dark park.  Knowing we had plenty of time,
 Fearless Fox and I walked over to the bathroom and as we did, the deputy spotlighted us.  He must've decided we looked decent, because he didn't approach us.  We quickly took care of business and returned to our car and left.  He stayed where he was, apparently guarding a back entrance to the park to make sure no one else came in.  We left the park, seeing not another soul as we drove through it, and checked again as we were leaving to make sure we didn't misread the closing time, but sure enough it said 7.   </div> <div> </div> <div>After all that activity and almost having to get up at 4:30 in the morning, I was really tired, so I took a nap until 8:30 and then got up and went to work on those HH's.  Most of them were in pretty good shape, except for being damp, so I fanned them out and left them alone for the night.  A couple of them were worse off, and one of them was, for all intents and purposes, ruined.  I am
 still really puzzled how so much moisture got inside the LNL - all I can figure is one of the latches wasn't rsealed properly.  All of the baggies had something wrong with them - they were either tattered, or had gaps in the seal.  Some of them were rolled up in other containers, and sometimes rolling baggies makes them gap, but it was odd to see so many problems inside what should have been a reliable container.  It drove home to me how important it is to have a good first defense, a good backup defense, and a good layout besides.   </div> <div> </div> <div>So after being startled awake by Lightning rolling out of his bed at the infamous 4:30 a.m., we managed to go back to sleep for a little while, until we woke up bright-eyed and bushy-tailed, ready to do some more boxing, and work our way back to the ferry for another ride back over to the San Jacinto monument before going home via every Best Buy/Walmart/<wbr/>KMart/Target/<wbr/>Circuit City, and
 now, Game Stop.  I threw open the curtains in our hotel room - to see a curtain of rain falling and to feel the cold coming off the window glass.    I happily announced I had ponchos for all, and heard two groans of support.  As I was taking a load of stuff to our car, I rubbed my eye and tore my contact lens and that was the moment I knew our trip was over - no contact, no seeing.    No seeing, no letterboxing.  I could almost hear (cause I sure couldn't see) Lightning jumping up and down with joy since that meant more time to spend searching stores for Wii's.  FF opted to forego San Jacinto - and we headed back up to East Texas, stopping in every town with a shopping center to check for Wii's.  I had to explain to Lightning why towns like Wells and Alto don't have Walmarts.  It never occurred to him that every town doesn't have at least that!  I slept while we drove so I Fearless Fox could relax and
 drive instead of being startled every time I jumped because something came into my myopic vision.  </div> <div> </div> <div>SO- we didn't find many boxes, but all the ones we found were worth finding.  I did wind up bringing all those HH's back home with me thanks to being distracted by blindness and bad weather, so I'm arranging to swap some with Hoppers to restock that HHH.  I might carve some new ones to send along, if I can get a new contact on Monday!  </div> <div></div></div></blockquote><br/></div></div> <div> </div><hr size="1"/> Get easy, one-click access to your favorites. <a href="http://us.rd.yahoo.com/evt=51443/*http://www.yahoo.com/r/hs" target="_blank">Make Yahoo! your homepage.</a> <div></div> <div></div><div></div><div></div></div><span width="1"></span> </div></div></div></blockquote></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"  <div></div> </div>
