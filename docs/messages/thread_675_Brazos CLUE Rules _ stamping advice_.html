work-in-progress as our family tries to debate the best way to do this! <br>
<br>
One note: If you enjoy coloring your stamp image with markers, you may want<br>
to just bring a black ink pad and stamp quickly - save the coloring for<br>
later! From what I hear of Monster Mash, that was a small complaint - folks<br>
who were taking quite a while with artistic touches!<br>
Some of the stamps submitted would lend themselves very nicely to stamping<br>
with black, and using markers or wooden colors later. Some are solid images,<br>
and would lend themselves to stamping with solid colors. <br>
We will provide an ink pad with each stamp, but no guarantees that it will<br>
be your favorite color!<br>
