                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I had a busy weekend boxing. My family thinks I am crazier than <br>
ever. Just wanted to let you know about some boxes.<br>
<br>
Super Frogger: CUTE! but a little damp<br>
<br>
Corpus Porpiose: Missing, found the rocks, no box.<br>
<br>
Coral Snake: Found it, didn't get bit.<br>
<br>
Texas Turtle: Found, however... email me for more info<br>
<br>
Music Man: Found, aquired 100 new thorn scratches, thanks.<br>
<br>
Light Catcher: Found, ran into a gathering of people in the woods, <br>
it looked like a wedding perhaps, or a fairy circle? People with <br>
ribbons and flowers in their hair and bubbles and confetti and <br>
sparkles... A very interesting experience with them looking at me <br>
like, What are you doing here! They each carried a wand, or a <br>
walking stick festooned with ribbons, and they looked at my plain <br>
stick, used for poking in holes before removing boxes, like it had <br>
forgotten to get dressed before going out today. It was quite a <br>
surreal experience, but I promise I did not dream it. By the time I <br>
got back to the parking lot they had all changed and gotten into <br>
very normal vehicles and headed back to the real world. Had to be <br>
very discreet recovering the box.<br>
<br>
Rest In Peace #2: Found in good condition<br>
<br>
Celtic Flower: Missing...<br>
<br>
Thanks to everyone<br>
<br>
WOW<br>
