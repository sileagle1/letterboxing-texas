                    <html><body><p>The latest feature added is the ability to "star" boxes you want to remember to look for later instead of having to print them and store in a binder (my binder is HUGE with many out-dated clues).  You just click on Status button of the clue and select Reminder as the status, then click Submit Changes and it will add a star to the left of the clue (you must be logged in).  You can also list all your "star" boxes by clicking the Letterboxes tab on the main page and selecting My Starred Letterboxes.  You can remove "stars" by selecting Remove as the status.<br/><br/>Another feature I have found useful is the ability to look at Most Recently Listed Letterboxes on the main page.  You can select More at the bottom and it will go to a page that lets you refine the listing by:  number of boxes displayed, state, and/or region.  Once you have clicked on a clue you are interested in you can then click on the Nearby button to see a list of other boxes in the area.  Since I was gone for so long this summer, this was a great way for me to see all the latest boxes placed in TX.  A similar feature will soon be available for Most Recommended Clues, which is something PI Joe wanted.  <br/><br/>Have fun trying these out and let me or Choi know of any problems or other features you would like to see.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>
