<div>I've been waiting and waiting for cooler weather to make that 3-mile round 
trip hike to find all of PuddleSplasher's Moose Series, but no, this was the 
day!  First we found Rather Be Paddlin' (and watching those out on the lake 
doing that, I'd definitely rather have been paddlin'!).  Then we trekked 
the north shore of Lake Grapevine, extending the hike another half-mile because 
PS told me (it's really level for the next little bit, and just a short walk to 
the Nature Center Trail, so we might as well, while we're already here.  
Never believe her, by the way.  It was up and down and up and down and NOT 
a short walk, but still, very scenic, and thankfully most of that trail is 
actually in the shade (a blessing!) and there were occasional sort-of breezes 
off the lake, plus the occasional friendly swipe of wet dog passing by after a 
short swim to cool off (wish it had been me!).  Forgot the part in her 
clues about taking fruit or trailmix bars, but did have plenty of water, so it 
wasn't really so bad.  And I did finally get to find all of those Moose 
boxes.  This is a great series, the clues have funny backstories and the 
stamps as always with PS are really little works of art, so it was a good 
morning.  And here's another good part:  maybe I lost 5 lbs on that 
trail, who knows!  I'm not checking, I'm just believing it must be 
so.  If you haven't made that hike, go prepared, but go.  It's worth 
it, even if you do decide to wait for cooler weather.  (And she did replace 
the missing #4 box on this hike today).  </div>
