the subtleties of l'boxing! Family B finally moves along and I can re-<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last April, my husband (Whiz Gee) and I went to find the box "Sakura" <br>
in the same park, and discovered that Sakura's hiding place is <br>
apparently the number one spot in Austin to get one's picture taken <br>
for prom.  After we had found the box and opened it, we endured wave <br>
after wave of badly tuxedoed/shimmery dressed teenage couples, posing <br>
on the bridge in front of us with their parents snapping picture <br>
after picture.  10-20-30 -- we started wondering if they had all come <br>
on a bus!  Still, we stubbornly claimed our bench, waiting for a <br>
break in the action so we could re-hide the box.  After 20 minutes or <br>
so, we called Lionsmane, the planter of the box, and described what <br>
was happening as it happened, including a fashion description of each <br>
outfit.  We all couldn't help laughing our heads off.  Finally, the <br>
coast was clear for a brief moment, and Whiz Gee quickly re-hid the <br>
box.  As we walked back through the park, we encountered at least <br>
another 30 teens headed for the bridge!  The second bus, maybe?  We <br>
wondered if Lionsmane should alter his clue to read, "Avoid prom time <br>
of the year"!  Definately one of our funnier finds! -- Bell Motel<br>

<p>Last April, my husband (Whiz Gee) and I went to find the box "Sakura" <br/>in the same park, and discovered that Sakura's hiding place is <br/>apparently the number one spot in Austin to get one's picture taken <br/>
for prom. After we had found the box and opened it, we endured wave <br/>after wave of badly tuxedoed/shimmery dressed teenage couples, posing <br/>on the bridge in front of us with their parents snapping picture <br/>after picture. 10-20-30 -- we started wondering if they had all come <br/>
on a bus! Still, we stubbornly claimed our bench, waiting for a <br/>break in the action so we could re-hide the box. After 20 minutes or <br/>so, we called Lionsmane, the planter of the box, and described what <br/>was happening as it happened, including a fashion description of each <br/>
outfit. We all couldn't help laughing our heads off. Finally, the <br/>coast was clear for a brief moment, and Whiz Gee quickly re-hid the <br/>box. As we walked back through the park, we encountered at least <br/>another 30 teens headed for the bridge! The second bus, maybe? We <br/>
wondered if Lionsmane should alter his clue to read, "Avoid prom time <br/>of the year"! Definately one of our funnier finds! -- Bell Motel<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Mary Jo" &lt;mjrekedal@...&gt; <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I had a similiar experience in the "Children's Park" in Tyler.  The <br>
time of year was mid November and there must have been at least a <br>
dozen different groups of families come there to have their family <br>
pictures taken for their Christmas cards. Plus, there was a couple <br>
having their wedding pictures taken.  I spent at least one hour just <br>
waiting for the coast to clear so I could stamp and rehid the <br>
letterbox.<br>
