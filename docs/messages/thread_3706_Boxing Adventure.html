<div>Great story, Bloomin Gramma Jo! I felt like I was right along with you. I think the most frustrating situation I had like that was when we had driven to the end of the earth to find a box, and a man was standing on the very rock we needed to explore. He was peacefully fishing, and we could tell he might hang in there for hours so we had to come back to that one a few weeks later. It's almost comical when that happens.... almost.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last April, my husband (Whiz Gee) and I went to find the box "Sakura" <br/>
in the same park, and discovered that Sakura's hiding place is <br/>
apparently the number one spot in Austin to get one's picture taken <br/>
for prom.  After we had found the box and opened it, we endured wave <br/>
after wave of badly tuxedoed/shimmery dressed teenage couples, posing <br/>
on the bridge in front of us with their parents snapping picture <br/>
after picture.  10-20-30 -- we started wondering if they had all come <br/>
on a bus!  Still, we stubbornly claimed our bench, waiting for a <br/>
break in the action so we could re-hide the box.  After 20 minutes or <br/>
so, we called Lionsmane, the planter of the box, and described what <br/>
was happening as it happened, including a fashion description of each <br/>
outfit.  We all couldn't help laughing our heads off.  Finally, the <br/>
coast was clear for a brief moment, and Whiz Gee quickly re-hid the <br/>
box.  As we walked back through the park, we encountered at least <br/>
another 30 teens headed for the bridge!  The second bus, maybe?  We <br/>
wondered if Lionsmane should alter his clue to read, "Avoid prom time <br/>
of the year"!  Definately one of our funnier finds! -- Bell Motel<br/>

<p>Last April, my husband (Whiz Gee) and I went to find the box "Sakura" <br/>in the same park, and discovered that Sakura's hiding place is <br/>apparently the number one spot in Austin to get one's picture taken <br/>
for prom. After we had found the box and opened it, we endured wave <br/>after wave of badly tuxedoed/shimmery dressed teenage couples, posing <br/>on the bridge in front of us with their parents snapping picture <br/>after picture. 10-20-30 -- we started wondering if they had all come <br/>
on a bus! Still, we stubbornly claimed our bench, waiting for a <br/>break in the action so we could re-hide the box. After 20 minutes or <br/>so, we called Lionsmane, the planter of the box, and described what <br/>was happening as it happened, including a fashion description of each <br/>
outfit. We all couldn't help laughing our heads off. Finally, the <br/>coast was clear for a brief moment, and Whiz Gee quickly re-hid the <br/>box. As we walked back through the park, we encountered at least <br/>another 30 teens headed for the bridge! The second bus, maybe? We <br/>
wondered if Lionsmane should alter his clue to read, "Avoid prom time <br/>of the year"! Definately one of our funnier finds! -- Bell Motel<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Mary Jo" &lt;mjrekedal@...&gt; <br/>

&gt; in the same park, and discovered that Sakura's hiding place is <br/>
&gt; apparently the number one spot in Austin to get one's picture taken <br/>
&gt; for prom.  After we had found the box and opened it, we endured <br/>
wave <br/>
&gt; after wave of badly tuxedoed/shimmery dressed teenage couples, <br/>
posing <br/>
&gt; on the bridge in front of us with their parents snapping picture <br/>
&gt; after picture.  10-20-30 -- we started wondering if they had all <br/>
come <br/>
&gt; on a bus!  Still, we stubbornly claimed our bench, waiting for a <br/>
&gt; break in the action so we could re-hide the box.  After 20 minutes <br/>
or <br/>
&gt; so, we called Lionsmane, the planter of the box, and described what <br/>
&gt; was happening as it happened, including a fashion description of <br/>
each <br/>
&gt; outfit.  We all couldn't help laughing our heads off.  Finally, the <br/>
&gt; coast was clear for a brief moment, and Whiz Gee quickly re-hid the <br/>
&gt; box.  As we walked back through the park, we encountered at least <br/>
&gt; another 30 teens headed for the bridge!  The second bus, maybe?  We <br/>
&gt; wondered if Lionsmane should alter his clue to read, "Avoid prom <br/>
time <br/>
&gt; of the year"!  Definately one of our funnier finds! -- Bell Motel<br/>

&gt; &gt; So Bird Dog and I decided to venture out in the hot Texas <br/>
afternoon <br/>
&gt; &gt; to locate a new box, Love &amp; Friendship. Back pack loaded and <br/>
water <br/>
&gt; &gt; bottle filled, we arrived at park and found hiding spot bench <br/>
only <br/>
&gt; &gt; mildly sweaty. But said bench was occupied with a couple enjoying <br/>
&gt; &gt; their own form of love and friendship! We dauddled, admired the <br/>
&gt; &gt; surroundings, examined the flora with intense interest, even <br/>
&gt; &gt; considered feigning exhaustion with need to sit on the other end <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; the bench (am I that duplicitous? Yes, I do confess!) But finally <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; family with boisterous boys came along, shouting, running, <br/>
jumping--<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; activity I would normally frown upon, but inwardly welcomed that <br/>
&gt; day. <br/>
&gt; &gt; Friendly Couple decided to move on to a more secluded bench. And <br/>
&gt; &gt; boisterous boys ran off in search of more adventure farther along.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Retrieved box, admired a truly gorgeous carving, learned some <br/>
&gt; &gt; Japanese word origins (thanks for that added bonus, AnnaBee), and <br/>
&gt; &gt; ready to re-hide. When along comes Family B with baby in <br/>
stroller, <br/>
&gt; a <br/>
&gt; &gt; Bird Dog magnet. He loves babies even more than I. He admires <br/>
baby <br/>
&gt; &gt; and strikes up conversation with mommy while daddy takes numerous <br/>
&gt; &gt; pics of surroundings. I sit patiently, again feigning interest. <br/>
Oh, <br/>
&gt; &gt; the subtleties of l'boxing! Family B finally moves along and I <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; re-<br/>
&gt; &gt; hide unobserved. Day's count: one box in one hour, consuming one <br/>
&gt; &gt; bottle of H2O. And every minute worth it all! <br/>
&gt; &gt; Happy boxing,all, even in the heat!<br/>
