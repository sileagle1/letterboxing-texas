for months.  We managed to get one of those planted today--Hoppin'<br/>
High--at Hester Garden Park in Seabrook, TX today.  This park was<br/>
gorgeous.  Plus, we were able to do some letterboxing at the San<br/>
Jacinto Battleground and in Seabrook, so all around it was a marvelous<br/>
day.<br/>
<br/>
This completely ready box had ridden around either in the car or the<br/>
backpack for about 7 months, so I'm sure it's glad to be out in the<br/>
woods now.<br/>
<br/>
Sad, huh?  But I can beat my own record--I have one that has been<br/>
ready to plant since last February--maybe it too will get out there<br/>
sometime soon.<br/>

<div>If you come to Houston this weekend, be prepared for road closures around the downtown, Galleria, Memorial Park area on Sunday!  It is the Houston Marathon ( <a href="http://www.houstonmarathon.com">www.houstonmarathon.com</a>) and lots of runners, including myself, will be out running the streets. WooHoo!! You can go to the marathon website for a course map and see where the streets will be closed.  Additionally, spectators are always welcome along the course route.  If you have never been to a marathon, it can be very entertaining!  Feel free to come out and cheer the runners on.  You never know when words of encouragement may be exactly what a runner needs.  Many runners write their name on their arms, legs, shirt etc...so that you can cheer specifically for them!</div>
