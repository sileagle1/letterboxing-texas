                    <html><body><p>This is shocking news indeed, if it were true.   I am
left to wonder “Who are the Renegades, and why have they chosen to attack me
like this?”  I suspect that Baby Bear
paid these unsavory characters to lie about me just to make this look like a
hate crime.  Not that I don’t hate bears,
but it sounds like something he would do. 
First, there are several things in this story that are obviously wrong.  1. I am a SPIRIT! I am not flesh
and blood.  Why would I have any interest
in a business that profits on crimes of the flesh?  2.  I never
set foot in the state of Florida in my lifetime.  Why would I do so after my death?  3.  I
was caught on camera?  I AM A GHOST!  I cannot be photographed.  4.  Why
would Florida law enforcement officials want to ban me from Texas, even if the
allegations had any merit?  I rest my
case.  I ask that you ignore this
letterbox.  I doubt that it even exists.  The Renegades only want you to be implicated
in  falsely reporting a crime, which
happens to be a felony.</p>
