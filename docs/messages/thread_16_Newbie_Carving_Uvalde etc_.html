                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Connie, welcome to letterboxing! <br>
<br>
I agree with Barefoot Lucy.... Hobby Lobby is the best place to go <br>
around my area for carving tools and carving medium. When I started, <br>
I bought 'the pink stuff', and the small package I bought came with <br>
a carving tool too. I didn't do all that great... made my signature <br>
stamp (Busy Bee), which my kids laughed at and said it looks more <br>
like 'Drunken Bee'. Actually, they were right, but I am still using <br>
it anyway. ;)<br>
<br>
Then I found the Staedter(sp?) Master Carve which says it 'cuts like <br>
butter' - which it really does. That is what I prefer. But Hobby <br>
Lobby (Calallen and Corpus Christi) has sold out (months ago) of all <br>
of their stock except the very thick blocks which I hate to pay $7-<br>
something for, when I want the not quite as thick square blocks I <br>
used to get. A few days ago, I bought some new 'cream colored stuff' <br>
made by the 'pink stuff' makers, which says it is new and improved <br>
and easy to carve. I haven't tried it yet though....and I wish it <br>
wasn't as thin and bendable as it is. <br>
<br>
After awhile, I found that I prefered to use an exacto-knife for <br>
stamp carving. And then use the carving tool only on the areas that <br>
I want to look 'hand carved' in the stamped image. <br>
<br>
I think I have heard of letterboxers using a dremel tool for some of <br>
their stamp carving. Maybe do a search for 'dremel' on the LbNA list.<br>
<br>
I'd be glad to get together with anyone to show them my materials, <br>
share my tools and carve together. I'm in Skidmore though, and my <br>
van is STILL in the shop getting a new engine. I do have my <br>
husband's pick-up after about 7 each evening, and on most Fridays or <br>
weekends. Would anyone like to get together? <br>
<br>
Susan, I'd love to help you scout out the Uvalde area, if my <br>
available time fits with your schedule. I have to be home each day <br>
by about 3:15 to be here when our granddaughter gets home from <br>
school. I do have Fridays free, IF my husband is not working, so he <br>
can be here for her. And Saturday's all day... and Sunday <br>
afternoons. I don't know if that is enough time, or if it fits with <br>
the days you'd rather do it, though. <br>
<br>

south,  about half way between SA and Corpus.  There are quite a few <br>
letterboxes around Goliad (26 miles east of Beeville) at the <br>
missions.  These are great places to visit and "live" Texas <br>
history.  I haven't looked for the LB's yet, but hope to soon.  I <br>
guess I'll have to plant some around Crystal City (of Popeye and <br>
spinach fame) and around Uvalde and get people headed this direction.<br>

I'm new to this, too.  I've only found one LB so far and have placed <br>
none. I'm a type A personality, but hadn't really thought about <br>
keeping track.  Guess I'd better get back on "track" with the <br>
personality type...lol.  My biggest challenge right now is having to <br>
carve stamps!!!  I hope I can pull that off in a recognizable end <br>
product.  I have to find the stuff first.  I guess I'm going to have <br>
to order it off the internet.<br>

<div>Wanda, Friday or Saturdays sound great to me.  Let me know when you want to go.  I went to Uvalde, Garner Park and Leakey today scouting.  I didn't leave Carrizo until 2pm, so I had to make a short day of it.  I found a few places in Uvalde that warrant closer exploration...lol.  Today is the first time I've been to Garner in 8 yrs.  WOW!! They have changed that place up tremendously since I was there last.  I see a lot of potention there also.  And ConCan and Leakey...LOL.<br/>Susan</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL Wanda, I've used the pink stuff, the mastercarve<br>
and the cream-colored stuff too.  It sounds like I did<br>
the same thing you did - I got that set by speedball<br>
with the single sheet of pink stuff and a few other<br>
things in it.  Then I found the blocks of mastercarve<br>
and it it amazingly pliable.  I found, though, and I'm<br>
not sure if it is just because of my technique, that<br>
it crumbles badly in detail work.  I think I may be<br>
cutting too deeply though.<br>
<br>
The cream-stuff is kind of a happy medium, IMO, and no<br>
pun intended - LOL.  The pink stuff is very firm and I<br>
find myself fighting it a bit (again, this may be due<br>
to immature technique), the mastercarve crumbles, as I<br>
mentioned, and the cream speedball stuff falls in<br>
between.  I did, though, just go back and carve a new<br>
simple stamp this evening from the pink stuff, and I<br>
felt a little better about it this time.<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I'm not speaking from my vast<br>
experience and great wisdom, but this is what I think<br>
of the different media based on my limited experience<br>
with them.<br>
