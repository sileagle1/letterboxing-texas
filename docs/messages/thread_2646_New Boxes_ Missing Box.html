County.  We went up to ride the Texas State Rairoad and decided to <br>
take advantage of the opportunity.  Lone Star Quilter placed a box <br>
called "Railway to Heaven" and I placed "Native-Born, Texas Governor <br>
Series".  We took our kids and grandkids and had a great time.  We <br>
also had a report today from new boxers that my letterbox in <br>
Georgetown called "To Hell and Back" is missing.  I'll try to replace <br>
it next time I get out that way.  <br>
