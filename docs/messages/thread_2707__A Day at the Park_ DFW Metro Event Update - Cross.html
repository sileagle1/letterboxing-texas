Below is the update I posted to the event listing on AQ today.  Again,
all are welcome to this 4/21/07 gathering just south of Dallas!!  I
also welcome your suggestions and thoughts.
Looking forward to seeing many of you "at the park!"<br/>
S of the PEAS<br/>
<b><br/>
</b>**UPDATE 4/9/07**<br/>
OK ... we've narrowed it down. Since we are
going to the Joe Pool/Cedar Hill area, let's start in Duncanville.
Since this started out as "A Day at the Park," let's choose a city park
where we can meet (~10:30 AM?), exchange, get the event stamp, chat,
and eat lunch, and let the kids play. <br/>
<br/>
The two city parks in
Duncanville that we are considering are Lakeside Park (home of The
Duncanville Dragonfly letterbox) and Lions Park (formerly Southside
Park, home of Aslan's Letterbox). I have been to Lakeside and it would
be fine. Has anyone been to the other park? The placer of Aslan's
Letterbox mentions in her clues that it is a wonderful park,
playground, picnic tables, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Then after that, there are a few
options. There are a few letterboxes at Cedar Hill Nature Preserve
which is just a few blocks away. CHNP is free to enter and has nice
hiking trails. Also, just beyond that is Cedar Hill State Park. This
park has an entrance fee, but houses a couple of other letterboxes.
Some may want to go box at one of these places (or somewhere else!) and
then meet up again for dinner in town. Others may just want to hang out
in town and have a relaxing day. This area could use a few more
letterboxes, too, so maybe some of us can plant some before (or during)
the event. <br/>
<br/>
Thoughts?
