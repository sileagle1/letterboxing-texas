                    <div class="plaintext-content">Are you putting the link in the clues section?<br/>
If so, you might try putting it on the Link<br/>
line and check the box to have it automatically<br/>
go to that link without reading the Clues section.<br/>
If this doesn't work, you might have to just<br/>
cut and paste the clues from AQ and put them in<br/>
LBNA in the Clues section.<br/>
<br/>
Even though many people prefer AQ, I hope everyone<br/>
continues to also post their clues in LBNA for those<br/>
of us that don't go to AQ that often.<br/>

&gt; Dear All, Could someone please tell me why I cannot get a URL that <br/>
you can just click on for the last two boxes I have listed on AQ?  I <br/>
know I have been able to accomplish this task in the past, but I <br/>
think having 5 kids home ALL DAY ALL SUMMER has done something bad to <br/>
my thinker.  (By the way, there is a new Houston sort of mystery box <br/>
I just listed, "Eye Spy Houston")  What ever happened to that box you <br/>
could check on AQ to have boxes automatically listed on LBNA, <br/>
anyway?  Thanks!  MO5<br/>

weekend:  Having letterboxes to look forward to kept<br/>
me more alert on a long drive down I-10, the most<br/>
boring highway in the country!  I'd almost argue that<br/>
I felt like a safer driver, paying more attention,<br/>
since I was anticipating the exits where I could find<br/>
a box or two.  I doubt that people in highway safety<br/>
would be willing to advertise this as a benefit of<br/>
letterboxing, but I certainly will.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Among the boxes was Mother of Five's "Long Tall Texan"<br/>
box in Houston.  VERY COOL STAMP.<br/>
