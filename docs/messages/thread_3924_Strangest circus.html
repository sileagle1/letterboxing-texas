<div>The most unusual circus act I ever saw was in 1987 in Lvov, Ukraine, when 
it was still part of the Soviet Union.  We went to a Russian circus on ice, 
3 rings of acts going at once, all on ice skates - tumblers, acrobats, 
aerialists, plate-spinning, clowns, everything one might expect to 
be found in a circus.  Audience was filled with cute little kids, 
girls all wearing big bows and everyone in heavy knitted sweaters.  We 
wondered if there would be bears, which of course you'd expect in a Russian 
circus, only since they were on ice, they would need to be Polar Bears, on ice 
skates, we joked -- and guess what!  That's exactly what happened: out came 
about 8 or 10 enormous polar bears, wearing ICE SKATES, and performing all the 
traditional trained animal acts, dancing, balancing, everything.  We were 
amazed and laughing so hard -- most unusual circus and certainly the most 
unusual act I've ever seen.   We were also grateful for the wire 
netting around the rings and hopeful the bears didn't decide to make a break for 
it while we were there.  </div>
