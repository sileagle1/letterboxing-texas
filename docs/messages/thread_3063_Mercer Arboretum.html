                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went by the Mercer Arboretum and Botanical Gardens today to check <br>
on a letterbox that had been picked up by an employee.  The box was <br>
placed by our son, Fish Tree and is called "Thelma's Garden".  It <br>
turns out that it had already been retrieved by him, but we (Wills <br>
World and I) talked to the lady about it.  She told me it was found <br>
in a flower bed by a gardener and brought to the office.  They <br>
emailed my son and told him he could pick it up.  This box wasn't <br>
originally placed in a flower bed, so I don't know how it got there, <br>
but I thought I'd just remind everyone that the folks at Mercer have <br>
no problem with letterboxes in the arboretum, but they ask that they <br>
not be placed in or near a flower bed and that they don't require a <br>
finder to walk in or across a flower bed.  She said that they first <br>
became aware of letterboxes when they noticed a bed very badly <br>
trampled and found a box in it  that was full of trinkets.  We had a <br>
discussion on the difference between a letterbox and a geocache.  <br>
So, if you plan to visit Mercer anytime soon, be aware <br>
that "Thelma's Garden" is temporarily missing.  By the way, the lady <br>
had looked at the clue sheet for this box on LbNA and thought it was <br>
a wonderful story about the Mercers and the gardens.  Please watch <br>
where you place boxes in this beautiful place so they will continue <br>
to be Letterbox-Friendly.  Thanks,<br>

That was a lovely box and I hope it gets replaced some time.  They're<br>
very nice at Mercer and I think it's great that they allow letterboxes<br>
as long as we box responsibly!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We spent some time in Humble today visiting family and I had a couple <br>
of hours to kill, so, taking a cue from Silver Eagle's recent trip to <br>
Brazos Bend SP, I decided to go to Mercer Arboretum and check on the <br>
Murder boxes.  I hadn't been since Hurricane Ike, so it was about <br>
time.  This was an impromptu trip, so I didn't take any clues with <br>
me, just trusting my memory to locate the boxes.  The park took a <br>
heavy hit from Ike, and a lot of trees and limbs were down.  A lot of <br>
clean-up had taken place, with fallen trees cut into pieces and <br>
removed from the trails.  Also, a lot of underbrush has been cleared <br>
as a part of the process, so the park looks a little more open.  <br>
Murder at the Arboretum Box #1 was uncovered and about 6 feet away <br>
from its tree, but hidden from the trail, so it was put back in its <br>
place.  I passed by The Pinata Box and recognized its location, so I <br>
stopped and it was partially visible and two of the snap tabs on the <br>
box were undone, but inside the box was dry and the logbook okay, so <br>
I put it back and covered it well.  Box #2 (Sterling Seagull) was at <br>
the base of its tree instead of wedged between the trunks, but it was <br>
covered with leaves and dry inside.  Box #3 (Kid Kodiak) was found in <br>
the right place, but a large limb from the big oak tree had broken <br>
and fallen over the box and its branches make the box a little more <br>
difficult to get to, but I was able to do so and left it where it <br>
was.  This one had been lost and replaced once before, so I was glad <br>
it was there.  Baby bears, in my experience, are generally high-<br>
maintenance (but worth the trouble).  Box #4 (Suzy Shoeless) was fine <br>
and snuggled in its hollow branch.  Box #5 (Rubus Trivialis) was not <br>
so lucky.  It was right where it was supposed to be, but the box was <br>
full of water.  Fortunately, the Zip-Loc bag was sealed tightly, so <br>
no damage was done to the logbook.  I don't know how water got into a <br>
sealed Lock-n-Lock box, but it was full.  Thanks to all you finders <br>
for sealing the bag, I appreciate it.  I thought Box #6 (Jogsfer <br>
Jellybeans) was gone, as it certainly wasn't in its proper spot, but <br>
I found it in a pile of wet leaves about 20 feet away, so it's good.  <br>
Box #7 was snuggled in and dry, although almost all the vines and <br>
undergrowth had been removed from around it.  Two of IRA Boxer's <br>
boxes, The Ice Box and The Lunch Box are missing and, due to his <br>
condition, will not be replaced.  So, all seven boxes have survived <br>
the first year (except that pesky Kid Kodiak that had to be replaced) <br>
and are ready for another good year.<br>

I suspect the first Kid Kodiak box disappeared because, like all baby <br>
bears, people think they are so cute they want to take them home.  I <br>
also think it is appropriate that the Rubus Trivialis box has a <br>
shroud of mystery concerning how it got water to flow through a <br>
supposedly waterproof container. <br>
