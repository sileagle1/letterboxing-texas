                    <div class="plaintext-content">We went by the Mercer Arboretum and Botanical Gardens today to check <br/>
on a letterbox that had been picked up by an employee.  The box was <br/>
placed by our son, Fish Tree and is called "Thelma's Garden".  It <br/>
turns out that it had already been retrieved by him, but we (Wills <br/>
World and I) talked to the lady about it.  She told me it was found <br/>
in a flower bed by a gardener and brought to the office.  They <br/>
emailed my son and told him he could pick it up.  This box wasn't <br/>
originally placed in a flower bed, so I don't know how it got there, <br/>
but I thought I'd just remind everyone that the folks at Mercer have <br/>
no problem with letterboxes in the arboretum, but they ask that they <br/>
not be placed in or near a flower bed and that they don't require a <br/>
finder to walk in or across a flower bed.  She said that they first <br/>
became aware of letterboxes when they noticed a bed very badly <br/>
trampled and found a box in it  that was full of trinkets.  We had a <br/>
discussion on the difference between a letterbox and a geocache.  <br/>
So, if you plan to visit Mercer anytime soon, be aware <br/>
that "Thelma's Garden" is temporarily missing.  By the way, the lady <br/>
had looked at the clue sheet for this box on LbNA and thought it was <br/>
a wonderful story about the Mercers and the gardens.  Please watch <br/>
where you place boxes in this beautiful place so they will continue <br/>
to be Letterbox-Friendly.  Thanks,<br/>

&gt; &gt; There's been a little strange twist here.  I talked to my son, <br/>
Fish <br/>

&gt; &gt; Mercer office did say that she had emailed two people about <br/>
their <br/>

pick <br/>
&gt; &gt; up and extra letterbox (Thelma's Garden) from Mercer Arboretum <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; Botanical Gardens in Spring by mistake?   Thanks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for the update Boots, I have a box there that could be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; considered in the gardens though I don't think it would have <br/>
been a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem, so to be on the safe side I went out and moved it.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We went by the Mercer Arboretum and Botanical Gardens today <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; check <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a letterbox that had been picked up by an employee.  The <br/>
box <br/>
&gt; &gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed by our son, Fish Tree and is called "Thelma's <br/>
Garden".  <br/>
&gt; &gt; It <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; turns out that it had already been retrieved by him, but we <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Wills <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; World and I) talked to the lady about it.  She told me it <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; found <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in a flower bed by a gardener and brought to the office.  <br/>
They <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emailed my son and told him he could pick it up.  This box <br/>
&gt; &gt; wasn't <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally placed in a flower bed, so I don't know how it <br/>
got <br/>
&gt; &gt; there, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I thought I'd just remind everyone that the folks at <br/>
Mercer <br/>
&gt; &gt; have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no problem with letterboxes in the arboretum, but they ask <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; they <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not be placed in or near a flower bed and that they don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; require a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finder to walk in or across a flower bed.  She said that <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; &gt; first <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; became aware of letterboxes when they noticed a bed very <br/>
badly <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trampled and found a box in it  that was full of trinkets.  <br/>
We <br/>
&gt; &gt; had a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion on the difference between a letterbox and a <br/>
&gt; &gt; geocache.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, if you plan to visit Mercer anytime soon, be aware <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that "Thelma's Garden" is temporarily missing.  By the way, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; lady <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had looked at the clue sheet for this box on LbNA and <br/>
thought it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a wonderful story about the Mercers and the gardens.  Please <br/>
&gt; &gt; watch <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where you place boxes in this beautiful place so they will <br/>
&gt; &gt; continue <br/>

of hours to kill, so, taking a cue from Silver Eagle's recent trip to <br/>
Brazos Bend SP, I decided to go to Mercer Arboretum and check on the <br/>
Murder boxes.  I hadn't been since Hurricane Ike, so it was about <br/>
time.  This was an impromptu trip, so I didn't take any clues with <br/>
me, just trusting my memory to locate the boxes.  The park took a <br/>
heavy hit from Ike, and a lot of trees and limbs were down.  A lot of <br/>
clean-up had taken place, with fallen trees cut into pieces and <br/>
removed from the trails.  Also, a lot of underbrush has been cleared <br/>
as a part of the process, so the park looks a little more open.  <br/>
Murder at the Arboretum Box #1 was uncovered and about 6 feet away <br/>
from its tree, but hidden from the trail, so it was put back in its <br/>
place.  I passed by The Pinata Box and recognized its location, so I <br/>
stopped and it was partially visible and two of the snap tabs on the <br/>
box were undone, but inside the box was dry and the logbook okay, so <br/>
I put it back and covered it well.  Box #2 (Sterling Seagull) was at <br/>
the base of its tree instead of wedged between the trunks, but it was <br/>
covered with leaves and dry inside.  Box #3 (Kid Kodiak) was found in <br/>
the right place, but a large limb from the big oak tree had broken <br/>
and fallen over the box and its branches make the box a little more <br/>
difficult to get to, but I was able to do so and left it where it <br/>
was.  This one had been lost and replaced once before, so I was glad <br/>
it was there.  Baby bears, in my experience, are generally high-<br/>
maintenance (but worth the trouble).  Box #4 (Suzy Shoeless) was fine <br/>
and snuggled in its hollow branch.  Box #5 (Rubus Trivialis) was not <br/>
so lucky.  It was right where it was supposed to be, but the box was <br/>
full of water.  Fortunately, the Zip-Loc bag was sealed tightly, so <br/>
no damage was done to the logbook.  I don't know how water got into a <br/>
sealed Lock-n-Lock box, but it was full.  Thanks to all you finders <br/>
for sealing the bag, I appreciate it.  I thought Box #6 (Jogsfer <br/>
Jellybeans) was gone, as it certainly wasn't in its proper spot, but <br/>
I found it in a pile of wet leaves about 20 feet away, so it's good.  <br/>
Box #7 was snuggled in and dry, although almost all the vines and <br/>
undergrowth had been removed from around it.  Two of IRA Boxer's <br/>
boxes, The Ice Box and The Lunch Box are missing and, due to his <br/>
condition, will not be replaced.  So, all seven boxes have survived <br/>
the first year (except that pesky Kid Kodiak that had to be replaced) <br/>
and are ready for another good year.<br/>

I suspect the first Kid Kodiak box disappeared because, like all baby <br/>
bears, people think they are so cute they want to take them home.  I <br/>
also think it is appropriate that the Rubus Trivialis box has a <br/>
shroud of mystery concerning how it got water to flow through a <br/>
supposedly waterproof container. <br/>
