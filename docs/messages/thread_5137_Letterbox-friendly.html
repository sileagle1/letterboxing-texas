                    <div class="plaintext-content">The other day I got an email from a ranger at the North Little Rock Parks & Recreation in Arkansas saying that a controlled burn in Burns Park (what an apt name for the park) was scheduled and since I have a letterbox in that area I should remove it.  At this point I figured it was just another way for a park to get rid of a letterbox, but he went on to say that I was welcome to replace the box after the burn or place it in a new location if the burn ruins the original spot.  I thanked him for the heads-up, but explained that I did not live close by and could not comply.  He then volunteered to do it for me if I would give him the clues to the box.  Since it was one of my game boxes (20 Questions Game 19-Person) I couldn't just give him the link to the clue page, so I solved it, cut and pasted the clues, and sent them to him.  He then responded:<br>
"Thanks.  I will look for it this week.  Just an FYI - the arch is still there but the trail has been blocked due to a change in our trail layout.  Once I find the letterbox I will try to get you an updated description to the letterbox when it gets put back".  Now that is what I call a letterbox-friendly park, and it makes me wonder why this park and ranger are so helpful when others are not. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">His willingness to help is remarkable, but I think there is a trend in the parks to be, if not interactive, at least tolerant towards letterboxing.  I believe park management realizes that the benefits outweigh the negatives.  Thanks for letting us know, hopefully his attitude is contagious.<br>

&gt; asks permission and/or fills out appropriate permits, everything should be<br/>&gt; good. I know Texas has a no-charge permit that needs to be filled out in<br/>&gt; order to place a cache. They have recently updated the form and there's a<br/>

&gt; checkbox for Letterboxes as well. Please be sure to fill out one of these<br/>&gt; if you're placing a box in a State Park. If we work with them, they will<br/>&gt; work with us.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The permit/guidelines are available at the very bottom of<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't want to get into this whole debate that we have hashed over many times, but I disagree with almost everything you said.  Parks are OUR property, too, and I don't think a few well-hidden boxes are going to cause any more of a problem than allowing hunting, scout troops, or other groups to use the park.  Also, letterboxing IS supposed to be secretive.  That is one of the main things that separates it from Geocaching and is what I like about it.  Growing the hobby too fast will just result in more boxes being badly placed by people not really interested in letterboxing other than as a passing fad. The box I placed in the park that started this thread was not permitted, nor was it required to be, yet the Ranger was able to contact me via LBNA email from my clue page.<br>
<br>
Now that being said, I do respect the wishes of Texas State Parks wanting all boxes to be permitted, so I have stopped placing boxes in them rather than comply.  For those that have the time and desire to go through the permit process, more power to you.<br>

> The other day I got an email from a ranger at the North Little Rock Parks & Recreation in Arkansas saying that a controlled burn in Burns Park (what an apt name for the park) was scheduled and since I have a letterbox in that area I should remove it.  At this point I figured it was just another way for a park to get rid of a letterbox, but he went on to say that I was welcome to replace the box after the burn or place it in a new location if the burn ruins the original spot.  I thanked him for the heads-up, but explained that I did not live close by and could not comply.  He then volunteered to do it for me if I would give him the clues to the box.  Since it was one of my game boxes (20 Questions Game 19-Person) I couldn't just give him the link to the clue page, so I solved it, cut and pasted the clues, and sent them to him.  He then responded:<br>

Once I find the letterbox I will try to get you an updated description to the letterbox when it gets put back".  Now that is what I call a letterbox-friendly park, and it makes me wonder why this park and ranger are so helpful when others are not. <br>

Wry Me gave you some very good advise on AQ, read the past post about this discussion, and you may have a better understanding of the views this group has. I love the fact that not everyone knows about letterboxing. The look on peoples face passing by while we are stamping in, is just priceless! <br>
Letterboxes are going to go missing for several different reasons, that is just a part of the hobby. I hate it when a box does go missing, but I think about all those that did get to enjoy the adventure while it was still available.<br>
See you all at TALE!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm sorry if our responses seem harsh.  It seems obvious that we should "just follow the rules" if you just look at the current forms.  The issue is that the rules are evolving and slowly becoming relevant to letterboxing.  Our attitude toward the state parks comes from long well thought out discussions and feedback from those here who have tried to work with the parks with mixed success.  The rules are changing positively as a result of their work. <br>
<br>
Three years ago the permitting form looked very different and was clearly intended for geocaches only.  There are some subtle but big differences in the two hobbies that make a one size fits all process difficult to use, but it is getting better. If I were to plant a cache today I'd permit it, but with a letterbox it depends.<br>

<p>I'm sorry if our responses seem harsh.  It seems obvious that we should "just follow the rules" if you just look at the current forms.  The issue is that the rules are evolving and slowly becoming relevant to letterboxing.  Our attitude toward the state parks comes from long well thought out discussions and feedback from those here who have tried to work with the parks with mixed success.  The rules are changing positively as a result of their work. <br/>
<br/>
Three years ago the permitting form looked very different and was clearly intended for geocaches only.  There are some subtle but big differences in the two hobbies that make a one size fits all process difficult to use, but it is getting better. If I were to plant a cache today I'd permit it, but with a letterbox it depends.<br/>

<p>I like the motto used on the Appalachian Trail: "Hike Your Own Hike", meaning, don't judge or allow others to judge how you choose to hike (ie: south to north, north to south, flip-flopping, slackpacking, full loaded pack, white blazing/blue blazing/yellow blazing, thru hiking or section hiking, skipping a section or placing your foot on each step of the 2164 miles) - just hike your own hike! I think the same motto can be carried into letterboxing as long as we all agree to respect each other and the letterboxes we are seeking. I for one am pretty old school and believe in taking all precautions to protect the privacy and secrets of letterboxing, but I also realize there are as many techniques for letterboxing as there are letterboxers. It's certainly not for me to judge or tell others how they should do it. I've never permitted my boxes at State Parks, maybe because it wasn't a requirement when I started boxing ten years ago, but if you want to... then do it. If any of my boxes are confiscated by a Ranger, well, I've lost boxes before and usually it was because of careless finders. I've learned to take it in stride. Missing boxes happens. My favorite ranger was at Mission Tejas where in casual conversation with the ranger on duty, I explained (in general terms) what letterboxing was all about. Next thing I knew, he emailed me that he'd found my box at his park and now he was hooked. (BTW: he didn't ask me to permit it!).</p>
<p>By the way, I'm hiking a portion of the Appalachian Trail this summer with a friend, and probably carrying a 40 pound pack. We'll probably be changing our hiking philosophy as we go along! Hike your own hike, friends. See you all in a month. </p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't see a link, just a mention of an old thread 2 or 3 years ago.  That's a long time and things change (hopefully for the better). I personally haven't had a problem working with TPWD, so I don't have a tainted view. Three years ago, I didn't even know about geocaching or letterboxing or any other location-based games (how sad it that?). Actually, it was on the TPWD's website that I first ever heard about geocaching. These games are all just a scavenger hunts to me, with just a few differences between them, and I don't discriminate between them.<br>
<br>
This is just my opinion (and everyone is entitled to their own, of course).<br>
<br>
Geocaching is a scavenger hunt that uses a GPS and clues.  Most (other than virtuals and earthcaches) contain logs.  Some also contain stamps and those are my favorite.  Geocaching sites have reviewers. As a geocacher, I don't have bad feelings toward boxers as a whole.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing is a scavenger hunt that does not use a GPS, but instead uses just clues. Of course, they MUST contain a stamp. The stamps is the part I like best...and not having to follow a GPS. Letterboxing has no reviewers. As a letterboxer, I don't have bad feelings toward cachers as a whole.<br>
<br>
You'll find lock N locks, film canisters and the like in both games. Both are good for people of all ages. Both hobbies have good and bad containers - and good and bad hiders/finders.  It's all just hiding and seeking and I enjoy the adventures that both bring.  I have met some great people through geocaching (and unfortunately some that were not so nice) and I can't wait to meet some of you great people through letterboxing at TALE. I hope any not-so-nice ones stay home. :)<br>

> NativTxn, would I be wrong in assuming that you are first a geocacher and second a letterboxer?  Unfortunately, TPWD views letterboxing as you do, about like geocaching, whereas letterboxers who do not geocache see the two as completely different.  Working with them in an attempt to get a little respect has been ongoing for years and is a work in progress.  I would ask that you go to the link provided by Silver Eagle and read the previous discussions on this subject.  Look me up at TALE 10 and I can tell you of my experiences with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. over the years.<br>
