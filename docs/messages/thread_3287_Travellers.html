<div> </div>
<div>A traveller is a special stamp that usually involves answering a question or performing some sort of feat to get.  While I don't personally have a logbook for my travelers, some folks probably do have logbooks to go with theirs.  Here's a link to mine so you can get an idea what I am talking about:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/HHView.php?hhnum=829&amp;hhname=Lucy's_Personal_Traveler">http://www.letterboxing.org/HHView.php?hhnum=829&amp;hhname=Lucy's_Personal_Traveler</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Although you would usually get these at gatherings, you might also run into a boxer on the trail and you would want to be prepared in case you did, and you would want to know 1) if they have a personal traveler, and 2) the "something" necessary to get the traveler.  I have a list of boxers across the country whose PT's I would like to get, in case I ever happen to "bump into" them.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You can find out who has personal traverls (PTs) by going here:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/HHFind.php">http://www.letterboxing.org/HHFind.php</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>and choosing personal as the type of stamp and perusing the list for recognized names, or you can go here:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/search.html?gTypeId=11">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/search.html?gTypeId=11</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>and doing the same.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For your reference though, not everyone lists their PT anywhere, so you might have to find a way to diplomatically ask if someone has one.  There's a little finesse to getting PT's, so try to find a way to slip it into conversation - it's a lot more fun that way.  A traveler, by the way, is a great way to open up a conversation with a complete stranger at a gathering.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>  Also, sometimes HH's are called travelers.<br/><br/></div>
