                    <div class="plaintext-content">I also love cemetery boxes--in Texas they are too often the only<br>
history that remains.  I think the most important thing is for the<br>
finders to be respectful--of any mourners, of the sacredness of the<br>
place, and of the graves themselves.  The periphery is usually the<br>
best way to go, although I do have one box hidden in the middle of a<br>
cemetery, just not on a grave.  <br>
<br>
This box in particular was really high on my to-do list, from the<br>
moment T-Dog planted it.  We just have to get up that way--for the TX<br>
boxcar event if not before.  When I was a kid, I loved to listen to<br>
the Blues records my dad had bought cheaply at the PX.  I don't listen<br>
so much now (can anyone say Radio Disney, blech!), but it's a fond memory.<br>
<br>
I would encourage those of you who may not have planted a box to<br>
consider doing so.  It's a great way to <br>
1.  Improve your carving skills.<br>
2.  Better understand what goes into a box (makes you a better finder).<br>
3.  Show off favorite spots in your community.<br>
4.  Return the favor for those who have planted before you.<br>
<br>
Don't worry if your carving skills are still amateur.  You get better<br>
quickly and practice is the only way to improve.  <br>
<br>
So, calling all Houston boxers--you should take pity on TeamKing &<br>
hide some boxes.  They're desperate for some more Houston-area boxes<br>
(and I won't complain either).  <br>
<br>
Cheers!  Here's to a great 2006,<br>
