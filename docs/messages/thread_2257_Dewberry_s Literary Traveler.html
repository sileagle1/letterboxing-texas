However, if you come to the gathering and give me the right answer,<br/>
I'll give you a different stamp, even better than the missing one.  It<br/>

<div>You've been a good sport about our teasing you about carving/recarving so many stamps these past few days!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll be thrilled to death to get whatever stamp you have for your LT...I'm sure it will be awesome.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Y'all have done such a great job with this - I can't wait to get there in the morning!</div>
