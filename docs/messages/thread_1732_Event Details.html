                    <div class="plaintext-content">Barefoot Lucy not only checked on the Fish Fry place, but<br/>
also located the elusive Picnic Pavilion where the Event<br/>
will take place.  It seems the map on the website is wrong<br/>
and the pavilion is not as described.  The bad news is that<br/>
it is smaller than advertised, though it should work.  The<br/>
good news is that it is a nice stone pavilion with a fireplace<br/>
right by the lake.  To find it, park in the lot by the train<br/>
depot and walk toward the lake.  We will be right in the most<br/>
crowded part of the park, so we might get some curious looks.<br/>
BL suggested we make a sign saying "Alden Family Reunion"<br/>
to really confuse people.  <br/>
Baby Bear and I will be at the park Friday night and plan<br/>
on going to the Maydelle winery around 6:00 if it is still open,<br/>
then going to Bertha's.  Maybe if others go to the winery a<br/>
little earlier we can keep them open and not overwhelm them<br/>
all at once.  Looking forward to seeing everyone either Friday<br/>
night or Saturday! <br/>
