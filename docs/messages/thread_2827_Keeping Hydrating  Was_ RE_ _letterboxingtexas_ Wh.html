 boots.  I had to walk around the store for a while before they even let me decide.</span></div> <div> </div><!-- Converted from text/plain format --><span class="948192511-12062007"></span>Well - gotta go!  More later.<span class="948192511-12062007"></span><br/> <div>Mike - KD9KC.<br/>M.A.R.I.E.<br/>El Paso, Tx.<br/>www.w5dpd.org<br/><br/>============<wbr/>=========<wbr/>=========<wbr/>=========<wbr/>======<br/>The United States Constitution (c) 1791.

I don't mind the 'book' at all. It makes me want to go out and walk again right now.</div> <div> </div> <div>It's 60 mi in 3 days. They don't really do 20 miles a day. It's more like 22, 22, 16. That way they can have a 'closing ceremony' on Sunday. It's walking. They won't let you to run or bike. They have pit stops every 3 miles and they relay the pit stops so they don't have to have so many. We camp in tents on Fri and Sat nights. I thought of the CamelBak (didn't know the name though) and wondered if that would be easier on my back. They recommend the two bottle fanny pack. But, if you use a tall bottle, your arms hit it. It was uncomfortable today. It made me walk funny. I already have
 mole skin, in my pack. It helped to have music in my ears, but we're not 'supposed' to on training walks. I have thick socks but need to be fitted for shoes again. I am 43 and have not missed a meal in a few years. This summer my cross training will be wat aerobics. I love the idea of Sun-Tue-Thu. Then, on Mon and Fri I can take D.O.G. for shorter walks (DH walks him other days). I tried to take him this morning. He was so excited and wanted to mark everything we passed. He didn't even try to eat the guy mowing the lawn he was so excited. </div> <div> </div> <div>Does the water in the CamelBak taste okay? Are they easy to fill at a pit stop? I think they are ingenious. And to have the pockets on the bag, makes it that much more feasible. </div> <div> </div> <div>I just looked at the CamelBak site and they have a fanny one that will hold enough water for an hour of running. That's probably perfect and it has some pockets. I think I'll go look at the bicycle
 store down the street for me and see about getting one.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thank you so much for your help.

 Tue-Thu-Sat.  Do your best to keep to it.  And try to do a little more each day.  It will get easier.  Also - there is only one way to get trained for climate.  That is that climate.  This is why our soldiers stage in Kuwait before going into Iraq.  They don't just sit around waiting for an assignment.  They train every day - and a little more every day - till they are ready fir the daily duty.</span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Try to do some training in the gear you will be using for the event.  The LAST thing you want to do it put on new shoes just before you walk 20 miles.  My rule of thumb - 50 miles in short walks with a new pair of boots before you do a road-march (military hike) with them.  Lighter shoes might
 not need as much break-in, but the day of the event isn't the time to learn that there is a glue-spot on the tongue that gives you a sore spot every time you flex your ankle.</span><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">If you need to carry your own gear (water - lip balm - sun screen - etc) consider a Camel-Bak.  I like the military models - they are rugged.  I hike a lot of rugged places with heavy gear.  Just carried a 55 lb power supply up to a radio site a few days ago.  But they are also heavy.  The civilian models are light-weight.  They won't hold up to my abuse, but this one works for my wife just fine - the Camel-Bak M.U.L.E.  It carries nearly 1 gallon of water, and had enough pockets to carry bug spray etc.....  It was made for biking, but also works out just
 right for light-weight hiking.</span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-120 it in for you.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt; &lt;DIV dir=" ltr="left"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div> <div><span class="673203305-12062007">Got to get to bed - I was just going to turn the computer off and here it is 30 min later.  &lt;grin&gt;  Hope it helps.</span></div><!-- Converted from text/plain format --><br/> <div>Mike - KD9KC.<br/>M.A.R.I.E.<br/>El Paso, Tx.<br/>www.w5dpd.org<br/><br/>============<wbr/>=========<wbr/>=========<wbr/>=========<wbr/>======<br/>The United States Constitution (c) 1791.
