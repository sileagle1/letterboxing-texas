or interesting places to plant your own boxes.  Ask yourself "If <br/>
this were someone else's box and I was coming to find it, would this <br/>

<div>This is important advice.  Recently, I was letterboxing with 
PuddleSplasher, and we just didn't feel good about a situation, felt unsafe -- 
bad vibes --  and left.  When you're out in an isolated section of 
woods and feel unsafe, it's best to leave.   You can always plan to 
return later and see if things are different.  After all, this should be 
fun, not life and death. </div>

Sometimes it's because you know that the box is in a ill-conceived<br/>
location and you are causing environmental damage.  Or it's that it's<br/>
tall grass &amp; snakey habitat or no PI-free way to get to the box.  If<br/>
you came during a different season, it'd be better.<br/>
<br/>
We were looking for a box in Louisiana and the hole was a lot deeper<br/>
than it seemed when the planter placed it (probably some settling). <br/>
No way was I sticking my hand (gloved or not) into a hole that deep.<br/>

<div>Oh, yes. That was one of my boxes that had fallen down in a tree trunk just out of reach. I finally went home and got my BBQ tongs and that did the job nicely. I carried those things around in my jeep for a long time, but finally my husband wanted them back. I don't think his priorities and mine are always the same.</div>

I can answer that!  They all moved to Florida!  Any night around <br/>
midnight I can step out my front door and find an armadillo within <br/>
100 yards of my house.  They're busily wiping out the endangered <br/>

<div>My Boxin' 'Dillo mystery box is planted near my last live-armadillo 
sighting.  I figured he must be a boxing armadillo because he was 
apparently searching for a nearby letterbox, the one, in fact, which now holds 
the specific clues to the mystery box's location.   And not too many 
months ago I saw not one but two different live armadillos scooting across the 
roads out at the FW Nature Center.  Guess you just have to be where they 
are when they're there! </div>

<div>maybe he was just checking to see if he'd already stamped it.  Did you 
happen to see what sort of stamp he was carrying in his little pointy
