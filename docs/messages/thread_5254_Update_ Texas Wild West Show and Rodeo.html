The show is safe. The horses broke from their corrals but have been roped and <br/>
harnessed. Everyone has been hitched, loaded and on the move. Yee-Haw<br/>

The show arrived in Spring this morning.  We set up on the old Mercer place, on the banks of Cypress Creek, in the woods that they call the Arboretum.  We turned into the Arboretum off of old Aldine-Westfield Road and drove back to the old settlers grounds, commonly known as the picnic area, parked near the outhouses and the kids play area.  Looking for a suitable place, we checked out the trails in the area.  We found the signpost behind where all the covered tables are gittin' set up for chow and took the trail to the Hawthorne Loop on the left, then took a right at the "Y" and continued on to the the next "T".  We got out of the wagon and walked up the loop to the left for about 90 steps and saw a good spot on the left, about 15 steps into the woods.  There was a good-lookin' fellow standing there, and he introduced himself to us as Sterling Seagull, right nice fellow.  He said he reckoned that was  as good a spot as any.  When he found out we was a Wild West Show and Rodeo, he said he could use some work and had some experience locally as a rodeo clown. I told him I didn't think we'd be here that long.  If any of y'all out there want to meet the stars of the rodeo, you'd best hurry.  We could be movin' out agin any time now. <br/>
