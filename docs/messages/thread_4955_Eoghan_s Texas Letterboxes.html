    The last time I talked with him was about 6 months ago and he seems
    to like the current set up. I am willing to hand them out and as
    more people have them there is less chance of the clues becoming
    lost.<br/>
<br/>
    Dawn's Glory and I have both looked for Wraith of the Woods in the
    past two years and have not been able to find it.Â  The area took a
    lot of rain and flooded several times over the past 5 years since I
    last checked on the box and I have not been able to locate it.Â  I do
    not have those clues any more, just the GPS coordinates.<br/>
<br/>
    It would be a shame if the Enchanted Rock box is gone.Â  I can't
    imagine someone stumbling onto it by accident. I wonder if a critter
    got it.<br/>

    See you soon,<br/>

    Here is the O-Knots clues. I have to type up the others, they are
    on hard copy only at the moment. I'll get them out to you ASAP.<br/>

    PI Joe<br/>
<br/>
-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-<br/>
<br/>
    O-Knots<br/>
<br/>
    Treasure Type: Letterbox Series<br/>
    Placed on: 11/10/01<br/>
    State: Texas<br/>
    County: Bastrop<br/>
    Nearest Town: Bastrop<br/>
    Park: Bastrop State Park<br/>
<br/>
    Terrain Difficulty: 2.5 stars<br/>
    Overall Difficulty: 2 stars<br/>
<br/>
    Clues:<br/>
<br/>
    To locate the four o-knots hidden in this park you will need to
    purchase ($3) an <br/>
    orienteering map from the park headquarters when you enter the park.
    There are <br/>
    two maps available; buy the one that shows the numbered locations of
    the <br/>
    permanent control points. Each of these letterboxes contains a
    circular ('O') <br/>
    Celtic knot stamp and is located near one of the permanent
    orienteering ('O') <br/>
    control markers shown on the map. Each box is in the base of a tree

<div>I have the clues to Wraith of the Woods, and to Gordian Knot 
Letterbox.Â  I donât believe either box is still there (and I have looked 
and looked), but the clues are fun reads.Â  For some reason, I thought his 
clues were already posted on this List to keep before the original link stopped 
working, to keep them from disappearing.Â  I could scan them in for the sake 
of Texas letterboxing history.Â  Or I could bring copies to TALE9.Â  --

<p>I know Eoghan doesn't want to publish his clues, but it is a shame only you 
have the clues. Any chance he would agree to you scanning them and posting in 
Files section of this List like the Lost Pines box? I have a link to his old 
website in the Links section but it no longer works.<br/><br/>Last time I was at 
Enchanted Rock I checked on his box and could not find it, so might be missing. 
Also, do you have clues for Wraith Of The Woods? It was a very challenging box 
that Baby Bear and I finally found after several tries many years ago and it 
might still be there.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com</a>,

mentioned on this mailing list that I had the clues to Eoghan's Texas

could not locate them in my files to pass them along. Well, I have located them 
again and now I have forgotten who asked for them. (do you see a pattern 
emerging here)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I have the clues for the following 
letterboxes:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Enchanted Rock - Placed on 11/26/2000 at Enchanted 
Rock SNA.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mayfield Park - Placed 1/6/2001 in Austin.<br/>&gt;

Park.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; O-Knots (4) - Placed 11/10/2001 in Bastrop State Park, 
but I have not been able to check all four since the fire. I do know that #4 has 
been lost to the flames.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; PI Joe<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div><!-- end group email --></div></div></div></body></html>
