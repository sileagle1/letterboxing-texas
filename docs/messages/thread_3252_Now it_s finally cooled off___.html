                    <html><body><div>I am so glad it has finally cooled off!  Between scouts being on a break through the Christmas holidays and having time off, I've finally gotten the itch to get out and box again and with the exception of Wednesday, the weather has cooperated beautifully.  Between finding several boxes earlier in the week in Coldspring, and finding boxes in Palestine yesterday and planting two in Anderson County, I was already doing pretty good this week, but since I had to go down to Davy Crockett NF today to pick up Fearless Fox and Lightning from their hiking trip and take them back to their truck, I decided to go ahead and box my way down to where I would wait for them to come off the trail.

<div>There were a few of JBK's holiday series I had not yet picked up, so I focused on finished up the series I had not yet completed.  I managed to get the last May box I needed at Gourmet Gardens - I think I could've laid down in the middle of the road to stamp in and never worried about traffic.  What a switch from yesterday in Palestine!  
</div>

<div>I also went to the Cherokee County Airport and picked up a June box there that I needed.  I always feel like flying when I go to that airport.  Back many years ago when Bealls Department Stores was still family-owned by the Bealls, they were based here in Jacksonville.  It was quite an imposing company at one time and they had a corporate jet that flew their buyers and executives all over the place.  Unfortunately, the Cherokee County Airport was too small to accomodate their new jet way back then, so the company flipped the bill for extending the runway.  I always find it funny to visit that airport and see that immensely long runway for the small planes that live there now (to my knowledge, there are no jets of any size that are based there anymore, although F16's frequently come through there since the guy who I guess owns the airport was a military pilot in the not too distant past).   Anyway, Fearless Fox's dad was a buyer for Bealls and FF and I dated all the way through high school, so he and I got to ride the jet a few times as the pilot made rounds dropping execs off in various places.  The plane would return to Jacksonville empty except for the two of us and any other privileged kids who got to go along, so the pilot always had a little fun with us on the way home - making our stomachs flip and knocking us around a little.  Can you imagine what liability insurance would have to say about that now???  Anyway, that was wayyyy before letterboxing and all of that was to say I successfully found a box at the airport.  Yep.

<div>I went on to find JBK's box at the Rusk State Hospital cemetery.  Remember the one where she was nearly arrested just for being there?  Well you can imagine I was a little antsy to be hanging out there alone, and sure enough once I retrieved the box bunches of cars whizzed by.  I kept wondering if any of them was the one that turned her in to the state hospital...  I stamped fast and tried to rehide between passing cars, so with one opportunity I tossed the box behind the tree while looking nonchalant, and with the next opportunity I grabbed leaves and sticks and covered it and went back to feigned casual boredom just as the next car passed.  I quickly skirted around the box looking for signs of it not being hidden and ducked before the next car passed, all the while waiting for a state car to pull up to interrogate me before they hauled me off to torture me.  Wait a minute - that was the movie I watched last night I think.  Anyway, nothing of any note, other than all the stinking cars that drove by happened.  Maybe it's just JBK...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I ventured on to Cedar Hill Cemetery to begin the December series and found the box there and then went on to the KOA to try to finish up June.  As directed, I stopped in the office to tell them I wanted to look around for a get-together.  Well - JBK did NOT tell us how talkative this guy would be!  Oh my - I thought he was going to get in my car with me and show me around.  By the time I was done talking to him, he had made me a deal I cannot refuse, so now I have to figure out what group to take camping there at the KOA.  In scouts we usually camp more primitively, but if I can't convince any other group to go with me there, it's going to be cub scout camping for sure!  He finally let me do the self-guided tour, although he gave me a key to one of the kabins to check out.  They really ARE very nice!  Anyway, the bad news is I found her Oscar the Grouch Birthday box in various pieces, with no evidence of stamp or log.  I collected what was there, casually dug around to see if I could find the good stuff, and finally left.  (Now let me mention here, since we've had so many discussions about reporting attempts, the ONLY reason I am reporting this information here is because the box I found was clearly and without a doubt JBK's box.  It was the kind of box she uses, the kind of baggies she uses, AND the box was marked like she marks her boxes.  If I were any less certain, I would NOT have marked the box as an attempt and I would not report this information here and now, but would leave it to her to make adjustments to her box description).

<div>Anyway, I hated to quit on a low note, but I was running late picking up FF and L.  I made up the time and landed at the store I was to meet them at at exactly the first possible meeting time.  No sign of them and the store clerk hadn't seen them, but no surprise either.  I roamed the area a bit until finally they called me on the two-way and told me they would be an hour longer.  I decided to get to work on a new box for Ratcliff Lake Recreation Area, but it turned out they were only a half hour away, so I barely got a start!  Still amazing to me how it is possible to meet someone in the middle of nowhere.

<div>Another nice day of boxing, and it looks as if I am approaching a milestone.  I need to sit down and count my logbook to see if I need to press a little harder tomorrow to hit the mark!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
