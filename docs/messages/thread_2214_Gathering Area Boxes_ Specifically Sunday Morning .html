<div>I'm wading through this ENORMOUS list of boxes in the Memorial Park area!  I am running across some of Hawk's boxes and I understand that those may well be hit or miss boxes.  What I'm curious about is - there are several listed with an owner "not listed" on AQ, but attributed to her as the author.  Are these the boxes you've found and confirmed, and that you've adopted, changed, and put back out for adoption?  In other words, are these Hawk boxes more likely to be found?  I'm trying to prioritize my list because there is NO WAY Lightning and I can find all these boxes before we have to leave to come home!

As far as the Hawk boxes, that's a different way than they were done<br/>
before, but it totally fits.  Her Memorial Park boxes, as far as I<br/>
know and last I checked, are where they're supposed to be.  But her<br/>
box nearby at Bayou Bend, Ho Hum is GONE.  For any that were confirmed<br/>
missing, I changed them to retired.  <br/>

characters.  But, I'll bring the clues for them that morning.  <br/>
<br/>
However, to give you a heads up, they will include:<br/>
<br/>
Capn Crunch<br/>
Boo Berry<br/>
Frankenberry<br/>
Count Chocula<br/>
Cocoa Puffs<br/>
Froot Loops<br/>
Frosted Flakes<br/>
King Vitaman<br/>
&amp; More<br/>
<br/>
They will be pulled after Sunday.  But I host the breakfast gathering<br/>
again sometime, because I think it's a fun easy-going event.  However,<br/>
I will have to recover from the whole weekend first!<br/>
