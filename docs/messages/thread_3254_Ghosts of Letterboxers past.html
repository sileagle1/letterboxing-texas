<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">My extended family and 
I packed up the bikes and a picnic and went to spend the day in Burroughs Park 
today.  I was thinking of all of you as I chased Naomi through the 
pavilion...remembering what fun we had the day of the gathering there.  It 
was as if it was full of a bunch of happy, inky ghosts.</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">Oh, and Lucy...it 
wasn't me hollering at the kids in the woods the other day (unless I was 
hollering so loud here in Houston that you heard me all the way to Palestine, 
which is entirely possible.)  I was jealous reading of your day there, over 
Thanksgiving break we took the kids to ride the state railroad, with great plans 
of finding a governor in Palestine and then stopping by Davey Dogwood park on 
the way home.  We got as far as Water from the Rocks, when the rain and 
then the stomach flu started at almost exactly the same time.  Imagine 
driving all the way home with a carload of sick kids (and a sick mom) it wasn't 
pretty.  In any case, we had to cut that trip short, but it is one I 
definitely am keeping in mind for a future roadtrip.
