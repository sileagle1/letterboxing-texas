Hi!<br>
<br>
This is my first time to post to this board, although I have been <br>
silently "lurking" for a short time.  My name is Brandi and myself, <br>
my husband and 2 children are the BusyBeesFamily.<br>
<br>
We were first introduced to letterboxing via a Girl Scout <br>
orienteering event.  They just said a small bit about other <br>
activities using compass skills, and we were intrigued.  We looked <br>
into it a bit and thought it might be a good fit for the family!  <br>
Then, we got our neighbors hooked on it and now it's turning into a <br>
great way for the neighborhood block to spend time together.<br>
<br>
Our first find was SilverEagle's Bluebonnet box at Yegua Creek Park <br>
(there for GS fishing event)!  We have found 4 others around the <br>
Austin area.  We have also planted our very first box in San Gabriel <br>
Park in Georgetown (If you plant it....).  We do have plans and ideas <br>
for a great many more boxes.  We are hoping that if we plant more <br>
boxes for others to find, that they will leave behind some boxes when <br>
they come...hint, hint!  There are many beautiful parks, lakes and <br>
historic sites in and around Georgetown!<br>
<br>
We are interested in coming to the event on March 19th.  It would be <br>
2 adults/2 children.  I would also like to carve an oil rig <br>
(Spindletop?) for your game.  If I carve it today, could I mail it <br>
tomorrow?  I know this is last minute, but we were not sure if we <br>
could make it to the event or not.  Also, please remember that we are <br>
not quite experts in the "carving" aspect of letterboxing, but I <br>
would be happy to give it my best shot.  :-)  Please just let me know.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Brandi (for BusyBeesFamily)<br>
