                    <div class="plaintext-content">Imagine my surprise when I opened that box (arts &amp; crafts rose), and <br/>
there is a note addressed to me! I certainly wasn't expecting that. In <br/>
fact, I put that box back without stamping in, then went and grabbed <br/>
the bus and put it in Cold Front's car before coming back to get the <br/>
original box (and one other). Then when I'm almost back to the car the <br/>
second time, a stranger comes out of the woods and asks if I'm Warm <br/>
Front... it caught me off guard. <br/>
   Thanks Dewberry, that was a very cool surprise. The bus doubled my <br/>
stamps for the trip since I only had time to get 6 other boxes(only 4 <br/>
for Cold Front, who is very upset that she missed out on the bus <br/>
adventure). <br/>
<br/>
We got back to Alpine about 9pm last night, and I went straight to bed. <br/>
It's now just after 4am and I have to go do my Trig homework before my <br/>
8am class... ugh! I just wanted to post about the bus. I'll log finds <br/>
and visit the boards this afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
As for the bus, I'm going to order some PZcut today (I typically use <br/>
pink pearl erasers :) but I guess I can try to do something bigger for <br/>
the bus. We're going to try and carve our additions this weekend, and <br/>
then re-plant the bus the following weekend. I'm thinking we might take <br/>
it to Kent, TX. It's almost exactly between Midland and El Paso, it's <br/>
only an hour and a hald from here, and it's located in a county with no <br/>
current letterboxes, so maybe we'll fill one in while we're there :)<br/>
