letterboxes that I ran out of time looking for on my 1st 2 visits and I <br/>
found out that the City of Rusk is doing some maintenance of the park.  <br/>
They are temporarily closing the trails to cut down the dead trees in <br/>
the area.  Some of the letterboxes are in the part of the park that's <br/>
being excalvated.  See list below:<br/>

NOVEMBER HOLIDAY SERIES: JB Kokopelli<br/>
Take a Hike<br/>
Mickey Mouse Birthday<br/>
Veterans Day<br/>
Thanksgiving<br/>
<br/>
I retrieved "Take a Hike" and "Mickey Mouse Birthday" from imminent <br/>
destruction and brought them home with me.  I didn't have the clues for <br/>
this series with me so I was going from memory from when I found them a <br/>
couple weeks ago.  I knew where "Veterans Day" was but I couldn't find <br/>
it and they were cutting trees down all around me so I thought it best <br/>
that I get out of there.<br/>
<br/>
CUB SCOUT SERIES:  Barefoot Lucy<br/>
<br/>
If anyone else has boxes in this park. you may want to check on them <br/>
and any one hoping to go look for them should probably wait awhile <br/>
until the city is done cutting down the dead trees and the boxes have <br/>
been replanted.<br/>
<br/>
JB:  If you contact me we can make arrangements to get "Take a Hike" <br/>
and "Mickey Mouse Birthday" back to you.<br/>
