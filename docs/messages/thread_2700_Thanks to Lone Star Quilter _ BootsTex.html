<br>
Our trip wasn't exactly what we'd planned.  We weren't able to hike <br>
today at Bastrop SP due to this odd, awful weather.  And a nasty <br>
stomach bug completely felled some of us.  But, we were able to get out <br>
and enjoy McKinney Roughs yesterday, only to find a surprise in Baby <br>
Bear's Fox in Socks box...clues to a new box by BootsTex, left just for <br>
us to find.  The boys loved it!  And when we got to BootsTex' box, <br>
there were clues to another one by Lone Star Quilter!  The boys were <br>
thrilled again!<br>
<br>
Thanks you two!  You really made our afternoon...<br>

posted on LBnA and Atlas Quest so you can now claim them.  My box is <br>
called The General - Texas Governor Series and LSQ's box is called <br>

ten more to post, but just got home and need some rest.  Look for <br>
them tomorrow.<br>

Those types of things are one of the reasons we like to road trip by <br>
car rather than flying--we like to take detours and meander around to <br>
all the good stuff.  <br>
