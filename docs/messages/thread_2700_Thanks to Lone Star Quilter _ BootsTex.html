Our trip wasn't exactly what we'd planned.  We weren't able to hike <br/>
today at Bastrop SP due to this odd, awful weather.  And a nasty <br/>
stomach bug completely felled some of us.  But, we were able to get out <br/>
and enjoy McKinney Roughs yesterday, only to find a surprise in Baby <br/>
Bear's Fox in Socks box...clues to a new box by BootsTex, left just for <br/>
us to find.  The boys loved it!  And when we got to BootsTex' box, <br/>
there were clues to another one by Lone Star Quilter!  The boys were <br/>
thrilled again!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks you two!  You really made our afternoon...<br/>

them tomorrow.<br/>

Those types of things are one of the reasons we like to road trip by <br/>
car rather than flying--we like to take detours and meander around to <br/>
all the good stuff.  <br/>
