                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, do you ever have one of those really bad letterboxing days?   <br/>
And does it ever occur when you are out of town?  I am just getting  <br/>
back into boxing after my annual winter hibernation and I'm off to a  <br/>
sour start.<br/>
<br/>
We went to Austin yesterday.  I decided to hit a few boxes as we were  <br/>
heading back to Fort Worth this evening.  I missed the first two  <br/>
because I was too late getting to the cemetery.  (Closes at 6pm.)   <br/>
The next box on my list was in a facility (private property) where  <br/>
there is a guard station.  The clues tell you that you may be stopped  <br/>
and they are specific about what you are supposed to say.  Well, the  <br/>
guard stopped us, questioned us, didn't like our answer or the way we  <br/>
looked or something, and then proceeded to search our car!  Then he  <br/>
got very belligerent.  So I explained letterboxing and what we were  <br/>
looking for.  His response: "There is a WAR going on, in case you  <br/>
didn't know, and you are telling me you are looking for hidden  <br/>
boxes!?  I should call the authorities!"  Then he ripped the clues  <br/>
out of my hand and demanded that I give him the contact number for  <br/>
the person responsible for this act of terrorism.  (My words, but  <br/>
that's the way he made it sound.)  I almost lost it.  I was so mad I  <br/>
was about to cry.  Do you ever get that mad?  My eight year old son  <br/>
was in the back of the car about to cry and THAT got me really  <br/>
steamed.   I grabbed my clues out of his hand and said, "This is MY  <br/>
property and you don't have the authority to confiscate it."  He  <br/>
tried to grab it back!  Then things got really ugly and I probably  <br/>
gave letterboxers a very bad name, but I felt like a mother bear  <br/>
protecting her cubs and her right to hunt, so I felt justified.<br/>
<br/>
By now the sun was going down and I still hadn't found a box.   So I  <br/>
stopped for one last try at a box hidden at some stables (not giving  <br/>
anything away there, it's in the clues).  I stepped in horse dookie,  <br/>
and there was a rather large (but harmless) snake right on top of the  <br/>
box that scared my husband to death, but golly darn-it I got that box  <br/>
and made friends with a nice mare to boot.  So I felt that the day  <br/>
wasn't an entire loss.  But if you happen to go searching for a box  <br/>
in Austin that requires you to stop at a guard station, be ready for  <br/>
the inquisition.<br/>
<br/>
I hope y'all are doing better in your searches.  I think tomorrow I  <br/>
will go for a nice eventless hunt in the mid-cities area.<br/>

I'm so sorry you had such an awful time in our capital city. <br/>
Amazin'Racer and I were at that box a few weeks ago, and didn't have <br/>
any trouble at the guard station. (Well, maybe two lone women look <br/>
less suspicious than a family with a kids in the back seat...) I hope <br/>
you return, and anyone else, as it is probably one of the most <br/>
beautifully carved stamps I've even found in all my 8 months of <br/>
experience. Well worth it, and more.<br/>
But on the other hand, maybe snakes are less formidable...<br/>
Happy unhibernating,<br/>

If this is where I think it is, that location used to be very open and<br/>
friendly--there were throngs of folks not associated with the facility<br/>
who would visit every day.  Sadly, I'm not surprised that you didn't<br/>
get a warm welcome, from what I've heard from other locals (though<br/>
Bloomin Gramma Jo's experience is heartening).<br/>
