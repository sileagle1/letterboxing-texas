I normally go with my kids (but they are gone for the week) or Dreamwalker (but he was at work). I had clues to 14 boxes. I was on a mission to get caught up with the last few boxes in and around Austin I don't have. The weather was nice in the morning considering the past few weeks were sweltering by 9am. I went out for the first box of my day which had recently been planted by Girlguides while they were here on vacation earlier this month. After a short walk I was happy to be the first finder! I'm sure Girlguides will be pleased someone finally found it after weeks of inactivity. Most boxes get found relatively within days of being planted around here. I suppose the heat has kept people indoors though. I then drove to my second box, this one by
 Easterbelle. There was a warning about parking issues during the week near the box but I had no problems. I enjoyed watching the Koi in the nearby fish pond for a few minutes before heading out to the 3rd box of my day also by Easterbelle. I quickly found the box and was pleased to see the image chosen this month for her chick of the month series she has been planting. Its always fun to see what she will have her chick doing every month to celebrate the holidays. I was going to head to box #4 on my list but the park was still closed as it was not near noon so I skipped that box and drove to Bee Cave, TX for the rest of my list. Box #5 on my list was a Princess S box carved by her friend Turkey Feathers. I quickly found the box and headed out of the park ready for a break. It was getting hot outside and I needed a break from all the walking . I will be 4 months pregnant next Thursday and this is probably the most walking in the heat I've done in a
 while, as I was on bed rest up until 3 weeks ago. I stopped in at Old Navy for a few minutes to cool off but left quickly to get back on my quest of boxes. My 6th box was just around the corner and I was ready to go get it. Another box by Princess S commemorating Bee Caves weather forecasting mammal. After that quick walk it was on to a box carved by a little boy, slugger 5. Its always so sweet to see young children's carves. In the same location I found another Princess S box "Who loves letterboxing?" and I checked in with the Hitch Hiker Hotel near these 2 boxes. I didn't have anything to swap out for a hitch hiker but I always like to see what there is. Box #9 was a little cryptic in its clues and as I was searching for it randomly 2 utility workers showed up out of the blue. They were walking along the road and if it wasn't for them radioing in there location I wouldn't have noticed them walking up. They stood in the shade of a near by tree watching
 me. So I felt compelled to leave. I had no idea how long they would be there and I didn't want to rouse suspicion when I didn't even know where I should really be looking. Oh well another time. Box #10 was across the street and by another boy named grandslammer (brothers). After a few minutes of frustratingly not finding it, I calmed myself down and took a second to collect myself. The heat and my annoyance with city workers getting in my way was getting to me. I then walked strait to the box and had a talk with myself about being frustrated. lol I decided I needed food. I stopped by McDonald's and grabbed a quick bite to eat. (I know, eating there without my kids! How could I? lol my kids don't even like McDonald's anymore) I then headed to Lakeway for the last few boxes on my list. By now it was past noon and if I could finish in time I could go back and get the box I skipped earlier. Box #11 on my list was by Easterbelle. The clues suggested parking
 across the street if you don't want to be ran over but I knew there was a sidewalk, in the Hamilton greenbelt, that runs under the bridge that requires a little more walking to get to but not very far and keeps you safe as well. I parked in the shade of the Hamilton greenbelt walked a little ways into it and took a left side trail, that takes another left and into the Smith greenbelt sidewalk going under the bridge. I proceeded to find the Callapitter and as I reached up for a tree to keep balance on this small incline I broke a tree out of the ground. WOW super strength! No, just a dead tree waiting for something to touch it so it could fall. I'm sure the next wind gust to come by would have done the same damage. I was unharmed though a little shaken by almost having a tree fall on me as I was falling back. I was rewarded by a first finder prize and I was quite happy and surprised by my prize. A shrinky dink made of the stamp! I loved it and
 may have to learn to make them myself. What a neat prize! On to box #12 down the same path a little further, by Easterbelle again. This one made me laugh. Yes, I can trust my eyes. I see it both ways. Well, onto box #13 on my list. My longest walk of the day for a 20 box series by Princess S. The clues give you 2 options, just go for the last box with the logbook or go for the whole set with a few surprises along the way... I was going for the whole thing but opted to get the logbook first. I wasn't sure how much energy I would have left at the end to go get the logbook, and it was just getting hotter. I was happy for the warning about bringing water and the only potty was in the parking lot. I went for the logbook and last box. Just as I rounded the first curve in the trail I saw 4 deer standing together spooked by me. I got a picture but it didn't turn out as clear as I would have liked. After stamping in I headed back down the trail and I
 went back to the parking lot to refill my water bottle and take some weight out of my bag. I wouldn't be needing to carry my sig stamps and ink pad along on the trail, just the clues, my logbook and markers. I quickly found the first few boxes and then went for a long walk with nothing in between. I got to see a bunch of Texas spinney lizards and squirrels along the way. After the one mile mark I refilled my water bottle again at the only water fountain along the trail. The boxes started picking up pace. I saw another family of deer, and then just a lone buck who followed me for a few boxes intent on finding out what I was up to and if I was a danger. He left me alone as I started heading down hill. There was a nice overlook with red building code signs on it warning people to stay off. It hadn't passed inspection. I didn't need the deck to see the view. As I continued on the lake came into view, or shall I say what is left of the lake. At 17 of the 20
 My great grandma decided to call me and wanted to chat as I was finishing up the series. Some how I skipped box 18 and found 19. I realized my mistake as she was hanging up with me and I trekked back up hill to 18. As I walked I heard the peacock cry and I stopped walking looked at my clues and went strait to the box. It was as if the peacock was telling me this is where I am, stop now and grab me. Back down hill to find my way out. The long trek back to the car took me quite a while. After 3 hours of hiking and 23 boxes later, I found myself back at the car, exhausted. It was now 5pm. My husband Dreamwalker would be getting off work any minute. It was time to head home. We decided to meet up for dinner and as we ate I logged my finds for the day. I had skipped 3 boxes of the 14 I had planned but somehow with all the bonus boxes I still had 35 finds!  from 9:30am-5p I boxed almost all day. I couldn't walk, the muscles in my legs were
 killing me but it was worth it. And I still have a few more for another day. :) Oh and now I've found 700 boxes! </div>

I'm so happy for you!!  Thank you for finding our boxes Easterbelle was started to get sad that so many of hers hadn't been found, except for me.
