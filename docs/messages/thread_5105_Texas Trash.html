I thought I'd share a comment with you that I got from a family of<br/>
letterboxers called "The Herd".  I guess they are visiting from out of<br/>
state.  They asked for clues to my box in Huntsville State Park called<br/>
"Texas Trash", in which I ask them to pick up any trash they might find<br/>
along the trail while walking to the box.  Here's the comment:<br/>

I remember when I went looking for this box not too long after you placed it I couldn't find any trash to speak of.  I guess previous finders had been just as diligent as this family.  Great idea for a box in a State Park, and a little ironic since some consider letterboxes trash.<br/>
