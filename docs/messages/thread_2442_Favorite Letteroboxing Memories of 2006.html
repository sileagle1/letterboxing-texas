                    <div class="plaintext-content">Lots of good letterboxing moments this year, so here's a few:<br>
1.  Finding great letterboxes and wonderful views along Donner Pass <br>
and around Lake Tahoe in California and NV;<br>
2.  Finally getting that elusive Rio Grande Gorge LB in New Mexico <br>
the second try (this time without police interference!);<br>
3.  Finding Kokopelli at the Lowry Ruins at Hovenweep in Colorado, <br>
and planting Howdy Man! at Canyon de Chelley in Arizona;<br>
4.  Taking the tiny Hickman Ferry across the mighty Mississippi River <br>
from Kentucky to Missouri to a little bitty river town and being FF <br>
for the Koffee Kup Kafe LB (and explaining letterboxing to the cafe <br>
owner);<br>
5.  Letterboxing along the Natchez Trace through Tennesse and <br>
Kentucky;<br>
6.  The Rusk Gathering last March, and getting to meet many <br>
letterboxers I'd known previously only by stamp, logs, or emails (and <br>
those beautiful dogwoods blooming in East Texas in the spring!  And <br>
finally finding Spring Hope, on the second try!);<br>
7.  The rapid increase in moose population around Lake Grapevine <br>
thanks to the MMMM (which I missed, but I did get to make the Moose <br>
Drool and met more local letterboxers, plus a few old friends);<br>
8.  The amazing explosion of new letterboxers - and new letterboxes! -<br>
around the DFW metroplex, with so many great new boxes, clever clues, <br>
wonderful stamps, and new places to discover right here in my own <br>
backyard! Thanks, Metroboxers!  <br>
9.   Personally:  getting closer to F 400 (currently, P39, F380, <br>
X23).  Pretty sure that there are at least 20 new boxes around here <br>
that I haven't yet looked for, so reaching 400 shouldn't be too hard.<br>
10.  Plans for 2007:  Retire some of my original boxes and replace <br>
with new series; several new Music Boxes in the works; just get out <br>
there and letterbox!  Looking forward to the gathering in March and <br>
seeing everyone again (and sharing BL's Irish Cream).<br>
<br>
Happy Letterboxing New Year, Everyone!<br>
