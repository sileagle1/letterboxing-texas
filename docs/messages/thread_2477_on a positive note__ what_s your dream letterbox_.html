&gt; My dream box to find on the other hand...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like a good hike, not too long, not too short - 2-4 miles is <br/>
&gt; nice.  Long<br/>
&gt; enough to get me out to some peace and quiet, somewhere with a view <br/>
&gt; to enjoy<br/>
&gt; - some that come to mind are Baby Bear's and Silver Eagle's boxes <br/>
&gt; in Cedar<br/>
&gt; Hill State Park, Rebel's Cameron Park Zoo #2 (in spite of the Lance<br/>
&gt; Armstrong wannabe's that nearly ran over me at the top of a wildly <br/>
&gt; careeningtrail), and The Frye Team's box, The Jig.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I like a box that has an unexpected image - I especially like Baby <br/>
&gt; Bear'smost recent boxes with that Far Side twist that allow a <br/>
&gt; glimpse at his<br/>
&gt; personality - Northern Exposure and Udder Madness come to mind.  I <br/>
&gt; also like<br/>
&gt; Delivery Girl's Chick boxes.  Quirky and unexpected.  I love humorous<br/>
&gt; stamps!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A box that tells a story - TLB's A Family Affair I think is my all-<br/>
&gt; timefavorite in this respect.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Outstanding carving is nice - Cactus Licker has done some of my <br/>
&gt; faves, like<br/>
&gt; Shawnee Trail (which I also like for its clever hide and the fact <br/>
&gt; that it<br/>
&gt; took me somewhere I probably never would've tarried at).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And a box that is wickedly difficult to solve - like Ruby Tuesday's <br/>
&gt; ScarletPimpernel.  I cursed that box and yet was drawn back to it <br/>
&gt; over and over<br/>
&gt; again for six months, slowly whittling away the solution with the<br/>
&gt; collaboration of much smarter PuddleSplasher and Gryzzled Gryphon.  <br/>
&gt; Thatsense of accomplishment?  Priceless!  (and by the way, the key <br/>
&gt; to a good<br/>
&gt; puzzle box is not in making it ambiguous in the hunt, but making it<br/>
&gt; ambiguous in the solution)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So let's see - for my favorite kind of box, we're going to see a<br/>
&gt; collaboration of Baby Bear and Cactus Licker on the image, and the <br/>
&gt; clues are<br/>
&gt; going to be written in some sort of dead language or alien space <br/>
&gt; writing,and they are going to tell a story while leading me out <br/>
&gt; into the wilderness,<br/>
&gt; where the box will be hidden on a stunning overhang, with a view to <br/>
&gt; end all<br/>
&gt; views.<br/>
