nesting!  We saw her well ahead of us and just off the<br/>
trail and she was hopping backward and oddly.  We<br/>
thought it was very strange, until we got closer and<br/>
realized she was trying to carry a patch of forest<br/>
floor material with her.  As we were approaching, she<br/>
managed to get it where she was going - to her hole in<br/>
some tree roots by a creek!  She realized we were<br/>
approaching, so she hid well away in her hole, but we<br/>
had seen her go in, so we went and stood right over<br/>
where she was.  She was rooting away and rearranging<br/>
material in her home very quietly.  We finally crossed<br/>
a bridge to the other side of the creek, where we<br/>
could easily see her.  She decided we had left so she<br/>
came out of her home and began shoveling bedding<br/>
material around and into her home - it was fascinating<br/>
to watch a mama of an odd species behave with such<br/>
care for her family.<br/>
<br/>
At another juncture, we were treated to a small flock<br/>
of red and black butterflies interspersed with small<br/>
bright blue dragonflies.  They swarmed up all around<br/>
us!<br/>
<br/>
And at yet another spot (right by a box in fact), we<br/>
saw a young snake slip away...but that was nothing<br/>
compared to the water moccasin we watched sunning from<br/>
our safe vantage point on a bridge above him!  He<br/>
appeared to be sunning and waiting for some minnows to<br/>
get close enough for him to eat, but they never did. <br/>
We even tried spitting in the water to draw them<br/>
closer, but while they would go to the spit far enough<br/>
away from him, they weren't being suckered in when it<br/>
was floating close by him!  So either water moccasins<br/>
like minnows and they know it, or water moccasins<br/>
don't care much for minnows, but minnows don't like<br/>
the way water moccasins smell!<br/>
<br/>
A good day for wildlife observation!<br/>
