                    <html><body><p>Baby Bear and I weren't sure we would be able to attend, so we signed up as day-trippers to save a spot just in case.  Because of our uncertainty we did not tell anyone we were going, even after we upgraded to overnight guests and booked our flights.  Therefore it was with glee that we surprised the other TX letterboxers when we saw them the first day.  It was great to have TX represented so well!  Since I was not sure I would be going, I did not have much time to come up with a costume for the masquerade ball.  We were supposed to dress up as our favorite letterbox, and since Boot's Murder at the Arboretum is my favorite series, I just used my Silver Eagle outfit and went as Sterling Seagull.  I know it was lame, but my heart was in the right place.  Baby Bear went as a Renegade Sheriff, so whoever placed that box should feel honored.  We even saw somebody from California dressed as the toilet seat museum box in San Antonio!<br/><br/>Some of my highlights include:  finally meeting Jay Drew, hanging out with iconic boxers that I first met at the Back To Our Roots Event 4 years ago (Der Mad Stamper, Silent Doug, Mark &amp; Sue, Team Green Dragon), meeting boxers from Michigan and playing pranks on them (and suffering the consequences), beating Baby Bear on the Rock Wall climb, and finding many creative boxes with awesome stamps (there was one that required 2 people to get and involved water).  My only lowlights were losing to Baby Bear at archery and realizing many people did not know who the iconic boxers were and their history with letterboxing.  <br/><br/>It was a great event and I highly recommend going if they have another in 5 years.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>

Great to meet all the icons of Letterboxing's beginnings, and finding the early letterboxes in Vermont.   The stories told around the dinning hall were worth the trip!   Great &amp; creative people!!!   Texas showed well at the event, as you can see from the pictures and I'm sure the upcoming video.   Choi even mentioned to me the last day that they had 10 Yr event in Oregon, and 15 Yr event in Mass, so maybe Texas would be good in the middle spot for 20 yr Event!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Thing I was most surprised with is how few people use LBNA and the LBNA Yahoo talk lists.   Seems most boxers that have come in after 2006 use only AQ, and had no idea there was a LBNA national talk list, and do not know anything about the original boxes or boxers (none of which are on AQ).   Which is sad in a way, as I looked at AQ yesterday I realized most people probably look at my stats and assume I only have placed 20 boxes, since AQ only counts what you log into it, thus numbers are incorrect for finds, places, events, etc.   That is not a big deal, but the fact that no one had found the 2 oldest boxes in Vermont in years is a big deal.  Hard to believe. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Glad I went out of State for the first time to an event, it was more than I expected!!!   <br/>
<br/>
PS - for those who went, it was great to see you there.  But, don't expect TALE 11 to be anything close to what this event was......okay, maybe we will add a few good ideas.......hmmm......more to come.<br/>

<div>I haven’t written my trip report, but I have to admit that I have been 
searching Texas for camps that would host retreats for hobby groups ever since I 
got home!  The eastern half of the state is full of camps, but they look 
just like the eastern half of the United States.  Camps in the Hill Country 
have that Texas feel that I’d love for out-of-staters to experience, but are 
hotter than blue blazes in the summertime – people would be falling like 
flies.  There are some camps west of Ft. Worth, but I think fewer boxers 
live up that way, and more volunteer organizers would have to travel farther 
during the preparation phase.  We’d really have to interview each camp to 
see how many miles of hiking trails they have, or if we can stray beyond the 
borders (if the camp was in a state forest, say).  Maybe someone has a 
relative who owns a summer camp!  The upper limit on guests at camps that 
I’ve found so far is 400, thus attendance would again be limited.  I LOVED 
the summer camp facility concept that L&amp;B XV used, though.  All the 
housing, meals, and extra activities are provided at one price, making hosting 
the event that much easier.  Still, I’d love for Der Mad Stamper and Muddy 
Paws and Choi and Travelers 4 and anyone else to actually come down and box in 
Texas during the time of year that they are thinking about holding an event in 
Texas.  Well, five years from now is a long ways away.</div>
<div>Sorry, Baby Bear and Silver Eagle, but as someone who started boxing after 
2006, I don’t understand why people are so upset with those of us who use 
AQ.  I feel like if I complained in reverse about all the boxers who use 
LBNA instead of AQ, I would be pounced on like a hungry mountain lion on a 
shivering jackrabbit.  I LOVED meeting Der Mad Stamper, and Silent Doug 
&amp; Clueless, and Jay Drew, and scores of other long-time boxers at L&amp;B 
XV.  I also love using AQ.  Can’t we all just get along?</div>

<p><span>Interesting.  Muddy Paws also 
mentioned something about having the next one in Texas.  Maybe they are 
seriously considering it.  I’d certainly be interested in helping organize 
it comes here.  <o></o></span></p>

<p><span>The hard part 
is finding a location to have an event that size.  People on AQ were angry 
the XV event had limited attendance, and many claimed they didn’t go because of 
that.  They also complained about the cost, but it seemed pretty reasonable 
for 3 nights and hot meals every day.  Where do  you find miles of 
trails and facilities to handle hundreds of people?  The larger state parks 
would work, but they are already packed when the weather is good so I doubt they 
would be very interested in working with us. <o></o></span></p>

<p><br/>Great to meet all the icons of Letterboxing's beginnings, and finding the 
early letterboxes in Vermont. The stories told around the dinning hall were 
worth the trip! Great &amp; creative people!!! Texas showed well at the event, 
as you can see from the pictures and I'm sure the upcoming video. Choi even 
mentioned to me the last day that they had 10 Yr event in Oregon, and 15 Yr 
event in Mass, so maybe Texas would be good in the middle spot for 20 yr 
Event!!!!<br/><br/>Thing I was most surprised with is how few people use LBNA and 
the LBNA Yahoo talk lists. Seems most boxers that have come in after 2006 use 
only AQ, and had no idea there was a LBNA national talk list, and do not know 
anything about the original boxes or boxers (none of which are on AQ). Which is 
sad in a way, as I looked at AQ yesterday I realized most people probably look 
at my stats and assume I only have placed 20 boxes, since AQ only counts what 
you log into it, thus numbers are incorrect for finds, places, events, etc. That 
is not a big deal, but the fact that no one had found the 2 oldest boxes in 
Vermont in years is a big deal. Hard to believe. <br/><br/>Anyway, Glad I went out 
of State for the first time to an event, it was more than I expected!!! 
<br/><br/>PS - for those who went, it was great to see you there. But, don't 
expect TALE 11 to be anything close to what this event was......okay, maybe we 
will add a few good ideas.......hmmm......more to come.<o></o></p></div>

2006, I donât understand why people are so upset with those of us who use 
AQ.  I feel like if I complained in reverse about all the boxers who use 
LBNA instead of AQ, I would be pounced on like a hungry mountain lion on a 
shivering jackrabbit.  I LOVED meeting Der Mad Stamper, and Silent Doug 
&amp; Clueless, and Jay Drew, and scores of other long-time boxers at L&amp;B 
XV.  I also love using AQ.  Canât we all just get along?</div>

<p><span>Interesting.  Muddy Paws also 
mentioned something about having the next one in Texas.  Maybe they are 
seriously considering it.  Iâd certainly be interested in helping organize 
it comes here.  </span></p>
<p><span></span></p>
<p><span>The hard part 
is finding a location to have an event that size.  People on AQ were angry 
the XV event had limited attendance, and many claimed they didnât go because of 
that.  They also complained about the cost, but it seemed pretty reasonable 
for 3 nights and hot meals every day.  Where do  you find miles of 
trails and facilities to handle hundreds of people?  The larger state parks 
would work, but they are already packed when the weather is good so I doubt they 
would be very interested in working with us. </span></p>
<p><a name="_MailEndCompose" rel="nofollow"><span></span></a></p>
<p><span>As for good 
ideasâ¦attending other events is certainly inspiring.  I attended the 
Grateful letterboxing event last year and found inspiration for the Halloween 
event last fall.  </span></p>

<p><br/>Great to meet all the icons of Letterboxing's beginnings, and finding the 
early letterboxes in Vermont. The stories told around the dinning hall were 
worth the trip! Great &amp; creative people!!! Texas showed well at the event, 
as you can see from the pictures and I'm sure the upcoming video. Choi even 
mentioned to me the last day that they had 10 Yr event in Oregon, and 15 Yr 
event in Mass, so maybe Texas would be good in the middle spot for 20 yr 
Event!!!!<br/><br/>Thing I was most surprised with is how few people use LBNA and 
the LBNA Yahoo talk lists. Seems most boxers that have come in after 2006 use 
only AQ, and had no idea there was a LBNA national talk list, and do not know 
anything about the original boxes or boxers (none of which are on AQ). Which is 
sad in a way, as I looked at AQ yesterday I realized most people probably look 
at my stats and assume I only have placed 20 boxes, since AQ only counts what 
you log into it, thus numbers are incorrect for finds, places, events, etc. That 
is not a big deal, but the fact that no one had found the 2 oldest boxes in 
Vermont in years is a big deal. Hard to believe. <br/><br/>Anyway, Glad I went out 
of State for the first time to an event, it was more than I expected!!! 
<br/><br/>PS - for those who went, it was great to see you there. But, don't 
expect TALE 11 to be anything close to what this event was......okay, maybe we 
will add a few good ideas.......hmmm......more to come.</p></div>

As for possible XX in Texas, everyone's help would be needed.   I would bet it will come down to Texas or Great Lakes area, with Great Lakes in the lead due to more active boxers right now.  <br/>

They also complained about the cost, but it seemed pretty reasonable for 3 nights and hot meals every day.  Where do  you find miles of trails and facilities to handle hundreds of people?  The larger state parks would work, but they are already packed when the weather is good so I doubt they would be very interested in working with us. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for good ideas…attending other events is certainly inspiring.  I attended the Grateful letterboxing event last year and found inspiration for the Halloween event last fall.  <br/>

&gt; Great to meet all the icons of Letterboxing's beginnings, and finding the early letterboxes in Vermont. The stories told around the dinning hall were worth the trip! Great &amp; creative people!!! Texas showed well at the event, as you can see from the pictures and I'm sure the upcoming video. Choi even mentioned to me the last day that they had 10 Yr event in Oregon, and 15 Yr event in Mass, so maybe Texas would be good in the middle spot for 20 yr Event!!!!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thing I was most surprised with is how few people use LBNA and the LBNA Yahoo talk lists. Seems most boxers that have come in after 2006 use only AQ, and had no idea there was a LBNA national talk list, and do not know anything about the original boxes or boxers (none of which are on AQ). Which is sad in a way, as I looked at AQ yesterday I realized most people probably look at my stats and assume I only have placed 20 boxes, since AQ only counts what you log into it, thus numbers are incorrect for finds, places, events, etc. That is not a big deal, but the fact that no one had found the 2 oldest boxes in Vermont in years is a big deal. Hard to believe. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, Glad I went out of State for the first time to an event, it was more than I expected!!! <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; PS - for those who went, it was great to see you there. But, don't expect TALE 11 to be anything close to what this event was......okay, maybe we will add a few good ideas.......hmmm......more to come.<br/>

&gt; I havenÃ¢ÂÂt written my trip report, but I have to admit that I have been searching Texas for camps that would host retreats for hobby groups ever since I got home!  The eastern half of the state is full of camps, but they look just like the eastern half of the United States.  Camps in the Hill Country have that Texas feel that IÃ¢ÂÂd love for out-of-staters to experience, but are hotter than blue blazes in the summertime Ã¢Â" people would be falling like flies.  There are some camps west of Ft. Worth, but I think fewer boxers live up that way, and more volunteer organizers would have to travel farther during the preparation phase.  WeÃ¢ÂÂd really have to interview each camp to see how many miles of hiking trails they have, or if we can stray beyond the borders (if the camp was in a state forest, say).  Maybe someone has a relative who owns a summer camp!  The upper limit on guests at camps that IÃ¢ÂÂve found so far is 400, thus attendance would again be limited.  I LOVED the summer camp facility concept that L&amp;B XV used, though.  All the housing, meals, and extra activities are provided at one price, making hosting the event that much easier.  Still, IÃ¢ÂÂd love for Der Mad Stamper and Muddy Paws and Choi and Travelers 4 and anyone else to actually come down and box in Texas during the time of year that they are thinking about holding an event in Texas.  Well, five years from now is a long ways away.<br/>
&gt; Sorry, Baby Bear and Silver Eagle, but as someone who started boxing after 2006, I donÃ¢ÂÂt understand why people are so upset with those of us who use AQ.  I feel like if I complained in reverse about all the boxers who use LBNA instead of AQ, I would be pounced on like a hungry mountain lion on a shivering jackrabbit.  I LOVED meeting Der Mad Stamper, and Silent Doug &amp; Clueless, and Jay Drew, and scores of other long-time boxers at L&amp;B XV.  I also love using AQ.  CanÃ¢ÂÂt we all just get along?<br/>
