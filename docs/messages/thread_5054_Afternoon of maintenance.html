                    <div class="plaintext-content">I spent the afternoon circling around McKinney checking on my boxes and replacing logbooks, plastic bags or boxes as needed. Then I came home to tweak any necessary adjustments to the clues. I'm happy to report that all my "active" boxes in the McKinney area are alive and well and in good condition, with plenty of room in the log books to stamp in. I'm especially happy to announce that the box that had previously been reported as missing due to a geocache being placed on top of it was, in fact, still in it's happy location where it has been for the past five years. There is however a small geocache in a nearby tree, so obviously the letterboxer who had been looking for my box was "barking up the wrong tree". So... my apologies for thinking some geocacher had put their box on top of mine - not the case! Whoo Hoo! Now it's time to hide some new boxes!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I alway remember the time I went looking for a box of Lucy Locket's right<br>
after she and Blue Butterfly started letterboxing.  I had been letterboxing<br>
a couple of years at that time and felt pretty smug in my ability to follow<br>
clues.  I followed her clues exactly, only to find the box wasn't there.  I<br>
started over and went at it again, with the same results.  I wrote to her<br>
telling her that her box was missing and I knew it was because I had<br>
followed her clues and everything had fallen into place and I was very sure<br>
I had wound up at the right location - and done it all twice - and the box<br>
was simply missing.  I figured "Newbie boxer.  They always lose a few at<br>
first."  She wrote back and said "Odd.  My mother found it just yesterday.<br>
I'll check on it when I get a chance."  Or something to that effect, in her<br>
nicest Lucy Locket way.  I went out there again to prove to myself that it<br>
wasn't there, only to find that had I not locked in on the very first leg<br>
of the clue and thus thrown myself off for the whole rest of the clue, I<br>
would've realized there was an even righter way of looking at that first<br>
leg.  It was pure coincidence that the clues worked after I took that first<br>
misstep, but it's a coincidence that happens more often than we realize.</div>

I'm with you too, Phoenix. I don't like to log attempt until I've contacted the placer, and made double/triple sure it's really not there. <br>
BL, there is a way to log attempts and keep it personal on AQ, I use the colored stars, my attempts receiving a yellow star, so I know I've looked.  I don't think there's a way on LBNA. Anyone know?<br>

If everyone viewed attempts as you do, I think there wouldn't be a
problem. In fact, I love that you see one Attempt as a challenge!<br/>
<br/>
However, there are many letterboxers who want a sure thing and one
attempt waves them off that box. Frankly, I don't think those folks
are cut out for letterboxing, but whatever. You would be amazed at the
numbers of people that write to the webmasters on LBNA (and AQ, I'm
sure) to ask which boxes are guaranteed to be there. Thankfully Jay
Drew and Choi are much more patient than I am, and they write a nice
note to those folks saying there are no guarantees but you can still
have fun, blah blah blah. My inclination is to say "None of them are
guaranteed to be there, so go take up knitting!"<br/>

<div>My two cents for what it's worth. (I'm an old newbie. I've been doing this for a few years and love letterboxing, but my counts are low because time is generally tight.)</div>
<div><u></u></div>It's always a question for me. I just looked back at my attempts on AQ, and for the most part, the box was dead when I attempted it. Most have not been found again after my attempt. There are a couple of Boots Tex's boxes that he shows maintenance on and then they were revived, <b>but</b> there are also a couple that were attempted by one or two people after me and then they suddenly started getting found again. I don't know if the planter stepped in or we just missed it.
<div><u></u></div>
<div>I've gotten now to the point that I'm very hesitant to list an attempt. I don't want to assume that I'm 100% accurate in my search and the only conclusion is that the box is no longer there. I don't want to be the guy that keeps others from seeking a box because I botched the clues. Then again, I don't want to be the guy that doesn't report and lets others waste time going out seeking a box that is gone... </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I never log attempts because, when I first started letterboxing it was widely believed that an attempt on a box was a "death sentence" and that box would be considered as missing.  I do, however, contact the placer and explain that I couldn't find the box, even though I believed that I was looking in the right place. If I am uncertain whether I am following the clues correctly, or if I'm just plain confused, I just don't log anything.  When I receive a first "attempt" report on one of my boxes, I generally ignore it, unless it's from someone I know and trust, like Wry Me.  At the second attempt, I'll mark the box as unavailable and place a note on the clue page that the box has been reported as missing.  If I have no intention of checking on it, I may just retire it.  I have one box which, in the last four notices was: attempted, attempted, found and attempted.  I put those boxes on a "check list" and whenever we make a trip in that direction, I'll go by and check on them, sometimes even bringing a new stamp and box just in case it's really missing.  As often as not, the box is intact and right where it should be.  Fifty percent is enough to make me skeptical of "attempted" reports.  If anyone ever has a reported problem with a box that is anywhere near Coldpspring, Texas, let me know and I'll try to check on it for you.  Last week I was down in the Beaumont area to place a box and I noticed a box by a prominent letterbox in a state park that was nearby.  It was placed in 2008 before Hurricane Ike and had never been found.  There was one attempt report and the box was assumed missing.  I had no problem finding the box by following the simple clues.  Unfortunately, the lid and the stamp were missing and the logbook slightly water damaged, but it was there.  I think most people still believe that "attempts" means the same as "missing".<br>
