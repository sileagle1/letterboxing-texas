(I've been sick for several weeks; another drs. appt this afternoon) and my 6 
year old son came in and crawled beside me, kind of flopping down on my 
husband's pillow. He said, "Mom, we have just *GOT* to go letterboxing. It has 
been sooooo long!" It was the cutest thing. I agreed and it turns out that he 
had found his letterboxing bag in the closet and was dying to use the stamp. So 
he ended up pretending he was letterboxing and stamping lots of sheets of paper 
with his older brother. Very cute and very funny.</font></div>
