                    <div class="plaintext-content">My bayou (White Oak) is much more full than usual, but well within <br>
its banks.  I'm not so worried about it.  I am concerned about Dean & <br>
what next week brings.  In so many places around the state (like <br>
here), the ground is saturated and the reservoirs are full.  <br>
<br>
Yesterday was bad in spots, fine in others (we hardly had any street <br>
flooding in my area of town).  It's all a function of which area gets <br>
too much rain too quickly.  And there's really no predicting that.  <br>
When I saw the CNN guy on the news talking about how badly Houston <br>
was hit by Erin, that wasn't my experience at all (but unfortunately <br>
it was fatal for some).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Brayes Bayou is a little higher than normal, but still looking pretty <br>
good.  And although we saw several heavy bands of rains, my side of <br>
town (Sugar Land area) faired pretty well yesterday.  But DH arrived <br>
home from work yesterday a little early and a lot stressed by his <br>
commute.  He works in Deer Park, about 45 miles from home.  That area <br>
is closer to the coast and experienced power outages and some <br>
flooding.  He got home about half an hour early... but had actually <br>
left work 2-1/2 hours early.  He said the water was about 4 feet deep <br>
in some places.  Even in his truck, he had to back-track and find <br>
alternate routes.  The news showed several cars in that area <br>
completely under water.<br>
<br>
I am also concerned about Dean adding more water to already saturated <br>
ground, and to waterways that are already above normal levels.  Keep <br>
us in your prayers.<br>
