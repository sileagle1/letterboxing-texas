<br>
When I got it the first time, it wasn't a big deal, just a bit on my hand...but the second time I had scratched my head and ended up with poison ivy all over my skull.  So painful and horrid in the middle of a Texas summer.  Now, I just look at the stuff funny and I start to break out.<br>
<br>
We should all, as planters, come armed with knowledge of what poison ivy looks like--avoid hairy vines in winter!<br>
<br>
But as finders, we should understand that sometimes the stuff just happens.  At planting time, there's no poison ivy there and over the course of the growing season it appears (sometimes years later).  Bring your tecnu, but be flexible about whether a box is worth finding.  <br>
<br>
For me, a box in the middle of a poison ivy stand is a box I'll try later.  I actually have a few boxes I can't do maintenance on because I can't reach them.<br>
<br>
For the sensitive among us, it's nasty stuff masquerading as an innocent little vine.<br>

I wonder how carbs/sugars affect the action of urushiol on the skin. Interesting...sounds like a Bell Motel or Whiz Gee explanation might shed some light. <br/>

I like Technu myself, which acts as an oil solvent on the urushiol. I've also used dishwashing liquid which seemed to work too when applied asap after exposure.</p>
