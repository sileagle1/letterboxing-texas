<title>Re:  Boxes left out and logbooks</title>
</head>
<body>
<span>Thank you so much.  It turns out the Raf’s Bat isn’t missing after all!   Yay!  <br/>
<br/>
I’m not upset about the moons.  Mainly I hate to lose the logbooks.  Any stamp can be re-carved, but the logbooks are irreplaceable.  All of that history...just gone.  I’ve always fought the urge to frequently replace logbooks, so that if one goes missing, I only lose the most recent additions...but I deep down feel that the logbooks, as well as the stamps, are there for other boxers, not me.  One of my favorite parts of finding a box is looking through the logbook to see all of the previous finders.  And it is especially exciting to find one that’s been around for a long, long time.  So, instead of replacing, I try to visit my boxes frequently to check in with the logbooks, see who all’s come by.  It’s surprising how many people stamp in but don’t log finds on the web.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I’m cool with it.  I’ll won’t replant the moons, but I have several new boxes ready to go out closer to spring.<br/>

I can't believe that! I was really looking forward to doing the ESOT series! I already had a couple of them but that series was so good that I wanted to get them all....that really bums me out! Any chance you will be re-carving any of these? Fortunately, I had Mean Moon and Moonrise. Those were some of the first ones I did.  So sorry, I know how much time and work is involved in getting a box together and to have it disappear is very frustrating...for you and others! Don't let it get you down. Keep on carving, your much  appreciated.<br/>

I now have 5 total missing: <br/>
<br/>
ESOT: Rafinesque’s Big-Eared Bat, ESOT: Jaguarundi, Stretch, Moonrise, and Mean Moon.  <br/>
<br/>
I’m not going to replace the two moons, and the ESOT’s and Stretch will have to wait a while.  I’ve fallen ill and I can’t even think about carving right now.  I happen to have hard copies of the stamps, though, thank goodness.  <br/>
<br/>
I have this tendency to hide boxes near creeks and lakes.  I hope that they just washed away instead of succumbing to some Muggle’s vandalism.  I hate the thought of some thieving teen miscreant stamping their math notebook with my giraffe or moon!!!  Acts of God and honest mistakes I can understand...stupidity and meanness I cannot.  <br/>

Well, two of my boxes have gone missing in just a few days. I've been going<br/>
around checking on my plants and have found SIX of them left out in the<br/>
open, and the logbooks left out of the plastic bags. It looks like the<br/>
Metroplex may have some newbies that aren't quite up to speed on protocol.<br/>
 <br/>
If you are new to boxing, please be sure to hide the boxes well, and please<br/>
put logbooks and stamps in their labeled baggies.<br/>
 <br/>
Thanks,<br/>
