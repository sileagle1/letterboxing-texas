<div>Hey you all!  We just arrived back in the 
great state of Texas after a long road trip to Michigan's upper penninsula...a 
beautiful, breathtaking spot to say the least.  We found a few boxes while 
there, in some of the most wonderful spots, and with stamps that rival even 
Baby Bear and Monkeytoes carving.  My little Texans couldn't brave the cold 
waters of Lake Superior (spoiled as they are by Gulf waters) but they hiked 
their little feet off...much easier to do in temps. of around 60-70...imagine 
being cold at night tent camping in July!  We also planted a box called the 
lost Texans, so if you ever happen to be in Marquette MI you'll have to go 
hunting!  Since there are over 800 messages in my in box I fear I will 
never read I'll just tell you all ahead of time if I don't reply to something it 
is not out of rudeness, but I'll never be able to read all that!  
Seems a lot has happened since we left, or maybe it is just so hot everyone is 
writing instead of boxing.  Either way, we are happy to be back in Texas, 
that's for sure!  -Mother of Five </div></body></html>

<div>Welcome back! My sister and her family used to live up there, and my niece was on swim team. I jokingly accused my sister of child abuse, because that poor kid had to go jump in a pool at 8 a.m., and to us, it felt like winter outside!!!  By noon, when it was all of 70, they would complain about the heat and humidity....... puhlezze!</div>

<div>Good to have you back!!  Oh, and we found your 
star wars series the other day, and all were alive, but Dark Side was a little 
wet.  It looked like the bayou had been up that high...  Just 
FYI</div>
