                    <div class="plaintext-content">I decided to take advantage of an extra hour of sunlight this evening by trying to find a few letterboxes.  I successfully found 4, and then went to a cemetery for my final stop.  The clue was vague enough that I had to guess which set of plants the clue was referring to.  I incorrectly chose 2 yucca plants.  Let me just stop here, and highly recommend you never plant a letterbox by a yucca plant.  While leaning into the bush, one of the "leaves" (if you can call this sword-like stem a leaf) pierced me in the knee through my work pants.  I had an initial "ouch" feeling, but no biggie.  When I realized I had the wrong plant, I began to walk away from the plant, and I felt something wet on my leg; it was blood.  Now, I am no wimp.  I have seen many gross things in my lifetime, and generally am not really bothered by them so much.  However, I have never in my life seen as much blood as I did at this point.  I became physically nauseous, a reaction I have never had to blood before.  I am very glad I had on black dress pants because if I had had on any other color, I am sure they would have been ruined.  Of course I couldn't find any band-aids. Thankfully last week I had placed some paper towels in the car.  I was shocked at how quickly it clotted, and I was able to get back to my search.  I ended up finding the letterbox in a much safer location, and to my surprise, there was a HH inside.  Yippee!  It made the whole experience worth it!  That said, my husband is always telling me that a sport isn't a real sport unless someone can get hurt.  With that reasoning in mind, I have decided that letterboxing can certainly now be defined as a sport.<br>

I hope you all have enjoyed boxing during your Spring Breaks, and with this extra hour of daylight!<br>
