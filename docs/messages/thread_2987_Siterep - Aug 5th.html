                    <div class="plaintext-content">We started at 6:45 am.  Our first stop was River Legacy Trails in <br>
Arlington so that Wag Time could place a neat series called Four <br>
Legged Friends which is dedicated to her beloved pets both past and <br>
present.  We then went to Randol Mil Park in Arlington and found A <br>
Gecko's Tale.  Nice stamp, but didnt find any geckos.  We then went <br>
to find Lake Chase #1 at Lake Arlington.  The location of the box <br>
has numerous newly downed trees and part of the area where the box <br>
should be is under water.  We then went to find Wassily and Joan at <br>
Play in Gene Schrikland (sp?) park in Arlington.  Instead of the <br>
letterbox, we found a geocache..but no letterbox.  We then went to <br>
Elkins Park in Dalworthington Gardens to find Man's Best Friend.  <br>
The clues were very confusing and we didnt find the box.  We did <br>
find A Tree Grew in the same park.  Our next stop was FJ "Red" Kane <br>
Park in Arlington and picked up the Pepper box.  The logbook was<br>
soaked and did not have a logbook to replace it with.  Our next stop <br>
was Cliff Nelson Recreation Center and found the Jazz Quartet Bass <br>
Guitar box.  We then attempted the Gir Box at the Putt Putt place in<br>
Haltam City, but did not find it.  As we left this location on Hwy <br>
820 I noticed a guy on a motorcycle who actually had shoulder pads <br>
and a back pad on along with a helmet.  As I was watching him in my <br>
rear view mirror, I saw him pop a wheelie.  A couple of minutes <br>
later he passed us going about 70 mph and as he passed he poppled <br>
another wheelie in the fast lane.  He then proceeded to stand on the <br>
motorcycle (not on the seat) and then when he sat down he poppled <br>
another wheelie...strange things happen in the Dallas area.  We then <br>
went to North Park and found the Texas State Symbols - Armadillo.  <br>
Great stamp.  We dropped off the Sgt HH in this box.  Went to look <br>
for What's in a Name at Fossil Creek Park in Richland Hills, but did <br>
not find the box.  We then went to find the Catch the Wind box in <br>
Bedford, but there was no pile of rocks.  It looks as though the <br>
limbs had recently been cut, so it may have been discovered.  This <br>
was still a neat site.  We then went to Bedford Cemetery to find the <br>
Bedford Settlers Reunion box.  The 3 trunk tree that it was in had <br>
lost one of its trunks, which had fallen.  The rocks were scattered <br>
all over, and there was no sign of a letterbox.  We then went to <br>
Grapevine Cemetery in Grapevine and found the Lone Star State box.  <br>
Next we went to Heritage Park in Grapevine to look for Moose-ic Man <br>
and it appeared that it must have been washed away.  Our last box <br>
for the day was at Delaney Vineyards in Grapevine.  The Delaney <br>
Vineyard box was right where it should have been.  Back home we went.<br>

PS On Saturday we also did find the Time Warp box at the Brazos <br>
Drive in Theatre in Granbury.<br>
