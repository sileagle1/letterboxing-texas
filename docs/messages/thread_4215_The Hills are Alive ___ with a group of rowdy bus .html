They stuck with me while I defended my dissertation proposal (I'm sure it their last minute advice that helped me pass).  They tried to jump in the car at least twice as I traveled, but I was terrified that that would get themselves lost with me as the last known contact.<br>
<br>
They've been feeling the heat and asked about heading to the mountains for some cooler temperatures.  I obviously couldn't take them to Colorado (they mentioned skiing) and wasn't sure that that I could handle a road trip to the Guadalupe Mountains with them.  So I did the best I could.  I found a beautiful tall hill where I can keep an occasional eye on them until they reach their next stop.<br>
<br>
I took the bus to the next stop today at lunch but they were uncomfortable since there was a stranger in the parking lot.  So we tried again after work and they are successfully on their way.<br>
<br>
Make your way through Hawkins, Texas, heading north.  On the north side of town there is a large grocery store.  Hang a right onto FM 1795.  We went about 6.5 miles and turned left onto FM 1002.  Barrel down the road about 3.7 miles until you get to FM 49 and turn right.  You will see a picturesque little country church on the left about 1/4 mile down the road.  Behind that is a formidable hill and cemetery.  Climb the hill close to the fence on the left.  There is a clearing/trail into the woods parallel to the fenceline.  From the treeline, take approximately 18 steps.  On the right you will see some brush, fallen trees, and what looks like cross ties.  The TTB2 is waiting for you there.<br>
<br>
If you do a little homework, I have a box planted here (not the exact spot, but very close) dedicated to Emma Sansom that can be found on LBNA or AQ.  I would recommend wearing shoes suitable for moderate climbing (not really cute/trendy work shoes) and not sliding down the hill on your bum.  It's hard on the wrists - and the bum.<br>
