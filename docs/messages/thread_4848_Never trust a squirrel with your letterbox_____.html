You know when you sometimes find a letterbox with teeth marks on it?  Those little white particles at the bottom of the box are from the lid.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know exactly what you're talking about.  I recently had the same experience with one of the squirrels that live in the trees behind my house.  I buy sunflower seeds for them and I place a bowl on my patio for them to eat in hopes that they'll leave the birdseed for the birds.  That's another story.  I got tired of storing the sunflower seeds and birdseed in my pantry so I brought a couple "Roughneck" containers in from the garage and I filled them up with the newly purchased bags of sunflower seeds and wild bird seed.  I placed both of them on the patio assuming they would be safe from the weather.  The very next day I happen to walk past the patio door and I saw one of the squirrels sitting on the corner of the container with the sunflower seeds and eating some seeds.  I figured he was using the container as a table and had taken some of the seeds out of his bowl. As I continued to watch him his head disappeared through the lid and I realized he had eaten his way through the corner of the lid and made himself a hole big enough to get his head through.  The containers are now sitting in the corner of the kitchen. <br>

I loved your picture of the squirrel eating the cookie.  Thanks for sharing.<br>

One day he was entirely distracted so I looked out the window, and there was a squirrel periodically popping its head out the lid of the trash can! We went out to investigate and found that there was a layer of sunflower seed husks two inches deep in that trash can - they had been at it for awhile! We spent way more time than we should have watching the squirrels rob us of food, then we started trying to think of ways to trap him in the can and spent time every evening working to rig the lid in various ways to make it so they could get in, but not out. At this point, I really have no idea why we thought this was a good idea, but I think we must have gone from curiosity about the squirrel to a wartime mentality.

I guess if we had to survive in the wild we'd look for food any way we could too!  I to have trouble keeping them away from the birdseed like you do.  I like watching the birds and squirrels come and eat on my patio and I also have a birdfeeder in the front yard so I can watch from my office and occasionally I have to chase the squirrels away from it too.<br>

We used a white 8"pvc pipe to make a pole to put the feeder on. They never get more than 3' off the ground with a running start and the pole is to wide and slippery for them to climb.  The only problem we found was the leeping off branches, so I cut back any branch they can leep from. She gives the squirrels food on the porch but it's never enough. The mama had 3 babys this spring and they are so cute! My g.g. Wanted me to catch them and take them home with me.

<p>Hello BL.  This is so funny.  I didn't realize just how smart those squirrels are until now.  I guess if we had to survive in the wild we'd look for food any way we could too!  I to have trouble keeping them away from the birdseed like you do.  I like watching the birds and squirrels come and eat on my patio and I also have a birdfeeder in the front yard so I can watch from my office and occasionally I have to chase the squirrels away from it too.<br/>

&gt; Well Mother's Love - now I feel better!  My family makes fun of me because I<br/>
&gt; put platters of seed out around the yard for the squirrels so they will<br/>
&gt; leave the bird feeders alone.  I also put out bowls of water for them since<br/>
&gt; I know it must be difficult to find water right now...  They STILL don't<br/>
&gt; leave the bird feeders alone entirely, but I think it must cut the problem<br/>
&gt; back a little bit.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Several years ago, when we were much younger and more naive and thoughts<br/>
&gt; squirrels were trustworthy, we kept a plastic trash can of bird seed on the<br/>
&gt; front porch.  The trash can had a flip lid - we figured out of sight, out of<br/>
&gt; mind was good enough.  Fools we were!  D'vir and I were homeschooling at the<br/>
&gt; time and we could see the bird feeders, the porch, and the trash can out our<br/>
&gt; classroom window.  One day he was entirely distracted so I looked out the<br/>
&gt; window, and there was a squirrel periodically popping its head out the lid<br/>
&gt; of the trash can!  We went out to investigate and found that there was a<br/>
&gt; layer of sunflower seed husks two inches deep in that trash can - they had<br/>
&gt; been at it for awhile!  We spent way more time than we should have watching<br/>
&gt; the squirrels rob us of food, then we started trying to think of ways to<br/>
&gt; trap him in the can and spent time every evening working to rig the lid in<br/>
&gt; various ways to make it so they could get in, but not out.  At this point, I<br/>
&gt; really have no idea why we thought this was a good idea, but I think we must<br/>
&gt; have gone from curiosity about the squirrel to a wartime mentality.  We were<br/>
&gt; never able to outwit the squirrels with the lid and finally, Fearless Fox<br/>
&gt; suggested we put the food somewhere inaccessible.  Sort of took the wind out<br/>
&gt; of our sails, but still - it was a logical solution to the problem we had<br/>
&gt; lost sight of.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I STILL keep a trash can on the front porch for bird food, but it is made of<br/>
&gt; metal, has a really tight lid which we bungee cord on with two bungees, and<br/>
&gt; we keep it under a bench on the porch.  They would have to move the bench or<br/>
&gt; the can (which usually weighs about 10-20 pounds), chew through the cords,<br/>
&gt; and wrench the lid off. I fully expect to find they have managed all that<br/>
&gt; one day.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know exactly what you're talking about. I recently had the same<br/>
&gt; &gt; experience with one of the squirrels that live in the trees behind my house.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I buy sunflower seeds for them and I place a bowl on my patio for them to<br/>
&gt; &gt; eat in hopes that they'll leave the birdseed for the birds. That's another<br/>
&gt; &gt; story. I got tired of storing the sunflower seeds and birdseed in my pantry<br/>
&gt; &gt; so I brought a couple "Roughneck" containers in from the garage and I filled<br/>
&gt; &gt; them up with the newly purchased bags of sunflower seeds and wild bird seed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I placed both of them on the patio assuming they would be safe from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; weather. The very next day I happen to walk past the patio door and I saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; one of the squirrels sitting on the corner of the container with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; sunflower seeds and eating some seeds. I figured he was using the container<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a table and had taken some of the seeds out of his bowl. As I continued<br/>
&gt; &gt; to watch him his head disappeared through the lid and I realized he had<br/>
&gt; &gt; eaten his way through the corner of the lid and made himself a hole big<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough to get his head through. The containers are now sitting in the corner<br/>
&gt; &gt; of the kitchen.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I loved your picture of the squirrel eating the cookie. Thanks for sharing.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; You know when you sometimes find a letterbox with teeth marks on it?<br/>
&gt; &gt; Those little white particles at the bottom of the box are from the lid.<br/>
