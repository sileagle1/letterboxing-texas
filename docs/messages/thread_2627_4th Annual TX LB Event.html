<div>To echo the sentiments of everyone else, a big thanks goes out to Baby Bear and Silver Eagle for organizing the event on Saturday.  What a beautiful day at Sommerville!  It was great visiting with familiar faces and meeting new ones.  After the letterboxing trivia game<span contenteditable="false" style="DISPLAY: inline-block"></span>, many ventured out to find the planted letterboxes around the park.  Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter were kind enough to let me travel with them, and we had a fabulous time out there searching for and finding the boxes!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just as we were about to set out on our adventure, M-Dot, my LSS showed up on his bike ( he biked from Houston to the park) so we visited with him for a few minutes.  He apparently napped in a spot of sun for a couple of hours afterwards while we were out letterboxing but did manage to be somewhat social after the nap!  As the sun started to set and temperatures began to drop, we packed up the car and headed home.  The conversation in the car centered around the day and how much fun we both had at Sommerville.  Michael didn't do the letterboxing part of the day, but he really enjoyed the conversation with others around the big camp fire.  Our Texas letterboxing friends are truly some of the nicest people around. Thanks again for a wonderful day!!</div>
