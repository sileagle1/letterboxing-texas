                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I'm Amy, and I'm 1/3 of "The Spirit Seekers."<br>
<br>
I discovered Letterboxing in a very roundabout way.  To start, I am a member of FindAGrave.com, where volunteers (called "gravers") take the time out to archive burials and photograph headstones in cemeteries all over the world.  I'd been having a problem where the GPS coordinates for individual cemeteries in my area were incorrect, added from a database (NGS??) based on data taken...well, too long ago.  Cemeteries are mislabeled on it, yada yada.  Anyway, I went searching for portable GPS devices so that, when I'm out photographing, I can get the REAL coordinates and submit corrections to the site.  While searching for that, Amazon suggest a book about Geocaching.  I Wiki up geocaching, read, enjoy, but am dejected because I couldn't start it until I got a GPS device.  (Still shopping around, haven't bought one yet.)  But lo and behold, what's this "Letterboxing" on the suggested articles list?  I read, I enjoy, I'm hooked.  I utter many variations on "OMG HOW COOL COME LOOK!" and pull my housemates away from XBOX and sci-fi novel, respectively.<br>
<br>
This all happens on a Monday night.  Tuesday was spent looking for boxes we wanted to try for.  Wednesday afternoon, we whip up our simple yet elegant (IMO) personal stamp and head out (as Wednesdays are Sarah's short days).  We're addicted.<br>
<br>
Our trail name "The Spirit Seekers" comes from my FindAGrave username, "Amy the Spirit Seeker".  (Inspired by an amazing Lubbock-area graver who goes by "Shawn the Grave Hunter".)  So, as a group, and for lack of anything else, I dubbed us "The Spirit Seekers."<br>
<br>
So to introduce:  I'm Amy; I usually pick the boxes and do the driving.  Rob is my husband, clue decoder and "eagle eye".  Sarah, our housemate my "big sis by choice", is our stamp carver (only 3 so far, personal and 2 plants, but more to come).  We've been living in Brenham since October '08, relocated from near Lubbock, where we're pretty much from (we're all movers!)  We hope to place boxes in old haunts and family spots - Crosby, Lubbock, Armstrong, Lee (we're the only one listed there!), and now Washington counties.  I'm trying to work out a way that my graving and our letterboxing can be incorporated, so expect to see plenty of boxes in cemeteries!  :)<br>

<br>
Welcome to the world of Texas Letterboxing.  I am a "sometimes" graver, mostly just locally in my county of residence.  I letterbox much more often, and there are a lot of letterboxes in cemeteries and, in fact, I enjoy letterboxing in cemeteries because they are quiet and there's usually no one around except the residents, and they don't mind.  When I plan a trip and I know I'm going to be looking for a letterbox in a certain cemetery, I check for photo requests and write the information down and put it with my letterbox clues.  I don't claim the photo until I get back with the pictures, in case my plans change and I don't get around to taking the picture or can't find it.  It's a good way to work both hobbies together.  Have a great time letterboxing: we do.<br>

  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Hello all! I'm Amy, and I'm 1/3 
  of "The Spirit Seekers."<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I discovered Letterboxing in a very 
  roundabout way. To start, I am a member of<br/>&gt; FindAGrave.com, where 
  volunteers (called "gravers") take the time out to archive<br/>&gt; burials and 
  photograph headstones in cemeteries all over the world. I'd been<br/>&gt; 
  having a problem where the GPS coordinates for individual cemeteries in my 
  area<br/>&gt; were incorrect, added from a database (NGS??) based on data 
  taken...well, too<br/>&gt; long ago. Cemeteries are mislabeled on it, yada 
  yada. Anyway, I went searching<br/>&gt; for portable GPS devices so that, when 
  I'm out photographing, I can get the REAL<br/>&gt; coordinates and submit 
  corrections to the site. While searching for that, Amazon<br/>&gt; suggest a 
  book about Geocaching. I Wiki up geocaching, read, enjoy, but am<br/>&gt; 
  dejected because I couldn't start it until I got a GPS device. (Still 
  shopping<br/>&gt; around, haven't bought one yet.) But lo and behold, what's 
  this "Letterboxing"<br/>&gt; on the suggested articles list? I read, I enjoy, 
  I'm hooked. I utter many<br/>&gt; variations on "OMG HOW COOL COME LOOK!" and 
  pull my housemates away from XBOX<br/>&gt; and sci-fi novel, 
  respectively.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; This all happens on a Monday night. Tuesday was 
  spent looking for boxes we<br/>&gt; wanted to try for. Wednesday afternoon, we 
  whip up our simple yet elegant (IMO)<br/>&gt; personal stamp and head out (as 
  Wednesdays are Sarah's short days). We're<br/>&gt; addicted.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Our trail name "The Spirit Seekers" comes from my FindAGrave username, "Amy 
  the<br/>&gt; Spirit Seeker". (Inspired by an amazing Lubbock-area graver who 
  goes by "Shawn<br/>&gt; the Grave Hunter".) So, as a group, and for lack of

                    <html><body><p>Sometimes you do what you gotta do - when I first started boxing, there were only seven boxes within a couple of hours of me. I found them, went to the first gathering four hours away and found seven or eight more, and my finding experience was over for awhile - after six months I had found less than twenty boxes. In hopes of luring other boxers closer to me, I planted. And then I hoped that by giving them something to find, they would leave behind something for me to find - and they did! <br/>
<br/>So - the find before you plant rule is very good advice IF you live in a high box population area, but if you don't, well - you do what you can to participate in the game, and that is plant. You do have to be prepared to lose a few boxes as you develop your sense of a good hide, but as long as you realize that, I think the fact you may have to work a little harder at being a letterboxer makes you a better letterboxer in the long run.<br/>
