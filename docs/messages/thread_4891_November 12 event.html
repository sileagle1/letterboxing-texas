This is a great camp with cabins to rent for individuals or families or school groups, church retreat, family reunion, etc, and summer resident camp for kids and programs available and all that good stuff.</div><div><br/></div><div>I will be there for sure, and most likely Random, Josephine, and Bangwell Putt will all be there, too, so we could have some fun time doing exchanges together.</div><div><br/></div><div>For letterboxes to get, there are at least two that I know about.  I have
 one letterbox right at the camp (Pink Dragonfly) and another one nearby (Monkey Wine),  You find clues for both at letterboxing.org, plus my several that travel with me.</div><div><br/></div><div>There's another friend who will most likely be there, as far as I know, and she is into geocaching and path tags.  so, if you are interested in those, you could meet a new friend, too.</div><div><br/></div><div>and, last but not least, the camp is also a BookCrossing zone.  We don't get many trades there, but still, it's a good opportunity to pick up some books, and leave children's books, too, if you want.</div><div><br/></div><div>Lunch is available at Noon for $5 - call 409-200-0331 to pre-register for that, and pay when you arrive.</div><div><br/></div><div>Or, just show up any time 1:00 - 4:00 for "visiting with friends" time.  There will be plenty of people around, all talking about the good ol' days, and hopefully making plans for a fun
 new future, too, and you can join in if interested, or just focus on your letterboxing with us and then be on your way.  This would be a good event for you to attend if you like to camp or hike or fish or things like that.  there is a small lake available for fishing, too, so bring your gear.  Not sure if you'd catch anything, but not sure if that even matters to many people who fish, anyway!  :-)  Dogs okay, if on leash. </div><div><br/></div><div>guess that is it for now.  Hope to see some of you there!</div><div><br/></div><div>ashby</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
