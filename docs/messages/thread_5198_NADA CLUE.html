The trails are pretty muddy right now.  Hopefully they'll dry out by May 11.  There's still a few bikes out there, even on a Wednesday, so watch out for them.  I also went by Glenwood Cemetery to check on the governor box The Post Man 2, which had been attempted this week, also taking a new logbook in case I found it as the old one has been reported full.  I was lucky enough to find the box, so I replaced the logbook and the box and moved it slightly because of major construction down below the slope where the box is hidden.  They are apparently expanding the cemetery.  It was interesting to see the entries in the log.  There must be 60-70 stamp-ins from all over the country.  There's even one, posted in March, from Taipei, Taiwan.  That's a lot for a cemetery box.  Too bad most of them aren't listed as finds on AQ and LbNA.<br/>
