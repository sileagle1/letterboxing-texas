                    <div class="plaintext-content">As the bus departed Weatherford, TX the driver decided to continue <br>
down the "Goodnight-Loving Trail."  While on the trail it stopped to <br>
pick up another passenger; none other than Charles Goodnight.  Now <br>
that the partners are reunited, the other passengers become quite <br>
captivated by their cattledrive stories.<br>
<br>
The bus arrived today, Aug. 13th, in Mansfield, TX for a picnic in <br>
Katherine Rose Memorial Park. Go to S. Cooper (Hwy 157) and Hwy 287 <br>
in Mansfield.  You'll know you're at the right corner if you see an <br>
IHOP on the SE corner and an On The Border on the SW corner. From <br>
that intersection take Hwy 287 east to the first exit, Walnut Creek <br>
Dr. Make a right at the McDonald's.  Go appoximately eight-tenths of <br>
a mile where you will see Katherine Rose Park on the right.  Enter <br>
and park in the lot.<br>
   <br>
Start trail at main entrance with the yellow post.  Go straight, <br>
passing the playground which is on your left and go through the <br>
large pavillion.  Continue to the fishing pond and pass pond with it <br>
on your left also.  You will see a couple huge rock piles - go<br>
toward them.  Make a sharp left turn on the trail where the stone <br>
wall starts.  Cross over the bridge (has orange safety fencing) and <br>
plop down to rest on the bench to your right.<br>
   <br>
Turn around and see the clearing behind you while you are sitting.  <br>
Go to the clearing and once there look straight ahead and you'll see <br>
a tree that has a broken limb crossed over the tree.  There are also<br>
jungle-type vines hanging in front of that tree. Take a few steps <br>
and look behind the tree.  At the base is a thin piece of bark <br>
covering a hole where the bus is parked.  You'll probably hear all <br>
the passengers.<br>
    <br>
Once you have the bus, take the short cut back to your car.  You'll <br>
see the short cut once you get back to the large rock pile.<br>

<div>Good to see that the Goodnight-Loving boys are reunited in the Texas Tour 
Bus.  I'm sure they have lots to talk about, and can only imagine the 
conversations among all the other passengers in that group of stars!  -- 
(and this park sounds like a likely place for future letterboxes, perhaps?) -
