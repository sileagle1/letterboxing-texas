                    <html><body><div>We just got hom from Arkansas - a very relaxing weekend, although it was essentially letterboxing free.  I admit - I had taken clues and I had loaded my GPS with geocache coords, but I was low key about both.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I did find my box I had never been to before.  How's that?  I made the box six months or so after I started letterboxing with the intent of planting it at Caddo Lake, but I never got that way.  Last Thanksgiving when Fearless Fox and Lightning went to Arkansas to hike, I sent it along with them and they planted it.  So when Fearless Fox announced that we were ditching Lightning and heading to Albert Pike to do a little hiking, just the two of us, I realized I would get to find it.  As we were sitting in a little diner Saturday morning, eating our last meal before heading into the mountains to hike, I realized I didn't have the clues.  I called my good friend, Lynn, who is sort of like my alter-ego, except that she doesn't letterbox.  She's the sort of friend who you can call any time day or night and she's always game for whatever is going on - I called her at 4 
a.m. one day last week to come be our nurse (she's an RN) while we set up a temporary shelter for some nursing home residents whose home had burned overnight, so when I called her early on Saturday morning from Arkansas, she thought it had to be a new adventure.  She was sorely disappointed when I only asked her to log on and read me the clues for my Paddle to the Sea.  After she read them, she was really disappointed because it sounded like a fun box to find - and she even had the right idea about what the clues were talking about (it's one of those sorts of clues that are a little cryptic).  It's really a shame she doesn't letterbox because she would be good at it - maybe that will be my next mission - to turn her into a letterboxer.  Anyway, I also didn't have a pen and paper in the diner, so I had to memorize the clues.  As we hung up, she mumbled something about looking at other clues.  Maybe she DID go letterboxing this weekend!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got in the car and drove - and drove - and drove - and got to the road the letterbox was on, and drove some more.  This box is wayyyy out in the boonies - down a gravel road - with BIG gravel.  It was quite a road.  The clues were perfect and I found the box with no problem, despite the fact that there was no foliage when they planted it and the area was covered with foliage this weekend.  Fearless Fox held his breath - oh yes he DID - as I opened the box to see if there was a log entry.  It nearly broke my heart to tell them it was as yet undiscovered.  He was so disappointed - I'm beginning to doubt whether he is still an LSS, or if maybe he has crossed over to our side of the fence.   It was in a nice place though, and he chose a really good hiding place.  I told him not to worry, someone would come for it someday.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had vowed not to make his life miserable on this trip by trying to get him to drive me all over Arkansas looking for letterboxes, and I was true to my word.  I didn't.  I did carve a new stamp in honor of that ROAD and I made the box and everything, but I didn't get to plant it.  We'll go back in a month or two and I'll plant it then.  He carved a stamp too - it was a very romantic stamp, but he cut through a letter and it was ruined.  He quit on that note.  He's quite the romantic - if y'all remember his very cool Valentine's series he planted for me in February.  Much nicer than roses.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We didn't get to hike as much as we had hoped becaus he had a nasty blister, but we did enjoy wandering the Ouachita National Forest and ogling the mountains.  We slept in hammocks under the cool night air and got raided by raccoons who stole our bread we forgot to put away the first night (didn't notice it was gone until today when we were packing up), and were entertained by the teenage boys in the campsite next to ours as they proved themselves to be boys to the core (let me just say - knives, fire, a mallet, and water).  We did a little hiking, but hardly made a dent in all the nice trails up there.  We saw my dad's old boss, Smokey Bear, and he still looks great.  Still preaching about forest fires too.  Nice guy.  Everyone should have a chance to meet him.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've decided we are going to buy a big ranch in Arkansas and raise chickens on one side of it and live on the far other side so we don't have to smell the chickens.  It was very green up there - apparently the drought hasn't hit them like it has us.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And Viewfinder, yet another foray without getting arrested, although the guy in the campsite next to ours (not the teenagers, but the other side) did.  Never did figure out why, but it was quite an event. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox offered to stop in Jefferson on the way home and find a couple boxes there, and just as I was about to pull my clues out, I looked at him and realized he was just being nice and was really, really tired, so I politely declined, saying I preferred to nap.  {Sigh}
