We just got back from Austin where I did an Academy Award Performance of a <br>
bag lady wandering through all those parks trying to be inconspicuous!<br>
Got Jack and Adam's, the USA Flag, The Mexican Bat and Keep Austin Weird. (I <br>
had to walk around the park twice before these lovebirds left so I could <br>
replant!)<br>
Tried for Predator and Spider Sword but either I was in the wrong place or <br>
just dumb.<br>
Way too many people for Bevo and I ran out of time for Oakwood Cemetery.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, this is your work-around, until the site is back up. <br>
<br>
1.  Go to the Texas letterboxing atlas <br>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi<br>
<br>
2.  Look up and note what boxes you might want clues for.<br>
<br>
3.  Go to Google.  type this into the search engine.<br>
site:www.letterboxing.org "name of box"<br>
for example site:www.letterboxing.org "rabbit house"  you can also<br>
search by placer name, by county, etc.<br>
<br>
4.  You should get some hits.  Click on the cached link instead of the<br>
 name of the box.<br>
<br>
It doesn't work for every box, but it works for many of them.  You<br>
also may need to try different variations.  For instance this search:<br>
site:www.letterboxing.org gramatrick  gets you access to different<br>
boxes, but I could never get our pumpkin pi box up for instance<br>
(although you can get those clues by following my previous post about<br>
atlasquest).<br>
<br>
Confused?  Hope it helps, at least some.<br>

<div>If you post a planted box on AQ and click on having it on lbna also, it won't finish the process. You'll get a file not found. I had to re-do a new box earlier today. You'll have to wait till lbna is back up and edit the AQ box. </div>
