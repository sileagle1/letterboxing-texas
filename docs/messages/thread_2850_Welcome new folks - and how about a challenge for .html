                    <html><body><p>I would add that WOWMOM brings up one of the key points about hunting letterboxes, but she also brought out a not-so-private joke amongst Texas letterboxers.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The story as I remember it goes that Silver Eagle got an email from an unhappy park ranger who was terribly perturbed about the placement of one of his boxes.
<span>  </span>He was thoroughly puzzled because it just didn't sound anything like where his box in that park was.<span>  </span>All we could ever figure out was that he had found someone else's box that HAPPENED to be near a well, so the ranger googled something he found in the box and came up with Silver Eagle's clue, which happened to say "Recover well".
<span>  </span>The ranger, upon reading this became VERY unhappy because we ne'er do well letterboxers had hidden something in their well and wanted to be sure everyone recovered it after finding.
<span>  </span>After all was sorted out, Silver Eagle's box was fine (and it was covered quite nicely) and the other box wasn't as bad as they first thought.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So the gig became that many folks post in their clues "Recover Well" (you'll see many variations, but the most common one in Texas IS "Recover Well") 
<span> </span>to give a little smile to Texas boxers and to gently remind each other to make sure the box is covered well before you leave the area.<span>  </span>

<div>
<div>The one piece of advice I wish I had been given when I first started boxing was to take my time and savor each box! Each box has a unique perspective brought by the person who placed it. Sometimes it's wonderfully written clues, sometimes a magnificently carved stamp or handmade logbook. Sometimes it's an amazing hiding place. Then there are those "blue diamond" type boxes that seem to combine the best of everything. Just remember that whoever placed that box took the time and trouble and offered their creative talents just for your enjoyment - so do exactly that.... take time to enjoy and appreciate each box. Unless you hear the bugle call of an army of mosquitos descending upon you (or a hunger bear), take time to look at the stamps that are already in a logbook and write a brief message.  In other words, take time to smell the roses!</div>

I reminded him that it doesn't <br/>matter when we start. When I get tired, I am through. I found out <br/>this week why I gave out so fast. I had a blockage in two heart <br/>arteries and had them fixed this week. I hope to back on the trails <br/>soon.

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">Well - I'll bet 99-% of the folks on this list know 
what my answer will be.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">At 23, a protective mother can be a bother.  One a 
23 your old may not understand.  I understand now, being a parent.  
&lt;grin&gt;  She will understand.  When she is a parent.  But 
likely not before.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">You cannot stop them from doing what they want to 
do.  The best you can do is to train them and equip them, then trust that 
they learned it well.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">My wife and I were nearly mugged one night.  3 
large kids (16+ y/o) and I had only a knife.  I am pretty good, but 3-kids 
good?  Fortunately, I convinced them that I would slice them to dog food, 
and they believed me.  The next Monday I applied for a handgun 
license.  It is my American Express card - I don't leave home without 
it.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">My wife had a friend - she was leaving a dog 
show.  When she got to the motel she got out of the van, unlocked the door, 
then turned to let the dogs out of the van.  And some guy with a hatchet 
started hacking away on her.  6 weeks in a hospital, dogs fostered out.... 
what a mess.  My wife got her handgun license within the 
month.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">What is the difference between my handgun and my 
wife's?  I am not man enough to carry a purple .357.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">My son?  Cavalry Scout, Sniper, Paramedic.  
God help the idiot that tangles with him.  He is truly alert and 
ready.  He had several years of martial arts training before joining the 
military and getting his own handgun and license.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">My daughter Heidi.  Well, not yet of age to have a 
handgun license..... but several years of martial arts training.  She will 
turn of age in July.  We will see.  Just because she is of age doesn't 
mean she will get a license.....  her call.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">Your brain is your most effective weapon.  Stay 
alert - stay alive.  Usually it is enough to keep alert and avoid 
trouble.  Avoid trouble when you can.  Go out of your way to avoid 
trouble.  It isn't worth it to shoot a burglar in your home unless he is 
threatening your life.  But if your life is threatened - you need to decide 
if you value it more than you value the life of your aggressor.  Sometimes 
trouble finds you anyway.  Nobody ever raped a .38.  
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">Just my opinion.  It is a very personal 
choice.  I hope no one ever forces the choice on you or your loved 
ones.  Being retired military, I am comfortable with the issue.  My 
pistol is just another tool.  One I am proficient with, but hope I never 
need.  But it will be here, if we do need it.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">It is a tough choice.  It is a tough world.  
Fortunately, it isn't so bad in Texas.  Its one of several reasons that I 
live in Texas and not in my home of Chicago.  </span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">Is it just a co-incidence that the cities with the 
highest crime rates also have the toughest gun laws?</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="047301303-25062007">For those of you who are offended by guns - don't buy 
one.  Don't try to force me to give up mine and I won't try to force you to 
buy one.  OK?</span></div>

</p><div>I was supposed to go with my oldest DD today. She only wants to 'hike' to 
  a letterbox. So, I had to pass because of pains where I had my surgery. She 
  said, "Don't feel bad, I can go hiking by myself you know." I said, "No you 
  can't, it's dangerous out there, what if you ran into Hannibal Lecter (sp?)?" 
  She said that I wasn't being very funny. I told her that I wasn't trying to be 
  funny, I was serious. I said, "Think about it, how often do we hear about 
  people being acosted on the trail, coming up missing?" I can't believe she 
  would even think about it. She's been hiking in Texas a total of twice, within 
  the last year, with DH and I. I told her that she can do the park hikes by 
  herself, but I really didn't want her doing those by herself either. </div>

<div>Am I being to overprotective? She's 23.</div>
