I will miss her more than I can say, but this last bit has been<br/>
horrid, so I wish peace on her beloved family.<br/>

We are lucky to have some pieces of her still floating around in her<br/>

<div>Sitting here trying to think of what I will remember most about her, and I think it might have to be how she combined her respect for each and every person with an understanding that people fall and fail, and because of and in spite of those things, finding a way to believe in her fellow man.</div>

letterboxer last week when our friend Ruby Tuesday<br/>

fight. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She was larger than life, a woman who commanded attention, sassy and<br/>
&gt; witty, but with a kind heart. She'd do anything for her friends. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here's a link to her obituary, also in print today in the Dallas<br/>
&gt; Morning News. It mentions one of her hobbies as letterboxing.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I will miss her more than I can say, but this last bit has been<br/>
&gt; horrid, so I wish peace on her beloved family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We are lucky to have some pieces of her still floating around in her<br/>
&gt; letterboxes. I hope that we will all commit to maintaining these as a<br/>
&gt; group effort, so that others may be inspired by her still.<br/>

Recently, I  was reading a blog in which the author said, "you can <br/>
get to know a person through their clues and  boxes." This was how I <br/>
got to know Ruby Tuesday. I was fortunate to meet her, but reading <br/>
her clues told me so much about her. The places she took you was <br/>
always an adventure. I traveled around White Rock Lake finding Lost <br/>
Keys, I imagined myself on the Shawnee Trail and felt sadness as I <br/>
read about the Cherokee Nations and their struggles. <br/>

<div>I received the birthday box the very month I moved back to Texas from CT.  At that time, I had not yet met Ruby personally, but I realized I was in for a very special letterboxing adventure if this was any indication of Texas letterboxing! Subsequently, Ruby Tuesday certainly inspired me to me a better letterboxer (try to carve better stamps, find better locations, and most especially write better clues!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went to her memorial in Dallas on Wednesday afternoon. This is the quote her  family chose for her memory card by Ralph Waldo Emerson. It describes her perfectly.

<div>To appreciate beauty;</div>
<div>To find the best in others;</div>
<div>To leave the world a bit better,</div>
