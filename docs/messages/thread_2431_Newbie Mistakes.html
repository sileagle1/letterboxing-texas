We had a wonderful gathering today, but we did have a problem with one<br>
group of game players.  They didn't put the boxes back where they had<br>
been hidden; they didn't put the lids on the locknlocks; they didn't<br>
reseal any internal baggies, and often just put the logbooks in not in<br>
baggies.  For the function of the game, these were one-day boxes, so<br>
it didn't matter as much as it does in the wild about the baggies and<br>
the box lids.  But the boxes being replaced incorrectly caused a major<br>
time problem, as the people following behind had to search extensively<br>
for boxes that should have been a quick grab.  And this slowed<br>
everyone up behind them, because then the finders thought that the<br>
clues were wrong, so they replaced the boxes in the wrong spot, and so<br>
on. . .we had big bunching and at least one box that many people<br>
couldn't find, as it was about 5 feet from where it should have been.<br>
<br>
How should we have handled this?  I really struggled with what to say<br>
that would be helpful, and not come off as overly critical of people<br>
new to the game.  What would you have done?<br>

It's a hard to know how to give helpful criticism to anyone that you don't know very well. But, I know that I personally would be grateful if someone told me what I were doing wrong.<br>
Maybe we could take someone aside privately (or email them privately) and let them know how much time and effort goes into placing a box and that in order for them to last, they have to be treated well by EACH AND EVERY finder.?

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When confronted with a situation, we must all do what we think is <br>
the right thing to do.  It's easy to look back and say, "I wish I <br>
had done something different".  Given the situation, I think I would <br>
have picked up the pieces of the boxes, just as Kim did, tried to <br>
notify the owners and posted a sitrep on this list.  What good were <br>
they doing scattered around the park?  The question in my mind <br>
is, "What will I do in the future if confronted with a similar <br>
situation?".  First, I need to be prepared to deal with it.  I think <br>
I'll make a temporary letterbox to carry with me and, if I think I <br>
have to remove a box temporarily, like overnight to dry out a <br>
logbook (one of those exceptions to the rule which I've done a <br>
couple of times), I'll put my temp box in its place with a note <br>
explaining that the target box is in maintenance and will be <br>
replaced the next morning, just in case someone came looking.  This <br>
temp box will be listed on LbNA as a traveling box.  It may not be <br>
the box you expected, but at least you'll get a find. If I can't <br>
hang around overnight, I'll do whatever I can and make sure I have a <br>
replacement box, then notify the owner as soon as possible.  If the <br>
box is completely destroyed, I don't see anything wrong with taking <br>
the remains, leaving a box with a note explaining the situation (for <br>
those boxers who may be right behind me), then contacting the owner. <br>
All they can do is yell at me, right?  That's not going to stop me <br>
from letterboxing, and it shouldn't you either, Kim.<br>
