We had a wonderful gathering today, but we did have a problem with one<br/>
group of game players.  They didn't put the boxes back where they had<br/>
been hidden; they didn't put the lids on the locknlocks; they didn't<br/>
reseal any internal baggies, and often just put the logbooks in not in<br/>
baggies.  For the function of the game, these were one-day boxes, so<br/>
it didn't matter as much as it does in the wild about the baggies and<br/>
the box lids.  But the boxes being replaced incorrectly caused a major<br/>
time problem, as the people following behind had to search extensively<br/>
for boxes that should have been a quick grab.  And this slowed<br/>
everyone up behind them, because then the finders thought that the<br/>
clues were wrong, so they replaced the boxes in the wrong spot, and so<br/>
on. . .we had big bunching and at least one box that many people<br/>
couldn't find, as it was about 5 feet from where it should have been.<br/>
<br/>
How should we have handled this?  I really struggled with what to say<br/>
that would be helpful, and not come off as overly critical of people<br/>
new to the game.  What would you have done?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When confronted with a situation, we must all do what we think is <br/>
the right thing to do.  It's easy to look back and say, "I wish I <br/>
had done something different".  Given the situation, I think I would <br/>
have picked up the pieces of the boxes, just as Kim did, tried to <br/>
notify the owners and posted a sitrep on this list.  What good were <br/>
they doing scattered around the park?  The question in my mind <br/>
is, "What will I do in the future if confronted with a similar <br/>
situation?".  First, I need to be prepared to deal with it.  I think <br/>
I'll make a temporary letterbox to carry with me and, if I think I <br/>
have to remove a box temporarily, like overnight to dry out a <br/>
logbook (one of those exceptions to the rule which I've done a <br/>
couple of times), I'll put my temp box in its place with a note <br/>
explaining that the target box is in maintenance and will be <br/>
replaced the next morning, just in case someone came looking.  This <br/>
temp box will be listed on LbNA as a traveling box.  It may not be <br/>
the box you expected, but at least you'll get a find. If I can't <br/>
hang around overnight, I'll do whatever I can and make sure I have a <br/>
replacement box, then notify the owner as soon as possible.  If the <br/>
box is completely destroyed, I don't see anything wrong with taking <br/>
the remains, leaving a box with a note explaining the situation (for <br/>
those boxers who may be right behind me), then contacting the owner. <br/>
All they can do is yell at me, right?  That's not going to stop me <br/>
from letterboxing, and it shouldn't you either, Kim.<br/>

extensively<br/>
&gt; for boxes that should have been a quick grab.  And this slowed<br/>
&gt; everyone up behind them, because then the finders thought that the<br/>
&gt; clues were wrong, so they replaced the boxes in the wrong spot, <br/>
and so<br/>
&gt; on. . .we had big bunching and at least one box that many people<br/>
&gt; couldn't find, as it was about 5 feet from where it should have <br/>
been.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How should we have handled this?  I really struggled with what to <br/>
say<br/>
&gt; that would be helpful, and not come off as overly critical of <br/>
people<br/>
&gt; new to the game.  What would you have done?<br/>

&gt; &gt; There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about what's going on<br/>
&gt; here, and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; believe we all may need to step back a pace (that would be a two<br/>
&gt; step pace -<br/>
&gt; &gt; LOL) or two and try to see both sides of the situation.  My <br/>
comments<br/>
&gt; are, as<br/>
&gt; &gt; always, open for discussion or dive bombing or using for toilet <br/>
paper,<br/>
&gt; &gt; whatever you please.  I would ask that everyone with a stake in <br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; particular matter read them through all the way before they <br/>
dispose<br/>
&gt; of them<br/>
&gt; &gt; as they see fit.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I believe, and I think many others believe this too, that a very<br/>
&gt; strong rule<br/>
&gt; &gt; of thumb would be that a box should not ever be removed from its<br/>
&gt; location.<br/>
&gt; &gt; And as with any rule, there ARE exceptions.  Here are some <br/>
possible<br/>
&gt; &gt; scenarios that would call for a decision, and how I personally <br/>
would<br/>
&gt; handle<br/>
&gt; &gt; them:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; 1) If I go and find a box that is waterlogged, I might remove the<br/>
&gt; logbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; and replace it with a few index cards or other paperstock so <br/>
that anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; following behind me can log in.  After all, we just don't know<br/>
&gt; anymore if<br/>
&gt; &gt; the next finder is an hour or a month behind us, and we don't <br/>
want<br/>
&gt; to cause<br/>
&gt; &gt; them to make a search to no avail.  I would then try to dry the <br/>
book<br/>
&gt; out as<br/>
&gt; &gt; best I could and either replace it in the box or contact the <br/>
sender<br/>
&gt; and ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; if they want me to send it to them, with a very forthright<br/>
&gt; description of<br/>
&gt; &gt; its condition so they can make an informed decision about whether<br/>
&gt; they want<br/>
&gt; &gt; it or not.<br/>
