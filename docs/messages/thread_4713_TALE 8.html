<p>Thank YOU, Boots Tx. It is a great box and it was our cherry on the top of a fabulous day! I've placed my box for the event while there. The clues will be posted in the next day or two. It will be a bit of a puzzle (not difficult) so if anyone is interested in finding this box, you'll need to do a little work before the event. Puddle Splasher</p>

      I'll be looking forward to finding your box, PS.  There is a mystery concerning my box "Texas Heros".  It seems that Viewfinder and her LSS tried to find it in December and it was definitely missing.  Then last weekend when you went with her back to the cemetery, it was lying out in the open, completely exposed.  She thought it was my replacement box, but it turned out to be the original.  I suggested that it might have something to do with local ghosts, considering its location.  She said that it did look like a crime scene: dead bodies lying all around, some of them covered with stones.  Definitely suspicious.  Now, I'd like to ask, seriously, if anyone accidentally took the box and then brought it back later?  I'm just curious, if you did and will admit it, we'll all get a laugh and be relieved that it was simply human error and not something more sinister.  Thanks.<br/>

Thank YOU, Boots Tx. It is a great box and it was our cherry on the top of a fabulous day! I've placed my box for the event while there. The clues will be posted in the next day or two. It will be a bit of a puzzle (not difficult) so if anyone is interested in finding this box, you'll need to do a little work before the event. Puddle Splasher"<br/>

<div>Boots,</div>
<div>It was actually on Oct 31, 2010 when my LSS and I first looked for your box at FPSP, the day I planted two boxes there and we found LSQ's box, but yours was quite definitely not there that day.  We searched all around just in case it was slightly misplaced, and even returned before leaving the park for one more check in case someone had it while we were looking for it.  More and more mysterious, since that was Halloween.  Wish we'd noticed any lurking clowns or ghosts in the old cemetery late that afternoon....  And to add to the mystery, when I found the box this past Sunday, back where it was supposed to be but lying out in the open, the logbook hadn't been stamped since last April, almost a year ago.  I did notice quite a bit of armadillo and possibly wild hog activity in the park, but I know there are letterboxing armadillos, but I'm not aware of any strong of those enough to move a rock and remove a letterbox, then gracious enough to return it.  That might explain why it was out in the open, though.  Those armadillos and feral hogs aren't that good at recovering well if they rooted it out.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And on that note:  my Cynthia Ann Parker/Prairie Flower letterbox there in the park is in a pouch wedged into a tree, but if any finders discover it on the ground, will you kindly put it back into the tree and off the ground to keep predators from ripping it open (I mean the armadillos and wild hogs, not human/ghost/bear predators).  Thanks! </div>

And to add to the mystery, when I found the box this past Sunday, back where it was supposed to be but lying out in the open, the logbook hadn't been stamped since last April, almost a year ago.  I did notice quite a bit of armadillo and possibly wild hog activity in the park, but I know there are letterboxing armadillos, but I'm not aware of any strong of those enough to move a rock and remove a letterbox, then gracious enough to return it.  That might explain why it was out in the open, though.  Those armadillos and feral hogs aren't that good at recovering well if they rooted it out.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; And on that note:  my Cynthia Ann Parker/Prairie Flower letterbox there in the park is in a pouch wedged into a tree, but if any finders discover it on the ground, will you kindly put it back into the tree and off the ground to keep predators from ripping it open (I mean the armadillos and wild hogs, not human/ghost/bear predators).  Thanks! <br/>

&gt; Thanks, Bozo, I love your sauce.  I like to use Cub Rub for the bear meat, and bearinate it overnight to tender it up.  You know how tough bear can be.<br/>

You are a great group of people, and dear friends now.  I hope everyone enjoyed the raffle.

A special thanks to LSQ and Boots for the TALE 7 book.  I love it!  <br/>

&gt; &gt; We will start are search for next years location soon. If anyone has a suggestion please post it, knowing we need a group facility that will handle 75-100 people.   Can't wait for next year.   Also, I will be bringing the Texas Tour Bus II again next year, so if you never got it before you can get all the stamps then.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; I carve with my feet, smart aleck! I wasn't invited to the party, but I decided to come anyway.  I had to stay hidden because, while I was skinny-dipping in the lake, someone took my boxer-shorts!   I don't know who it was, but I can guess.  Speaking of which, I hope you all liked the bear-b-q I cooked up for you.  Thanks to Boots Tex for letting me use his BBQ pit.  I lurked around the activity center where the party was going on and saw a couple of live people that I recognized from the day at the arboretum when I met my untimely death.  There was Sterling Seagull and Kodiak Kid (I still think he's the one who killed me, although I still don't know why), who were conducting some kind of raffle, and Shoeless Suzy was there as well.  Many of you I didn't know personally, but that gryzzled old cuss that was making fun of my boxers (and making a spectacle of himself) sure looked familiar.  I do remember a cop hanging around the arboretum on that fateful day.  Could it be.?  Naw, surely a fastidious flatfoot like that wouldn't have stolen someone's shorts...or would he?  I did notice he was about to split the seams.  Time to go on a diet, detective.  Finally, a big thanks to all of you who visited The Sentinel Ghost of Tehuacana.
