keep wishing folks a happy birthday!!!<br>
<br>
CelticLions created a "Happy Birthday, Texas!" Postal Letterbox, which has<br>
been traveling around the state, with two quick trips OUT of state for one<br>
displaced Texan and one honorary Texan.<br>
This is a letterbox you don't have to find - it finds YOU!<br>
If you would like to receive this box, please email me offlist at:<br>
celticlions@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Please include your birthdate (no need to add the year!) & mailing address.<br>
If you sign up for this box, you MUST agree to the following:<br>
<br>
1. To try your best to mail it to the next recipient on time for his/her<br>
birthday (Please email me before sending it on - sometimes we have new<br>
additions)<br>
<br>
2. To send it with a Delivery Confirmation Tracking number & send that<br>
number to me (NO EXCEPTIONS!!! This costs only an additional 50 cents and<br>
helps me track it - it is now too precious to lose, since we have so many<br>
cool stamp signatures in the logbook!)<br>
<br>
3. To allow $6.00 or so in your budget to mail it! I'm sorry that it's not<br>
lightweight, but I like to warn everyone ahead of time.<br>
<br>
Once in a while, the box returns to us for maintenance & I've thoroughly<br>
enjoyed seeing everybody's stamps & comments! It's especially fun to see the<br>
signatures of folks who live in other far corners of this state.<br>
<br>
Cheers!<br>

- it's a whole letterboxing-styled party-in-a-box.  By<br>
the time you FINALLY pack it back up, you feel like<br>
you have truly been the guest of honor at a gala<br>
event.<br>
<br>
Any time you have an opportunity to get involved with<br>
something CelticLions does, you better jump on it. <br>
They just don't do anything halfway!<br>
