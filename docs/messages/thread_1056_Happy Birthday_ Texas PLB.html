keep wishing folks a happy birthday!!!<br/>
<br/>
CelticLions created a "Happy Birthday, Texas!" Postal Letterbox, which has<br/>
been traveling around the state, with two quick trips OUT of state for one<br/>
displaced Texan and one honorary Texan.<br/>
This is a letterbox you don't have to find - it finds YOU!<br/>
If you would like to receive this box, please email me offlist at:<br/>
celticlions@comcast.net<br/>
<br/>
Please include your birthdate (no need to add the year!) &amp; mailing address.<br/>
If you sign up for this box, you MUST agree to the following:<br/>
<br/>
1. To try your best to mail it to the next recipient on time for his/her<br/>
birthday (Please email me before sending it on - sometimes we have new<br/>
additions)<br/>
<br/>
2. To send it with a Delivery Confirmation Tracking number &amp; send that<br/>
number to me (NO EXCEPTIONS!!! This costs only an additional 50 cents and<br/>
helps me track it - it is now too precious to lose, since we have so many<br/>
cool stamp signatures in the logbook!)<br/>
<br/>
3. To allow $6.00 or so in your budget to mail it! I'm sorry that it's not<br/>
lightweight, but I like to warn everyone ahead of time.<br/>
<br/>
Once in a while, the box returns to us for maintenance &amp; I've thoroughly<br/>
enjoyed seeing everybody's stamps &amp; comments! It's especially fun to see the<br/>
signatures of folks who live in other far corners of this state.<br/>

- it's a whole letterboxing-styled party-in-a-box.  By<br/>
the time you FINALLY pack it back up, you feel like<br/>

Any time you have an opportunity to get involved with<br/>
something CelticLions does, you better jump on it. <br/>
They just don't do anything halfway!<br/>
