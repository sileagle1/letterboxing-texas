                    <div class="plaintext-content">I woke up this morning to the tap-tap-tapping of the telegraph emanating from my office.  Alarmed and fearing the worst, I sprang from the comfort of my feather bed, grabbed my quill and, dipping it in the inkwell, commenced to copy down the message that was springing forth from a far-away place.  To my relief, the news wasn't tragic, but told a happy tale:  The Wild West Show and Rodeo is coming to East Texas!  Promoters are already headed east from the wilds of New Mexico following a hugely successful run, aboard the Butterfield Stage.  They will be followed by the myriad performers and animals and the train load of equipment required to put on a show of this caliber.  The show train should arrive via the Santa Fe Railroad in a few days at the depot in Shepherd, where it will be unloaded onto wagons for the short trip to the fairgrounds at Coldspring, and there the famous cowboys and Indians, trick riders and sharp-shooters will perform their awe-inspiring deeds for a week or two or even more, perhaps adding an act or two during the stay.  Flyers have arrived on the Overland Mail and are going up on the sides of buildings and fence-posts all across the town.  I shall keep you posted on their progress.<br/>

<body>Glad to hear it!  One of my best carves is in the WWS, so very happy to know they're still on the tour.<br/>Viewfinder<br/><br/>Sent from my HTC Inspire™ 4G on AT&amp;T<br/><br/><div id="htc_header">----- Reply message -----<br/>From: "Boots Tex" &lt;redbarn@eastex.net&gt;<br/>To: &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Wild West Show and Rodeo coming to Coldspring!<br/>Date: Tue, Aug 27, 2013 1:12 pm<br/><br/></div><br/>

<p>Great News!  The Texas Wild West Show and Rodeo came rolling into Coldspring this morning!  Posters are up all over town.  Cowboys, Cowgirls, Riders, Ropers and all sorts of other attractions are pitching tents and setting up booths at the county fair and rodeo grounds.  Turns out they took a wrong turn at Salt Flat and wound up in Santa Fe, then took the scenic route through Denver back to Texas.  We're looking forward to seeing all the old acts and maybe a couple of new ones.  When they leave here, I'll be sure to let you know where their next booking is likely to be.</p><div><br/></div><div>Boots</div>
