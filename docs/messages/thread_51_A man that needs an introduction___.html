<div>My name is Susan and I live in Beeville.  Glad to see you here and interested in this. I'm very new too.  We need to get out there and plant some more boxes in our area.  Wanda (Busy Bee) is also from this area.  She has boxes planted around  our area.</div>

<br>
I was surprised at one huge benefit we get from<br>
letterboxing.  Like your family, we love being<br>
outdoors, so I figured letterboxing would just be an<br>
extension of that appreciation.  But letterboxing has<br>
really honed our abilities to see detail.  When you<br>
are accustomed to living in a fast-paced world with<br>
lots of stimulation, you lose that ability to see the<br>
little things.  I'm so thankful we found this activity<br>
- it's given us back a whole little world we forget<br>
exists sometimes!<br>

that's where it came from.  I'll post the stamp on my web page soon <br>

Answer #2: I wish I could, but I have a previous engagement.  Maybe <br>
next year.<br>

Also, be on the lookout for my Kite series.  I'm working on the <br>
second stamp now and they're coming out pretty good.<br>

*****AHA!  Very interesting.  I like that.  I ran into<br>
the same thing - nothing I could think of drew out my<br>
sense of humor.  My stamp is posted in the files<br>
section of this list.  <br>
<br>
Your message reminded me of a verbal sparring I had<br>
with my husband yesterday.  We were on our way to a<br>
boy scout training he was attending (I was going to<br>
hike the location).  I was filling out his paperwork<br>
for him and two of the questions were "what do you<br>
want to be called?" and "what is your occupation?"  I<br>
gave him a hard time about having to fill out his<br>
paperwork for him.  Threatened to give him a really<br>
good name and occupation.  I came up with<br>
monkey-trainer as his occupation and followed with<br>
calling him monkey mind.  He was a little worried<br>
about what I actually wrote - didn't know I cut him<br>
slack until I handed his paperwork over for him at the<br>
registration.<br>
