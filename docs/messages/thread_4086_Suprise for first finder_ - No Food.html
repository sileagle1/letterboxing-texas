                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's too funny. I must admit, the few times I've placed a first finder gift in a letterbox, I've wondered what exactly would GG want! Actually, I do often place a ff certificate in the box, but the only times I've placed a gift was with my Folk Art Series where I made a little sample of the folk art. In my holiday series, I placed a little token in baggies for all the finders to take one (jingle bells tied with red ribbons at Christmas, fuzzy chicks at Easter, flags for July 4th, shamrocks for St Patty's, etc. Kids seemed to love that. However, since those boxes required more maintenance (replacing the gifts), I only did that for boxes that were close enough to my location I could check on them often. I don't actually have a formula for what to do with each of my boxes; I just kind of let the box dictate what I want to do. Have fun with it. I just LOVE finding a box where someone thought outside the BOX (sorry), and did something unique and clever!<br>
