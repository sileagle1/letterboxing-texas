We looked for the 4 letterboxes there and only found one. I am pretty <br/>
sure that we were in the right places but no boxes. The one we found <br/>
was "Shelob's Lair" It was exactly where it was suppose to be. Fairy at <br/>
Work maybe there but the black berry vines were so thick that we were <br/>
not going to go through them. Maybe we will try again in the fall. <br/>
Kantexan's Arachnitopia and Arachnitopi'love could not be found. We <br/>
found the tree with the spiky branches but no box. We also found the <br/>
big rock and the small rock but no spiders in love. I will be <br/>
contacting Kantexan and hope they can shed more light on this. I am not <br/>
saying not to try to find these but I believe they are not there. Adams <br/>
