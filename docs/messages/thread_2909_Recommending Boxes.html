<div><font size="2">It's the diversity in letterboxing that keeps it interesting. What if we were all the same and the boxes were all the same. If my first pitiful boxes had never been visited, or if I hadn't received such encouraging emails from finders, I would probably have given up long ago. I'm still growing and I like to think that my boxes are getting better with each addition. Rather than only celebrating those boxes that are excellent, I think we should enjoy and encourage all who make the effort so our hobby will continue to progress.</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think there's a difference between what I might say to someone I was<br>
emailing back and forth and on a more public list that goes to so many<br>
people like this one.  I would probably be more honest about which<br>
boxes stink too, in a one-on-one conversation.<br>
<br>
But, when it comes down to it, the boxes I liked and remember fondly<br>
are usually the ones that worked for me on that given day.  It could<br>
be that my family had a terrific time at a  given box--it was a<br>
low-humidity, beautiful sunny day; the kids were in a good mood; we<br>
saw an unusual animal...etc.  All things that made the experience so<br>
much more than just the stamp.  On another day, the weather could be<br>
lousy, the stinging insects rampant, the kids cranky and so on.  Same<br>
box=totally different experiences.  Not the box's fault.<br>
<br>
My main point was that a lot of people *TRY* their best, and to have a<br>
few singled out for one skill or another could certainly make someone<br>
feel bad.  Like the Academy Award winning actress who thanks her<br>
parents, her manager, her hairdresser, etc., but not her husband.<br>
