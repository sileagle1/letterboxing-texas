<div>However, as an antique dealer, I try to keep in mind the old saying, "one man's junk is another man's treasure". It was always a huge surprise to me the things that would sell quickly or vise versa. There are as many opinions as there are people.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's the diversity in letterboxing that keeps it interesting. What if we were all the same and the boxes were all the same. If my first pitiful boxes had never been visited, or if I hadn't received such encouraging emails from finders, I would probably have given up long ago. I'm still growing and I like to think that my boxes are getting better with each addition. Rather than only celebrating those boxes that are excellent, I think we should enjoy and encourage all who make the effort so our hobby will continue to progress.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think there's a difference between what I might say to someone I was<br/>
emailing back and forth and on a more public list that goes to so many<br/>
people like this one.  I would probably be more honest about which<br/>
boxes stink too, in a one-on-one conversation.<br/>
<br/>
But, when it comes down to it, the boxes I liked and remember fondly<br/>
are usually the ones that worked for me on that given day.  It could<br/>
be that my family had a terrific time at a  given box--it was a<br/>
low-humidity, beautiful sunny day; the kids were in a good mood; we<br/>
saw an unusual animal...etc.  All things that made the experience so<br/>
much more than just the stamp.  On another day, the weather could be<br/>
lousy, the stinging insects rampant, the kids cranky and so on.  Same<br/>
box=totally different experiences.  Not the box's fault.<br/>
<br/>
My main point was that a lot of people *TRY* their best, and to have a<br/>
few singled out for one skill or another could certainly make someone<br/>
feel bad.  Like the Academy Award winning actress who thanks her<br/>
parents, her manager, her hairdresser, etc., but not her husband.<br/>

&gt; &gt; What I won't do is recommend one planter over another, as I think<br/>
&gt; &gt; that's just bad form and potentially hurtful to others, even if that's<br/>
&gt; &gt; not what you meant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But if you're recommending a few boxes, what happens if all the boxes <br/>
&gt; you recommend happen to be by the same boxer?  Like, even if you <br/>
&gt; don't mention the boxer by name, you still end up effectively <br/>
&gt; recommending this particular boxer.  Is that all right?  Or do you <br/>
&gt; deliberately throw in a recommendation for someone else's boxes even <br/>
&gt; though they stink?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There's two factors that apply to me here:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)  There are only three or four planters in the area.  It's hard to <br/>
&gt; make any recommendations at all without noting which ones belong to <br/>
&gt; which planter.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)  Nobody ever asks me for recommendations -- at least not for <br/>
&gt; *good* boxes.  I'm more likely to get an inquiry about *quick* boxes, <br/>
&gt; boxes that can be found while zipping past on the freeway without <br/>
&gt; taking too much time.<br/>
