<br/>
I'm new to the list and to letterboxing.  I first read about<br/>
letterboxing in Wondertime magazine, in an article about geocaching.<br/>
Letterboxing sounds like much more fun to me, and my husband and son<br/>
(3.5y) think that it sounds like fun, too!<br/>
<br/>
We live in Austin, but I'm from East Texas, so I expect that we'll be<br/>
active in Central, East, and Southeast Texas once we learn more (I'm a<br/>
firm believer in learning a group's etiquette before getting started)<br/>
and get our stamp and book together.<br/>
<br/>
My husband is an illustrator, and among other things I'm a printmaker<br/>
and bookmaker, and I'm looking forward to using our combined skills to<br/>
set up our first box.  We have quite a collection of old baby wipes<br/>
boxes that may or may not be appropriate to use--any opinions on that?<br/>
 I would prefer to decorate their outsides before stashing them, but<br/>
I'm not sure if that's done, either--I really am brand new to this!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any advice y'all have to offer!<br/>

<div>Wen,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Welcome!  Sounds 
like you all have some talents that will lend themselves well to 
letterboxing.  My suggestion on the baby wipes boxes would be that they 
won't keep the contents dry over time, and also the fragrance from the wipes 
could attract animals.  I think some of the best advice for new boxers is 
to find lots of boxes before hiding one, it gives you an idea of how a box is 
put together, what could be a good hiding spot, and how to put out a box that 
will last awhile.  Reading through the archives on this site, LBNA, and AQ 
will be a big help as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a great 
activity that changes just a little bit with every new person that gives it a 
try.  Have fun, and ask anything you like on this list.  -Mother of 
Five (oh, and by the way, I also have quite a few empty baby wipe boxes hanging 
around my house!)</div>

<div>
<div>Welcome Wen! Since your family's talents include bookmaking, illustrating and printmaking, I'm sure your future boxes will be well worth finding.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>(Warning: I'm trying to type this with the help of our new kitten so <em>we </em> may hit the send button at anytime, so if it doesn't make sense... all the blame goes to the kitty, Lillie Belle.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Most boxers will tell you the box of choice is a Lock n' Lock brand because they are so sturdy and have such a great seal to keep moisture out. I usually buy the sandwich size at Target ($1.99), but they can be hard to find sometimes. An important factor to keep in mind when selecting, preparing and hiding boxes is to be sure the box does not attract any unwanted attention. Often the boxes are covered with camouflage tape which can be found in the hunting or painting departments at Walmart, or painted with Krylon Fusion paint (which sticks to plastic). Another factor that invites the box to be discovered and dragged away by an animal is scent. You want to make sure the container you select has no scent. It's never a good idea to use a box that previously had food stored in it, because although we may not be able to smell it, animals will! I'm afraid your baby wipe boxes may be just to tempting to squirrels, raccoons, etc.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't know exactly what you mean by "decorating" your boxes, but some really fun boxes I've found have been decorated inside. It doesn't allow the box to be too conspicuous from the outside, but when you open it, you have a fun surprise. I love, love, love finding a creative box... one where someone made a special effort with the logbook, stamp, box itself, or creative clues. The more effort you put into your boxes, the more people will want to seek them out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best way to get up to speed is to read all the tutorials on the Atlas Quest and LBNA sites, join the Newcomers list on AQ, read back though some of the discussions on the Texas list, and just start looking for boxes. You will quickly learn what you like or don't like about the boxes you find. There are some really clever ways to write clues. Remember that not all boxes have the same appeal to everyone. Some people prefer long hikes and some prefer drive-bys.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My single most piece of advise for all letterboxers, new and old alike, is to be respectful of the boxes you are looking for. Leave them better than you found them! Take the time to make sure they are hidden well so they won't be accidentally discovered by passers-by. You may find a box that has no covering and has been left out in the open, but I can guarantee that the person who went to all the trouble to develop, make and plant a box did not originally hide it like that, so please take the time to either replace it better than you found it, or notify the placer that the box needs attention.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have fun, Wen, and welcome to you and all the new boxers that have joined the Texas list recently.</div>

<div>Well, Mo5, maybe we can't tell right from left, but we know the difference between right and wrong (I think).</div>

</p><div>Wen,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Welcome!  Sounds like you all have some talents that will lend themselves well to letterboxing.  My suggestion on the baby wipes boxes would be that they won't keep the contents dry over time, and also the fragrance from the wipes could attract animals.  I think some of the best advice for new boxers is to find lots of boxes before hiding one, it gives you an idea of how a box is put together, what could be a good hiding spot, and how to put out a box that will last awhile.  Reading through the archives on this site, LBNA, and AQ will be a big help as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a great activity that changes just a little bit with every new person that gives it a try.  Have fun, and ask anything you like on this list.  -Mother of Five (oh, and by the way, I also have quite a few empty baby wipe boxes hanging around my house!)</div>

<p>Hi, all!<br/><br/>I'm new to the list and to letterboxing. I first read about<br/>letterboxing in Wondertime magazine, in an article about geocaching.<br/>Letterboxing sounds like much more fun to me, and my husband and son<br/>(3.5y) think that it sounds like fun, too!<br/><br/>We live in Austin, but I'm from East Texas, so I expect that we'll be<br/>active in Central, East, and Southeast Texas once we learn more (I'm a<br/>firm believer in learning a group's etiquette before getting started)<br/>and get our stamp and book together.<br/><br/>My husband is an illustrator, and among other things I'm a printmaker<br/>and bookmaker, and I'm looking forward to using our combined skills to<br/>set up our first box. We have quite a collection of old baby wipes<br/>boxes that may or may not be appropriate to use--any opinions on that?<br/>I would prefer to decorate their outsides before stashing them, but<br/>I'm not sure if that's done, either--I really am brand new to this!<br/><br/>Thanks for any advice y'all have to offer!<br/><br/>wen<br/>austin<br/>yahoo id: bitterhazel<br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote>
