You really are coming in in the middle of a lively,<br/>
creative time in the life of our list - and we are<br/>
GLAD to have you and most HAPPY to answer any question<br/>
you have.  While it might seem we have some inside<br/>
jokes going at times, please consider that you ARE an<br/>
insider now too, and if you don't understand, we'll be<br/>
glad to explain.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, yes, we are planning a "barn raising" in<br/>
October - October 23rd to be exact.  In Waxahachie. <br/>
You and your family are invited.  We will spend the<br/>
first half of the day seeding three counties with<br/>
boxes (they have NONE right now), then we'll meet for<br/>
lunch and gathering and talking, then we'll set out to<br/>
find the boxes we planted, leaving them behind for<br/>
letterboxers yet to come to that area.  <br/>
<br/>
Now then, there may be other gatherings in the works,<br/>
but any letterboxer is welcome at any gathering unless<br/>
otherwise stated.  We have a big gathering in March<br/>
where we all get together and have a great time! <br/>
We've had two of these gatherings so far and Silver<br/>
Eagle has organized them for us.<br/>
<br/>
Now - Silver Eagle hasn't been around much this<br/>
summer, but he and his brother BabyBear have been a<br/>
force in Texas letterboxing (I think of Silver Eagle<br/>
as the Yoda of Texas Letterboxing and Baby Bear is<br/>
definitely a Jedi knight in his own right).  They<br/>
planted boxes when there was hardly anyone but each<br/>
other to find them and had the faith to know that the<br/>
rest of us would eventually find our way to<br/>
letterboxing.  There were a few others like Eoghan, I<br/>
think DrooP was in on the beginning, and oddly,<br/>
someone named Julie who disappeared until we recently<br/>
tracked her down and hope to have her to a gathering<br/>
soon.  I know there were others, and to all of them we<br/>
are grateful.<br/>
<br/>
Two years ago there were maybe 50 letterboxers in<br/>
Texas (including family members who were letterboxers<br/>
by default).  Our community has grown to probably<br/>
around 175.  Back then, there were fewer than 100<br/>
boxes - now there are around 700.  The hobby has grown<br/>
quickly in Texas and we've fed off of each other and<br/>
gotten to know each other through gatherings and this<br/>
list and meetings on the trail and in coffee shops. <br/>
Every newcomer seems to bring something to the table,<br/>
and for that we are also grateful.<br/>
<br/>
You've heard us mention GG quite a bit lately.  Well,<br/>
GG is Gryzzled Gryphon, our mystery boxer.  To my<br/>
knowledge, no one knows who he is.  We pretty much all<br/>
know each other through (as I mentioned) this list and<br/>
gatherings and so forth, but also through seeing each<br/>
others' stamps in logbooks.  Well, although we've seen<br/>
his stamp quite a lot and he somehow manages to be FF<br/>
(First Finder) quite often, he has never been seen or<br/>
encountered on the trail.  Only recently has anyone<br/>
even had direct contact with him, and that was through<br/>
email because a boxer in his area asked him in her box<br/>
to email her.  Also, we got the bright idea and Ruby<br/>
Tuesday and her crew CelticLions carried out our plan<br/>
- to place a box to lure him in.  It's called Gryphon<br/>
Bait (we're not very subtle around here!).  Lo and<br/>
behold if the box didn't go missing for awhile, and we<br/>
suspected GG may have taken it as a joke on us (I mean<br/>
really, wouldn't you feel like you should take a box<br/>
intended to bait you?), but it turned up somewhere not<br/>
exactly where it was supposed to be.  Earlier this<br/>
week he actually logged in to the bait box!  We are<br/>
all so excited about it!  AND he emailed Ruby T too! <br/>
I myself had the good fortune a few weeks ago of<br/>
boxing the same area on the same day as him and logged<br/>
into one box just hours before him and another box<br/>
hours after him.  Too much excitement for me - and my<br/>
LSS (Long Suffering Spouse - a partner who humors our<br/>
passion, but isn't as much into it as we are) still<br/>
makes fun of me for getting as excited as I did when I<br/>
discovered his stamp in a really remote box!  I think<br/>
GG is a grand gentleman who has a passion for our<br/>
pasttime and has, up to now, pursued it in a solitary<br/>
manner.  Now that he knows we are fascinated by him,<br/>
who knows what will happen!<br/>
<br/>
And here's another peculiarity about Texas, and it<br/>
actually stemmed from the thoughts of one of our<br/>
Louisiana counterparts, BoxDN.  Shortly before our<br/>
last gathering, a couple of boxes disappeared.  When<br/>
boxes disappear, we all mourn them because we know how<br/>
much each and every box means to its placer, its<br/>
finders, and those who didn't get the opportunity to<br/>
find it.  In the course of discussing these<br/>
disappearances, we also were discussing beignets (we<br/>
like to talk about food too) and where to find them,<br/>
and the two discussions became intertwined until we<br/>
very astutely figured out that the boxes were<br/>
disappearing near where beignets were eaten, so it was<br/>
quite obvious that our boxes were being lost to<br/>
beignet-eating aliens, or BEA's.  BoxDN brought an<br/>
alien emissary to the gathering, and we fully intended<br/>
on having diplomatic discussions with him, but even as<br/>
he hung out in our pavilion, a box critical to<br/>
CelticLions' awesome Clue game (that's yet another<br/>
story) disappeared!  So instead of having a summit<br/>
with the emissary, we hung him in effigy.  And we<br/>
don't apologize for it either!<br/>
<br/>
You will find that our list has quite a sense of humor<br/>
and a sense of comaraderie.  Please don't be<br/>
intimidated by us - we're all fairly harmless!<br/>
<br/>
Let me shoot you some links that may help you out:<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you know www.letterboxing.org<br/>
Then there is www.atlasquest.com<br/>
A new boxers list:  groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers<br/>
<br/>
The Big List (be careful out there - I suggest you<br/>
listen for awhile before you participate on it):<br/>
groups.yahoo.com/group/lbna<br/>
<br/>
A brand new Houston list:<br/>
groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxing_houston<br/>
<br/>
And a Texas Specific interactive, map-based database:<br/>

That should get you started!<br/>

<div>We may like to join everyone in Waxahachie.  I 
guess I will watch for further details.  That sounds like lots of fun and a 
good opportunity to meet everyone.  Every box we find, I turn through the 
stamps and wonder if I will ever be able to put a face to the stamp.  
How exciting.  Thanks for the info.  </div>
