have there. When I saw a box containing all I could dream of getting, <br>
on this item 75% off I caved....lol. So when I got it home I put all <br>
of the ink and the markers up I looked at 58 stamps and thought to <br>
myself oh my goodness what to do with all these stamps. So before I <br>
made up a ton of LB I thought maybe I will ask to see if there is <br>
more leaning towards one way or the other. So before I left to plant <br>
the reaction I got was that some would like them no matter what and <br>
some would like it better if they were carved so I still had the <br>
problem of what to do with all of the stamps....lol. So I just <br>
thought I would do some one way and some the other so when I list <br>
them as either hand carved or store bought people could make up their <br>
own minds. So thats all I wanted was just to see before I hammered <br>
out all of those boxes. I hope everybody will like them no matter <br>
what. That's all I want is to continue to help plant more boxes and <br>
tell a little story about why that stamp means something to me. I <br>
hope we all have fun and remember .....just box!<br>

<div><font size="2">I have a stash of store bought stamps too. Last summer I kept coming across so many geocaches while scouting places to hide my letterboxes. Sometimes I would stamp into their logbooks and leave a message when I'd come across one, but wished I'd had something to leave in their box. Then it occurred to me that I could leave one of my little store bought stamps in them, so I started carrying them with me in my backpack for such occasions. You're very ambitious. I didn't get the nerve to place my first letterbox until I had been boxing for a year and a half! Have fun with your new supplies!</font></div>
