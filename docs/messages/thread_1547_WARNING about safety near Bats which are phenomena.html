<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We went twice and loved it.  We found you must 
stand on the bridge above the bayou facing east (downtown) to get the best view 
of nearly 1/4 of a million bats dispersing toward downtown in approximately 2 
minutes.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">However I need to alert you to a safety 
concern.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The first time we went we parked three blocks south 
of the bridge at a Jack-in-the-Box on Waugh.  The walk was nice, but on the 
way back to the car a young guy, (I'll describe as "surfer-dudish" because of 
his short bleached spiked hair and speech patterns), verbally threatened my 
nine-year-old.  He was either out of his mind on drugs or just out of his 
mind.  Something was definitely wrong with him.  It happened while 
crossing the very busy street.  Another couple was with us and I felt I 
could keep my children safe, but now wish I'd had my pepper spray in my 
pocket.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I only had my boys with me that trip.  The 
week after Thanksgiving, I was arriving near the intersection about one hour 
before I needed to have my daughter to the Houston Ballet for her classes, so we 
decided to stop again.  We parked exactly where Angela did and our van was 
burglarized.  The window was broken, a leather seat punctured 
by glass and three bags were stolen.  I phoned 911 and was told 
to vacate the area, a police man would call me.  The report was taken by 
phone.  The policeman called that area Tinsley Park and said it is 
known for crime.  Tinsley Park's larger parking lot is actually about 
100 yards east of this four car parking space.  The area Angela and I used 
is right next to the fountain my children affectionately call the daffodil, 
because when it sprays water, it looks just like the white weed, before it 
looses its seeds.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2"><font face="Arial"><font size="5">If I were to go again</font>, 
which my husband is not supporting, given our first two trips, I would park at 
the southwest corner of the Allen Parkway/Waugh Intersection.  There is an 
upscale, two-story strip center which is busy.  Keep all valuables out of 
sight:  dvds, garage door openers, purses, lunch bags, computers, 
etc.  The bats take off at dusk.  The night we went a month ago, it 
was at 5:32.  Three weeks before that, it was at 5:45.  Winter's 
official start would have been the shortest day of the year and the 
earliest they would have been departing the bridge.  You want to be there 
just before sundown.</font></font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Post Katrina/Rita, we have more homeless and 
beggars than usual in that area.   I still highly recommend the 
trip.  The bats were phenomenal.  However, I do not want anyone to 
endure what we did.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> <br/>
</div><font face="Arial" size="2">p.s. </font> <font face="Arial" size="2">My car 
alarm did not sound.  The policeman indicated these guys know what 
they are doing.  If they do not open a door, the alarm is not 
activated.  They punched the window and grabbed the goods.</font>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">Hmmmm....  I am very glad you escaped without 
incident!!!!!  While it is true that some places are more prone to such 
activities than others, everyone should realize that there ARE evil people in 
the world intent on having their way without regard to the common law abiding 
citizen.  This could happen anywhere.</span></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005"></span></font> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">Your first line of defense should be your alertness and 
common sense.  If you feel uneasy - there is probably a reason for 
it.  Avoidance is the best policy.  </span></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">Most people are afraid of 
offending strangers, so they act as though everything is normal when their 
senses tell them there is trouble.  Pay attention to your feelings.  
ACT!  Don't slouch and avoid eye contact like a victim.</span></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005"></span></font> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">If you are caught off guard, your defensive posture is 
strictly a personal matter.  I believe in stand-off weapons over contact 
weapons.  A good pistol or PEPPER FOAM (NOT SPRAY) allow you to defend 
without contact.  AVOID CONTACT.  If you can touch them - they can 
touch you.  You do not want to let them close to 
contact.</span></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005"></span></font> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">As a last resort - any object can be pressed into a 
defensive weapon.  Hold your key ring in the palm of your hand, with the 
key points protruding out between your fingers.  Punch the key points into 
the eyes or other sensitive areas.  Engage and escape.  You can call 
for the police later - escape and survival of you and your party is the first 
priority.</span></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005"></span></font> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">Again - alertness and avoidance are your number one 
goals.  </span></font><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">Overall our state is a 99% safe place.  With a 
little attention paid to your surroundings, you can ensure your family of that 
last 1%.</span></font></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005"></span></font> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"><span class="775511223-28122005">Let me share one other thing with you.  This was 
drilled into me as a young man.  It is called the Combat Color Code.  
People say I live more in orange than yellow.  Possibly true.  I can 
accept it.  I hope everyone reading this avoids white.</span></font></div>

<br>
I answered your query - but something seems to have eaten it.  Here it is<br>
again - in TEXT format this time.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
This is what I recommend.<br>
 <br>
http://www.milestonesafety.com/mac10pepfoam2.html<br>
 <br>
Why foam?  The foam squirts out like shaving cream.  It is a heavy stream,<br>
not a mist that can blow back in your face if the wind is against you.  It<br>
sticks to the attacker like shaving cream too.  And it expands to get behind<br>
glasses. The more they try to wipe it away, the more it gets rubbed in.<br>
Last, it contains a UV dye that will identify your attacker for a number of<br>
days.<br>
 <br>
I n Texas pepper spray (foam) is considered simple assault.  If you are<br>
authorized to punch in defense of yourself, you are authorized to use pepper<br>
foam.  If you are charged at all, the charges would be the same if you spray<br>
them or hit them.  In simpler terms - pepper foam is considered to be the<br>
same level of force as a fist.  But it has the stand-off advantage.  You<br>
want to keep them from closing to contact if at all possible.<br>
 <br>
Willing to help in any way if I can.<br>
 <br>
Mike. <br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son, Lightning, and I just got home from a long<br>
letterboxing day in Rusk and I find this topic running<br>
on the list.  After our experience today, it's<br>
interesting the timing...<br>
<br>
We had a full day of boxing planned - I wanted to<br>
check every box in Rusk and I wanted to plant six at<br>
one park and 2 at another.  We got to Jim Hogg<br>
Historical Site and sat down at a picnic table to sort<br>
out our stuff and make sure we had everything we<br>
needed.  The park was dead empty except for the<br>
groundskeeper when we arrived - empty is a situation<br>
that makes me a little uneasy when I am about to head<br>
off into the woods.  Shortly after we got there,<br>
another vehicle pulled in and a guy got out and<br>
started walking around.  My son had finished repacking<br>
his pack so he had taken off a little distance away to<br>
play around with the GPS while I finished my own pack.<br>
 The guy came over and started up a conversation and<br>
he gave me the creeps.  I don't get creepy about folks<br>
too often (in fact, it's a widely known fact that I<br>
have a weirdo magnet, so I often find myself engaged<br>
with folks who are a little - different), but this guy<br>
was sending out the creep vibes, not the oddball<br>
vibes.  I spotted my son and wanted to get closer to<br>
him, so I told the guy that I was waiting for my<br>
husband and he would be really mad if he saw me<br>
talking to another man (my teddy bear husband nearly<br>
fell over laughing when I told him this part of the<br>
story), then grabbed both packs and threw them back in<br>
my car and went to my son, who was closer to the road<br>
and to the buildings and so was safer anyway. <br>
Meanwhile, I had memorized the guy's license number<br>
when I walked by his truck and once we were near the<br>
building where the groundskeeper had disappeared, I<br>
made a note of the license plate and a description of<br>
the guy and the truck.  I felt really silly since all<br>
I really had to bother me was creepy feelings, but I<br>
went ahead and disturbed the groundskeeper and asked<br>
him if he knew the guy.  Sure enough, he apparently<br>
takes his lunch break there at the park every day. <br>
The groundskeeper didn't know his name, but knew his<br>
habit, so I felt better anyway.  Still though, I trust<br>
my creepy feelings implicitly and even if the guy<br>
turned out not to be an immediate threat, there was<br>
"something" about him that I didn't like.  Although we<br>
had packed a lunch, I decided we would leave for a bit<br>
and grab lunch in town and return when the guy's lunch<br>
hour was over.<br>
<br>
It did make me really think about our safety though. <br>
I checked my pepper spray and realized it is expired<br>
(guess I'll be shopping for foam instead).  And I<br>
checked my cell phone to see how charged up it was -<br>
and it wasn't.  Sheesh.  Was I being complacent or<br>
what?  I had theories about what I would do in most<br>
given situations, but I sure wasn't prepared to carry<br>
them out on this particular day!<br>
<br>
After we returned to the park and the guy was gone, we<br>
sat at a picnic table again to relax and digest lunch<br>
before we hit the trail.  While we were sitting there,<br>
we talked about the different safety gear we had with<br>
us and how we could adapt it to different emergency<br>
situations.  We talked about why I had my whistle and<br>
my compass tied to the outside of my pack instead of<br>
tucked inside.  We played a little what-if.  Talked<br>
about how our new GPS could help us in an emergency. <br>
Regretted not bringing our 2-way radios.  <br>
<br>
As it happened, a couple of different groups of moms<br>
and kids had arrived between the time we left and<br>
returned, and a couple of ladies were sitting at a<br>
table near us, so as we got up and got ready to head<br>
out, one of the ladies came over and asked us about<br>
the length and difficulty of the trail.  I was waiting<br>
for Lightning to return from the car, so I told her<br>
the highlights of the trail and what could be easily<br>
reached and what should be avoided.  As she was going<br>
back to her table, she commented that she had<br>
overheard my son and I talking about safety and asked<br>
me how I could take him out there if there were so<br>
many things to worry about.  It was at that moment<br>
that I realized I have a lot of confidence in him and<br>
me - because we HAVE talked about situations and<br>
identified potential problems and pre-determined<br>
possible courses of action.  But more importantly, by<br>
talking out situations, we are training ourselves to<br>
think on our feet.  I told her that by actually<br>
talking about potential problems and brainstorming our<br>
way through them, we can go hiking together<br>
worry-free.<br>
<br>
Lots of folks allow thinking about bad things to make<br>
them scared and fearful, but I think that's because<br>
they don't think through to the resolution - the<br>
moment when they have successfully handled a situation<br>
using nothing but their own brains and the resources<br>
they will have with them.  The likelihood that we can<br>
predict exactly how a situation will happen is pretty<br>
slim, but we can be confident that we can think<br>
quickly to handle whatever may come up.<br>

<div><tt>My son, Lightning, and I just got home from a long<br/>letterboxing 
  day in Rusk and I find this topic running<br/>on the list.  After our 
  experience today, it's<br/>interesting the timing...<span class="638202902-29122005"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"> </font></span></tt></div>

<div><tt>The likelihood that we can<br/>predict exactly how a situation will 
  happen is pretty<br/>slim, but we can be confident that we can think<br/>quickly 
  to handle whatever may come up.<br/><br/>Lucy<span class="638202902-29122005"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2"> </font></span></tt></div>

			Thanks for the link! I will get some foam!<br>
	 <br>
	You are right- you never want to let the attacker get close. The guy<br>
who gave me some shooting lessons years ago told me that most civilians are<br>
better off without guns, because civilians hesitate and criminals do not, so<br>
during that second of hesitation, the criminal will close the distance and<br>
get your weapon and use it against you. Food for thought.<br>
<br>
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++<br>
<br>
This is why I said a defensive posture is a very personal thing.  There is a<br>
level of commitment there that must be realized - for you are quite correct.<br>
Some people are better off not being prepared.  My response might be<br>
different if I were alone or if I had family along.  I carry pepper foam.<br>
If I had enough time, I would draw the pepper foam with the left hand.  But<br>
the right hand MUST remain clear in case the pistol is needed.  And I do<br>
train this way.<br>
<br>
I would be happy to share some scenarios with folks directly if you want<br>
something to think about.<br>
<br>
I cannot force myself into condition white.  Too many years living in yellow<br>
and orange.  But I hope that my alert level allows me to avoid danger and<br>
steer my family and friends out of danger before it ever gets to the final<br>
decision.  However, the circle of friends I travel in are mostly ex-mil or<br>
law enforcement like myself.    It would be kinda like the joke of the two<br>
criminals trying to rob a cop bar.  Just being alert and not looking like a<br>
victim is usually enough.  Not showing fear is the second half.  Most<br>
criminals expect people to show fear and just give in.  When you don't, it<br>
turns the tables on them.<br>
<br>
I truly hope no one here is ever put in a situation where self-defense is<br>
needed.  You will need to make split-second decisions that will affect the<br>
rest of your life - however long that may be - seconds if you are unlucky or<br>
years if you are lucky.  Lucy has a good mind-set.  When you "WHAT-IF"<br>
scenarios in your mind, you have the beginnings of a plan in your head to<br>
start with.<br>
<br>
Well - I am still sick - and losing energy fast.  I am happy this had a good<br>
ending.  Often enough they do not.  But just being alert to your<br>
surroundings is about 75% of whet you need to do to survive.  You can teach<br>
that to your self!<br>
<br>
G-nite Y-all<br>
