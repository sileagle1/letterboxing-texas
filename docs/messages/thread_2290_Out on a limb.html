little letterboxing, then came home and went with Fearless Fox to a<br>
folk festival not too far from home.  What a nice evening!<br>
<br>
One of the groups was promoting a three day songwriters' workshop in<br>
January that they are hosting, and they happened to be my personal<br>
favorite group on the lineup.  Fearless Fox, knowing me too well,<br>
pushed and prodded until I signed up for it.  I can hardly believe I'm<br>
going to do this - I wrote several songs in my teen years, and (as<br>
y'all know) have enjoyed writing casually for quite a long time, but<br>
I've resisted taking it more seriously because I already have at least<br>
two major passions and I know that if I turn myself loose to it,<br>
writing will become such a passion too.<br>
<br>
I can barely breathe when I think about jumping in to this - signing<br>
my name was QUITE a commitment!<br>
