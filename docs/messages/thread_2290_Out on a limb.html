<div>Cool! I'll be on Entertainment Tonight before long giving an interview - "yep... we're old friends... I knew her before she wrote 'Hiking in the Rain with my Compass on a Chain'! I just knew the minute I heard that song it would fly to the top of the chart! That's right... Barefoot Lucy and I go waaaaay back!" <em>And what's your name?</em> "Uh, Puddle Splasher".  <em>I see.... they do have strange names in Texas.... back to you in the studio, Apple.</em></div>
