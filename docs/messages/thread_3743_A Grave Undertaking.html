all of the headstones in that cemetery have been transcribed and <br/>
typed.  However, before I submit any of that list to the people who <br/>
need it (City Hall, Library, Cherokee County Historical Society, and <br/>
publish it on the Cemeteries of Cherokee County website) I really need <br/>
some help in proof-reading the typed list to catch my mistakes.  So, <br/>
since so many people were willing to come and help transcribe, I am <br/>
reaching out again to ask people to come and help proof-read.  So, A <br/>
Grave Undertaking Event (thanks to GG for the name of this event) has <br/>
been born.  It will take place on Saturday, August 30th at 8 am till <br/>
whenever at the City Cemetery in Jacksonville.  It is listed on AQ, so <br/>
please sign up.  I hope to see you there...by the way, most of you <br/>
have heard of Wag Time, and some think she is simply a sock puppet, <br/>
since most of you have not met her...however, she is supposed to be at <br/>
this event (GG, this is mostly directed at you).  Also, if GG shows <br/>
up, you can hear about his run-in with the local law enforcement.<br/>

I regret to advise that I anticipate being in San Antonio on the day <br/>
in question and so cannot attend the Cemetery Sequel. I especially <br/>
regret not being in a position to confirm the existence of the <br/>
mythical Wag Time. All I can hope for is that if any pictures are <br/>
taken they won't be of the usual blurry or obviously photoshopped <br/>
variety so often seen when such "sightings" are "recorded". Of course, <br/>
the main reason that prevents me from returning so soon to <br/>
Jacksonville is that the Statute of Limitations has yet to run on my <br/>
last visit. Have fun and thank Ms. Giraffe again for the sandwiches.   <br/>
