<br/>
We also found out a very disturbing thing...someone stole over 12 caches along Highway 380 and one included a GirlScout letterbox hybrid-I was the first finder on that. It really ticks me off. It was a young girls box and I am sure she won't understand how someone could be so vindictive. Not just regular caches but premium ones too....so just be aware...if we catch the perps they may be prosecuted for theft of property.<br/>
<br/>
Have 2 postals to sign in and a car show this weekend. My geo event is on November 3rd and I may have a letterbox planted. Not sure yet.<br/>
