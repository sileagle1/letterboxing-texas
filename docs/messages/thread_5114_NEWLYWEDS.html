<br>
Joe and Peggy, aka TOP HAT and LADY OF MANY HATS were engaged when Joe got Safari Man to carve a stamp and in the box it was Will You Marry Me?<br>
<br>
Well that has been a while and they got married this month.<br>
<br>
On 12/12/12 at 12:12....so Joe would remember their anniversary.<br>
<br>
They are a great couple and it would be fun if you sign into Atlas Quest and sent them a Best Wishs Email!<br>
<br>
Hmmm I wonder how many of those e-mails will arrive and if Safari Man will get blamed rather than Granny Butterfly?<br>
<br>
Hee Hee Hee.<br>
<br>
Merry Christmas everyhone..Sandy aka Granny Butterfly<br>
