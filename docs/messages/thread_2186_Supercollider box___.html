<div>I just remembered... I was first finder on the Supercollider box! Yep.... even beat GG to that one. In typical Celticlions style, they had a wonderful first finder certificate with a coiled up copper wire "collider". I did that box solo too and know just what you mean. That place must be haunted for it to evoke such strong feelings for those to go there.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>In the late 80's/early 90's I worked for a company in SoCal that made computers for military and "rugged" environments.  I worked for quite a long time trying to get a foot in the door to sell computers on the Supercollider project.  It was notoriously difficult to even get a contact in the electronics engineering portion of the project, much less to pitch goods.  I finally got someone inside to talk to me, and I was making inroads, when I transferred out of the Military Products division and into Accounting in my company.  I took a couple of projects with me because I had cultivated contacts within them that couldn't really be transferred to someone else, and SCSC was one of them.  I left that company in December 1992 and returned to Texas and had good intentions of eventually at least standing outside the gates of the SCSC facility, if not getting inside for a tour (I took some totally cool tours back then-most of them under the veil of non-disclosure affadavits).  In late 1993, they started shutting the project down and it was unheard of shortly after that.  It eventually left my mind and I had forgotten about it until JEN last year, when Stillwater started researching it for a box.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So with that background it was an amazing experience for me to stand on the site - wondering where the tunnel was, looking at the office buildings that looked as though the staff had left at 5 p.m. for the day.  And to know the billions spent there before calling it off.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And there was a sheriff car there when we were there, except that we finally drove up close to where he was and decided he must've been in one of the buildings or the car was vacated.  And of course, my sister-in-law the journalist pulled out her camera and started flashing pictures.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All of it combined - and I was convinced there would be FBI cars waiting at the exit drive to escort us away forever!  Totally X Files...</div>

<p>When LSQ and I went to the Supercollider box in August, there was a <br/>workman at the building nearest the box, but he wasn't watching us, <br/>so I went and got the box. As I was coming back over the <br/>footbridge, a guy in a pickup had pulled up next to the service 
<br/>truck and was watching me, then started over to our car. He asked <br/>what we were doing there. I had my camera around my neck (we always <br/>take pictures when we letterbox), so I told him that I had worked <br/>for one of the contractors when the Supercollider was being built 
<br/>(true, although I didn't actually work on the project). He told me <br/>that the site had been sold and they were changing out locks in all <br/>the buildings. He said it would be okay if I took some pictures and <br/>went back to the building. When we finished with the box, the man 
<br/>in the pickup had left and the workman wasn't interested in us, so I <br/>took it back to its hiding place. When I turned around to come <br/>back, the guy in the pickup was sitting about 100 yards away in the <br/>parking lot watching us. Since I didn't know what else to do, we
