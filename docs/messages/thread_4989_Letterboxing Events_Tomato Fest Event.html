                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I posted the Tomato Fest event earlier today, I've had some new<br/>
folks to email and ask me to tell them more about what happens at<br/>
events. what they should expect, that sort of thing.  Rather than<br/>
answer them each individually, I thought I would bring their questions<br/>
out here for everyone to answer, and I would briefly answer specifics<br/>
about the Tomato Fest.<br/>
<br/>
In general, events and how they are "done" are as diverse as the<br/>
organizers who plan them.  The only common features of pretty much any<br/>
gathering are 1) exchanging stamps with other boxers, 2) boxes to be<br/>
found, 3) an event box, and 4) food!<br/>
<br/>
The Tomato Fest has sort of taken on a life of its own.  It began six<br/>
years ago as a box I had at my booth I was manning at the Tomato Fest,<br/>
and I invited boxers to come and find me and find my box.   The next<br/>
year I held a Pampered Chef kitchen party for my daughter, SJZ, and<br/>
invited letterboxers to attend that since our demonstrator was our<br/>
very own Maydelle Queen Bee.  It was held the day of the city's Tomato<br/>
Fest and rather than giving directions to my house, I gave clues to<br/>
boxes which led boxers to my house.  The third year I tried planting<br/>
boxes in the downtown area, so that boxers had to be stealthy in<br/>
crowds.  The fourth year I was unable to host it and JB Kokopelli<br/>
graciously stepped in and put on a great event during which boxes were<br/>
hidden with her classic eye for the historical aspects of the<br/>
community.  Last year, the theme was celebrity tomatoes and boxers<br/>
joined together in teams and had to accomplish objectives to earn<br/>
clues to boxes hidden away from the crowds.  We have photos of<br/>
Gryzzled Gryphon in handcuffs as evidence of the good times from last<br/>
year!<br/>
<br/>
In general, no matter what the premise, the event has turned into a<br/>
seat-of-the-pants, think-on-your-feet rolling good time!<br/>
<br/>
This year?  Well, as is customary with regard to the Tomato Fest<br/>
gathering, participants will know very little before the actual event.<br/>
 The details will be cloaked in secrecy.  From here on out, anything I<br/>
say on this list or on Facebook may or may not be an important clue to<br/>
what to expect.  I guarantee only a few things:  1) the event is held<br/>
in conjunction with the city's Tomato Fest and you will have time to<br/>
enjoy the festival as well as the event.  2) The event will end with<br/>
food (less than $10 per person).  3) I will give you all the<br/>
information you need prior to the event with enough time to gather<br/>
what you need.  4) You will not have clues to the event boxes before<br/>
the event.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if you are a new boxer, don't be scared away by all the<br/>
mystery.  It may sound a little intimidating to know so little going<br/>
in, but the name of the game for the day is FUN, FUN, FUN and I won't<br/>
have fun unless YOU have fun!<br/>
