letterboxes that I launched today.  I call it the "Texas Governor <br/>

called "Price of Liberty".  I plan to plant the second one tomorrow, <br/>

with the first governor, but will be opportunistic.  That is, I will <br/>
try to get the East Texas governors first, because they are closer to <br/>
where I live, and go from there.  However, if I have the opportunity <br/>
to place one in another area, I'll take advantage of it.  There have <br/>
been 46 different governors so far, so this is a long-term project. <br/>

<p>Thanks, Puddle Splasher, I really appreciate that. I have roots in <br/>Collin County. My great great grandfather, Benjamin Watson, <br/>established Bethlehem Baptist Church north of Farmersville in 1853, <br/>and is buried in the cemetery there. I may take you up on that.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/>&lt;cjagger405@<wbr/>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Boots Tex: If you need any help planting any of your series up in <br/>the DFW area, I'd be happy to help. I know James Webb Throckmorton <br/>(1825-1894) was from McKinney (Collin County). I'm up there about <br/>once a week since my two daughters live in Frisco.

I actually do have a George T. <br/>&gt; Wood box ready to place (his grave site is only a few miles from <br/>&gt; me), but I certainly don't mind seeing another one out there.

I call it the "Texas <br/>&gt; Governor <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Series" and I planted the first one today in Liberty County. <br/>&gt; It's <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called "Price of Liberty". I plan to plant the second one <br/>&gt; tomorrow, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so stay tuned. These boxes will not be in any order, like <br/>&gt; starting <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with the first governor, but will be opportunistic. That is, <br/>&gt; I will <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to get the East Texas governors first, because they are <br/>&gt; closer to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where I live, and go from there. However, if I have the <br/>&gt; opportunity <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to place one in another area, I'll take advantage of it. <br/>&gt; There have <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been 46 different governors so far, so this is a long-term <br/>&gt; project. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The stamps will all be graphic portraits.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>
