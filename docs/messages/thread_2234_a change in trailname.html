character he has been using for the last 6 months or so to as the hero<br>

He wanted you to know before next weekend.  Eyeman has about the<br>
teeniest signature stamp I've ever seen, but that's how he draws--small.<br>

                    <html><body><div>Having done lots of kidwork even when I was a late teenager, I thought I was smart enough when I had kids to know that the magic age is 12.  I said from the beginning that I would sell my child when she reached the age of 12 because that's when she would still be lovable and I could get something for her.  Did y'all know girls change between ages 11 and 12?  They do!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One year while I was coaching soccer, I coached two girls' teams - a team of 11 year olds and a team of 12 year olds.  For my own convenience, I practiced them back to back.  The first hour was the younger team - and they were still cuddly and fun and willing and were happy with whatever we did each practice.  Toward the end of their practice the older girls would start arriving, and you could feel the mood changing.  By the time the first practice was over, the older girls were in fine form - their smart mouths were thoroughly warmed up, but their feet weren't.  You could almost look at them and see their little paws, I mean hands, reaching out with claws extended to swipe at the younger girls as they left.  I wanted to send the younger girls off the back of the field so they could avoid encountering the older ones.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That was ONE season, and one season only.  I retreated to coaching 10s and under for the rest of my coaching career - until nearly the very end.  That same group of 12 year olds had become 17-18 and they needed a coach.  With fear and trepidation, I ventured onto the field with them again.  I wore kevlar armor and a face mask and helmet.  I quickly discovered that the Mean Girls had gone away, but I had to contend with them finishing their makeup before they would take their laps, and endless comparisons of who had what cleats, and if a girl came along with new cleats?  Well stop practice and let's all take a look!  And if they matched our uniforms AND were a good name brand?  She WAS the girl of the hour!  And uniforms - have you ever tried to shop with 18 girls?  we went through umpteen variations of uniforms until we found JUST the right length and style of shorts, NO stripes on the shirts please, Yellow was simply out, price of course was no object because Mom and Dad would gladly pay.  We had to travel to games, so they requested that we only play in towns with malls, and no scheduling games before Noon or after 4 in the afternoon - they DID, after all, have a social life!  I would load them in a van or two to go, and we would be followed by a string of boyfriend-driven cars.  Cute refs?  I may as well consider the game lost.  
<br/><br/>That particular team went on to the championship recreational tournament in North Texas and did pretty well - advanced into the second round of playoffs, but the nail kit got a bigger workout than the first aid kit.

I think it occurred to me last week that she was going to go through all the same transformations that the older ones went through, but worse. </div> <div> </div> <div>We asked Cassie what she wanted for her Bday. She said makeup (she's not kidding), jewelry and Barbie's. I said don't you want some clothes (I'm a nonpracticing child psche :) She replied, "Only if they are really really cute and stylish and I'll look good in them." Where did that come from. I was 11 (hmmm, seems BL called that one) before I cared what I wore. I was running around in my undies at 5 (long, long, long, LONG time ago).</div> <div> </div> <div>Heavy sigh. Isn't there anyone that needs a cute little girl 5 going on 20? I'm willing to do a lease, no money down.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet<br/><br/><b><i>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div>Having done lots of kidwork even when I was a late teenager, I thought I was smart enough when I had kids to know that the magic age is 12.  I said from the beginning that I would sell my child when she reached the age of 12 because that's when she would still be lovable and I could get something for her.  Did y'all know girls change between ages 11 and 12?  They do! </div> <div> </div> <div>One year while I was coaching soccer, I coached two girls' teams - a team of 11 year olds and a team of 12 year olds.  For my own convenience, I practiced
 them back to back.  The first hour was the younger team - and they were still cuddly and fun and willing and were happy with whatever we did each practice.  Toward the end of their practice the older girls would start arriving, and you could feel the mood changing.  By the time the first practice was over, the older girls were in fine form - their smart mouths were thoroughly warmed up, but their feet weren't.  You could almost look at them and see their little paws, I mean hands, reaching out with claws extended to swipe at the younger girls as they left.  I wanted to send the younger girls off the back of the field so they could avoid encountering the older ones.  </div> <div> </div> <div>That was ONE season, and one season only.  I retreated to coaching 10s and under for the rest of my coaching career - until nearly the very end.  That same group of 12 year olds had become 17-18 and they needed a coach.  With fear and
 trepidation, I ventured onto the field with them again.  I wore kevlar armor and a face mask and helmet.  I quickly discovered that the Mean Girls had gone away, but I had to contend with them finishing their makeup before they would take their laps, and endless comparisons of who had what cleats, and if a girl came along with new cleats?  Well stop practice and let's all take a look!  And if they matched our uniforms AND were a good name brand?  She WAS the girl of the hour!  And uniforms - have you ever tried to shop with 18 girls?  we went through umpteen variations of uniforms until we found JUST the right length and style of shorts, NO stripes on the shirts please, Yellow was simply out, price of course was no object because Mom and Dad would gladly pay.  We had to travel to games, so they requested that we only play in towns with malls, and no scheduling games before Noon or after 4 in the afternoon - they DID, after all, have
 a social life!  I would load them in a van or two to go, and we would be followed by a string of boyfriend-driven cars.  Cute refs?  I may as well consider the game lost.  <br/><br/>That particular team went on to the championship recreational tournament in North Texas and did pretty well - advanced into the second round of playoffs, but the nail kit got a bigger workout than the first aid kit. </div> <div> </div> <div>I was never so glad my second child was a boy!  Sandibox, I feel for ya!</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 10/15/06, <b class="gmail_sendername">Sandi</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:sandibox@msn.com">sandibox@msn.<wbr>com</wbr></a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid"> <div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> <div> <div> <div> <div>Watch what you wish for!
