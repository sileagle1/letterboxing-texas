                    <div class="plaintext-content">Despite poor weather and lack of campsites, our third TX LB Event <br>
was a success, mainly because TX Letterboxers are a lot of fun! <br>
About 40 people attended this year, including a mystery guest <br>
(Gryzzled Gryphon) and out-of-state letterboxers (Compass Points & <br>
Happy Days from Oklahoma). <br>
<br>
The festivities actually started Friday night, when several boxers <br>
sampled some local wine at the Maydelle Winery, then moved on to <br>
Bertha's for all-you-can-eat catfish. The winery was fun and the <br>
food was superb. <br>
<br>
The next morning was cold and rainy, but a roaring fire and furious <br>
stamping in each other's logbooks kept everyone warm and happy. <br>
After eating some chili and other treats it was time to play <br>
Letterbox Bingo. This fun game was organized by Dewberry and she did <br>
a great job. I am still amazed she was able to hide 25 boxes in the <br>
park for us to find. The first several people to Bingo received nice <br>
prizes, also provided by Dewberry. Later that afternoon it was time <br>
to eat again and finally relax with the remaining letterboxers. A <br>
few of us stayed until after 8:00, drinking Barefoot Lucy's homemade <br>
Irish Cream and swapping letterbox tales. This is always my favorite <br>
part of Events, and I hope next year the camping situation will <br>
allow more people to camp the night of the Event so they don't have <br>
to leave so early. <br>
<br>
I want to give special thanks to Barefoot Lucy for being our travel <br>
agent, tour guide and troubleshooter. She is a big reason the Event <br>
was a success. I also want to thank Lucy Locket for making the Event <br>
Poster, and Dewberry for organizing the Bingo game. And I especially <br>
want to thank my brother Baby Bear for helping put on another <br>
successful Event. Last but not least, thanks to all of you that <br>
attended for coming and making it fun. I can't wait to do it again <br>
next year! <br>

<div>Love that name!  Always makes me think of Robert Redford rather than 
F.S. Fitzgerald, but still, it's a great trailname!  Enjoyed meeting the 3

Sorry we missed what seems to have been a great event. We were <br>
traveling in the fields of Kansas and the Rockie Mountains. Saw <br>
Gryzzled Gryphon's signature stamp along the way. My husban was <br>
impressed with it and the ink color. We was really getting into it <br>
asking so do you just have to use black? I told him we could look <br>
into using different colors to see what we liked : ) <br>
<br>
P.S. <br>
My family really loves letter boxing, realy glad to have found this <br>
fun hobby!<br>
