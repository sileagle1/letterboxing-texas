                    <div class="plaintext-content">Back in November you were invited to participate in a web-based survey<br>
about letterboxing as part of a doctoral dissertation. Well, I have<br>
now completed the data analysis and written the report of my findings.<br>
 To take a look at what I learned about the 355 participants in my<br>
study, check out my blog at www.letterblogger.blogspot.com.  I am<br>
adding new information to the blog every day for the next two weeeks.<br>
 Thanks again to those who participated and supported me.  Your<br>
comments on the blog are encouraged.  Be well and do good things.  <br>
