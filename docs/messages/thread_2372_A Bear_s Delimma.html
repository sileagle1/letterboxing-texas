                    <div class="plaintext-content">While searching for LB's in Memorial park this week with Silver <br/>
Eagle, I told him about my adventure in finding the mystery <br/>
box, "GW".   He suggested I share this story with everyone, so all <br/>
get get a laugh at my expense as he did.  Don't worry Jeff, I will <br/>
not disclose details on the box location.<br/>
<br/>
I arrived at the park with the clues I had figured out in hand (but <br/>
still not clear).   So I got to the location I was sure of, then <br/>
began going through the options.   After 30 minutes of searching I <br/>
heard a noise and figured it was more joggers coming by (I had <br/>
already hid behind a tree for the set of 10 that had run by 20 <br/>
minutes ago).  I turned to look and got chills when I saw a huge dog <br/>
(rotty)with a spike collar running at me.  I knew I could not out <br/>
run him, so I just hoped he would not attack.  Turns out he was <br/>
friendly.   Actually he was to friendly.  He kept jumping up on me <br/>
wanting to play.   I waited about 5 minutes, looking down different <br/>
paths to see if someone would come to claim him, but no one came.  <br/>
So I went back to looking for the box, thinking he would leave.   <br/>
NO.  He kept following me everywhere.  Then a jogger came along and <br/>
he ran up to her.  I could tell she was scared so I yelled that "he <br/>
is friendly, but he is not Mine".  Unfortunatly he did not go with <br/>
her, he stayed with me.  So I decided I needed to shake him.  I <br/>
walked back to the main part of the park, as I could here people <br/>
playing out there.  I thought if he would see others he would go to <br/>
them.  He walked ahead and scanned the park, as I backed off slowly <br/>
down the trail.  This worked for about 30 seconds, when he turned <br/>
and saw me way down the trail and came galloping back.   Okay, plan <br/>
B.  After following me for awhile he wondered into the trees.  I <br/>
walked up the trail then hid behind a big tree.   Soon he realized I <br/>
was gone and started to search.   He ran up the trail, stopping on <br/>
occasion to listen for me.  As he approached my tree I worked my way <br/>
around it so as he passed he did not see me.  He continued up the <br/>
trail about 50 yards, stopped, then turned around and came back to <br/>
my tree.  Foiled again.  Did I mention I was trying to find "GW" <br/>
box.   It had now been 1:30.   I was about to just give up and <br/>
leave, as I was concerned about this dog chasing someone else, when <br/>
a lady came running up another path calling the dog.   Finally, the <br/>
owner, I'm free.   Not so fast.  She then wanted to talk.  30 more <br/>
minutes gone.   She departed with dog, but as I was plowing through <br/>
the brush, she came back by again (probably wondering at this time <br/>
why I am still in the same area and digging through the brush).  In <br/>
fact she came back and forth about 4 times, until another person <br/>
joined her and the left the area.   Now I could focus on the box.  I <br/>
found it (in original place I though it would be), after 2 1/4 hours <br/>
of dog infested searching.  At least I did not in trouble with a <br/>
Park Ranger for once!<br/>

<div>You know, I would feel

big run away dogs.</div>

day as I think of Baby Bear circling the tree trying to keep out of the dog's
