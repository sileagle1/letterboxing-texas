Silver Eagle - deleted your last message so sending in the blind to <br>
the list.  Please reply when you get this.<br>
<br>
We got her done!<br>
<br>
The wonderful Garmin GPS found us a walmart.  Inside was lock-n-lock, <br>
a spiral-wound 50 piece 3x5 card book, zip-lock freezer bags, and <br>
mechanical pencils.<br>
<br>
With the help of a passing police officer with a flashlight (who loved <br>
our dogs BTW), we ventured into the darkness to replace your water-<br>
logged box.  I couldn't stuff the old log-book in the lock-n-lock.  <br>
You could squeeze a cup of water from it.  So I have it, will carry it <br>
to El Paso with us.  There is NOTHING left of the stamps in it.  I can <br>
mail it to you if you like.  Swamp water and all!  <grin><br>
<br>
Then we took James to Joe's Crab Shack for dinner, and sent him on his <br>
way to Ft. Hood.  We will leave for El Paso at 0500 Monday.<br>
<br>
Take care sir.<br>
<br>

Mike found my San Marcos Salamander box cracked and full of water <br>
with only the stamp left unharmed.  He replaced the box and logbook, <br>
so it is back in action.  Sounds like you had a little adventure <br>
while replacing it, too.<br>
