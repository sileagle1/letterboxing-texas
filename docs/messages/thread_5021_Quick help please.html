                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm teaching letterboxing to GA's at church for the next two or three<br/>
weeks and I'm trying to round up some simple images to provide for<br/>
them to carve tonight.  These girls are 10-12 years old.  There are<br/>
about 8 of them and I would like some help thinking up images that<br/>
might appeal to them.  I know I have a soccer player, a tennis player,<br/>
an animal lover, a fashion diva, and a few run-of-the-mill typical<br/>
preteen girls.<br/>
<br/>
Next week we will be searching for boxes that I plant on the church<br/>
campus, and after that - who knows.  As it turns out, their two GA<br/>
leaders have both been dabbling in letterboxing for the last couple of<br/>
years and the 7th grade Sunday School teacher has been out boxing with<br/>
me a couple of times.<br/>
<br/>
Any ideas?<br/>
