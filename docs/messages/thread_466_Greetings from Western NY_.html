This is the Sprite and the Highlander from upstate NY! We've been <br>
down to Dallas for our Thanksgiving family getogether and were <br>
thrilled to find this hobby has taken off down here! We moved to NY <br>
in 2000 and didn't find out about letterboxing until just this year, <br>
but we couldn't have picked a better time to start...there's boxes <br>
EVERYWHERE!<br>
<br>
We added two new boxes to the North Texas bunch, Coming Home and Once <br>
a Year (Uncle Julie). The second one is gettint the camo treatment <br>
from a local friend before they place it in the spot we chose, but <br>
the other is out and about already (posted on both LBNA and Atlas <br>
Quest). Also put an HH out there and picked up one of our own, so <br>
you've got new travelling blood out there!<br>
<br>
We'd love to get to know you guys...even though we'll only be around <br>
once a year, email and groups like this last forever (or until the <br>
systems crash)! Could we prevail upon any of you to give us a tiny <br>
bit of info on yourselves (like names and where you are in TX so <br>
we'll know who we've met?). So far, our only connection is the Celtic <br>
Lions (who placed some GREAT boxes out our way!), so anyone who <br>
wouldn't mind a brief repeat of what I'm sure you all did years ago, <br>
please do! Feel free to contact us offlist, too if you want to visit <br>
the Buffalo Niagara region...we will GLADLY zip you around to the <br>
overabundance of local boxes. We're also able to place boxes up here <br>
for you, so if you'd just like to see your HH move a bit (or just get <br>
your name in a different corner of the US) write us!<br>
<br>
Thanks again to the Celtic Lions for a GREAT Thanksgiving treat...our <br>
other Texas friends liked it so much that they're getting started <br>
boxing, too!<br>

P.S.--What's up with the Mad Box Stealer and His Evil Aquarium of <br>
Reptiles??? He's not gonna go on Atlas Quest or LBNA, is he? 'Cause <br>
if so, the Highlander wants to know his real address so he can <br>
um...CHAT with him...in a very personal way...with blunt <br>
objects...and lots of screaming! :-D<br>
