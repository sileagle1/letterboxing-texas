                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was spooked out letterboxing last weekend in Ben Wheeler. We went<br>
out to Edom to pick blueberries before the season was totally over<br>
here and decided to find a few boxes out there as well. One of the<br>
places we went was Bethlehem cemetery in Ben Wheeler. <br>
<br>
Now I am totally fine in cemeteries. I go to them for genealogy stuff<br>
all the time as well as letterboxing, but there is just something<br>
about a cemetery/church in the middle of nowhere with waist high grass<br>
and an abandoned feel to it that is a little spooky. Add to that the<br>
possibility of snakes in the high grass and the big spiderwebs I<br>
almost walked into and I got spooked out. I found one of the boxes in<br>
the cemetery easily but when I didn't locate the other right away, I<br>
decided to get out of there and come back in the winter (maybe). The<br>
funny part was it was the middle of the day, I think if it had been<br>
evening I would have been yelling and screaming and running out, if<br>
I'd even had the courage to go in. <br>
<br>
So that was a pretty memorable box hunt for me, and a story I thought<br>
might be fun to share. Where were my kids who were with me? This was<br>
box #5 so they were past done and were sitting in the nice cool a/c<br>
truck while mom found "just one more box, it's on our way (kinda)".<br>
Smart kids. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm up for it!  Cemeteries are my favorite places to find and place <br>
letterboxes.  I've been to a lot of them and none of the residents <br>
have ever bothered me or messed with a box.  Except for "The Ghost of <br>
Oakwood Cemetery" in Austin, who confiscated LSQ's letterbox (Jacob's <br>
Ladder) and sent us an email with a creepy warning about placing <br>
boxes there.  He never bothered my governor box (The Leaning Tower of <br>
Pease), though.  Do ghosts send emails?  By the way, thanks to Cancan <br>
for placing a new logbook in the Pease box.<br>

<p>I'm up for it! Cemeteries are my favorite places to find and place <br/>letterboxes. I've been to a lot of them and none of the residents <br/>have ever bothered me or messed with a box.

<p>JBK and I will! We both love cemeteries and ghost stories (and ghosts too, of course)!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Aurora Cemetery in Aurora, Texas, has a wierd vibe to me. I made my <br>
mother and sister go with me to find "Flying in Circles." I want to to <br>
a box for the Space Man that crashed there years ago, but I'm going to <br>
have to take someone with me. My family thought it was the hype about <br>
the place, but it was just...weird.<br>
Also, when we found "Floating Away" in Roanoke, the IOOF Cemetery had a <br>
camp fire in the back and the graves are buried in odd spots. Top that <br>
off with the random benches in the woods and the newly built stage, we <br>
got our stamps and high tailed it.<br>
I still want to go to the cemetery you are speaking of. But I know <br>
the 'feeling' you are speaking about.<br>

<p>I was spooked out letterboxing last weekend in Ben Wheeler. We went<br/>out 
  to Edom to pick blueberries before the season was totally over<br/>here and 
  decided to find a few boxes out there as well. One of the<br/>places we went 
  was Bethlehem cemetery in Ben Wheeler. <br/><br/>Now I am totally fine in 
  cemeteries. I go to them for genealogy stuff<br/>all the time as well as 
  letterboxing, but there is just something<br/>about a cemetery/church in the 
  middle of nowhere with waist high grass<br/>and an abandoned feel to it that is 
  a little spooky. Add to that the<br/>possibility of snakes in the high grass 
  and the big spiderwebs I<br/>almost walked into and I got spooked out. I found 
  one of the boxes in<br/>the cemetery easily but when I didn't locate the other 
  right away, I<br/>decided to get out of there and come back in the winter 
  (maybe). The<br/>funny part was it was the middle of the day, I think if it had 
  been<br/>evening I would have been yelling and screaming and running out, 
  if<br/>I'd even had the courage to go in. <br/><br/>So that was a pretty 
  memorable box hunt for me, and a story I thought<br/>might be fun to share. 
  Where were my kids who were with me? This was<br/>box #5 so they were past done 
  and were sitting in the nice cool a/c<br/>truck while mom found "just one more 
  box, it's on our way (kinda)".<br/>Smart kids.
