                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was spooked out letterboxing last weekend in Ben Wheeler. We went<br/>
out to Edom to pick blueberries before the season was totally over<br/>
here and decided to find a few boxes out there as well. One of the<br/>
places we went was Bethlehem cemetery in Ben Wheeler. <br/>
<br/>
Now I am totally fine in cemeteries. I go to them for genealogy stuff<br/>
all the time as well as letterboxing, but there is just something<br/>
about a cemetery/church in the middle of nowhere with waist high grass<br/>
and an abandoned feel to it that is a little spooky. Add to that the<br/>
possibility of snakes in the high grass and the big spiderwebs I<br/>
almost walked into and I got spooked out. I found one of the boxes in<br/>
the cemetery easily but when I didn't locate the other right away, I<br/>
decided to get out of there and come back in the winter (maybe). The<br/>
funny part was it was the middle of the day, I think if it had been<br/>
evening I would have been yelling and screaming and running out, if<br/>
I'd even had the courage to go in. <br/>
<br/>
So that was a pretty memorable box hunt for me, and a story I thought<br/>
might be fun to share. Where were my kids who were with me? This was<br/>
box #5 so they were past done and were sitting in the nice cool a/c<br/>
truck while mom found "just one more box, it's on our way (kinda)".<br/>
Smart kids. <br/>

Ladder) and sent us an email with a creepy warning about placing <br/>
boxes there.  He never bothered my governor box (The Leaning Tower of <br/>
Pease), though.  Do ghosts send emails?  By the way, thanks to Cancan <br/>

&gt; This <br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box #5 so they were past done and were sitting in the nice <br/>
cool <br/>

<p>I'm up for it! Cemeteries are my favorite places to find and place <br/>letterboxes. I've been to a lot of them and none of the residents <br/>have ever bothered me or messed with a box.

mother and sister go with me to find "Flying in Circles." I want to to <br/>
a box for the Space Man that crashed there years ago, but I'm going to <br/>
have to take someone with me. My family thought it was the hype about <br/>
the place, but it was just...weird.<br/>
Also, when we found "Floating Away" in Roanoke, the IOOF Cemetery had a <br/>
camp fire in the back and the graves are buried in odd spots. Top that <br/>
off with the random benches in the woods and the newly built stage, we <br/>
got our stamps and high tailed it.<br/>

One of the<br/>places we went was Bethlehem cemetery in Ben Wheeler. <br/><br/>Now I am totally fine in cemeteries. I go to them for genealogy stuff<br/>all the time as well as letterboxing, but there is just something<br/>about a cemetery/church in the middle of nowhere with waist high grass<br/>and an abandoned feel to it that is a little spooky. Add to that the<br/>possibility of snakes in the high grass and the big spiderwebs I<br/>almost walked into and I got spooked out. I found one of the boxes in<br/>the cemetery easily but when I didn't locate the other right away, I<br/>decided to get out of there and come back in the winter (maybe). The<br/>funny part was it was the middle of the day, I think if it had been<br/>evening I would have been yelling and screaming
 and running out, if<br/>I'd even had the courage to go in. <br/><br/>So that was a pretty memorable box hunt for me, and a story I thought<br/>might be fun to share. Where were my kids who were with me? This was<br/>box #5 so they were past done and were sitting in the nice cool a/c<br/>truck while mom found "just one more box, it's on our way (kinda)".<br/>Smart kids. <br/><br/>allyall<br/><br/></p></div></blockquote></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>

<div>...So if I'm planning on 
planting one in a graveyard that has a strong <br/>reputation of being haunted, 
you'd rather I'd choose another place? <br/>How about if I warn about not 
visiting it at the witching hour? I <br/>have a long list of places where ghosts 
or other spirits (one had a <br/>woman's body and a bear's head) have appeared 
(Uvalde County and the <br/>surrounding area is very haunted, apparently) and I 
was thinking of a <br/>series...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nope - that would be a very interesting location I'd probably be very 
excited to explore, but I don't think I'd be creeping around in any cemetery (or 
most other places, for that matter)  in the middle of the night.  I'm 
not afraid of ghosts, but I'm afraid of groundskeepers and cops and others who 
might suspect me of vandalism or theft in the middle of the night and question 
me about what I'm doing there... so I'd make it a point to be there in the 
daylight anyway!</div>

<div>Nope - that would be a very interesting location I'd probably be very excited to explore, but I don't think I'd be creeping around in any cemetery (or most other places, for that matter)  in the middle of the night.  I'm not afraid of ghosts, but I'm afraid of groundskeepers and cops and others who might suspect me of vandalism or theft in the middle of the night and question me about what I'm doing there... so I'd make it a point to be there in the daylight anyway!</div>
