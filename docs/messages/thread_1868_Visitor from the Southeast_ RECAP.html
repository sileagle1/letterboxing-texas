<br>
Just wanted to let all of you know that I had a great time in the<br>
Houston area this week. I'm back home now, having recorded 10<br>
"traditional" Finds and one HH (the Buffalo-Gourd Flower), which will<br>
be planted in a Georgia box soon... perhaps this weekend!<br>
<br>
Somebody once told me that Texas doesn't have trees... they don't know<br>
what they were talking about, or they ain't been to Houston! One of<br>
the boxes I went after said to look for a multi-trunked tree... and<br>
everywhere I looked there was a multitude of multi-trunked oak trees!<br>
The coolest thing was driving on some of the urban and suburban<br>
residential streets and feeling like I was driving through tunnels<br>
made of trees. Astounding!<br>
<br>
Speaking of driving, it really got me, and not in a bad way. Nobody<br>
told me about the wacky exit and on-ramp system (which actually works<br>
pretty good, I think). And then those dedicated U-turn lanes under US<br>
59... what imagination... But the kicker was that it seemed like<br>
everyone was driving within 5 mph of the speed limit!! I live on the<br>
far outskirts of the metro Atlanta area, and if I drove the speed<br>
limit on any highway, freeway or street, I'd get an earful.<br>
<br>
But back to the letterboxes: I think 10 boxes is pretty good for four<br>
days in which I actually had limited time to get out there and 'box. I<br>
missed four (that I actually got out of the car for). Three weren't<br>
there (pretty sure, but not positive), and one was too overgrown with<br>
poison ivy for me to risk it.<br>
<br>
And there's always next time!<br>
