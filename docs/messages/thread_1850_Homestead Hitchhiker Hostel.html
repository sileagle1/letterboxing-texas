                    <html><body><div>The end of the currently situated Homestead Hitchhiker Hostel is close at hand.  They are building an apartment complex near it, so the box's location will be situated directly between the 5th and 6th grade school and the low-income apartment complex, complete with woods and field for the kids to play in.  The hiding place itdrlg is a prime placefor kids to play, so I suspect my box would not survive long.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I give the complex about three months before people begin to move in, so I'm going to keep a close eye and move it as soon as traffic picks up.  I will carve it a new stamp and hide it somewhere else, so that it should qualify as a new find.  It will still be a hostel and the HH's currently in it will simply be transferred over.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I mention this so that anyone who had been thinking they want to go after that box might want to grab it before the stamp is retired.  <br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
