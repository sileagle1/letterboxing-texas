<div>. . .  I must say that I know Barefoot Lucy and don't believe she meant to offend in her posting.  She is actually a very devoted scouter.  The original intent of the email, at least how I read it, was to open up a dialog on this issue.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's how I read it. But, as with any group of people there is going to be some chance that someone may take it the wrong way and get their feelings hurt or take offense.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At one time, I was writing back and forth with someone from this group. We were writing privately and I told her that I never meant to offend someone and that I would probably not write anymore posts, only read. She told me not to do that. She enjoyed my posts and that I should not worry about people getting bored or not liking my posts.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Everyone has a choice of whether to read someone's posts or not. I've stopped reading a thread many times if it doesn't interest me or makes me upset. That's why I hope that everyone knows to channge the subject line when they change the subject (as I have here but am guilty of not doing more often than not, hehe). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have come across a boxer than I didn't get on with right away (it was at an event). But, never have I felt that anyone was kept out of the group. I hate the thought of someone feeling that way. But, you can't make someone feel a certain way, they have to choose on their own.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I honestly have no idea what the Investigator Bacon thing is about, but I know there is something behind it. It's like a train wreck, I don't want to look, but I'm afraid if I don't I will miss something interesting.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Venting needs to be done sometimes. I know if I had a problem with boxing, my family would not be able to help me. I'd need y'all to vent my frustrations. Which I have done once or twice. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm done.</div>
