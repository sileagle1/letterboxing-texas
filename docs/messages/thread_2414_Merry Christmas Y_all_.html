<div>Merry Christmas to all of you - I would not enjoy letterboxing nearly as much if it weren't for all of you, my good friends on the Texas letterboxing scene.<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Aside to PurpleintexKim, I know today marks the anniversary of your husband's accident.  I'm really glad you and he and your family are celebrating this Christmas better than you were able to last Christmas!
