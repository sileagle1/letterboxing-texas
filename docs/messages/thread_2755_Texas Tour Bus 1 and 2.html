My Nany (mother's mother) had the Carpenter's Best Hits Album (for all of you younguns, that's the big black thing that we put on top of a stereo and this arm with a needle, no good for carving, and it would turn around and play music. And sometimes, if they got scratched, we melted them over a can and make a beautiful bowl out of them). Where was I? Oh, yeah, the Carpenter's. So, when I would spend the night, which was all the time, because I was the only GD and we had a most special bond,  on Saturday mornings I would play that album over and over again and sing to it because the album had the words in a cool pamplet. Heavy sigh. Those were the best of times. I really miss my Nany. She would have loved the idea of letterboxing and she would've been an awesome carver and her logbooks would make

We were there getting the Barton Salamander and so were they.  They took the box and I explained all about it to them because they were fairly new to letterboxing. I told them they would need to replant the bus and post the clues here and gave them all the information.  So I don't really know that the bus was re-planted in Barton Springs or some other Austin location....fact is I haven't heard anything so I don't even know if it has been replanted yet or not. I was hoping that someone in Austin might know them and pass the word around to find out what is happening with the TTB1. They did tell me that they had friends that did letterboxing, so I hope that maybe some of our faithful lb'ers out in Austin way might get the word out to them.<br/><br/><b><i>carie78504 &lt;carierraine@hotmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:  </p><blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div><br/>I am in Austin, have any idea where in Barton Springs I should look? <br/>NOt that it is necessarily still there....
