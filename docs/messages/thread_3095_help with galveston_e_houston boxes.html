we'll be in the Galveston Island area, but might venture up to NASA <br/>

that,two by the Hoppers are still there. And then there were Nun &amp; Long <br/>
Lost Treasure of the Pirate Jean LaFitte.The Celtic Cross by Hawk is <br/>
good to go too.<br/>
Legend of the Sand Dollar is a lost cause. I hope this helps you out. <br/>
