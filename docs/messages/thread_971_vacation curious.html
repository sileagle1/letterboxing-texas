                    <div class="plaintext-content">So, I'm sitting here looking at South Carolina letterboxes and that <br>
has made me wonder, where are folks planning vacations and will <br>
letterboxing be a part of it?  Will you be planting or finding?<br>
<br>
We'll be hitting the road, driving to Kiawah SC.  On the way there, <br>
we will be graced with no children, so we're hoping to do a few <br>
longer hikes and hopefully hit some challenging BOXD'N boxes.  On <br>
the way back, we'll have the kids, so it'll be more family-friendly <br>
walks.  While we're there, the kids will have no desire to leave the <br>
beach to go letterboxing, but maybe we can get them out for part of <br>
the day a couple of times.<br>
<br>
We are also looking at a fall pilgrimage to Legoland near San Diego, <br>
so I've been daydreaming about cooler climes/less humidity in <br>
southern California.  <br>
<br>
What about you?<br>

                    <html><body><div>My family is driving from Houston to Lake Texoma in Oklahoma at the end of July, then on to my mom's house on TableRock Lake in the southwest corner of Missouri.  I have already looked up some boxes on the route, and another family we are going to Oklahoma with will be finding their first somewhere between here and OK.  Thinking about coming home a different way to get different boxes.  Looking forward to LBing, and hoping that it breaks up the drive some.  My LSS HATES long drives.  My children don't hate them now that we have the TV/DVD player.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Think we will mostly find, possibly plant near my mom's house.  (There are three within a reasonable drive of her house, maybe more).  Maybe one by the "shoe tree" in Arkansas.  (She lives half way between Eureka Springs Ark and Branson, MO.  Very near the Dogwood box in Lampe, MO.)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also will try to addict as many people as possible on the trip...</div>
