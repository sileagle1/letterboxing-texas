                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is a cafe in Maydelle, which is about 7 miles<br/>
from the State Park, and they serve all-you-can-eat<br/>
out-of-this-world catfish on the weekends.  They don't<br/>
have a huge amount of seating, maybe 10 tables of 4,<br/>
but I think they would be thrilled to serve us (if we<br/>
let 'em know we're all coming)!  It's a laid-back<br/>
little country store kind of place, a great way to<br/>
start a laid-back little country gathering.<br/>
<br/>
For myself, I plan on taking off the Friday of the<br/>
gathering, so if anyone needs/wants me to check them<br/>
in at the campsite so they can get a good site, I'll<br/>
be glad to do that if you've paid in advance (of<br/>
course, that means you also have to tell me what your<br/>
definition of "good" is).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Perhaps we could add something like this on Friday<br/>
&gt; night for anyone  <br/>
&gt; interested. . .?<br/>
