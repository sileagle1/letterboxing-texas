it HAS happened to us.  Three years ago we were letterboxing in

<p>ok, i ran across something today, that i have never seen nor heard of <br/>before. i went to find a box and the box was there, but when i <br/>started getting the logbook and stamp out, the stamp did not match the <br/>name of the box, and the logbook stated that the box had been pirated <br/>by the almost famous jolly roger. the logbook then said to turn to <br/>the back page for directions to the treasure that i was looking for. <br/>so i followed those directions and they led me to the box that i was <br/>originally looking for...has anyone ever had this happen to them???<br/>jb<br/><br/></p></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></tbody></table><br/></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>

what they wanted to do.  Reading JB's note made sense.  I never did<br/>
respond as I was on a month long vacation and quite honestly I forgot<br/>
all about it.  I don't know if I would want one of my boxes moved, per<br/>
some of Lucys notes below.  It would be a nice surprise to find a box<br/>
like this though.  I'm gonna have to think about that one a bit longer..<br/>

You're thoughts are the same as mine.  I would be hightly upset if my <br/>
box got moved, then went missing since it got moved.   If someone is <br/>
pirating their own boxes, then yes this is a neat and fun idea, but <br/>
if taking other's boxes, then I don't think this should be done, and <br/>
it could get ugly. Anyway, that's my 3 cents.<br/>

<p>Now that I think about it, I had received an email in June. A boxer<br/>that I did not know asked me if she/he could turn one of my boxes into<br/>a Pirate box. I had no idea what that was and didn't quite understand<br/>what they wanted to do. Reading JB's note made sense. I never did<br/>respond as I was on a month long vacation and quite honestly I forgot<br/>all about it. I don't know if I would want one of my boxes moved, per<br/>some of Lucys notes below. It would be a nice surprise to find a box<br/>like this though.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am often inspired to hide a letterbox by a certain location. I <br/>
spent quite some time and a couple of trips trying to find a safe <br/>
place to hide "The Mick" letterbox, so that it would be close to <br/>
Mickey Mantle's tomb. It wasn't easy! I even moved it once after I <br/>
originally hid it because I was afraid the first spot might be <br/>
vunerable. I would be plenty irritated if someone decided they should <br/>
take it upon themselves to move it for me. To me, it just sounds like <br/>
muggling. I have another box ready to be planted soon. I have spent <br/>
several months researching the spot which relates to the box, and an <br/>
afternoon walking around the area observing it so see if it would be <br/>
safe. I usually do put quite a bit of thought into the placement of <br/>
my boxes so that it will provide the finders with a positive <br/>
experience.<br/>
<br/>
I think I would refer to the AQ Code of Conduct: "Do not plant <br/>
letterboxes near other people's existing letterboxes without <br/>
permission. Also, do not use someone else's letterbox as a starting <br/>
point in your clue for your own box without permission. This is <br/>
called poaching and while we may not always know if you're breaking <br/>
the other rules, we always learn when you break this one. Not only <br/>
might the original letterbox planter not appreciate your efforts, but <br/>
the added traffic with people getting your letterbox might cause <br/>
unacceptable environmental damage or risk exposing the location of <br/>
the original letterbox. Instead, plant your box on a different trail <br/>
or at least one quarter-mile away from the original letterbox's <br/>
location." <br/>
<br/>
Okay... that's not exactly the same thing, but close! I think we all <br/>
try to respect that rule and also realize it means not to mess with <br/>
other people's boxes, except when we are doing a little first aid or <br/>
have their permission. It's probably a good time to remind people <br/>
that unless a box is in emanate danger, it's never okay to remove a <br/>
box that doesn't belong to you. It's just flies in the face of <br/>
letterboxing tradition.<br/>
<br/>
I have found some "piggyback" boxes in other regions of the country <br/>
and that can be fun. That is when the planter puts clues in one of <br/>
HIS OWN boxes which lead you to another box. You can also do this <br/>
with someone else's box ONLY if you have their permission first.<br/>
<br/>
I'm really not an old grouch, but I think it's important that we not <br/>
stray too far from the code of conduct introduced by the original <br/>
letterboxers so that we don't have chaos.<br/>

spending time<br/>
