                    <html><body><p>Small world MO5...I also LOVE supervising homework...our oldest finished his last day of HS this past Monday (graduates June).  He is our unflappable, very optimistic son...he never for a moment ever believed he needed more than a few minutes to do ANY homework project...it was like reliving my own childhood all over again!!!  Fortunately with the youngest I am little more than a grammar/spell checker.  Nonetheless they inspired me to go back to school too, which ultimately landed me here in Texas. What great hobbies...supervising homework, letterboxing and topping them off with a nice cold dark beer!<br/>
