                    <div class="plaintext-content">That size box would certainly work.  They have several acres of the <br>
old equipment, but none of it is hard to get to, and there are <br>
probably endless places to stash a box of any size.  There is a fee <br>
to go inside the museum, but not if you stay outside.  I wasn't <br>
really kidding about the rattlesnakes, though, so tell her to be <br>
careful.  Of course, that's true just about anywhere outside in the <br>
desert, around mesquite bushes, etc. <br>

<p>That size box would certainly work. They have several acres of the <br/>old equipment, but none of it is hard to get to, and there are <br/>probably endless places to stash a box of any size. There is a fee <br/>to go inside the museum, but not if you stay outside. I wasn't 
<br/>really kidding about the rattlesnakes, though, so tell her to be <br/>careful. Of course, that's true just about anywhere outside in the <br/>desert, around mesquite bushes, etc. <span class="q"><br/><br/>Boots Tex <br/>
