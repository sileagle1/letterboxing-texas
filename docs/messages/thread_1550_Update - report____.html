Some of you (Mr. Silver Eagle) know I am supposed to be researching some<br/>
lost or abandoned letterboxes at Hueco Tanks.<br/>
<br/>
I FINALLY got it set up with the head ranger.  I am to be out there Sunday<br/>
around 10 or 11 am to search for the two boxes.  IF they exist, we will see<br/>
what needs to be done.  As long as they are not in a restricted area, they<br/>
can remain.  Under the park rules someone will need to adopt them and take<br/>
responsibility for their care.  I guess that would be me.  If they are in a<br/>
restricted area, they can be moved or removed.  I guess I will decide what<br/>
to do once I see what we have to work with.<br/>
<br/>
I will make every attempt to keep these boxes alive if possible since they<br/>
are some of the oldest ones in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
I will report on what I learn upon my return.<br/>
<br/>
