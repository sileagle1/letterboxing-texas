<div>Being a sentimental sort of person in a fairly unsentimental sort of way, I always take a moment or two to look back at anniversary times, and to see what has changed and what is better (and hopefully that IS the case), and to look forward to think of what I would like to see change before the next anniversary.

<div>The last of August and the first of September is a happy/sad time of year for me.  SJZ was born on August 21st, and on September 7th (Labor Day that year) of the same year my dad passed away.  He was bigger than life itself - a giant in character and heart.  And she was so tiny and held so much promise of life.  I really tend to rollercoaster emotionally during this time of year because I remember the birth of a child and the death of a parent in one breath.  After several years of self-destructing during this time, I learned to find something good and positive and constructive to do with myself to get through it and even honor it.  Isn't it cool that it was during this difficult period of time that I found letterboxing?  And while SJZ doesn't box as much as she would like it is something she thoroughly enjoys, and it is something my dad would have completely immersed himself in, so in yet another way the ends of the circle meet each other.

<div>My first letterboxing experience was almost 2 years ago this month:  
Oct. 9, 2004, the first afternoon I arrived in CT to visit my sister 
(PuddleSplasher) who was living there at the time, we went out to find a 
letterbox (she'd discovered it earlier that summer and had already 
found all 31 or so letterboxes placed by the CT DEP in state forests) - and 
during the week I was there, I found 5 more in CT, + a hitchhiker + a 
piggyback + another one in Maine, so I rushed home to Texas to start finding 
local letterboxes --  thanks to Kantexan of the Samurai Stampers and Ruby 
Tuesday of the Celtic Lions who had scattered some really good ones around Ft. 
Worth, Arlington, and Dallas.  And now, almost 2 years and about 350 
letterbox finds and almost 30 boxes place later, I'm an addicted 
letterboxer and proud of it! Have looked for and found boxes in Canada, 
Montana, Colorado, Nevada, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, 
Kentucky, Tennessee, and Texas, besides those first ones in New England, and 
hope to find many many more!  -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
