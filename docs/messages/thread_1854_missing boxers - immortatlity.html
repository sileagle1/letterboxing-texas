I currently have a few of my non-U.S. boxes and my<br/>
Hitchhikers listed in AQ since LBNA did not handle<br/>
them a year ago.  I hardly ever log into AQ and<br/>
could possibly go an entire year without doing so.<br/>
However, I keep the status of all my boxes updated<br/>
on LBNA and am still very much in the game, so I don't<br/>
think it would be right to put my boxes on AQ up<br/>
for adoption.<br/>
It's interesting that the main reason for this discussion<br/>
is the problem of updating the status of the box.  This<br/>
is the same topic that has caused such discord on the<br/>
main list over the years.  One solution was to create<br/>
a database of boxes with the status able to be updated<br/>
by everyone.  That way it did not matter if the owner<br/>
participated or not, the people looking for the box<br/>
could put in a status of Not Found or Found.  This caused<br/>
an outcry from many because they did not want their boxes<br/>
having a status updated by anyone else.<br/>
Now we have the ability to log a find by clicking on the<br/>
flag next to a box clue.  One of the choices is to say<br/>
Attempted instead of Found, and I think this is as close<br/>
to a status update as we can get for boxes missing with<br/>
no active owner.<br/>
Even if a box does get adopted by someone else, I would<br/>
hope the original owner is still listed somewhere in the<br/>
clues, along with the original placement date.  I feel<br/>
that person deserves to be recognized for as long as the<br/>
box exists (and possibly beyond).  When I place a box, I<br/>
have the hope that it will remain in place beyond my years<br/>
as a letterboxer, and I am just vain enough to want credit<br/>
for it.  I figure this is my only chance at immortality!<br/>

&gt; Ryan is going to offer boxes up for adoption on AtlasQuest if the<br/>
&gt; owner hasn't logged into AQ for a year.  This won't affect LBNA of<br/>
&gt; course, but it would allow someone to adopt a box and change the<br/>
&gt; status of it on Atlasquest. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This does affect us here, as there is one relatively prolific Texas<br/>
&gt; boxer who will have been MIA for about a year on May 22nd.  At that<br/>
&gt; point, the boxes on AQ will be "adoptable."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure how I feel about it.  It's a good idea to have the <br/>
status<br/>
&gt; updated, but I struggle to keep up with maintenance on my own boxes<br/>
&gt; (everybody, pretty please carry a box-repair kit in their lbing <br/>
bag),<br/>
&gt; so am not sure I'd want to be responsible for someone else's.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; However, I do think that it could be very frustrating for a new <br/>
boxer<br/>
&gt; to find missing box after missing box--that gets old quickly.  So, <br/>
I'd<br/>
&gt; like the status updated!<br/>
