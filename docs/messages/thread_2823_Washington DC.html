from our GS troop took a trip to Washington DC for the 95th anniv. of <br>
GS. (sing along)  We had a blast.  While there we got a fellow TEXAN <br>
involved in letterboxing.  We had her pick one she might want to find <br>
and what does she pick...  The one that turns out to be appox. a 5 mile <br>
hike round trip.  OH MY GOSH was I tired. She didn't relize how far it <br>
would take us. And guess what the box wasn't there.     <br>
  Then on Sat.  while at the sing along we found a lady with a <br>
letterbox at the event.  Then we found someone that You Guys with more <br>
experience might know...Scarab!!!  That's right the one and only!!  I <br>
snatched him right up before he could ride away.<br>
     He was great with us newbies and even gave us a little hint on <br>
what to ask for with his travler.  Then up walks Sam I am of the FD.  <br>
We must have been a sight.  Stamps everwhere, books laid out, and <br>
having a Blast!!!!<br>
There was even a troop leader next to us that said it all sounded so <br>
great she was going to check it all out when she got home.<br>

I have a stamp from the Great Book Adventure that is so great. It's big and detailed. Then, I have a little one that I don't want to log as a find till I find out if it's legit or not.
