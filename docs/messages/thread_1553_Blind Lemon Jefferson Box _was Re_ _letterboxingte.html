<div>I like cemetery boxes, too.  I like discovering old graves, reading 
names and dates and looking at the symbols and epitaphs, even the differences of 
stones and plantings in old cemeteries.  Also, when you have the time to 
really explore, you discover mysteries and questions - why are there so many 
graves with the nearly the same death dates?  Was there an epidemic or a 
fire or some other major catastrophe?  And I love to look for really old 
dates and think about what the area might have looked like then, and wonder if 
someone in some future time will also notice these same old graves and think 
about the lives of the people who were here then.  It's always sad to see 
infants' graves, with the little stone lambs.  Often, there are new graves 
in among old cemetery markers, and that's interesting, too, to realize that it's 
still an active cemetery, even though some of the earliest settlers in the area 
are buried here.  And often there are rabbits, mice, other small animals 
(including, sometimes, snakes) living there, also.  And always, 
birds.  Sometimes they are on tops of hills, and you have long vistas, and 
sometimes they appear abandoned, lost, and you wonder if anyone comes here 
anymore.  I think the inhabitants would welcome a quiet, respectful 
visitor, and if my letterbox brings another interested, curious, respectful 
person to discover the old cemetery, I think that's a good thing.
