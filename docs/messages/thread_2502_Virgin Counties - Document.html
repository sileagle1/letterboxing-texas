                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations on completing your goal in one year and good idea to <br/>
keep a record of ongoing progress.  I actually compiled a list of <br/>
counties without boxes back in December when I first saw the new map <br/>
of TX with individual colored counties.  It is a word document that I <br/>
will upload to Files showing counties by region without boxes as of <br/>
last December (currently not colored on TX map) along with a list of <br/>
counties without boxes that will be removed as we place boxes in <br/>
them.  Sea Dove has already placed a box in Wharton county, so I <br/>
removed it from the updated list.  I know this isn't as nice as a <br/>
map, but it will be easier to update.  So as you place boxes in <br/>
virgin counties, either update the file or let me know and I will do <br/>
it.  I don't expect to populate every county by the end of the year, <br/>
especially the Panhandle Region, but it will be fun to see how far we <br/>
get.  Let the planting begin!<br/>

&gt; Hi!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We encouraged a similar "populate the counties" project in <br/>
Wisconsin <br/>
&gt; last year. I started publicizing the project mid-year. At that time <br/>
&gt; there were boxes in 42 counties and 30 counties without a box. By <br/>
mid-<br/>
&gt; December there was a box in every WI county! (I know Texas is a <br/>
MUCH <br/>
&gt; larger state, so it might take a bit longer!).  We had some help <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; people in neighboring Minnesota who planted boxes in WI counties <br/>
&gt; across the border from them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since the LBNA webmasters are busy with a variety of things, they <br/>
&gt; only update the maps periodically.  I therefore created my own map <br/>
&gt; that actually showed the names of the counties and colored in the <br/>
&gt; ones that had boxes.  It was a somewhat crudely hand-colored map, <br/>
but <br/>
&gt; I could scan it and update it as soon as a new county was <br/>
populated.  <br/>
&gt; I think it kept up some awareness of the project.  If you want to <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; what it looked like before we had the last county populated, you <br/>
can <br/>
&gt; see it here:  http://letterboxing.homestead.com/WIcounties.html<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good luck!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Now would be a good time for us to count how many counties have <br/>
&gt; boxes, and how many we have to go, so we can measure our <br/>
&gt; accomplishments at the end of the year!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   I agree, and already have several boxes made and trips <br/>
planned <br/>
&gt; to seed these boxless counties. I think our short term goal should <br/>
be <br/>
&gt; to color in all counties in regions we live in (e.g. Southeast for <br/>
&gt; me) and long term goal should be to color the entire state. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Maybe we should all resolve this year to pick a county that <br/>
has <br/>
&gt; no letterboxes and plan a special trip to plant some there. Share <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; fun with those who are letterbox-poor.<br/>
