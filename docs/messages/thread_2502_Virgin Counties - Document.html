                    <div class="plaintext-content">Congratulations on completing your goal in one year and good idea to <br>
keep a record of ongoing progress.  I actually compiled a list of <br>
counties without boxes back in December when I first saw the new map <br>
of TX with individual colored counties.  It is a word document that I <br>
will upload to Files showing counties by region without boxes as of <br>
last December (currently not colored on TX map) along with a list of <br>
counties without boxes that will be removed as we place boxes in <br>
them.  Sea Dove has already placed a box in Wharton county, so I <br>
removed it from the updated list.  I know this isn't as nice as a <br>
map, but it will be easier to update.  So as you place boxes in <br>
virgin counties, either update the file or let me know and I will do <br>
it.  I don't expect to populate every county by the end of the year, <br>
especially the Panhandle Region, but it will be fun to see how far we <br>
get.  Let the planting begin!<br>
