<br>
I began letterboxing back in 2006 when we were still living in Florida.  (But don't hold that against me - I'm a native Texan, my husband is the Floridian.)  We needed something inexpensive to do with the kids that would get us out of the house.  We also needed a way to improve the kids writing skills, because they were not doing very well on the writing portion of their standardized testing in school.  I ran across an article in Family Fun magazine about letterboxing, and it seemed like the perfect way to get us out of the house often, on a budget, and get the kids to do some creative writing, to boot. (We immediately made it a rule that you had to write a paragraph about the stamp when we found it - whether it was how much you hated me for making you write, how fun the trip through the park was, or how dumb the whole thing was. LOL  If you found it, you must journal it!)<br>
<br>
Since that summer, we have letterboxed off and on.  I graduated college (finally) with an AS degree in Radiologic Technology; we moved back to TX; my husband went back to school for his Journeyman Electrician's license; we migrated out to the country south of Austin...  We sort of fell off letterboxing for a while during all of that, but in the last year and a half or so, we've gotten more active again.  We began to play with carving, and creating our own boxes.  We've planted a couple, and have a couple more to plant once I get the logbooks finished.  I've slowly become better at utilizing Atlas Quest, and trying to get out and find other letterboxers. We only have 2 kids left at home, and one of them is about to graduate, so the husband and I need to find new letterboxing pals! LOL<br>
<br>
Aside from letterboxing, we are avid Scouters.  We like camping, backpacking, shooting, archery and preparedness activities.  We are all readers (and now some of us write better, too. *Thanks, mom!* LOL)  I am an artsy-fartsy type person, too.  I quilt, scrapbook, sew, do leatherwork, paint, make jewelry - you name it, and I probably do it.  Or at least, try to. LOL  I am currently working out at Seton Smithville Regional Hospital as a CT Tech, doing the 7pm-7am shift, so my posts will most likely be in the middle of the night. ;-)  We've already RSVP'ed to TALE, and are really looking forward to meeting so many of you with so much more experience in this fun hobby we've come to love!<br>

 are coming to TALE.  This is a helpful and friendly group online, but it<br>
 makes such a difference when you meet everyone in person.  <br>
