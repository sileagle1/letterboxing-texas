                    <div class="plaintext-content">I must admit I don't look on AQ that much, so when I saw this post I figured I better see what I might be volunteering for.  From what I can tell, he wants someone from each Region as defined by AQ, which does not include TX as its own Region.  It looks like someone would have to represent the entire Southwest Region, so not sure I would be best for that.  He does say that At Large Regional Voices can volunteer for other countries, and since TX was once a country I guess I could volunteer for that position and let someone else do the Southwest Region.  What do you think?<br>
<br>
I appreciate your kindly support of me for this position, and I would be honored to do it if none of you GOOD writers wants to :)<br>
