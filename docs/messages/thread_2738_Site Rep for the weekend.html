                    <div class="plaintext-content">Up bright and early Saturday morning; JBK picked up WagTime at 7am <br>
to hit the road. First we headed over to Nichols Green II so Wag <br>
could get JBK's March series (she's a little behind in ETX) and <br>
her "The Magnolia & The Cowboy" set. We didn't think about the red <br>
dirt paths being covered with dew, and little JR's paws and legs <br>
were covered with red dirt glued on by the dew. We were filthy by <br>
the time we got back in the car, even though JR got wiped down a <br>
bit. <br>
<br>
The next stop was Nichols Green I to get BFLucy's Girl Scout series <br>
and Silver Eagle's "Barefoot Den Mother". We verified that <br>
TexasLuvBug's "Life is a Picnic" is definitely not there. As he <br>
always manages to do, JR got away from us on the trail, and although <br>
we were afraid of not being able to catch him, had to laugh when he <br>
picked up the handle of his own leash as if taking himself on a <br>
walk. After that we headed over to the Homestead Hitchhiker Hotel <br>
where WagTime got to do some stamping and JBK traded a new stamp for <br>
a HH she liked. <br>
<br>
Next on the list was the footbridge in Rusk so WagTime could get <br>
BFLucy's "Friends are Friends Forever" stamp. The stamp was <br>
beautiful and WagTime is thankful to Lucy for such a thoughtful <br>
gesture. We found "Railway to Heaven" (fabulous stamp!) at the <br>
Texas State Railroad Park, then went to Maydelle. Both JBK and <br>
WagTime had missed opportunities to visit the winery and pick up the <br>
box there, and both were anxious to try some East TX wines. We <br>
sampled everything and got a bit of a buzz at 10:00 in the <br>
morning! The LB had been misplaced, but the owner was sure it was <br>
still there and promised to find it for us. We bought a case of <br>
wine between us and headed on out. If you go, be sure to try the <br>
lemon wine and visit the guard-cats, May and Dell.<br>
<br>
We went by JBK's house for a fluid adjustment break and to figure <br>
out where to go next. We visited the Killough Monument, but Lucy's <br>
box couldn't be found. A road had been cut outside the barbed wire <br>
fence and we found the remnants of a destroyed L&L box; we searched <br>
around, but found no paper, baggies, etc. Lucy, we're sure sorry!<br>
<br>
Disappointed but with more stops to make, we headed for Tyler. <br>
After a quick drive-through lunch, we went out to Lindale. WagTime <br>
planted a new box just inside Smith County in honor of her adopted <br>
grandfather who passed away last year, and then we drove around <br>
Mineola until we found a spot for WagTime's other memorial box. <br>
Wood County has lost its virginity and has its first box. We tried <br>
to find the Mineola Nature Preserve, but after we turned off the <br>
highway at the big brown sign, there was a sudden shortage of signs <br>
and we never could find the place. <br>
<br>
We then headed north to Emory to find a home for a new box JBK had <br>
put together; another county (Rains) has been de-flowered. We <br>
backtracked down to Alba and cut across Quitman to get to Hawkins, <br>
the pancake capital of Texas, where we planted another of JBK's <br>
boxes; Wood County now has 2 boxes! We toured Jarvis Christian <br>
College in while in town, and then happened across a bunch of kids <br>
with a lemonade stand out in front of their house. In the back of <br>
the house was a terrific tree house with a full staircase (not just <br>
a ladder) going up to it. We were pretty jealous! The next stop <br>
was Big Sandy in Upshur County to plant another box, but we couldn't <br>
find a suitable spot so we drove toward Gladewater until we reached <br>
our goal. We drove back through Big Sandy to Winona so WagTime <br>
could get JKC's "Starville Stagecoach", then headed back to Tyler <br>
around 6:30m, hoping that daylight would last long enough for us to <br>
make a few more spots.<br>
<br>
We found the Children's Park in Tyler and both got the stamp there <br>
after wandering around enjoying all the memorials to the children; <br>
if you haven't visited this park, please take the time to do so. <br>
Next we hit Bergfield Park for Atoy Adventure's "Meow" and JR made a <br>
new friend. Finally, really chasing the sun, we went home by way of <br>
Troup to pick up Blue Butterfly's "Go Tigers". We got back to the <br>
house around 8:15, exhausted, but having accomplished a lot.<br>
<br>
We started again on Sunday around 9:00, having decided to stay in <br>
Jacksonville since we didn't have a lot of time. First we went to <br>
Lake Jacksonville for TexasLuvBug's "Big Bass Bonanza" and found it <br>
just where it was supposed to be. Cary Lake was next on the list <br>
for JBK's "Treasure at Cary Lake". Then we came back into town and <br>
went to Buckner Park; we were batting a thousand now, verifying that <br>
TexasLuvBug's "Sunflower Summer" and "Dragonfly Springs" are no <br>
longer there, and also failed to find "Lightning's 11th Birthday <br>
Box" although JBK felt sure we were in the right spot. We had <br>
better luck finding Lucy's "Spring Hope", and then drove down the <br>
farm roads to get JBK's "The Rose and the Tomato Farmer" set. While <br>
in Afton Grove, we almost gave up but did find Lucy's "Flying <br>
Again". That email talk about ants jinxed us; the box was pretty <br>
much buried down in a hole and lots of ants were keeping it <br>
company. JBK took it personallythat and the briar scratches she <br>
got while she was digging.<br>
<br>
Running out of time, we made quick work of another cemetery so <br>
WagTime could get JBK's April series, then went over to Jarrett <br>
Cemetery to get "Vogue" and find a spot for a new stamp WagTime had <br>
planned in tribute for a second cousin who is buried there. We <br>
pushed our curfew and WagTime was a little late getting back to pack <br>
and head back to Dallas, but we had a blast and enjoyed the weekend <br>
and the beautiful weather.<br>
<br>
All in all, WagTime planted 3 boxes and found 40, and JBK planted 3 <br>
plus 3 HHs and found 5. Not bad for a weekend's work!<br>
