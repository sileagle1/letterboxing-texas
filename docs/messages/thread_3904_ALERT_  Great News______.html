James woke us at midnight.<br>
<br>
He was calling from Kuwait.  He is on the way back to Ft. Hood.  This ends his<br>
last combat tour as a Scout/Sniper/Paramedic in K-Troop, 3d Squadron, 3d Armored<br>
Cavalry Regiment.  The Brave Rifles.  4 years of combat - he did his time.<br>
<br>
James will be at Ft. Hood until he finishes this enlistment.  The plan is for<br>
him to get out of the Army somewhere from July to August.  He will be taking a<br>
job as an apprentice electrician in El Paso, and going to school at night.<br>
Someone made him an offer he couldn't refuse.  They wanted his leadership<br>
skills, they said they would teach him the electrical skills.  A great<br>
opportunity.<br>
<br>
Armadillo/Cactus folks may hear KC0WKY on the system calling us in El Paso when<br>
he arrives.  Please welcome this fine young trooper home.<br>
