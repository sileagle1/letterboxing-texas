<div><em>Wow!  I just went to update my Kemah Stingray microbox (it's 
definitely missing) on the webpage and decided to look and see if there are any 
new boxes in my area.</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>There are 11 new ones!!!  Wow, you guys have been busy.  My 
kids and I started boxing last spring, and believe it or not, they lost interest 
and refused to drive long distances to find any more boxes.  So this is 
great, I can get them to go boxing, and we don't have to drive far!  
Yippee!</em></div>
<div><em></em> </div>
<div><em>Also, there are so many boxes listed as being in Houston, but which 
ones are on the SE side of town (Pasadena, Webster, Clear Lake areas -- not 
counting the boxes clearly listed as in those areas)?  I hate to go in and 
look at every single clue.  LOL.  I've lived here less than 2 
years and am not familiar enough with downtown to know where most of them 
are.  </em></div>

There are two in Tom Bass Park near Beltway 8 and 288:  Husky and <br/>
Tribute to England #6 (currently listed as missing).  Sea Wolf is in <br/>
Clear Lake.<br/>
<br/>
The others, I think, are listed with cities such as Pasadena, Deer <br/>
Park, Webster, La Porte, La Marque, etc.  Someone may correct me on <br/>
this, though, as those aren't our normal stomping grounds.  <br/>
<br/>
FYI, My kids particularly enjoyed the boxes at Challenger 7 park.  <br/>
Good stamps, pretty trails, and a fun playground after we were <br/>
finished.  We had a great day there.<br/>
<br/>
Hoping for better weather--<br/>
