                    <html><body><p><span>We made a quick trip to Hamilton to visit with my sister Saturday and took the opportunity to do some maintenance on our boxes in Waco, which was right on our way.  We replaced Lone Star Quilter's box, "My Special Angel" in Holy Cross Cemetery and my box "The Lawman - Texas Governor Series" in Oakwood.  We also replaced the boxes and logbooks in my other two Governor boxes in that cemetery.  The Lawman box had been accidentally found about 6 months ago (I don't remember who found it).  It had been lying out in the open and they didn't know where it should be, so placed it in a hole in a tree, but didn't record any directions, so the original box may still be there in that hole, but I looked around the area and didn't find it.  Thanks to Texas Wench and Crabby 'Ol Man (no, that's not me!) for reporting that the logbooks were wet and providing new ones and a new box for one of them.  All three should be fine now for a while.  One of those boxes was "Parks for Texas", placed for Governor Pat Neff.  Since Mother Neff State Park was not far away, we decided to visit it on the way back home Sunday morning.  As you may recall, that park was closed for a long time because of flood damage and we hadn't been back since it reopened.  We didn't look for any of the old boxes, but I think they are probably all gone.  There is a new entrance to the park at the north end, on high land.  The headquarters building is beautiful, the best I've ever seen in a state park.  There is also a new RV camping loop at that end of the park, with 20 very nice camping sites.  They all have new wide concrete, level,  sites.  The ranger said all of the trails are open and in good shape, although we didn't walk on any of them because of the weather.  There is one problem, and that's at the south end, where the old headquarters building is located.  That is low land on the banks of the Leon River, and a huge log jam at the highway crossing near the park has caused that whole area to flood.  We drove by and the jam is still there, although the flood water has receded.  The ranger said they didn't know what they were going to do about it.  The big open CCC pavilion is still there and apparently was not harmed in any way by the flood, but the ground around it is still in bad shape, still wet and muddy.  However, the rest of the park, the rock tower, the cave and the trails seem to be okay, so this would be a good place to visit and place letterboxes.</span></p><p><span><br/></span></p><p><span>Boots Tex</span></p></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>I wouldn't rule it out.  The pavilion is quite large and rent is $80.00.  You never know when you book a facility what the conditions will be in the next year.  Any park located on a river is subject to flooding I assume.  We're thinking about trailer camping at Mother Neff for a few days this spring, so we'll check it out again at that time.</p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>
