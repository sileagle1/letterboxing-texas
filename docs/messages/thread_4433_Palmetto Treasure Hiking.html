<div>On Monday, I asked at the Palmetto State Park office if 
they knew how long the new trails were.  I was told that someone was coming 
out to measure this week, and then signs would go up.  They believe that 
they have about 5 miles of trails total, and the the long back trail that skirts 
the perimeter is about 3 miles long.  In that case, I think I can 
safely say that I walked at least 3 miles on Saturday, trying to find every box 
in one day, and can safely apply 3 miles to my Texas Treasure Hiking 
count.  Does that sound right to everyone else?  -- Bell Motel
