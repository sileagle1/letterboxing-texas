<br>
It is a stamp you carry, different from your signature stamp, that you<br>
offer to people when you run into them--on the trail or at a<br>
gathering.  It started from the fact that people didn't want to give<br>
away their "signature" stamp, so they devised another one for<br>
exchanges.  Now, most  people do use their signature stamp for<br>
exchanges, so the personal travelers are an extra--kind of fun--little<br>
bit of nonsense.<br>
<br>
To get them, you often need to solve a riddle, give a bit of<br>
information or perform a little trick.  Sometimes you can just ask for<br>
them.  Clues to how to get a personal traveler are located on LBNA<br>
(often as mystery boxes), in the archives of this list and Atlas<br>
Quest--if you go to the TX gathering page for instance on AQ you will<br>
see a list of those people who have RSVP'd for the gathering who have<br>
listed their personal travelers on AQ.  Then, just click on clue. <br>
There are others on LBNA, so you may need to search for them as well.<br>
<br>
My boys each have their own personal travelers--to get Gpillar's you<br>
have to tell a knock-knock joke.  To get Batrick's you have to tell<br>
what 0-0 is in chess notation.  They will probably both get new<br>
travelers for the Texas gathering, depending on their interests this<br>
year--and I'll post those to this list.  I just listed a new traveler<br>
for myself and listed it on AQ.  It's my best carving yet, and I made<br>
it a PT because I couldn't bear to part with it.<br>
<br>
Some people get humongously sneaky about their travelers, carrying<br>
them in a special pocket so they can slip them surreptiously to the<br>
person with the correct answer.  They are very emphatic about no<br>
hints, and that you have to quietly whisper them the correct answer.  <br>
<br>
We will also be introducing more cooties at this year's gathering, as<br>
that is something fun for the kids.  Adults, please act unsuspecting<br>
as the children try to sneak cooties onto your person!  Here's the<br>
definition of cooties from AQ:<br>
<br>
cooties <br>
A relatively new type of letterbox where one tries to sneak around<br>
hiding the box on another personperhaps in an open backpack or jacket<br>
pocket. Once you 'catch a cootie', you stamp in and try to pawn it off<br>
onto another unsuspecting letterboxer. Cooties are often signed into<br>
with the stamp of your thumb or fingers that you draw on to embellish<br>
instead of the traditional signature stamp, though many people use<br>
signature stamps as well. <br>
<br>
<br>
And finally, the Texas Tour Bus is a cool Letterbox that TeamKing<br>
started.  Think of it as a bus traveling through Texas, picking up<br>
passengers as it goes.  Clues for it are to be published only on this<br>
list.  If you collect it, you have to carve a stamp to put inside it<br>
and then rehide it, offering the clues on this list.  I didn't get it<br>
when it was down here at the beginning, and now I can't wait for it to<br>
make its way back to SE texas.<br>
