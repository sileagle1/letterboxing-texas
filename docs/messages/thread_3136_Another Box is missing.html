I don't know how you could get them to clarify exactly where they put <br/>

searching the area and see if you can find the original.  Good luck!<br/>

That is what I thought but I searched and searched and could not find <br/>
it. I had on Thursday replaced the box with a lock and lock box. It <br/>
seems like when I use a L&amp;L that is the box that completely disapears. <br/>
I shall not ever use L&amp;L again. I had gotten these boxes for a <br/>
reasonable price but I have paid 4 dollars for some. Cheap glad boxes <br/>
for me from now own. LOL<br/>

found it while playing, someone else found it too.  It's sometimes<br/>
hard to tell how much use an area of a park gets.  Boxes hidden in<br/>
good climbing trees or places where kids play hide and seek could<br/>
easily be discovered.  <br/>
<br/>
Sometimes, what seems like a cool hiding place is actually in the<br/>
middle of a lot of traffic.<br/>

I did that and no reply however it was my mistake. So not to worry. The <br/>
box is back. My LSS is the one who went to check on the box this <br/>
morning. He had to take the grandson to work at 6:30. He had not had <br/>
his coffee or breakfast. When he got home, he reported that the box was <br/>
no where. That he walked the whole area looking everywhere for the box <br/>
and no box. I took him at his word. Then you all started giving me some <br/>
ideas and I got to thinking. hummmm maybe I had better go look. I went <br/>
to pick up said grandson after work and he and I went to look for box. <br/>
We found it. Some of the pieces were missing but all in all it was in <br/>
good shap just not in its location. It was about 50 or 75 feet from the <br/>
hiding spot and fully out in the open. It was under a tree. You know <br/>
kids. They really don't remember where they found this lovely box so <br/>
they just put it somewhere. After all it is hide and seek. So lets hide <br/>
it somewhere else and see if they can find it. tee hee. I have now <br/>
replaced it where it was but on the north side of the oak tree as the <br/>
fire ants wanted the south side. I don't blame the child for not <br/>
putting it back in that ant bed. I hope he did not get too many bites <br/>
getting it out.<br/>

<div>There are so many different ways for a false missing to happen, right down to caffeine deprivation and innocent children playing their game the way they think it should be played.  Combine the two and the results could be interesting!

&gt; &gt; I did that and no reply however it was my mistake. So not to <br/>

&gt; &gt; morning. He had to take the grandson to work at 6:30. He had not <br/>
had<br/>
&gt; &gt; his coffee or breakfast. When he got home, he reported that the <br/>
box was<br/>
&gt; &gt; no where. That he walked the whole area looking everywhere for <br/>
the box<br/>
&gt; &gt; and no box. I took him at his word. Then you all started giving <br/>
me some<br/>

went<br/>
&gt; &gt; to pick up said grandson after work and he and I went to look for <br/>
box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We found it. Some of the pieces were missing but all in all it <br/>
was in<br/>
&gt; &gt; good shap just not in its location. It was about 50 or 75 feet <br/>
from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding spot and fully out in the open. It was under a tree. You <br/>
know<br/>
&gt; &gt; kids. They really don't remember where they found this lovely box <br/>
so<br/>
&gt; &gt; they just put it somewhere. After all it is hide and seek. So <br/>
lets hide<br/>
&gt; &gt; it somewhere else and see if they can find it. tee hee. I have now<br/>
&gt; &gt; replaced it where it was but on the north side of the oak tree as <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; fire ants wanted the south side. I don't blame the child for not<br/>
&gt; &gt; putting it back in that ant bed. I hope he did not get too many <br/>
bites<br/>
&gt; &gt; getting it out.<br/>

<div>You just might want to consider rehiding your box in a different location now that it's safe again. The kids who originally found it know where it was hidden the first time, and may look for it again next time they are in that park. The next time you might not be lucky enough to know it's been left out in the open in time to rescue it. Just a thought.</div>

I posted that it was missing and will not be replaced. I found the lid <br/>
about 1/4 mile down stream but never found the box. I am sure it sank. <br/>
I may place another Boxing is a Circus #2 someday. Just keep checking. <br/>
