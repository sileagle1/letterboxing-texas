I don't know how you could get them to clarify exactly where they put <br>

searching the area and see if you can find the original.  Good luck!<br>

That is what I thought but I searched and searched and could not find <br>
it. I had on Thursday replaced the box with a lock and lock box. It <br>
seems like when I use a L&L that is the box that completely disapears. <br>
I shall not ever use L&L again. I had gotten these boxes for a <br>
reasonable price but I have paid 4 dollars for some. Cheap glad boxes <br>
for me from now own. LOL<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another possibility is that if it's in an area where one group of kids<br>
found it while playing, someone else found it too.  It's sometimes<br>
hard to tell how much use an area of a park gets.  Boxes hidden in<br>
good climbing trees or places where kids play hide and seek could<br>
easily be discovered.  <br>
<br>
Sometimes, what seems like a cool hiding place is actually in the<br>
middle of a lot of traffic.<br>

I did that and no reply however it was my mistake. So not to worry. The <br>
box is back. My LSS is the one who went to check on the box this <br>
morning. He had to take the grandson to work at 6:30. He had not had <br>
his coffee or breakfast. When he got home, he reported that the box was <br>
no where. That he walked the whole area looking everywhere for the box <br>
and no box. I took him at his word. Then you all started giving me some <br>
ideas and I got to thinking. hummmm maybe I had better go look. I went <br>
to pick up said grandson after work and he and I went to look for box. <br>
We found it. Some of the pieces were missing but all in all it was in <br>
good shap just not in its location. It was about 50 or 75 feet from the <br>
hiding spot and fully out in the open. It was under a tree. You know <br>
kids. They really don't remember where they found this lovely box so <br>
they just put it somewhere. After all it is hide and seek. So lets hide <br>
it somewhere else and see if they can find it. tee hee. I have now <br>
replaced it where it was but on the north side of the oak tree as the <br>
fire ants wanted the south side. I don't blame the child for not <br>
putting it back in that ant bed. I hope he did not get too many bites <br>
getting it out.<br>

</p><div><span class="e" id="q_115c663514a1cc5f_2">&gt; I got an email yesterday from a homeschooler mom. She had went on <br/>&gt; <a href="http://Letterboxing.org">Letterboxing.org</a> and sent it in reguards to my letterbox in Mabank 
<br/>&gt; called The Blue Daisy. She said that she and some other <br/>homeschooler <br/>&gt; Moms were at the park and one of the kids found my box. She told <br/>me how <br/>&gt; interesting it was and then said that she told (told) the child to 
<br/>go <br/>&gt; put it back. I checked on it today and it is no where in the area. <br/>The <br/>&gt; child must have decided to take it home. I guess it was just too <br/>cute <br/>&gt; to resist the temptation. So until I replace it, don't look for 
<br/>it. I <br/>&gt; will email the mom back and tell her the box is missing. I hope <br/>she is <br/>&gt; cooperative. Here is a copy of her email to me.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Message: <br/>&gt; hi we are the lake area christian homeshoolers in Mabak tx. Our 
<br/>kids<br/>&gt; were playing in the park and found your box. The Blue Daisy.... <br/>We <br/>&gt; all<br/>&gt; didn't know what it was, until one of our mothers said it was a<br/>&gt; letterbox. The kids didn't know what to do with ti, so we had 
<br/>them <br/>&gt; just put<br/>&gt; it back where they found it. I think this is the neatest idea!!!!<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></span></div>

I posted that it was missing and will not be replaced. I found the lid <br>
about 1/4 mile down stream but never found the box. I am sure it sank. <br>
I may place another Boxing is a Circus #2 someday. Just keep checking. <br>
The blue daisy is back in place. Adams Trails<br>
