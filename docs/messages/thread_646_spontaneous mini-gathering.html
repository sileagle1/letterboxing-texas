Well, at the moment, the plan is for him to be at the gathering on <br>
crutches.  When we're all out on the trail, he can guard the chili <br>
from hungry alligators and bears (no accusations). . . He'll be <br>
certainly easy to identify.  <br>
<br>
There's a reason soccer is extremely popular with our nation's <br>
YOUTH.  Grown men and women were dropping in Asterix' Y league <br>
season like flies (it sounded like a good idea in theory).  Anyway, <br>
the surgery's all routine now, but you still gotta go through the <br>
recovery process.  I am bummed because we'll miss much of that all-<br>
too-short period when the Gulf Coast weather is nice.<br>
