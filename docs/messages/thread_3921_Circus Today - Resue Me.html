&gt; We saw Carson and Barnes once, it was great because we got to go the <br/>
day before the show and watch the elephants put up the tents.  It was <br/>
here about 4 years ago, and as far as I can tell it hasn't been back to <br/>
Houston since.  Too bad, it was a great show.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The best circus I ever saw was in Ireland, a little tiny show that <br/>
had about 10 people total.  The best part was that when the performers <br/>
weren't doing their acts they could be found in the concession stand <br/>
selling popcorn.<br/>

&gt; Now I am really in the mood for a circus!  MO5<br/>
