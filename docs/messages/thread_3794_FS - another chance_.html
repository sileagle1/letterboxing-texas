Over a year ago I started cleaning out my hiking equipment.  I had several<br/>
Camelbak backpack combinations too many.  I thinned it down to just three.<br/>
<br/>
Warm Front and Cold Front bought both of the packs I was selling.  Cold Front<br/>
got the one that was a CamelBak water bladder only.  This one was my "High-Speed<br/>
Low-Drag" unit.  But it didn't have room for my letterboxing gear.  In fact - it<br/>
only carried water - no room for anything else.  So I bought another pack.  A<br/>
"waist-pack" called the Maxpedition Thermite.<br/>
<br/>
Yeah - now that I look at it, what was I thinking?<br/>
<br/>
Digging through the gear this morning getting ready for a hike I ran across that<br/>
"other pack"  again.  I realize I am never going to use it again.  Seems a shame<br/>
to let it sit at the bottom of the box.  So I am offering it to you-all, my<br/>
friends on the list.  This is it.<br/>

<br/>
It can be worn around the waist, or over the shoulder.  The second strap is<br/>
included.  This one is in a color that is no longer made, the 3-color desert<br/>
camouflage.  It is a nice light color, doesn't get hot in the sun like darker<br/>
colors do.<br/>
<br/>
Used very little - in perfect shape.  How about $25 + shipping.  Photo on<br/>
request.<br/>
<br/>
Y-all enjoy your evening.  I have another hike planned for the morning.  Later.<br/>
