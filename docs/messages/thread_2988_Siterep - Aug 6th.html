                    <div class="plaintext-content">My navigator, JR and I headed home around 7:30 am down Hwy 175 from <br>
Dallas.  Our first stop was Seagoville to pick up the GWP Series: Oh <br>
Give Me a Home box in C.O. Bruce Central Park.  The box was<br>
safe and sound.  As we were leaving the park, we saw a mommy duck <br>
going to the pond with about 10 baby ducks all in a line.  Our next <br>
stop was the Veteran's Memorial in Kaufman where we picked up the<br>
Celebrate Our Military Day box.  We then went to Athens to pick up <br>
some of the new boxes there.   The first stop was Athens City <br>
Cemetery where we picked up the United We Stand box and the We <br>
Remember box which had a HH in it.  Next was the Kiwanis Park where <br>
we found the Dont Rocket til Youve Tried It box at a really neat <br>
arbor.  The playground at the park has a big rocket that the kids <br>
can climb in which reminded me of a park in Jacksonville that used <br>
to have a rocket that I played in when I was a kid.  Our next stop <br>
was Central Park in Athens to find the TVCC Cardinal park which we <br>
found with no problem. We then went to the TVCC campus to find The <br>
Cardette box which has a neat history.  We then went to the<br>
Cain Center and picked up the Texas Longhorn box.  We then went back <br>
downtown in Athens to Ginger's Park and found The Old Fiddler box.  <br>
This is a neat pocket park and a really neat stamp.  We then went to<br>
the Railroad Park and picked up Black Eyed Uncle Fletcher.  I really <br>
liked this double stamp and the park was very cute.  The next stop <br>
today was at the Oaklawn Cemetery in Athens to find the Just Call <br>
Him Jess box in tribute to "The Law East of the Trinity."  This had <br>
a neat history to it and was a nice stamp.   I then stopped at Mt <br>
Olive Cemetery in Frankston and placed a new box for Wag Time.  Then <br>
headed home after 6 days of marathon letterboxing...at the end of <br>
the day I had found 70 boxes and 3 hitchhikers.  Not a bad week!!! <br>
