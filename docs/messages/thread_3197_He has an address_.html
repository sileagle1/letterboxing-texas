James just called.<br/>
<br/>
He said they had a good Thanksgiving, considering where he was.  Mosul.  We<br/>
talked about a 1/2 hour total.  He said there was a bit of sadness that they<br/>
were not "HOME" with their families.  But he said "I was with my other<br/>
family, so its all right".<br/>
<br/>
He said that the "Wild West" days of Iraq are over.  Oh - there is still<br/>
plenty of danger.  But the Iraqis have pretty much taken over the fight.<br/>
You hear a battle off in the distance.  Then the word comes down, this or<br/>
that Iraqi unit has just kicked ass on this or that terrorist camp.  Not<br/>
like it used to be.<br/>
<br/>
Gee - wonder why you don't get this on the alphabet soup news channels!<br/>
Think they might have an agenda?<br/>
<br/>
His best friend Kris was at Mosul last deployment.  He was the young man who<br/>
earned the Silver Star at Tal Afar.  And is still in rehab because of it.<br/>
<br/>
Anyone wanting to send James any cards or mail, his address is:<br/>
<br/>
SPC James H. Olbrisch.<br/>
K-Trp 3d Sqn, 3d ACR<br/>
FOB Marez<br/>
APO AE 09334<br/>
<br/>
OR - - - change James' name to - To Any Soldier - and it will get to some<br/>
deserving trooper in his unit.  Ahhh - Cavalry.  If you ain't CAV, you ain't<br/>
SHIT!  There is a reply to that - it usually invokes an ass kicking from the<br/>
CAV guys.  But that's a story for another time.  <grin>  I still miss it!<br/>
<br/>
I told him the old saw - STAY ALERT - STAY ALIVE - - TACTICAL TACTICAL<br/>
TACTICAL.  He said he was where he belongs, doing what he is supposed to be<br/>
doing.  Ya gotta love it.  He does.<br/>
<br/>
Oh - Re-Up asked him what it would take to get him to re-enlist.  He said<br/>
"You asking for a list"?  Yes was the answer.<br/>
<br/>
I want a promotion.  We can work on that.<br/>
I want to go to Ft. Carson.  Everybody wants that, we can try.<br/>
I want a $50k bonus.  We can do that.<br/>
I want a Unicorn.  A Unicorn?<br/>
Yes - a Unicorn.  Guess it ain't gunna happen, is it?<br/>
<br/>
Yup - ya gotta love him!<br/>
<br/>
Y-all have a great day after thanksgiving.<br/>

I detect a little sadness on your part too. I'm sure you miss having <br/>
your son home for Thanksgiving as much as he misses being there.  <br/>
Thanks for the sacrifice you are both making for our country.  And <br/>
thanks for providing his address.  I look forward to sending him a <br/>
little Christmas cheer from the home front.<br/>

friends - he is the only on that can stay with me on a good hike.  We did 
have a great time last fall grabbing some letterboxes around San Antonio.  
And I enjoyed finding B-L's box for James in Killeen.  Even the in-laws 
from Germany were impressed.  And who can forget the search for Hueco Tanks 
#2.  &lt;grin&gt;</span></div>

doesn't snow, perhaps I can get the Hueco Tanks #1 letterbox replaced on Sunday, 
and get the Hudspeth County letterbox out there too, they will be within a few 
miles of each other.</span></div>

She thinks it will be to hard for her, rofl. She read the part about dropping the gear and crawling through crevices. Then she read how you forgot the trash bag and had to hike back for it. To hear her tell it so funny. She says, "I would have just left that bag there." I, of course, told her how that would defeat the purpose of picking the trash up in the first place. She says, "You mean it wasn't even their own trash? They picked up the trash from other people, then forgot it. I bet they were so mad. . ." It was funny. She calls it the Army Man hike.<br/><br/>I did explain that your hike and the hike to the cave paintings was two completely different hikes. I told her that you explained that I could hike it without training. Plus, I promised to take her to the restaurant in the ELP airport and we'd eat and drink $10 margaritas (after the
 hike).<br/><br/>I just may have her convinced to go in the Spring.<br/><br/>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Mike Olbrisch &lt;mike-2007@elp.rr.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> </div><div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="059143423-23112007">Than you.  Yes - I do miss him.  Of all my  friends - he is the only on that can stay with me on a good hike.  We did  have a great time last fall grabbing some letterboxes around San Antonio.   And I enjoyed finding B-L's box for James in Killeen.  Even the in-laws  from Germany were

 Zane Gray.  Mysteries.  Anything but war    novels.  We sometimes shop the $5 DVD isle in Wal-Mart.  Seems DVDs    are great, but they never last - the sand eats them up after a while.  It    gets into everything.  I shop the thrift stores for books and DVDs    too.  And - I always toss in a few AA and AAA batteries, the guys have    MP3 players and such.</span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="845375723-24112007"></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="845375723-24112007">I will be stocking the unit library with books I know    they need.  I already got them the 4-volume set of sniper training from    MSG Owens.  And of course On Killing and On Combat by David    Grossman.  Tactical Shotgun and Tactical Pistol by Gabe Suarez.  But    they need stuff to take their minds away
 from it too.  And when they    leave for home they usually leave all the books behind for the next    crew.</span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="845375723-24112007"></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="845375723-24112007"> </span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"> </div></div><!-- ygrp-msg --><!-- Sponsor --> <div>.</div><img height="1" src="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=11523462/grpspId=1705016061/msgId=11885/stime=1195949744/nc1=5028924/nc2=5008827/nc3=4990213" width="1"/> <br/><span></span> <!--End group email --></blockquote> <div></div> </div> <!--End group email --> </blockquote><br/><p>
