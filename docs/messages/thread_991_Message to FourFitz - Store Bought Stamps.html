                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been catching up on email again.  I read the big list only <br/>
sporadically although I stay up with this list diligently for the <br/>
most part.<br/>
<br/>
I saw your message about being scared off from planting a store-<br/>
bought stamp and being disillusioned by the discussion on that <br/>
list.  Let me offer you two points of encouragement:<br/>
<br/>
I think I can speak for everyone here, but we in Texas encourage you <br/>
to plant what you feel comfortable planting.  We don't have an <br/>
elitist attitude - we are grateful for every box that gets planted!  <br/>
Also, I believe (and I think most of us on this list do also) that <br/>
as you do more letterboxing, you will find yourself wanting to take <br/>
the next step - once you've found a few, you will find you want to <br/>
share a locale with everyone else by planting.  But maybe you find <br/>
carving to be intimidating.  So plant store-bought and post your <br/>
clues to invite us all out to find somewhere that you want us to <br/>
discover - but just plant!  So you plant a few store-bought stamps <br/>
and you find that you just can't quite find another store-bought <br/>
stamp that says what you want it to say and you decide to try to <br/>
carve one.  So you carve a pink pearl eraser with a pocketknife, and <br/>
it doesn't turn out like you want it to - plant it anyway!  You then <br/>
decide to buy a few tools and a block of real carving material, but <br/>
you find you are still clumsy with the tools - it's okay, keeping <br/>
working at it and you will get it.  BUT, keep finding and keep <br/>
planting!  You will find that as you grow in the hobby, you will <br/>
look back at your early efforts and sometimes laugh and sometimes <br/>
maybe cringe a little, but you will see how much you've developed in <br/>
carving and clue-writing and seeking and everything else that goes <br/>
with letterboxing.  We are all on this grand adventure together and <br/>
we delight in sharing the journey, so don't be scared away from <br/>
doing what feels natural for you to do next - and if it means you <br/>
want to plant a store-bought stamp, do it!  You ARE among friends <br/>
and those in your area will go out and find your store-bought with <br/>
fervor.<br/>
<br/>
As to the big list, all of us get discouraged when it gets <br/>
rancorous.  In fact, I've noticed that at times when that list gets <br/>
ugly, this list picks up in traffic.  Sometimes I think we are <br/>
trying to hum over someone else's argument.  In addition to <br/>
belonging to this list, let me suggest that you also belong to <br/>
groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers, if you don't already.  That's a <br/>
really good and encouraging list for newbies.  The big list serves <br/>
its purpose, but admittedly it is difficult to wade through the crud <br/>
sometimes.<br/>
<br/>
Hang in there and stick with us!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I want to add that my question (and my comments) seemed to be very<br/>
misunderstood, which is why I've stopped commenting on the big list. <br/>
I must be phrasing things very badly.<br/>
<br/>
A few minutes ago, I counted the stamps in my own personal logbook,<br/>
and--if I don't count the exchanged stamps that resulted from a<br/>
(large) class that I taught in letterbox stamp carving--the stamps are<br/>
equally handcarved and store bought.<br/>
<br/>
That's probably a good representation of the balance in actual<br/>
letterboxing: 50/50.<br/>
<br/>
I'm thrilled to find any letterbox.  I don't think any less of a store<br/>
bought stamp than a handcarved one.<br/>
<br/>
When I asked on the list, I was mostly commenting about how often I'll<br/>
struggle with truly vague and/or confusing clues if I know that a<br/>
hand-carved stamp is the prize.<br/>
<br/>
For example, I once spent over an hour turning over rocks in a heavily<br/>
wooded (and very rocky) area in the northeast when the clue was, "turn<br/>
left at the two trees and look under the rock!"  The stamp was<br/>
gorgeous, but the clues were far too vague.<br/>
<br/>
But, in my post to the big list I never intended to make less of any<br/>
letterbox, no matter what the stamp is like... For me, every letterbox<br/>
is a fabulous opportunity to discover a new trail, a new landscape,<br/>
and often a new park.<br/>
<br/>
I hope to meet some of the other letterboxers on this list, but now<br/>
I'm wondering if I'm regarded as some horrid woman who disdains store<br/>
bought stamps.  I'm also suspecting that my comments were confused<br/>
with Lady P's, when her sentiments seemed to be the very opposite of<br/>
mine.<br/>
<br/>
As an artist, I love handcarved stamps.  However, letterboxing is--for<br/>
me--about the hikes and the thrill of successfully sorting out clues<br/>
to find a box.  I also enjoy planting boxes, and reading the log books<br/>
later. I get all mushy when I read notes by little kids.<br/>
<br/>
If I was all that keen on carving stamps, I'd be far more active with<br/>
the Carving Consortium.  I'm not.<br/>
<br/>
I want to make it very clear that I am delighted to find any and all<br/>
letterboxes, whether they include handcarved stamps, store bought<br/>
stamps, cut-up pink erasers as stamps, or even a piece of a sponge cut<br/>
in a cute shape.  Heck, if it makes any kind of mark in my logbook,<br/>
I'm thrilled.<br/>
<br/>
And, I'm horrified by what was suggested on the big list, and dismayed<br/>
that I'm the one who seemed to have started it.<br/>
<br/>
I would never want anyone to give up letterboxing because they're<br/>
using store bought stamps.  That would limit the hobby to artists and<br/>
aspiring artists, and that would be simply awful.  This is such a<br/>
fabulously fun hobby, I want everyone to enjoy it as much as I do, no<br/>
matter how plain or fancy their stamps, logbooks, containers, or<br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
Sincerely,<br/>
Aisling<br/>

<div>While I was not on the big list due to the fact 
that I left a few weeks ago over another flaming incident that all started when 
poor Silver Eagle got a nasty email from someone who had found one of his 
letterboxes and claimed to have destroyed it!!  By the time I left it was 
COMPLETELY off topic and unnecessary insults were flinging everywhere!!  
After leaving I even got a few nastygrams in my personal inbox.  So, I can 
still say with fair confidence that it is probably not the way you phrase 
things, but the very demeanor of that list...  I agree with the store 
bought stamp thought.  I personally have begun carving (thanks to the 
encouragement of many on this list before the Brazos gathering), but certainly 
don't fault anyone for not feeling ready!  I too was very intimidated, but 
as I began carving I felt a little better about it and I see marked improvement 
in each stamp I carve.  That said the whole idea of carving is 
overwhelming, and if you want to plant a store bought stamp--  do 
it!!  Like Barefoot Lucy said, you will probably one day find your self 
giving carving a try anyway, but that is no reason to not enjoy the whole sport 
now!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am also on the newboxers list, and it is NOTHING 
like that big ball of nastiness otherwise known as "the big 
list"....</div>

<div>You get out of letterboxing exactly what you put into it and exactly what YOU want out of it. Nothing more. Nothing less. As long as you respect people's property, respect nature and follow common sense "rules", that's all that's needed. Carve the stamp or buy it. Make the logbook or buy it. DO WHAT MAKES YOU HAPPY AND WHAT GIVES *YOU* SATISFACTION AND never mind what some elitist boxer thinks , OR what some newcomer says who pops off when they probably know very little of what they speak. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>No list that has 2600 people (and growing) is going to remain what we would like it to be.......easy going and flame-free. Ain't gonna happen. If you had seen it the way it was as recently as April or May of last year, you would see the difference. It's not the nice list it used to be and it's not going to go back to being that. EVER. </div>

I'm sure you realize this, but I wanted to make sure<br/>
you do - I was in no way inferring anything about your<br/>
original message.  I got your drift when you asked the<br/>
question and I was dismayed when it left being about<br/>
your question...and was especially unhappy that<br/>
someone would be left unsure about planting because of<br/>
that discussion which was nothing like what you<br/>
originally posted.<br/>
<br/>
As to the flame about Silver Eagle's box, I felt like<br/>
it was a matter that needed to be discussed, but I<br/>
could surely see why some folks felt it shouldn't. <br/>
Safety is a big concern to me for reasons I won't go<br/>
into here.  I hate that I inadvertantly fanned the<br/>
flame war when I defended TexasLuvBug's choice to<br/>
carry a gun with her, but I had hoped to be able to<br/>
make the folks who were horrified by that understand<br/>
that it isn't that big a thing in our state,<br/>
especially in rural regions like TLB and I are in. <br/>
Folks carry guns.  Period.  But that was another<br/>
example of comments being taken outside of their<br/>
intent....(sigh)<br/>
<br/>
I agree with Miss June that the big list isn't the<br/>
warm place it once was, but I'm on a couple of other<br/>
very large lists (one is 3500 and the other is 2200)<br/>
that just don't have the same dynamics we see on the<br/>
letterboxing big list.  I have no idea why it is that<br/>
way...I think it's a cycle or something maybe.  Maybe<br/>
it will even out again one day.<br/>

&gt; Hi,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to add that my question (and my comments)<br/>
&gt; seemed to be very<br/>
&gt; misunderstood, which is why I've stopped commenting<br/>
&gt; on the big list. <br/>
&gt; I must be phrasing things very badly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few minutes ago, I counted the stamps in my own<br/>
&gt; personal logbook,<br/>
&gt; and--if I don't count the exchanged stamps that<br/>
&gt; resulted from a<br/>
&gt; (large) class that I taught in letterbox stamp<br/>
&gt; carving--the stamps are<br/>
&gt; equally handcarved and store bought.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's probably a good representation of the balance<br/>
&gt; in actual<br/>
&gt; letterboxing: 50/50.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm thrilled to find any letterbox.  I don't think<br/>
&gt; any less of a store<br/>
&gt; bought stamp than a handcarved one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I asked on the list, I was mostly commenting<br/>
&gt; about how often I'll<br/>
&gt; struggle with truly vague and/or confusing clues if<br/>
&gt; I know that a<br/>
&gt; hand-carved stamp is the prize.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For example, I once spent over an hour turning over<br/>
&gt; rocks in a heavily<br/>
&gt; wooded (and very rocky) area in the northeast when<br/>
&gt; the clue was, "turn<br/>
&gt; left at the two trees and look under the rock!"  The<br/>
&gt; stamp was<br/>
&gt; gorgeous, but the clues were far too vague.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But, in my post to the big list I never intended to<br/>
&gt; make less of any<br/>
&gt; letterbox, no matter what the stamp is like... For<br/>
&gt; me, every letterbox<br/>
&gt; is a fabulous opportunity to discover a new trail, a<br/>
&gt; new landscape,<br/>
&gt; and often a new park.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope to meet some of the other letterboxers on<br/>
&gt; this list, but now<br/>
&gt; I'm wondering if I'm regarded as some horrid woman<br/>
&gt; who disdains store<br/>
&gt; bought stamps.  I'm also suspecting that my comments<br/>
&gt; were confused<br/>
&gt; with Lady P's, when her sentiments seemed to be the<br/>
&gt; very opposite of<br/>
&gt; mine.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As an artist, I love handcarved stamps.  However,<br/>
&gt; letterboxing is--for<br/>
&gt; me--about the hikes and the thrill of successfully<br/>
&gt; sorting out clues<br/>
&gt; to find a box.  I also enjoy planting boxes, and<br/>
&gt; reading the log books<br/>
&gt; later. I get all mushy when I read notes by little<br/>
&gt; kids.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I was all that keen on carving stamps, I'd be far<br/>
&gt; more active with<br/>
&gt; the Carving Consortium.  I'm not.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I want to make it very clear that I am delighted to<br/>
&gt; find any and all<br/>
&gt; letterboxes, whether they include handcarved stamps,<br/>
&gt; store bought<br/>
&gt; stamps, cut-up pink erasers as stamps, or even a<br/>
&gt; piece of a sponge cut<br/>
&gt; in a cute shape.  Heck, if it makes any kind of mark<br/>
&gt; in my logbook,<br/>
&gt; I'm thrilled.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And, I'm horrified by what was suggested on the big<br/>
&gt; list, and dismayed<br/>
&gt; that I'm the one who seemed to have started it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would never want anyone to give up letterboxing<br/>
&gt; because they're<br/>
&gt; using store bought stamps.  That would limit the<br/>
&gt; hobby to artists and<br/>
&gt; aspiring artists, and that would be simply awful. <br/>
&gt; This is such a<br/>
&gt; fabulously fun hobby, I want everyone to enjoy it as<br/>
&gt; much as I do, no<br/>
&gt; matter how plain or fancy their stamps, logbooks,<br/>
&gt; containers, or<br/>
&gt; clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
Yes, I stay on the big list, and I've been on it for years.  I watch<br/>
it mostly for news of gatherings, and what friends are doing.<br/>
<br/>
I was getting active again simply because--since moving to TX from<br/>
NH--I'm getting more active with letterboxing again, and I like to be<br/>
part of interesting discussions.<br/>
<br/>
However, "interesting" and "flames" are mutually exclusive terms, in<br/>
my opinion.  So, I'm silent on the big list again, but keep skimming<br/>
it for the cool stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I agree about the current climate on the big list.  I've lived all<br/>
over the U.S. and the gun issue, like politics, can polarize people in<br/>
a blink.  That seems so weird to me, but I lived for five years in<br/>
Utah and eight years in northern California where guns were as routine<br/>
in rural areas as they seem to be in Texas.<br/>
<br/>
Then again, I carry pepper spray for dealing with problem wildlife<br/>
when I go camping, and I thought that the Canadian border police were<br/>
going to have a seizure when I tried to take pepper spray into Quebec.<br/>
 Needless to say, not one of them had been camping and it was as if I<br/>
was speaking a foreign language.<br/>
<br/>
I should have double-checked the laws before trying to cross the<br/>
border, of course, but my point is:  In some volatile discussions,<br/>
opinions vary widely according to the context, and seem to be based on<br/>
the individual's experiences.  So, I try to bite my tongue on the big<br/>
list.  In many cases, all that we have in common is an interest in<br/>
letterboxing, period.<br/>
<br/>
And, at times like this, it's clear that nerves are frayed and it<br/>
doesn't take much for people to snap.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm nodding in agreement with the posts on this list, and<br/>
wanted to add my two cents.  I like the big list, and always have. <br/>
I'll remain on it, but I'm going "no mail" there again, so that I can<br/>
skim the posts at the Yahoo website without reading the flame sessions<br/>
in my mailbox.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
Ais<br/>

<div>Aisling,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I did not misunderstand you at all, and I have never thought you would be rude or mean-spirited! I thought it was an interesting question on boxers' personal preferences and never believed you meant to discount boxers who use store bought stamps. I have seen your previous posts and they have all been friendly, supportive, and, of course, "cheerful"! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, there are some people on the "big list" that are not cheerful, but I choose to ignore them, as I do not allow anyone to steal my</div>

<div>Hi,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to see if I can teach a free class in "letterbox stamp</div>
<div>carving for beginners" at the public library here in Katy.  I've</div>
<div>taught this before and it's great fun.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll ask at the library this week, to see what's required to use one</div>
<div>of their rooms.  Other suggestions for free, Houston-area classrooms</div>
<div>will be welcomed, too.</div>
<div> </div>
