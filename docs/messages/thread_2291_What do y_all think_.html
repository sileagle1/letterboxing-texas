actually started last night and ran all day today, but we only got to<br>
go for a few hours.<br>
<br>
It was held at the site of a renaissance festival that is held in East<br>
Texas each year in April and May, .  There are quite a few permanent<br>
structures relating to the faire, so the location goes idle much of<br>
the year.<br>
<br>
As I hung out and relaxed, I realized how much like my letterboxing<br>
friends folk music folks are.  Wouldn't it be cool to have a gathering<br>
coinciding with a small folk festival?  The site is closer to Tyler,<br>
which is still pretty much box-poor, although there are lots of places<br>
to put boxes.  Imagine mixing music and boxing - what do y'all think?<br>
