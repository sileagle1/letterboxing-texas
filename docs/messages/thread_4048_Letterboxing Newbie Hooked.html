                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome to Texas Letterboxing BBT and PC. We try not to have too many "rules" in letterboxing, but rather rely on courtesy and common sense, however you can find the topic of letterboxing etiquette on the AQ site, and it's definitely worth reading.<br/>
<br/>
Your question regarding planting a box where a missing one had been is a good question. There may be as many opinions about this as there are letterboxers, but here's my two cents worth. Just because a box has gone missing, does not mean that the planter will not replace it soon. I've found places that I just loved, and therefore have replaced the box after it disappeared (as I did earlier this week with one of my moose series boxes). Not that the planter of the missing box "owns" a particular spot, but it does seem like a courteous gesture to at least attempt to contact the original planter and ask them if the plan to replace their box or if they'd object to you planting a new box in their vacant spot.<br/>
<br/>
Some people have left letterboxing and their boxes are long gone. In that case, I see no reason not to use their original spot. Of course, there is also the possibility that you may have misunderstood the clues and their box is not missing and may actually be very near by. In that case, it would be considered bad form to hid a new box so close to the original.<br/>
<br/>
My suggestion would be to contact the placer of the original box and ask if they know for sure their box is missing. Then ask if they plan to replant the box, or if they would mind if you planted a new box in that particular place. You may not get an immediate response from someone because they may be traveling or busy, but if after trying to contact them for a few weeks with no response, I suppose it would be okay to move forward.<br/>
<br/>
You may also want to consider that although you may have just visited that spot for the first time searching for a particular box, it may have already been visited by many, many letterboxers before who had found the original box, so it may not be as much fun for them to be led back to the same spot a second time for a different box.<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully, you'll get some input by other letterboxers with different opinions. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun, Puddle Splasher<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Before I planted a new box in a location where a currently-listed box seems to be missing, I think I'd contact the owner of the missing box and ask if they are plannig to replace their box in that same location.  Also, there's the real possibility that the apparently-missing box isn't actually missing, but perhaps only temporarily removed for maintenance or some other reason, and the box is going to be replaced soon.  And of course, there's always the possibility that you could be looking in not quite the right place, and the box isn't missing at all (it happens!).  It would be a courtesy, and if the owner isn't planning to replant in that location, I'm sure they'd respond and say go for it!  But I think I'd be hesitant to plant there without at least contacting the original planter first.  I don't know what others would do, though, and if the box has been reported missing for a very long time (like, say, a year or so) without being replaced, or if the planter doesn't respond within a reasonable time, perhaps because they've stopped letterboxing altogether, then I'd say the location is up for grabs and you're safe to plant your own box in that place.  In fact, I've found at least 3 different boxes, by 3 different planters, in one particular location over the past several years -- each apparently unaware that previous boxes had ever been there.  Some places do cry out for a letterbox, but if they go missing frequently in that location, then that might not be such a good place after all.  <br/>

I don't know what others would do, though, and if the box has been reported missing for a very long time (like, say, a year or so) without being replaced, or if the planter doesn't respond within a reasonable time, perhaps because they've stopped letterboxing altogether, then I'd say the location is up for grabs and you're safe to plant your own box in that place.? In fact, I've?found at least 3 different boxes, by 3?different planters, in one particular location over the past several years -- each apparently unaware that previous boxes had ever been there.?

  location.? Also, there's the real possibility that the apparently-missing box 
  isn't actually missing, but perhaps only temporarily removed for maintenance 
  or some other reason, and the box is going to be replaced soon.? And of 
  course, there's always the possibility that you could be looking in not quite 
  the right place, and the box isn't missing at all (it happens!).? It would be 
  a courtesy, and if the owner isn't planning to replant in that location, I'm 
  sure they'd respond and say go for it!? But I think I'd be hesitant to plant 
  there without at least contacting the original planter first.? I don't know 
  what others would do, though, and if the box has been reported missing for a 
  very long time (like, say, a year or so) without being replaced, or if the 
  planter doesn't respond within a reasonable time, perhaps because they've 
  stopped letterboxing altogether, then I'd say the location is up for grabs and 
  you're safe to plant your own box in that place.? In fact, I've?found at least 
  3 different boxes, by 3?different planters, in one particular location over 
  the past several years -- each apparently unaware that previous boxes had ever 
  been there.? Some places do?cry out for a letterbox, but if they go missing 
  frequently in that location, then that might not be such a good place after 
  all.??<br/>&gt; -- Viewfinder?<br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  <br/>&gt; We are itching to plant a box of our own and I was wondering if a box 
  is missing but the location is really great can you plant a new box there?? I 
  was looking for "rules" on this but didnt find one, I dont want to step on any 
  toes our first time planting.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We would love to know if there 
  are any other Girl Scouts in the group?? We're in Irving.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
  Also is there going to be a 6th TX Annual Letterboxing Event?? <br/>&gt;

                    <html><body><p>Hi Michelle, and welcome!<br/><br/>Several other boxers have given you very good information! <br/><br/>The question of "how many boxes can a location hold?" is a very good one, but not easily answered. It's really easy to come to the conclusion that "the more the merrier", or "if one is good, ten must be better.", or to go to the other extreme and say "I can't plant one there, someone else already has one there". Neither of those answers is right.<br/>
<br/>As everyone else has mentioned, it's a very good idea to ask previous planters of a location if they would mind if you also plant a box in XX park. Most of the time they will be readily agreeable, but they may also know of reasons why it isn't a good idea or be able to make suggestions that save you a lot of trouble in the end. As an example, they may know that for whatever reason, boxes in that park tend to go missing or they may know of a word of mouth series in a location. They may know there are mystery boxes in the park or they may know the park is about to undergo renovations. Or perhaps you were looking on AtlasQuest for boxes and found only one, but the placer knows there are seven others listed on LBNA. <br/>
<br/>I think a park is overplanted when finders don't stop to take the time to "get" what the planter was trying to convey when he placed the box, but are instead busily trying to regroup themselves and get themselves pointed the right way to find the next box, even while others are still stamping in. This might sound like a finder's "problem", and to a certain degree it is, but I think it's brought about when finders feel like there are so many boxes in a park that they might not have time to find them all before they have to move on. <br/>
<br/>I think of it like this: If I plant one more box in the park, will the scale be tipped and all the focus is on the boxing and none is focused on the park? Sort of like makeup on a woman - a little eyeshadow is attractive, some color on the lips is appealing. Highlighting the cheekbones works too, and clean up the eyebrows. But after everyone has added their favorite features, and they've done their best to make sure their feature shines above all the others, you no longer see the woman, but a clown. <br/>
<br/>I think you can't go wrong if 1) you ask placers who already have boxes in the park (makes you a good neighbor and indicates you want to cooperate with them), and 2) ask yourself what the effect of your box will be on the park and on the other boxes?<br/>
<br/>Of course, my analysis works only if you are an experiential boxer - if you are numbers only, then Easter Egg boxing is what it's all about and the only time you can have too many in a park is when cars are running them over as they drive in!<br/>
