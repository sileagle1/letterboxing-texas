Celtic Lions is the first VFF of Surrender Dorothy.  Sending lots of<br>
warm Emerald City wishes your way!<br>

I think it's great to let puzzles percolate in your brain for a while.<br>
 Sometimes, it just clicks and it's all that much more the sweet for<br>

<br>
Coffee toasts to all those who like the mysteries on a chilly, chilly<br>
morning (no real boxing for us this weekend, faraway puzzles sound<br>
perfect)!<br>

wish is that someone does come up with a puzzle that will make you as<br>
crazy as Dorothy has made me.  Silver Eagle and Teamking, my hat is<br>
off to you both, and if I could get my arms out of this straightjacket<br>
I would tip it to you.  MO5<br>
