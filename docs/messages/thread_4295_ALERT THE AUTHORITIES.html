                    <html><body><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top">a few weeks ago the rowdy bus riders on the ttb2 were arrested and sent to rusk to serve some hard time.  they needed some community service, so i took a chance and put them to work.  last night, after this rowdy bunch of rascals finally had drank themselves into oblivion, i settled in for a nice rest with my little navigator.  about 2 am this morning the navigator began barking and growling and i sprang up from my bed and went to the door just in time to see some crazy man jump in the bus, playing zydeco and talking in french...making some comment about taking these rascals to nawlins...i ran out and the navigator grabbed the cajun's leg, but all of a sudden this sombrero came out of nowhere and hit me in the back of the head and the next thing i saw was a pancho running behind the bus, which was being driven by the cajun...i looked around for
 my navigator and by that time he was running behind the sombrero man who was running behind the bus.  i caught up to my navigator and the last i saw of the bus and its riders, they were being driven by a crazy cajun and a crazy mexican was on top of the bus shouting viva mexico.......so be on the lookout, there is no telling what is going to happen next<br/><br/></td></tr></table><br/>
