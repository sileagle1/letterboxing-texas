                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is boxhounds08 down in south tx. Just wanted to let you know we are still here. Haven't been out much since I retired from the navy. But now I'm working in Afghanistan while Melinda holds the fort down. Hopefully we will be back out next year. I would put a box here but you have to be military to get on this base. Maybe we will make TALE. I should be on vacation in March. <br/>
