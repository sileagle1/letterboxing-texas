                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oakwood is apparently a common name for cemeteries.  Twelve Texas governors are buried in six different cemeteries named Oakwood in Austin, Corsicana, Fort Worth, Huntsville, Tyler and Waco.  All of them are apparently haunted based on my experience with letterboxes placed in them.  One of our boxes in Austin's Oakwood was removed by "The Ghost of Oakwood Cemetery" who emailed us a warning against placing boxes there. A lady finding our boxes in Waco's Oakwood was approached by a strange man in a white suit who asked if she was looking for the letterboxes.  He said they had all been removed.  She told me that, even though it was a very hot day, he was cool as a cucumber and disappeared as quickly as he appeared.  Her young son asked her if he was a ghost.  Then, last Monday I went to Oakwood Cemetery in Huntsville to check on my governor box there, which was missing.  I was walking around the cemetery taking photos of some of the interesting markers and had just read the historical marker at the grave of Joshua Houston, who was a slave for the Lea family (Sam Houston's in-laws) and who was sent to Texas from Alabama in 1840 to serve as Sam's personal body-servent, which he did for the rest of Sam's life.  After he gained his freedom, he became a prominent businessman in Huntsville.  As I continued on my way, I heard a voice calling out to me.  I turned and saw an old black man approaching.  He asked for money and I was a little taken aback, so I just walked away, taking my pictures, thinking a cemetery was a strange place for anyone to be panhandling.  He followed me a ways, telling me why he needed the money.  I was going to give him a couple of dollars just to get rid of him, but when I turned around, he was gone and I didn't see him again.  I did go back Thursday and replaced my missing letterbox, moving it to a new spot and giving it a different name.  Oakwood was busy that day, with visitors to Sam's grave and a worker that kept popping up in different places, but I didn't see old Joshua again.  He seemed harmless and may merely be attending still to the welfare of Sam Houston.  If you go to find the letterbox, remember that this is a peaceful place, but you may not be alone.<br>
