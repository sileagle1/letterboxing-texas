It was a VERY BUSY day today.<br/>
<br/>
First - an announcement.<br/>
<br/>
The replacement location for HUECO TANKS #1 has been APPROVED!  You cannot<br/>
imagine how difficult it was to find the right place.  Visitors will understand<br/>
- once you visit the park - this is a significant ecological and historic place.<br/>
Finding a place where the letterbox would be accepted has been a struggle.  But<br/>
the lead ranger checked the place I selected today (my 6th try) and agreed it<br/>
was a perfect place for it.  It is awaiting final approval, but this should be a<br/>
rubber-stamp <grin> thing.  It must be approved by the same guy I hiked with two<br/>
weeks ago.  Shouldn't be a problem.  Look for it soon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
NEXT - color in a new county.  Hudspeth County has a letterbox in it.<br/>

<br/>
Now - time for dinner and my favorite radio dramas.  Y-all have a great evening.<br/>
We are tired here.<br/>
