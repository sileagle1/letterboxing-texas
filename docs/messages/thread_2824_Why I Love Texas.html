                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all...I have to get in on this, even if from afar.  First, let <br/>
me remind you all that you do not have to be born a Texan to love <br/>
Texas.  Since I am finding myself missing Texas at the moment, I <br/>
thought I'd add a "foreigner's" perspective to the great things <br/>
about Texas.<br/>
-Drivers that wave when you let them into traffic instead of <br/>
flipping you the bird.<br/>
-COLD air conditioning (it is NEVER cold enough in Michigan)<br/>
-SHINER BOCK (can't get it this far north)<br/>
-Strangers who actually smile back instead of looking at you as if <br/>
you may be crazy<br/>
-Neighborhood pools<br/>
-The way Texans pronounce the word "can't".  I don't know what there <br/>
is about that particular word, but I love it.<br/>
<br/>
I think one of the greatest things about Texas for a "non native" is <br/>
how surprising it is.  Texas in reality is nothing like the pre <br/>
conceptions non Texans have of it.  I will never forget the first <br/>
time I took one of my brothers to Enchanted Rock and he said, "No <br/>
way!  THIS is Texas?"  The very best thing about Texas for me is <br/>
that reading all of this has made me HOMESICK, even though I am <br/>
currently staying with my parents in the home where I spent the <br/>
first 22 years of my life...I would never want to live anywhere but <br/>
Texas now.  I know how good I have it.  Can't wait to get back...MO5<br/>
<br/>
PS add Lyle Lovett, Willie, and Robert Earl Keen to my list of <br/>
favorites.  Oh yeah, and cheap mangoes in the summer.<br/>

specifics.  But I will tell you a secret.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Repetition is the key.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Example.  Lift a calf every day, pretty soon you 
can lift a cow.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">What this means is that you will get as good as your 
dedication will allow you to.  If you really want to do this, you 
can.  But it will take some effort.  You will have to lift that calf 
every day.  Actually, every other day.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Clarify something.  20 miles.  3 days.  
Is that 6.666 miles a day over three days?  Or is that 20 miles a day for 
three days - 60 miles total?  Walking?  Or running?  Or 
Bicycle?  It isn't clear to me.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Do not train for the event.  Start training slowly 
- but push yourself a little bit.  Some days you will feel like you can do 
more - so do more.  Some days you will not have it in you - but try to get 
at least 15-20 minutes of good heart-rate for that day anyway.  Get on a 
schedule of training.  Like Mon-Wed-Fri or Tue-Thu-Sat.  Do your best 
to keep to it.  And try to do a little more each day.  It will get 
easier.  Also - there is only one way to get trained for climate.  
That is to train IN that climate.  This is why our soldiers stage in Kuwait 
before going into Iraq.  They don't just sit around waiting for an 
assignment.  They train every day - and a little more every day - till they 
are ready fir the daily duty.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Try to do some training in the gear you will be using 
for the event.  The LAST thing you want to do it put on new shoes just 
before you walk 20 miles.  My rule of thumb - 50 miles in short walks with 
a new pair of boots before you do a road-march (military hike) with them.  
Lighter shoes might not need as much break-in, but the day of the event isn't 
the time to learn that there is a glue-spot on the tongue that gives you a sore 
spot every time you flex your ankle.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">If you need to carry your own gear (water - lip balm - 
sun screen - etc) consider a Camel-Bak.  I like the military models - they 
are rugged.  I hike a lot of rugged places with heavy gear.  Just 
carried a 55 lb power supply up to a radio site a few days ago.  But they 
are also heavy.  The civilian models are light-weight.  They won't 
hold up to my abuse, but this one works for my wife just fine - the Camel-Bak 
M.U.L.E.  It carries nearly 1 gallon of water, and had enough pockets to 
carry bug spray etc.....  It was made for biking, but also works out just 
right for light-weight hiking.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Pack your pack a little heavier when you train.  
Like carry a big flashlight or something - just a pound or two at first.  
Later build up to a 4-pound can of coffee or something.  The days of the 
event your pack will feel much lighter and you will go farther 
faster.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="673203305-12062007">Gosh - I am writing a book here.</span></div>

  for a mile and a half today. I turned the pool into a jacuzzi. The sweat was 
  blinding me and I think that is because I tried to stay hydrated.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've got to get up to 20 miles for three days in October (Breast Cancer 
  3-Day), but I have to start training now. How am I supposed to do that in this 
  weather? I could do indoor training, but that's not going to be the terrain. I 
  know you've had this kind of training, help a girl out.</div>

 aerobics. I love the idea of Sun-Tue-Thu. Then, on Mon and Fri I can take D.O.G. for shorter walks (DH walks him other days). I tried to take him this morning.

it.  On our last hike in the Gila I had ice water until the end.  And 
cold water to me doesn't have as much taste to it.  Of course my camel-baks

<div>I have an REI Camelbak my daughter gave me when I was hiking on the Appalachian. They have several models/sizes and styles designed just for a woman's frame. Mine is a backpack/water reservoir combo with plenty of pockets for snacks and first aid equipment (and letterboxing stuff). I love that I can keep sipping water as I hike without having to stop or use my hands. Like Mike, I fill mine up with ice (which also keeps my back cool) then add water. There is usually enough water to last all day (or half a day with steep terrain and hot weather).</div>

<p>
</p><div>That is great. I don't mind the 'book' at all. It makes me want to go out and walk again right now.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's 60 mi in 3 days. They don't really do 20 miles a day. It's more like 22, 22, 16. That way they can have a 'closing ceremony' on Sunday. It's walking. They won't let you to run or bike. They have pit stops every 3 miles and they relay the pit stops so they don't have to have so many. We camp in tents on Fri and Sat nights. I thought of the CamelBak (didn't know the name though) and wondered if that would be easier on my back. They recommend the two bottle fanny pack. But, if you use a tall bottle, your arms hit it. It was uncomfortable today. It made me walk funny. I already have mole skin, in my pack. It helped to have music in my ears, but we're not 'supposed' to on training walks. I have thick socks but need to be fitted for shoes again. I am 43 and have not missed a meal in a few years. This summer my cross training will be wat aerobics. I love the idea of Sun-Tue-Thu. Then, on Mon and Fri I can take D.O.G. for shorter walks (DH walks him other days). I tried to take him this morning. He was so excited and wanted to mark everything we passed. He didn't even try to eat the guy mowing the lawn he was so excited. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Does the water in the CamelBak taste okay? Are they easy to fill at a pit stop? I think they are ingenious. And to have the pockets on the bag, makes it that much more feasible. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I just looked at the CamelBak site and they have a fanny one that will hold enough water for an hour of running. That's probably perfect and it has some pockets. I think I'll go look at the bicycle store down the street for me and see about getting one.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thank you so much for your help. I knew you'd know what to do.</div>

<div>Well, actually that reminds me of a story... once in Connecticut, I was hiking up a steep hill and it was one of those times when my heart was pounding, and I could feel the blood pulsing through my veins. I decided it was time to take a little breather and cool down. My training had been to lay down on the ground and prop my feet up on a tree, but the ground was too rocky, so I just found a great tree and went to the uphill side of it and leaned my back against it forgetting that I was wearing a Camelpak. When I did, the water in my pack came gushing out the top because I had obviously not screwed the lid on tight enough. Somehow, most of it ended up on the seat of my jeans. Luckily no one was around to enjoy the comedy as I was hopping around with an icy butt, but quite refreshed. I was actually letterboxing that day, so of course my mind was on successfully completing my mission!</div>
