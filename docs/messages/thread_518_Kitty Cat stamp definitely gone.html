Hey all,<br/>
The Powerpuff Girl's first endeavor in planting and her stamp was <br/>
stolen less than a week after planting. :(  As she is young, she may <br/>
use a commercial stamp to replace or we'll buy some more Dr. <br/>
Scholl's corn pads!<br/>
Hope everyone had a great Christmas!  Thanks to all who kept us <br/>
updated on the box!<br/>

<br/>
Don't blame ya about the store-bought though....let<br/>
her practice planting with something with a little<br/>
less personal investment so she doesn't get<br/>
discouraged.  She can always just carve for fun!<br/>
<br/>
Was the whole box gone, or just the stamp?<br/>
