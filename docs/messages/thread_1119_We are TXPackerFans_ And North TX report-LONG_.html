                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to introduce my family.  We obviously have a serious <br/>
identity crisis.  We are from Ohio.  We live in TX (Flower Mound).  <br/>
Our blood bleeds green and gold from Sept to Jan.<br/>
<br/>
So far, we just stamp in as a team.  Myself and my 2 sons.  Soon, we <br/>
will get my DH involved as I have already road tripped spur of the <br/>
moment to Oklahoma to box.  And I have big plans to hit all the <br/>
other surrounding border states, too. <br/>
<br/>
We have been in the Dallas area just two years this month and I was <br/>
always threatening.  Today I am going to Oklahoma.  And so we did.<br/>
<br/>
I am a rubber stamper, card crafter, scrapbooker, so somewhere in my <br/>
internet searches for ideas I stumbled on this fabulous hobby.  We <br/>
found our first 5 boxes  and our first HH on July 11.<br/>
<br/>
Be Happy / Tiger Trail-  alive and well<br/>
Gerault Park-     alive and well<br/>
Flower Mound Mini-  alive and well<br/>
<br/>
I have to say these were some of my favorite clues.  SO much <br/>
personal history.  I could envision these kids playing there and <br/>
heard their laughter.  <br/>
<br/>
In the Creek: Lauren's Turtle- alive and well<br/>
Meghans Bird-   alive and well  (Watch for falling black walnuts-<br/>
                                    big as softballs  LOL)<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
On 7/14 we found <br/>
Polly's Paws in Lewisville- alive and well.  A fabulous park I did <br/>
not know existed even with all of my baseball field travels these <br/>
past two years.<br/>
<br/>
Then on 7/15- I decided to go to OK.  Well we had to stop in Denton <br/>
to try for Day of the Dead- my first attempt at cemetery boxing.  <br/>
Although I have crawled many a cemetery on genealogy expeditions.  <br/>
Once there, we realized we forgot the LB backpack in our rush to <br/>
gather long trip snacks, drinks, etc.  So back to Hobby Lobby for a <br/>
stamp and markers.  We did not actually find Day of the Dead as the <br/>
mowers were there and two "guard" puppies that must travel with the <br/>
mowers under said tree.  And as we may be able to stack all three of <br/>
us up to make the 5'7" recommedation, we will go back when we hook <br/>
DAD so he can be indispensable.<br/>
<br/>
We continued to OK, crossed the Red River and found Wanda and Pete's <br/>
Pooh Points where we had to wait for the UPS guy to finish his <br/>
stretching exercises close to the hiding spot.  This is the coolest <br/>
rest area/welcome center I have ever been to by the way.<br/>
<br/>
And we had to hit a state park, so went for Chickasaw.  It was a <br/>
mere 105 in the shade by then.  And my 11 yo morphed into an alien <br/>
between the red river and Lake Murray so we were not successful in <br/>
finding the box.  Since we had left our back pack behind, we were <br/>
without our compass, too.  My 8yo and I have vowed to go back and <br/>
find it.  We may have to rent one of the cabins and camp out next <br/>
time.<br/>
<br/>
I am not thrilled about being introduced to any TX snakes. While at <br/>
Chickasaw we did see an amazing spider web that was built into a <br/>
nest of sorts which the spider was down in guarding his catches.  <br/>
Maybe that's when my 11yo morphed.  He is the techie in the group.  <br/>
He barely survived 5th grade camp.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry to be so long.  Soon we have plans to go to Keller for more <br/>
fun in the sun.<br/>
<br/>
It's a great day for boxing,<br/>

*****Ohhh...mine too!  My Texan parents found<br/>
themselves exiled to Wisconsin for three years, where<br/>
I was born a couple months after they got there.  They<br/>
left Wisconsin and returned to Texas, but they brought<br/>
with them Packer fever and there is NO cure!  My<br/>
parents were actually AT the Ice Bowl...<br/>

Nice report - thanks!<br/>

<br/>
&gt;&gt;Are they thawed out yet???  I recently found out there is a local<br/>
pub here in this little town where Packer Fans gather to watch the<br/>
games and cheer them on.  Go figure!!<br/>

&gt;&gt;It looks as though that is about 3 hrs for me- so when the temps<br/>
cool off I will plan a day trip there.  They sound awesome!!<br/>
<br/>

<br/>
Don't know that he's ever had one.  Nor have I.  From the archives I<br/>
learned of a place that may have them, so I may have to plan that trip<br/>
also.  Has anyone planted boxes close to those bakeries??<br/>
