<br/>
I just wanted to let you know that my letterbox called CAMP OUT, located<br/>
in Maydelle at the Fairchild State Forest is retired.  I got a message from someone saying they were harvesting timber in that area and came across my letterbox after the fact.  Lucky for me, he found the logbook in tact and was nice enough to mail it to me.  Thanks to all who found it! <br/>
