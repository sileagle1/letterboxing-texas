                    <html><body><p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">After entertaining the Tax-Free crowds at the mall with my pet monkey until nearly <st1>midnight</st1>, I was shocked to hear that Baby Bear was last seen at <st1><st1>Telge</st1> <st1>Park</st1></st1> (also known as the Letterboxing Halloween park). I immediately suspected that he was up to no good.<span>  </span>What reason could that scoundrel possibly have for visiting the strange cast of characters that inhabit <st1><st1>Telge</st1> <st1>Park</st1></st1>?<span>  </span>Some of my best friends are freaks and outcasts, and I was worried about his motives.<span>  </span>And I was even more concerned about my beloved LSS Bozo.<span>  </span>I know Bozo better than anyone, and he is innocent of the accusations being hurled against him by that devious bear.<span>  </span><b>Innocent I tell you!</b><span>  </span>Bozo has been hot on Baby Bear's trail  not out of malice, but to <u>rescue</u> the TTB2 passengers.<span>  </span>But would that dastardly bear actually sink so low as to harm Bozo just to salvage his own spotty reputation?<span>  </span>With fear gripping my heart, I gathered up a couple of flashlights and one of the circus' dancing dogs, then the monkey and I set off on a daring rescue mission of our own!</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></o></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We arrived at Telge at <st1>2:00 am</st1>.<span>  </span>With the dancing dog in the lead, and a full moon lighting our way, we set out to find Bozo and capture Baby Bear.<span>  </span>The dancing dog immediately picked up the gamey scent of matted bear fur and took off into the woods, with the monkey and I racing along behind.<span>  </span>But that bear is tricky, leaving false trails, and we had to double-back a couple of times.<span>  </span>Just as we were ready to give up in despair, we caught a glimpse of brown fur between the trees near a large vehicle.<span>  </span>Could that be the hijacked TTB2?<span>   </span>We turned the dancing dog loose to give chase, but that bear is fast, and alas, he escaped. </font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></o></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">We ran up to the vehicle, and to our amazement, we found not the TTB2, but the Traveling Texas Circus!!!<span>  </span>And although he was a little worse for the wear, we found Bozo safe and sound inside.<span>  </span>Needless to say, he is quite traumatized by this entire experience, so we have brought him home to the big top to rest and recuperate for a few days.<span>  </span>But good folks, don't worry, the Traveling Texas Circus should be ready for its next venue very soon.<span>  </span>Ladies and gentlemen, children of all ageslook here to the Texas Talk List for the announcement of our next show.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><o><font face="Times New Roman" size="3"> </font></o></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Times New Roman" size="3">In spite of my great relief at having Bozo and the rest of the circus safe and sound, my heart goes out to those poor passengers of the TTB2.<span>   </span>Baby Bear can't weasel his way out of it this time.<span>  </span>HE is the real hijacker!<span>   </span>`Fess up bear <b>where is that bus?!!!</b> </font></p>
