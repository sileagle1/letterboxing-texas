I, too was out enjoying the wildflowers this weekend on<br>
the way to Austin for Easter.  I replaced the logbook<br>
and box for Texas Flag on Friday, just in time for Dewberry.<br>
I also replaced Father Of Texas in a new spot within<br>
SFA SP.  It should be much easier to access now.  I was<br>
not able to find the other box in that park.  I also<br>
confirmed that my Stevie Ray microbox in Austin is missing<br>
and since I have already replaced it once I will just retire it.<br>
Finally, my Lake Arrowhead box near Wichita Falls is back in<br>
action thanks to Jet Phoenix.  The wildflowers are great right<br>
now so have fun!<br>

We couldn't find the Fish either!  But, when we were there in <br>
January, there were no leaves on the trees, the whole place was <br>
muddy and it was very hard to distinguish where the trails actually <br>
went; we planned to go back this spring.  The first trip, we didn't <br>
find FOT either, but I knew that was probably just user error <br>
complicated by tired children. Now we'll have an excuse to go back <br>
to what I thought was a nice little park.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to Silver Eagle for replacing the log book at Texas Flag just <br>
in time for us.  If we'd been a few days earlier, there would have <br>
been another box for him to find, but as it was Team King has <br>
checked in as the first finder of Power of the Pen.  <br>
<br>
Now, if we could just teleport to Keller we'd give Puddle Splasher <br>
something to be really jealous about.<br>
