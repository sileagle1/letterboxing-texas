                    <div class="plaintext-content">I made a spur of the moment decision to go hiking at<br>
Fairfield State Park last Sunday.  I couldn't convince<br>
anyone else in the family to go, so I just jumped in<br>
the car to go hike a little and check on my Fairfield<br>
box before I changed my mind.<br>
<br>
Well, I got to Fairfield and got out of the car at the<br>
trail head.  It was HOT!!!  I hiked on in, determined<br>
to ignore the heat.  About halfway to Fairfield, I<br>
realized I had forgotten my clues.  Well, it was my<br>
own box, so I figured I would surely remember where I<br>
put it!  HA!<br>
<br>
I put on my best hot face and hiked on in.  We had<br>
severe storms since I was there in May, so the terrain<br>
looked much different!  Lots of downed trees across<br>
the path, for one thing.  The trail was also overgrown<br>
with summer foliage in some places for another.  I<br>
realized, as I hiked through knee-high weeds next to<br>
the lake by myself (translate that to hoping I didn't<br>
get bit by a snake), that I had never been to<br>
Fairfield in the hot summer.  I got to the bench I had<br>
planted the box near and turned to look in the<br>
direction it would be - only to see lots of debris.  I<br>
knew I had hidden it near a fallen log, but which of<br>
the dozen or so logs in sight was it?  I searched<br>
around for a bit, with no luck.  Of course, not having<br>
my clues I realized I could well have been wrong on<br>
any of several points, OR the box was gone, OR ...<br>
<br>
As it turns out, I was in the complete wrong place -<br>
the wrong bench.  I had remembered the clues<br>
incorrectly, so I searched in vain for about a half an<br>
hour.<br>
<br>
It was a nice idea that I would remember where I<br>
planted my box, but obviously that was a bad<br>
assumption, so next time I will definitely remember to<br>
take my own clues!  Now I wonder if I would've<br>
recognized my kids when they were babies, if I had had<br>
to pick them out of a group of babies???  So, does<br>
this make me a bad box mom or just a wiser boxer today<br>
than I was last week?  <br>
<br>
Anyway, I'll throw that out for anyone else who may<br>
consider checking their own boxes without clues.  May<br>
you be the better finder than I was if you try it!<br>
