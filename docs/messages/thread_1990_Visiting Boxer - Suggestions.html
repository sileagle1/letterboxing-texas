                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hopefully some of our Austin, College Station & Houston<br>
area boxers will come forward with suggestions, but I<br>
thought I would give some of mine.  Let me start by<br>
saying I won't be in TX during Bandaid's visit, so I'll<br>
just say Howdy, and welcome to TX now.  I'm not sure how <br>
much time you will have to letterbox or sightsee while <br>
visiting, but there are a lot of things to do and places <br>
to see in those 3 cities.<br>
<br>
In Austin, you can visit the State Capitol and even get a<br>
free tour, with letterboxes nearby.  If the heat gets to be <br>
too much, you can always go swimming at Barton Springs in<br>
Zilker Park, with boxes nearby, or at Hamilton Pool, also<br>
with boxes.  If you like outdoor activities, there are many<br>
hike/bike trails along Greenbelts in Austin, canoe rentals<br>
at Zilker Park and a great view of town from Mt. Bonnell, <br>
all with boxes.  For meals, I'm sure local boxers can tell <br>
you more but some of my favorites include Threadgills, <br>
Conan's Pizza and the Hula Hut.  If you have time to explore<br>
surrounding areas, you can head west on Hwy 290 toward<br>
Fredericksburg and visit Pedernales SP, LBJ's home or even<br>
TX wineries, with boxes all along the way.  Heading south<br>
on I35 will take you to San Marcos with it's Outlet Malls<br>
and pretty Aquarena Springs, and further to New Braunfels<br>
where you can rent a tube and float on the "horseshoe".<br>
Heading North on I35 will take you to the towns of Roundrock<br>
and Georgetown, both with boxes and swimming holes like<br>
the Blue Hole.  Heading east on Hwy 71 will take you to<br>
Bastrop SP, home to our first LB Event and many boxes.  Be<br>
sure to continue through the park on a scenic back road to<br>
Buescher SP just a few miles away, and home to the oldest<br>
TX LB still available (Lost Pines).  You can continue on<br>
Hwy 21 to College Station.<br>
<br>
It is ironic that you will be going to College Station<br>
right after Austin, since they are home to the biggest rival<br>
schools in TX, Longhorns vs. Aggies.  There are a few boxes <br>
and more being added by a new letterboxer in Aggieland.  <br>
Nearby is one of the most famous TX wineries, Messina Hof.<br>
<br>
On the way to Houston, you can detour off Hwy 6 and visit<br>
Washington-On-The-Brazos SP, site of TX Declaration of <br>
Independence and home to several letterboxes.  This area <br>
is beautiful in Spring with Bluebonnetts, our State flower, <br>
but is nice even in summer.  Continuing south toward Houston, <br>
you might want to detour east to Tomball for many boxes, and<br>
maybe on to Woodlands area for even more.  If you come<br>
south to Hwy 290, there are many boxes in the Hockley/<br>
Cypress area.  Once in Houston, there are too many boxes<br>
to list, but major concentrations are found in Memorial Park. <br>
If you can make it east of town to San Jacinto SP, you can<br>
visit the site of TX Independence and a few boxes.  South<br>
of town you can visit NASA Space Center with many boxes nearby,<br>
and of course Galveston with its beaches and boxes.<br>
<br>
I hope you have a great visit and enjoy TX as much as we do!<br>
