That is too cool Lucy!  My oldest, Auston, (9) desperately wants to carve<br>
his own stamp.  Thinking it would be a while before he got his widdeling<br>
chip I told him he could carve his stamp once he had that.  Well. Guess what<br>
they are working on this year?  LOL!!  He will have his widdeling chip by<br>
the end of the school year.  He was very quick to remind me that that meant<br>
he gets to carve his stamp!  Oh well..  I have to let go sometime I guess!  <br>

Semalee's post reminded me that I am just finishing<br>
something up with my Webelos (4th graders) that has<br>
turned out to be really cool.<br>
<br>
One of the Webelos requirements is to explore various<br>
forms of Art by creating art in different genre. I<br>
decided to let them carve stamps - xacto knives and<br>
all! We've been working on them for about three<br>
weeks, and I've even had some boys from the older<br>
Webelos den come in to see what we were doing and beg<br>
to make their own stamps, so I've been staying late<br>
with them to help them out. It has been a lot of fun<br>
teaching them to carve and they've done surprisingly<br>
well at handling the xactos and gouges. While they've<br>
been carving their own very rough stamps, I copied and<br>
carved our den emblem, dragons, and it has turned out<br>
great!<br>
<br>
Of course, this is the last piece of the puzzle in<br>
preparation for doing our scout training series, which<br>
is about to happen. They will be working with me on<br>
that, and I'm so excited. They may even carve some of<br>
the stamps for it. Hopefully in January we will begin<br>
placing the series in Jim Hogg Historical Site in<br>
Rusk. It will definitely be in place by March 18th!<br>
