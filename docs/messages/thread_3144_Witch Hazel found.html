                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I went out to Azle today to check on Witch Hazel.  She had been  <br/>
reported missing last November.  (Yes, I procrastinate.)  I assumed  <br/>
she was a flood victim, so didn't make it a priority.  She was there,  <br/>
in the exact spot where I planted her.  She had obviously been under  <br/>
water, but I had hidden her beneath a tangle of roots that went under  <br/>
the trail.  Those roots effectively "held her down" during the  <br/>
deluge.  Her box had a lot of water in it (Lock-N-Locks may be water  <br/>
proof, but they obviously aren't flood proof.)  Her logbook had a  <br/>
little mold on it, but all of the stamp images and writings were  <br/>
pristine.  I was very excited.  The last logged entry was October  <br/>
28th, 2006.  There was an attempt on November 27, 2006.  If anyone  <br/>
had gone out there, they would have found her, easily.   I have to  <br/>
wonder if her year-long inactivity was due to the attempted find.    <br/>
(Of course, I know it's my own lazy fault for not checking on her  <br/>
sooner.) And I'm officially revising my practice of ignoring boxes  <br/>
with attempted finds from now on.<br/>
<br/>
At any rate, she is retired now.<br/>

<div>I sure hope that one attempt wasn't the only reason no one went after your box...did you notice that the attempter had joined AQ a month prior to the attempt, and the only thing logged on their page is one single attempt - Witch Hazel.  No finds of any sort, no plants.  JUST - one attempt.

<div>I always feel a little elated when I find a box after it had been marked attempted. It's kind of like a double reward. As there become more and more boxes available to find, I would definitely encourage boxers to still continue to look for a box even if it has been marked attempted, because you never really know. It has also happened on occasion that a box was missing when someone looked for it, only to find out later that someone else had just found it and had taken it a short distance down the trail to find a suitable place to sit and stamp in while the other boxer was looking for it. That can especially happen on a weekend when more folks are out boxing.</div>
