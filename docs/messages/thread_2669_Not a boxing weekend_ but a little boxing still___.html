                    <html><body><div>Our cub scout pack had a campout last night and while there we had the crossover ceremony, during which Lightning was officially inducted into his new troop.  (Mom managed to cry only a little! )  My husband and another leader took the new boy scouts and camped with them in a different site, and I stayed and camped with the Cubs since I'll be staying on a little longer with them. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The sister of one of the cubs is one of the girl scouts I spoke to awhile back, so she finagled her dad into bringing her along so she could hang out with me.  Unfortunately, I wore my scout hat for several days before the campout and had been so intent on getting the ceremony straight and making sure the campout went well, that I forgot anything about downloading clues for the area.  I did, at least, throw my boxing backpack into my car at the last minute!  Anyway, she had the clues for BabyBear's and Silver Eagle's boxes in Mission Tejas State Park, as well as a few other clues for boxes in Alto and Rusk. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wasn't able to accompany her when she went boxing, but I had already glimpsed that both boxes in Mission Tejas were in place and I let her know that.  She headed out before breakfast this morning and found Baby Bear's Tejas box.  She returned to camp to report that it was there, but it was wet, wet, wet!  We had a nice fire going that was going to at least glow most of the day, so I sent her back out to retrieve it with a note to put in its place as to where it was for the day.  When she returned, we spread the pages of the journal and the additional makeshift journal which someone had added by the fire, and we dried them slowly, page by page. This afternoon we buttoned a dry box back up and I sent her off to replace it - I'm sure smelling strongly of campfire smoke! Unfortunately, some of the stamp images are lost, and I would have liked to have been able to place a new log in it, but my logmaking material was on my kitchen table.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She had a little more trouble finding Silver Eagle's box.  She came back and said it wasn't there, but I sent her back and told her I knew that it was!  She finally found it and had one of those AHA moments, seeing what she did wrong.  She reported back to me that it was in good condition and the log had room still.  I told her I would pass along her report.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Her dad had scolded her for bugging him about stopping to look for more boxes between Mission Tejas and Jacksonville, so I intervened by bugging him on her behalf!  He finally gave in and assuming he kept his word (and I believe he would), they did a little more boxing on the way home.  She had clues for JBK's two Alto boxes, as well as for my Friends are Friends boxes (but she hadn't solved the code yet), and Baby Bear's Hogg box and several Rusk State Park boxes.
