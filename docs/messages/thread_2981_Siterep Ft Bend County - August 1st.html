                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wednesday - Aug 2<br>
Started out the day in The Woodlands, north of Houston, and drove to <br>
Ft Bend county on the south side of Houston.  Went to Brazos Bend <br>
State Park and on the way down the trail to find the Bonnie Parker <br>
box a raccoon was coming towards me on the trail.  As he crossed the <br>
bridge, he saw me and decided to show me the direction that I needed <br>
to go.  I ended up losing him, but did see a lot of spider webs on <br>
the side of the trail with tons of large spiders just hanging <br>
around.  Found the Bonnie Parker letterbox with no problem and in <br>
good shape.  The next trail that I went on had a mommy and baby deer <br>
grazing on the side of it and they wished me good luck on finding <br>
the box.  I then noticed that a pair of eyes  were watching me from<br>
the water..it was Allie the alligator...she also wished me good <br>
luck.  A little further down, Ricky the raccoon wished me luck.  <br>
Thanks to all the friends that I was making, my luck was good and I <br>
found the Good Luck letterbox in good shape.  After returning to the <br>
car to drive to the next trail, I spotted another mommy deer but she <br>
had 2 babies with her.  A little further down were about 8-9 mommy <br>
and baby deer grazing in a group on the side of the road and then <br>
continued a little way further to see another group of 9-10 deer<br>
having their morning breakfast.  The next trail that I attempted was <br>
the Red Buckeye trail to find the LA and TLRE box and the Taz box <br>
but the trail was closed due to floods.  My next stop was a trail <br>
that had several boxes on it, however it also had the observation <br>
tower on it, and on this day a group of about 30 summer camping kids <br>
decided to visit it also.  So there were too many kids to feel <br>
comfortable to make this attempt.  So I decided to leave Brazos Bend <br>
and come back another time to pick up the rest.  My next stop<br>
was Seabourne Park in Rosenberg.  This park has a beautiful wetland <br>
area with a pond and a board walk that goes over one end of it.  As <br>
I was crossing it, I saw another set of eyes  near a little hut.  <br>
Ollie the otter was busy repairing his house.  He said hi and told <br>
me where to look for the box at.   I managed to find the<br>
Rosenberg box in great shape.  My next stop was Brazos Park in <br>
Rosenberg where I managed to find the Bully box.  The log book was <br>
very damp, and I did not have a log book small enough to replace <br>
it.  My next stop was Morton Cemetery in Richmond.  Saw the grave of <br>
the founder of the Confederate Museum of the Old South Plantation <br>
(this was written on the headstone with a confederate flag on front <br>
and back) on my way to the letterbox.  Also this is the resting <br>
place of President of the Republic of Texas Lamar and the<br>
mother of Texas, Jane Long.  The box that is here is in tribute to <br>
her and is called the Mother of Texas. The box was in good shape.  <br>
Went to Cullinan Park in SugarLand to retrieve the Widow Skimmer <br>
box.  I found the correct location but there was a geocache there <br>
instead of a letterbox.  Found the SugarLand box at Oyster Creek <br>
Park in SugarLand with no problem.  If you go to this park, be sure <br>
and look over the bridge at the river.  I saw at least a hundred <br>
turtles swimming along in this river.  Went to Lost Creek Park<br>
and found the Lamp Post box, Triforce box and the Fence Me In box.  <br>
I attempted the Texas Sprint Champion box, but unsure if I was at <br>
the right place or not, so can't say if the box is there or not.  My <br>
next stop was Camp Sienna to find the Sienna Sunset Microbox.  It <br>
was in good shape.  I then went to Kitty Hollow Park and found the <br>
Tweety box.  I also attempted the Snappy Snapper box in this same <br>
park.  The box had previously been reported as missing, and I also <br>
could not find it.  There is a neat old house that they are <br>
currently restoring in this park that is very interesting, but I <br>
don't know what the history of it is.  I then decided that it was <br>
time to call it a day and decided to head to my parents.  Once I got <br>
there, my mom and I decided to look for the Bird in the Woods box on <br>
a trail around the golf course that my parents house backs up to.  <br>
We decided that we could handle this without a map and just pick up <br>
the trail from their house....BAD DECISION...we got lost and <br>
realized that neither one of us had a cell phone with us...and<br>
didnt know where we were or how to get home.  About 2 hours of <br>
walking and finally decided to ask a mounted security officer.  She <br>
told us which way to go, and we realized that we were still about 30 <br>
minutes from the house.  We finally managed to find the house, but <br>
needless to say the letterbox will have to wait for another day.  <br>

<div>Sounds like a fun trip.  Lightning and I have fond memories of getting flooded out of our tent at the Brazos Bend gathering and driving around in the middle of the night right after torrential rains and seeing tons of coons and a flock of deer bedded down not 100 yards from our campsite.  Thankfully, there were no gators that close, not even Allie.

<div>(and YES, those memories really ARE fond - in spite of spending the rest of the weekend soaking wet and having to admit that I COULD be forced to abandon a tent.  BUT - there were extenuating circumstances...)<br/><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we first moved to southeast Texas (Sugar Land) from Midland our <br>
son was about 14.  His cousin of the same age came to visit and we <br>
went to Brazos Bend State Park that weekend.  The two boys decided <br>
to take fishing poles and catch a few, only they didn't have any <br>
bait.  They found a piece of half-raw chicken that someone had left <br>
on a barbecue pit and thought that would make fine bait, so off they <br>
went.  It wasn't long before we heard them hollering and then we saw <br>
them running toward us as fast as they could run.  It seems that <br>
hunk of chicken on the end of the fishing line had attracted the <br>
attention of a large alligator.  Our son started reeling in his line <br>
and the faster he got, the faster the alligator got.  When he pulled <br>
the bait up on shore, they thought they had it made, until the <br>
alligator decided he would just join them.  That's when they came <br>
running and hollering.  Luckily the gator didn't take the hook and <br>
their fishing poles were still lying there on the bank.  I still kid <br>
him about that, but that was a scary thing that I wouldn't advise <br>
trying.<br>

we all 4 made it around him and continued down the path...i know it <br>

A little further down, Ricky the raccoon wished me luck. <br/>Thanks to all the friends that I was making, my luck was good and I <br/>found the Good Luck letterbox in good shape. After returning to the <br/>car to drive to the next trail, I spotted another mommy deer but she <br/>had 2 babies with her. A little further down were about 8-9 mommy <br/>and baby deer grazing in a group on the side of the road and then <br/>continued a little way further to see another group of 9-10 deer<br/>having their morning breakfast. The next trail that I attempted was <br/>the Red Buckeye trail to find the LA and TLRE box and the Taz box <br/>but the trail was closed due to floods. My next stop was a trail <br/>that had several boxes on it, however it also had the observation <br/>tower on it, and on this day a group of about 30 summer camping kids <br/>decided to visit it also. So there were too many kids to feel <br/>comfortable to make
 this attempt. So I decided to leave Brazos Bend <br/>and come back another time to pick up the rest. My next stop<br/>was Seabourne Park in Rosenberg. This park has a beautiful wetland <br/>area with a pond and a board walk that goes over one end of it. As <br/>I was crossing it, I saw another set of eyes near a little hut. <br/>Ollie the otter was busy repairing his house. He said hi and told <br/>me where to look for the box at. I managed to find the<br/>Rosenberg box in great shape. My next stop was Brazos Park in <br/>Rosenberg where I managed to find the Bully box. The log book was <br/>very damp, and I did not have a log book small enough to replace <br/>it. My next stop was Morton Cemetery in Richmond. Saw the grave of <br/>the founder of the Confederate Museum of the Old South Plantation <br/>(this was written on the headstone with a confederate flag on front <br/>and back) on my way to the letterbox. Also this is the resting <br/>place of President of the Republic of Texas
 Lamar and the<br/>mother of Texas, Jane Long. The box that is here is in tribute to <br/>her and is called the Mother of Texas. The box was in good shape. <br/>Went to Cullinan Park in SugarLand to retrieve the Widow Skimmer <br/>box. I found the correct location but there was a geocache there <br/>instead of a letterbox. Found the SugarLand box at Oyster Creek <br/>Park in SugarLand with no problem. If you go to this park, be sure <br/>and look over the bridge at the river. I saw at least a hundred <br/>turtles swimming along in this river. Went to Lost Creek Park<br/>and found the Lamp Post box, Triforce box and the Fence Me In box. <br/>I attempted the Texas Sprint Champion box, but unsure if I was at <br/>the right place or not, so can't say if the box is there or not. My <br/>next stop was Camp Sienna to find the Sienna Sunset Microbox. It <br/>was in good shape. I then went to Kitty Hollow Park and found the <br/>Tweety box. I also attempted the Snappy Snapper box in this same
 <br/>park. The box had previously been reported as missing, and I also <br/>could not find it. There is a neat old house that they are <br/>currently restoring in this park that is very interesting, but I <br/>don't know what the history of it is. I then decided that it was <br/>time to call it a day and decided to head to my parents. Once I got <br/>there, my mom and I decided to look for the Bird in the Woods box on <br/>a trail around the golf course that my parents house backs up to. <br/>We decided that we could handle this without a map and just pick up <br/>the trail from their house....BAD DECISION...we got lost and <br/>realized that neither one of us had a cell phone with us...and<br/>didnt know where we were or how to get home. About 2 hours of <br/>walking and finally decided to ask a mounted security officer. She <br/>told us which way to go, and we realized that we were still about 30 <br/>minutes from the house. We finally managed to find the house, but <br/>needless to
 say the letterbox will have to wait for another day. <br/>JB Kokopelli<br/><br/></wbr></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/><p>

                    <html><body><div>LOL...my whole family thinks we're nerds too.  We think they are uninformed.  We feel sort of like the Men in Black - you know, WE know what's out there, but everyone else is oblivious to it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The first Christmas that we letterboxed, we mentioned it at the family gathering and many of them began eying us warily and moving away.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The second Christmas, we mentioned it again and they said "You still do that?" (much as they would have said "You still belong to that cult?") BUT my sister-in-law sat me down and asked me about it and went boxing herself later in the year.  We slipped out early and planted a box - on Christmas Day.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The third Christmas, my sister-in-law and I were discussing it and a cousin got in on the conversation and the rest of them rolled their eyes.  Just a few short days later my husband, Fearless Fox, and son, Lightning, talked 
<br/>his sister's husband into going with them on a grand adventure to retrieve the Texas Tour Bus - only to be foiled by the dastardly PuddleSplasher.  That Christmas I made my mother-in-law an exquisite personal stamp.  It was beautiful but she didn't appreciate what it was.  She looked at it puzzled, sniffed it, and put it back in the box.  Oh well (she DOES still have it though).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The fourth Christmas, some of them even asked if we had found any good boxes lately but regretted it later as they had to extricate themselves as we continued discussing the boxes we have found, and my sister-in-law and I dared to ask for boxing supplies for Christmas.  We didn't get them, but the seed was planted (HA - no pun intended).  And on the other side of the family, I introduced my mother and step-dad to letterboxing and gave my mom a very nice letterboxing kit for Christmas.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In anticipation of this next Christmas, my mom (Nac Trail Cat) and her husband have discovered this year that they are completely hooked on letterboxing.  My 9-year-old nephew is a frustrated letterboxer because his parents won't take him boxing, although he learned about it and loved it at Cub Scout camp in April.  I'll have to kidnap him and take him with me.  My sister-in-law still likes to box, but she doesn't get out much.  I think we will plant several boxes on the family land and hand out clues and stamps for entertainment.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They do come around - eventually.</div>

Went to Brazos Bend <br/>State Park and on the way down the trail to find the Bonnie Parker <br/>box a raccoon was coming towards me on the trail. As he crossed the <br/>bridge, he saw me and decided to show me the direction that I needed <br/>to go. I ended up losing him, but did see a lot of spider webs on <br/>the side of the trail with tons of large spiders just
 hanging <br/>around. Found the Bonnie Parker letterbox with no problem and in <br/>good shape. The next trail that I went on had a mommy and baby deer <br/>grazing on the side of it and they wished me good luck on finding <br/>the box. I then noticed that a pair of eyes were watching me from<br/>the water..it was Allie the alligator...<wbr>she also wished me good <br/>luck. A little further down, Ricky the raccoon wished me luck. <br/>Thanks to all the friends that I was making, my luck was good and I <br/>found the Good Luck letterbox in good shape. After returning to the <br/>car to drive to the next trail, I spotted another mommy deer but she <br/>had 2 babies with her. A little further down were about 8-9 mommy <br/>and baby deer grazing in a group on the side of the road and then <br/>continued a little way further to see another group of 9-10 deer<br/>having their morning breakfast. The next trail that I attempted was <br/>the Red Buckeye trail to find the LA and TLRE box and the
 Taz box <br/>but the trail was closed due to floods. My next stop was a trail <br/>that had several boxes on it, however it also had the observation <br/>tower on it, and on this day a group of about 30 summer camping kids <br/>decided to visit it also. So there were too many kids to feel <br/>comfortable to make this attempt. So I decided to leave Brazos Bend <br/>and come back another time to pick up the rest. My next stop<br/>was Seabourne Park in Rosenberg. This park has a beautiful wetland <br/>area with a pond and a board walk that goes over one end of it. As <br/>I was crossing it, I saw another set of eyes near a little hut. <br/>Ollie the otter was busy repairing his house. He said hi and told <br/>me where to look for the box at. I managed to find the<br/>Rosenberg box in great shape. My next stop was Brazos Park in <br/>Rosenberg where I managed to find the Bully box. The log book was <br/>very damp, and I did not have a log book small enough to replace <br/>it. My next stop
 was Morton Cemetery in Richmond. Saw the grave of <br/>the founder of the Confederate Museum of the Old South Plantation <br/>(this was written on the headstone with a confederate flag on front <br/>and back) on my way to the letterbox. Also this is the resting <br/>place of President of the Republic of Texas Lamar and the<br/>mother of Texas, Jane Long. The box that is here is in tribute to <br/>her and is called the Mother of Texas. The box was in good shape. <br/>Went to Cullinan Park in SugarLand to retrieve the Widow Skimmer <br/>box. I found the correct location but there was a geocache there <br/>instead of a letterbox. Found the SugarLand box at Oyster Creek <br/>Park in SugarLand with no problem. If you go to this park, be sure <br/>and look over the bridge at the river. I saw at least a hundred <br/>turtles swimming along in this river. Went to Lost Creek Park<br/>and found the Lamp Post box, Triforce box and the Fence Me In box. <br/>I attempted the Texas Sprint Champion box,
 but unsure if I was at <br/>the right place or not, so can't say if the box is there or not. My <br/>next stop was Camp Sienna to find the Sienna Sunset Microbox. It <br/>was in good shape. I then went to Kitty Hollow Park and found the <br/>Tweety box. I also attempted the Snappy Snapper box in this same <br/>park. The box had previously been reported as missing, and I also <br/>could not find it. There is a neat old house that they are <br/>currently restoring in this park that is very interesting, but I <br/>don't know what the history of it is. I then decided that it was <br/>time to call it a day and decided to head to my parents. Once I got <br/>there, my mom and I decided to look for the Bird in the Woods box on <br/>a trail around the golf course that my parents house backs up to. <br/>We decided that we could handle this without a map and just pick up <br/>the trail from their house....BAD DECISION...we got lost and <br/>realized that neither one of us had a cell phone with
 us...and<br/>didnt know where we were or how to get home. About 2 hours of <br/>walking and finally decided to ask a mounted security officer. She <br/>told us which way to go, and we realized that we were still about 30 <br/>minutes from the house. We finally managed to find the house, but <br/>needless to say the letterbox will have to wait for another day. <br/>JB Kokopelli<br/><br/></wbr></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/> <div></div></div><!--End group email   --></div></blockquote><br/> <div> <hr size="1"/>  Fussy?

<div>~~ I love this, Lucy, since it's exactly my experience with just about 
everyone except PuddleSplasher.   So we usually don't bring up the 
subject with those family members and friends whose eyes glaze over and whose 
heads roll around on their necks -- we just talk among ourselves.  I have 
noticed, though, how others will quietly move away and leave us when we 
do!!That's not always a bad thing, either, is it? ~`

<div>Lucy said, "...we mentioned it at the family gathering and many of them began eying us warily and moving away.  The second Christmas, we mentioned it again and they said "You still do<span class="q"><br/>that?" (much as they would have said "You still belong to that cult?")"

<div>~~ I love this, Lucy, since it's exactly my experience with just about everyone except PuddleSplasher.   So we usually don't bring up the subject with those family members and friends whose eyes glaze over and whose heads roll around on their necks -- we just talk among ourselves.  I have noticed, though, how others will quietly move away and leave us when we do!!That's not always a bad thing, either, is it? ~` Viewfinder
