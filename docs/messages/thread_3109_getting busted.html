                    <div class="plaintext-content">well, in a year and a half that i have been boxing, i have never had <br/>
an incident like i had this past sunday when i was placing my <br/>
october series.  i had my boxes ready to go and knew where i wanted <br/>
to place the october series plus two others that i had come up with <br/>
that seemed appropriate to the halloween series.  so, sunday morning <br/>
i got up and left the house at around 7:30 am to beat the heat.  my <br/>
first stop was at the rusk state hospital cemetery near my house.  i <br/>
had heard a couple of haunted tales about this cemetery and thought <br/>
what a great place to place a box.  i had been to this cemetery <br/>
before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock on it, <br/>
but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of the <br/>
cemetery without trespassing across state property.  now first of <br/>
all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a green sign <br/>
on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery.  i also <br/>
should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at rusk <br/>
state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when they <br/>
died.  as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that went <br/>
by, but thought nothing of it.  so then i started looking around for <br/>
a good place to put the box.  i was having difficulty, because <br/>
the "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of underbrush/briars.  <br/>
well all of a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a security <br/>
guard from rsh got out and started questioning me and telling me <br/>
that i had been reported as being inside the cemetery (that would <br/>
mean that i had crossed over the gate)  he noticed the box in my <br/>
hand, which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me what i <br/>
had taken from the cemetery.  i told him that i had just been <br/>
looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i had not <br/>
crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no trespassing" <br/>
sign anywhere near.  i then explained that the box was a hobby of <br/>
mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my trunk.  <br/>
i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a choice <br/>
on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at this <br/>
location.  he continued to question me for about 5 minutes before i <br/>
was finally able to leave.  needless to say, i dont think i will go <br/>
back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>
problems.  but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to hide and <br/>
what do they think i would have tried to take from the cemetery?   <br/>
again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital itself.  <br/>
any thoughts from anyone???<br/>

<p><span>All I can think of is that they might have had vandals in the
past and would like to curb any preventable vandalism in the future. I haven’t
a clue as to what he thought you might have in the box but trying to remain
completely neutral – he might have thought you had spray paint or markers
or something to ruin grave markers with. He was going on the “info”
that you had been reported as being inside the cemetery so would have thought
the box came from it. I am actually quite impressed that someone reported “suspicious
behavior” as most people don’t even bother to look twice. A cemetery
near my last residence was always being vandalized and it was quite
disheartening to see the damage. Besides being massively expensive to fix that
type damage. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <html><body><div>Well I find that very interesting too!  The history of that location gives me the creeps just thinking about it, and then to think that they were so protective is just bizarre!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I remember, the hospital was a prison before it was an insane asylum, right?  And of course, now it is part prison and part mental hospital.  So there are probably inmates buried there as well as patients.  Hmmm... somehow the thought of the patients has always been more unsettling to me, maybe because RSH was known for the experimentation they did on mental patients many years ago.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It really does seem odd that the state would send security guards 4 or 5 miles to check out suspicious activity instead of just calling local law enforcement to check it out.  It IS, after all, JUST an old cemetery, right?  Maybe you could have gotten away with telling him you were doing research about your long-lost great-uncle who was rumored among the family to have died while at Rusk State Hospital, alone and rejected by his unenlightened family.  Don't know how you could've explained the box, except that it was part of a hobby you are involved with.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It reminds me of a facility SJZ noticed in Denton awhile back.  She mentioned it to me on a visit last year and about how they have armed guards at the gate, so she and I went and tried to enter just to see what they would do.  Sure enough, when a car approaches the outer perimeter of the property, two armed guards exit the guard shack with their hands on their guns, and they turn you away in no uncertain terms.  We tried being innocent hicks and asking what the building was, but all they would tell us was it was a federal facility.  I finally did enough research to find out it was listed as a FEMA clearing house.  Now WHAT could they keep at a FEMA facility that was that sensitive???  I figure after that incident I (we were in my car) am probably on a federal watch list somewhere!

<div>If I remember, the hospital was a prison before it was an insane asylum,

<div>It reminds me of a facility SJZ noticed in Denton awhile back.  She

<p>well, in a year and a half that i have been boxing, i have never had 
    <br/>an incident like i had this past sunday when i was placing my 
    <br/>october series. i had my boxes ready to go and knew where i wanted 
    <br/>to place the october series plus two others that i had come up with 
    <br/>that seemed appropriate to the halloween series. so, sunday morning 
    <br/>i got up and left the house at around 7:30 am to beat the heat. my 
    <br/>first stop was at the rusk state hospital cemetery near my house. i 
    <br/>had heard a couple of haunted tales about this cemetery and thought 
    <br/>what a great place to place a box. i had been to this cemetery 
    <br/>before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock on it, 
    <br/>but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of the 
    <br/>cemetery without trespassing across state property. now first of 
    <br/>all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a green sign 
    <br/>on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery. i also 
    <br/>should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at rusk 
    <br/>state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when they 
    <br/>died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that went 
    <br/>by, but thought nothing of it. so then i started looking around for 
    <br/>a good place to put the box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>the 
    "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of underbrush/briars. <br/>well all of 
    a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a security <br/>guard from rsh got 
    out and started questioning me and telling me <br/>that i had been reported 
    as being inside the cemetery (that would <br/>mean that i had crossed over 
    the gate) he noticed the box in my <br/>hand, which was taped up with black 
    duct tape, and asked me what i <br/>had taken from the cemetery. i told him 
    that i had just been <br/>looking around to see what was there, and assured 
    him that i had not <br/>crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no 
    trespassing" <br/>sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a 
    hobby of <br/>mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my 
    trunk. <br/>i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a 
    choice <br/>on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at this 
    <br/>location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes before i 
    <br/>was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i will go 
    <br/>back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same 
    <br/>problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to hide and 
    <br/>what do they think i would have tried to take from the cemetery? 
    <br/>again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital itself. <br/>any

&gt; &gt; well to add to the mystery, i had been doing some research about <br/>
an <br/>

&gt; appears that now it is not accessible by any means unless you go <br/>
on <br/>

let <br/>

that <br/>

&gt; maybe that is what they are hiding and afraid of someone digging <br/>

&gt; probably did have a little bit of a guilty conscience, since about <br/>
2 <br/>
&gt; years ago, my friend joan and i did actually go over the fence to <br/>
&gt; explore (yes i am older and wiser now).  the thing that got me <br/>
back <br/>
&gt; then was how many babies are buried there.  you cant see any <br/>

&gt; &gt;       Well I find that very interesting too!  The history of <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; location gives me the creeps just thinking about it, and then to <br/>
&gt; think that they were so protective is just bizarre!<br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   If I remember, the hospital was a prison before it was an <br/>
insane <br/>
&gt; asylum, right?  And of course, now it is part prison and part <br/>
mental <br/>
&gt; hospital.  So there are probably inmates buried there as well as <br/>
&gt; patients.  Hmmm... somehow the thought of the patients has always <br/>
&gt; been more unsettling to me, maybe because RSH was known for the <br/>
&gt; experimentation they did on mental patients many years ago. <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   It really does seem odd that the state would send security <br/>
guards <br/>
&gt; 4 or 5 miles to check out suspicious activity instead of just <br/>
calling <br/>
&gt; local law enforcement to check it out.  It IS, after all, JUST an <br/>
old <br/>
&gt; cemetery, right?  Maybe you could have gotten away with telling <br/>
him <br/>
&gt; you were doing research about your long-lost great-uncle who was <br/>
&gt; rumored among the family to have died while at Rusk State <br/>
Hospital, <br/>
&gt; alone and rejected by his unenlightened family.  Don't know how <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; could've explained the box, except that it was part of a hobby you <br/>
&gt; are involved with. <br/>
&gt; &gt;    <br/>
&gt; &gt;   It reminds me of a facility SJZ noticed in Denton awhile <br/>
back.  <br/>
&gt; She mentioned it to me on a visit last year and about how they <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; armed guards at the gate, so she and I went and tried to enter <br/>
just <br/>
&gt; to see what they would do.  Sure enough, when a car approaches the <br/>
&gt; outer perimeter of the property, two armed guards exit the guard <br/>
&gt; shack with their hands on their guns, and they turn you away in no <br/>
&gt; uncertain terms.  We tried being innocent hicks and asking what <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; building was, but all they would tell us was it was a federal <br/>
&gt; facility.  I finally did enough research to find out it was listed <br/>
as <br/>
&gt; a FEMA clearing house.  Now WHAT could they keep at a FEMA <br/>
facility <br/>
&gt; that was that sensitive???  I figure after that incident I (we <br/>
were <br/>
&gt; in my car) am probably on a federal watch list somewhere! <br/>

&gt; well, in a year and a half that i have been boxing, i have never <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; &gt; an incident like i had this past sunday when i was placing my <br/>
&gt; &gt; october series. i had my boxes ready to go and knew where i <br/>
wanted <br/>
&gt; &gt; to place the october series plus two others that i had come up <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; &gt; that seemed appropriate to the halloween series. so, sunday <br/>
morning <br/>
&gt; &gt; i got up and left the house at around 7:30 am to beat the heat. <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; first stop was at the rusk state hospital cemetery near my <br/>
house. i <br/>
&gt; &gt; had heard a couple of haunted tales about this cemetery and <br/>
thought <br/>
&gt; &gt; what a great place to place a box. i had been to this cemetery <br/>
&gt; &gt; before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock on <br/>
&gt; it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; cemetery without trespassing across state property. now first of <br/>
&gt; &gt; all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a green <br/>
sign <br/>
&gt; &gt; on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery. i also <br/>
&gt; &gt; should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at rusk <br/>
&gt; &gt; state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when they <br/>
&gt; &gt; died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that <br/>
went <br/>
&gt; &gt; by, but thought nothing of it. so then i started looking around <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; &gt; a good place to put the box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>
&gt; &gt; the "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of underbrush/briars. <br/>
&gt; &gt; well all of a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a security <br/>
&gt; &gt; guard from rsh got out and started questioning me and telling me <br/>
&gt; &gt; that i had been reported as being inside the cemetery (that <br/>
would <br/>
&gt; &gt; mean that i had crossed over the gate) he noticed the box in my <br/>
&gt; &gt; hand, which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me what <br/>
i <br/>
&gt; &gt; had taken from the cemetery. i told him that i had just been <br/>
&gt; &gt; looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i had <br/>
&gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no <br/>
trespassing" <br/>
&gt; &gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a hobby of <br/>
&gt; &gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my <br/>
trunk. <br/>
&gt; &gt; i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a <br/>
choice <br/>
&gt; &gt; on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at this <br/>
&gt; &gt; location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes before <br/>
i <br/>
&gt; &gt; was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i will <br/>
go <br/>
&gt; &gt; back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>
&gt; &gt; problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to hide <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; what do they think i would have tried to take from the cemetery? <br/>
&gt; &gt; again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital itself. <br/>
&gt; &gt; any thoughts from anyone???<br/>

The history of that <br/>location gives me the creeps just thinking about it, and then to <br/>think that they were so protective is just bizarre!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
 If I remember, the hospital was a prison before it was an insane <br/>asylum, right? And of course, now it is part prison and part mental <br/>hospital. So there are probably inmates buried there as well as <br/>patients. Hmmm... somehow the thought of the patients has always <br/>been more unsettling to me, maybe because RSH was known for the <br/>experimentation they did on mental patients many years ago. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It really does seem odd that the state would send security guards <br/>4 or 5 miles to check out suspicious activity instead of just calling <br/>local law enforcement to check it out. It IS, after all, JUST an old <br/>cemetery, right? Maybe you could have gotten away with telling him <br/>you were doing research about your long-lost great-uncle who was <br/>rumored among the family to have died while at Rusk State Hospital, <br/>alone and rejected by his unenlightened family. Don't know how you <br/>could've explained the box, except that it was part of a hobby
 you <br/>are involved with. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It reminds me of a facility SJZ noticed in Denton awhile back. <br/>She mentioned it to me on a visit last year and about how they have <br/>armed guards at the gate, so she and I went and tried to enter just <br/>to see what they would do. Sure enough, when a car approaches the <br/>outer perimeter of the property, two armed guards exit the guard <br/>shack with their hands on their guns, and they turn you away in no <br/>uncertain terms. We tried being innocent hicks and asking what the <br/>building was, but all they would tell us was it was a federal <br/>facility. I finally did enough research to find out it was listed as <br/>a FEMA clearing house. Now WHAT could they keep at a FEMA facility <br/>that was that sensitive??? I figure after that incident I (we were <br/>in my car) am probably on a federal watch list somewhere! <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/></span></div> <div><span class="e" id="q_11566402cd6cca56_3">&gt; On 10/2/07, tigger32167

 "main" road, and has a green sign <br/>&gt; on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery. i also <br/>&gt; should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at rusk <br/>&gt; state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when they <br/>&gt; died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that went <br/>&gt; by, but thought nothing of it. so then i started looking around for <br/>&gt; a good place to put the box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>&gt; the "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of underbrush/briars. <br/>&gt; well all of a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a security <br/>&gt; guard from rsh got out and started questioning me and telling me <br/>&gt; that i had been reported as being inside the cemetery (that would <br/>&gt; mean that i had crossed over the gate) he noticed the box in my <br/>&gt; hand, which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me what i <br/>&gt; had taken from the cemetery. i told him that i had
 just been <br/>&gt; looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i had <br/>not <br/>&gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no trespassing" <br/>&gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a hobby of <br/>&gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my trunk. <br/>&gt; i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a choice <br/>&gt; on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at this <br/>&gt; location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes before i <br/>&gt; was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i will go <br/>&gt; back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>&gt; problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to hide and <br/>&gt; what do they think i would have tried to take from the cemetery? <br/>&gt; again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital itself. <br/>&gt; any thoughts from anyone???<br/>&gt; jb<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

 been <br/>&gt; &gt; looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i had <br/>&gt; not <br/>&gt; &gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no <br/>trespassing" <br/>&gt; &gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a hobby of <br/>&gt; &gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my <br/>trunk. <br/>&gt; &gt; i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a <br/>choice <br/>&gt; &gt; on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at this <br/>&gt; &gt; location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes before <br/>i <br/>&gt; &gt; was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i will <br/>go <br/>&gt; &gt; back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>&gt; &gt; problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to hide <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; what do they think i would have tried to take from the cemetery? <br/>&gt; &gt; again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the

&gt; &gt; &gt; well to add to the mystery, i had been doing some research <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; an <br/>
&gt; &gt; old prison cemetery that i saw on a map for the rusk prison. it <br/>
&gt; &gt; appears that now it is not accessible by any means unless you go <br/>
&gt; on <br/>
&gt; &gt; prison grounds. apparently there used to be a public road that <br/>
&gt; let <br/>
&gt; &gt; people into it. a friend of mine who used to work at rsh said <br/>
&gt; that <br/>
&gt; &gt; the rsh cemetery used to be open...but mike i agree with you <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe that is what they are hiding and afraid of someone digging <br/>
&gt; &gt; up...but i dont think my freedom is worth finding out. i guess i <br/>
&gt; &gt; probably did have a little bit of a guilty conscience, since <br/>
about <br/>
&gt; 2 <br/>
&gt; &gt; years ago, my friend joan and i did actually go over the fence <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; explore (yes i am older and wiser now). the thing that got me <br/>
&gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; then was how many babies are buried there. you cant see any <br/>
&gt; &gt; tombstones from the gate but there are plenty of ground level <br/>
&gt; &gt; stones...i dont know<br/>

&gt; &gt; well, in a year and a half that i have been boxing, i have never <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; an incident like i had this past sunday when i was placing my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; october series. i had my boxes ready to go and knew where i <br/>
&gt; wanted <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to place the october series plus two others that i had come up <br/>
&gt; with <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that seemed appropriate to the halloween series. so, sunday <br/>
&gt; morning <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i got up and left the house at around 7:30 am to beat the <br/>
heat. <br/>
&gt; my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; first stop was at the rusk state hospital cemetery near my <br/>
&gt; house. i <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had heard a couple of haunted tales about this cemetery and <br/>
&gt; thought <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what a great place to place a box. i had been to this cemetery <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery without trespassing across state property. now first <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a green <br/>
&gt; sign <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery. i <br/>
also <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at <br/>
rusk <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when <br/>
they <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that <br/>
&gt; went <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by, but thought nothing of it. so then i started looking <br/>
around <br/>
&gt; for <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a good place to put the box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of <br/>
underbrush/briars. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well all of a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a <br/>
security <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guard from rsh got out and started questioning me and telling <br/>
me <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that i had been reported as being inside the cemetery (that <br/>
&gt; would <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mean that i had crossed over the gate) he noticed the box in <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hand, which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me <br/>
what <br/>
&gt; i <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; had taken from the cemetery. i told him that i had just been <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i <br/>
had <br/>
&gt; &gt; not <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no <br/>
&gt; trespassing" <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a hobby <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my <br/>
&gt; trunk. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a <br/>
&gt; choice <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at <br/>
this <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes <br/>
before <br/>
&gt; i <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i <br/>
will <br/>
&gt; go <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to <br/>
hide <br/>
&gt; and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; what do they think i would have tried to take from the <br/>
cemetery? <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital <br/>
itself. <br/>

 haunted tales about this cemetery and <br/>&gt; thought <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what a great place to place a box. i had been to this cemetery <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock <br/>on <br/>&gt; &gt; it, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery without trespassing across state property. now first <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a green <br/>&gt; sign <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery. i <br/>also <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at <br/>rusk <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when <br/>they <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that <br/>&gt; went <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by, but thought nothing of it. so then i started looking <br/>around <br/>&gt; for <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a
 good place to put the box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of <br/>underbrush/briars. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; well all of a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a <br/>security <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guard from rsh got out and started questioning me and telling <br/>me <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that i had been reported as being inside the cemetery (that <br/>&gt; would <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mean that i had crossed over the gate) he noticed the box in <br/>my <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand, which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me <br/>what <br/>&gt; i <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had taken from the cemetery. i told him that i had just been <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i <br/>had <br/>&gt; &gt; not <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no <br/>&gt; trespassing" <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a hobby <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my <br/>&gt; trunk. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a <br/>&gt; choice <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at <br/>this <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes <br/>before <br/>&gt; i <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i <br/>will <br/>&gt; go <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to <br/>hide <br/>&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what do they think i would have tried to take from the <br/>cemetery? <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital <br/>itself. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any thoughts from anyone???<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; jb<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;

I guess that phrase could be open for argument with a gung-ho cemetery <br/>
guard. I've only been questioned once, and I said I was visiting a <br/>
family grave and pointed across the cemetery to where I thought the box <br/>
was going to be located. However, my "prepared answer" is that I'm <br/>
researching my family geneology and I'd been told that some family <br/>
graves may be located in "this" cemetery. That gives me to opportunity <br/>
to wander around without raising suspicion; at least it shouldn't get <br/>
me arrested!<br/>

<br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; building was, but all they would tell us was it was a federal <br/>&gt; &gt; facility. I finally did enough research to find out it was <br/>listed <br/>&gt; as <br/>&gt; &gt; a FEMA clearing house. Now WHAT could they keep at a FEMA 
<br/>&gt; facility <br/>&gt; &gt; that was that sensitive??? I figure after that incident I (we <br/>&gt; were <br/>&gt; &gt; in my car) am probably on a federal watch list somewhere! <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; october series. i had my boxes ready to go and knew where i <br/>&gt; wanted <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to place the october series plus two others that i had come up <br/>&gt; with <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that seemed appropriate to the halloween series. so, sunday 
<br/>&gt; morning <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i got up and left the house at around 7:30 am to beat the <br/>heat. <br/>&gt; my <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; first stop was at the rusk state hospital cemetery near my <br/>&gt; house. i <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had heard a couple of haunted tales about this cemetery and 
<br/>&gt; thought <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what a great place to place a box. i had been to this cemetery <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock <br/>on <br/>&gt; &gt; it, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of the 
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery without trespassing across state property. now first <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a green <br/>&gt; sign <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on the road and an archway sign going into the cemetery. i 
<br/>also <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; should tell you that the cemetery is for people who were at <br/>rusk <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; state hospital who had no family to claim their bodies when <br/>they <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did notice a car that 
<br/>&gt; went <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; by, but thought nothing of it. so then i started looking <br/>around <br/>&gt; for <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a good place to put the box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the "woods" next to the cemetery had a lot of 
<br/>underbrush/briars. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; well all of a sudden, a security vehicle drove up and a <br/>security <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; guard from rsh got out and started questioning me and telling <br/>me <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that i had been reported as being inside the cemetery (that 
<br/>&gt; would <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mean that i had crossed over the gate) he noticed the box in <br/>my <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand, which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me <br/>what <br/>&gt; i <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had taken from the cemetery. i told him that i had just been 
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i <br/>had <br/>&gt; &gt; not <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no <br/>&gt; trespassing" <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the box was a hobby 
<br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten the box out of my <br/>&gt; trunk. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; i did show him the box and its contents (he didnt give me a <br/>&gt; choice <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on this) but i made no mention of my wanting to plant it at 
<br/>this <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; location. he continued to question me for about 5 minutes <br/>before <br/>&gt; i <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was finally able to leave. needless to say, i dont think i <br/>will <br/>&gt; go <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; back and place a box there for anyone else to have the same 
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problems. but i do have to wonder, what are they trying to <br/>hide <br/>&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; what do they think i would have tried to take from the <br/>cemetery? <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital 
<br/>itself. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; any thoughts from anyone???<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; jb<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;

&gt; &gt;   That is what I was talking about. You may have<br/>
&gt; to visit the<br/>
&gt; &gt; hospital and find out when you can visit the<br/>
&gt; cemetery, but they<br/>
&gt; &gt; can't deny you access. Of course, if you placed a<br/>
&gt; box there,<br/>
&gt; &gt; potential finders would also have to find out when<br/>
&gt; the gates are<br/>
&gt; &gt; open for visitation. The phrase "only for purposes<br/>
&gt; usually<br/>
&gt; &gt; associated with cemetery visits" certainly applies<br/>
&gt; to letterboxing,<br/>
&gt; &gt; doesn't it? That's the only reason I normally<br/>
&gt; visit cemeteries.<br/>

&gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; old prison cemetery that i saw on a map for<br/>
&gt; the rusk prison. it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appears that now it is not accessible by any<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prison grounds. apparently there used to be a<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; let<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people into it. a friend of mine who used to<br/>

&gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2<br/>

&gt; thing that got me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then was how many babies are buried there. you<br/>
&gt; cant see any<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I find that very interesting too! The<br/>
&gt; history of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location gives me the creeps just thinking<br/>
&gt; about it, and then to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that they were so protective is just<br/>
&gt; bizarre!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I remember, the hospital was a prison<br/>
&gt; before it was an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; insane<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; asylum, right? And of course, now it is part<br/>
&gt; prison and part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mental<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hospital. So there are probably inmates buried<br/>
&gt; there as well as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patients. Hmmm... somehow the thought of the<br/>
&gt; patients has always<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been more unsettling to me, maybe because RSH<br/>
&gt; was known for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experimentation they did on mental patients<br/>
&gt; many years ago.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It really does seem odd that the state would<br/>
&gt; send security<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guards<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4 or 5 miles to check out suspicious activity<br/>
&gt; instead of just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; calling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; local law enforcement to check it out. It IS,<br/>
&gt; after all, JUST an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery, right? Maybe you could have gotten<br/>
&gt; away with telling<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you were doing research about your long-lost<br/>

  &gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] getting busted<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Well I find that very interesting too! The 
  history of <br/>that <br/>&gt; location gives me the creeps just thinking about 
  it, and then to <br/>&gt; think that they were so protective is just 
  bizarre!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; If I remember, the hospital was a prison 
  before it was an <br/>insane <br/>&gt; asylum, right? And of course, now it is 
  part prison and part <br/>mental <br/>&gt; hospital. So there are probably 
  inmates buried there as well as <br/>&gt; patients. Hmmm... somehow the thought 
  of the patients has always <br/>&gt; been more unsettling to me, maybe because 
  RSH was known for the <br/>&gt; experimentation they did on mental patients 
  many years ago. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; It really does seem odd that the 
  state would send security <br/>guards <br/>&gt; 4 or 5 miles to check out 
  suspicious activity instead of just <br/>calling <br/>&gt; local law enforcement 
  to check it out. It IS, after all, JUST an <br/>old <br/>&gt; cemetery, right? 
  Maybe you could have gotten away with telling <br/>him <br/>&gt; you were doing 
  research about your long-lost great-uncle who was <br/>&gt; rumored among the 
  family to have died while at Rusk State <br/>Hospital, <br/>&gt; alone and 
  rejected by his unenlightened family. Don't know how <br/>you <br/>&gt; could've 
  explained the box, except that it was part of a hobby you <br/>&gt; are 
  involved with. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; It reminds me of a facility SJZ 
  noticed in Denton awhile <br/>back. <br/>&gt; She mentioned it to me on a visit 
  last year and about how they <br/>have <br/>&gt; armed guards at the gate, so 
  she and I went and tried to enter <br/>just <br/>&gt; to see what they would do. 
  Sure enough, when a car approaches the <br/>&gt; outer perimeter of the 
  property, two armed guards exit the guard <br/>&gt; shack with their hands on 
  their guns, and they turn you away in no <br/>&gt; uncertain terms. We tried 
  being innocent hicks and asking what <br/>the <br/>&gt; building was, but all 
  they would tell us was it was a federal <br/>&gt; facility. I finally did 
  enough research to find out it was listed <br/>as <br/>&gt; a FEMA clearing 
  house. Now WHAT could they keep at a FEMA <br/>facility <br/>&gt; that was that 
  sensitive??? I figure after that incident I (we <br/>were <br/>&gt; in my car) 
  am probably on a federal watch list somewhere! <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt;

  <br/>&gt; well, in a year and a half that i have been boxing, i have never 
  <br/>had <br/>&gt; &gt; an incident like i had this past sunday when i was 
  placing my <br/>&gt; &gt; october series. i had my boxes ready to go and knew 
  where i <br/>wanted <br/>&gt; &gt; to place the october series plus two others 
  that i had come up <br/>with <br/>&gt; &gt; that seemed appropriate to the 
  halloween series. so, sunday <br/>morning <br/>&gt; &gt; i got up and left the 
  house at around 7:30 am to beat the heat. <br/>my <br/>&gt; &gt; first stop was 
  at the rusk state hospital cemetery near my <br/>house. i <br/>&gt; &gt; had 
  heard a couple of haunted tales about this cemetery and <br/>thought <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; what a great place to place a box. i had been to this cemetery <br/>&gt; 
  &gt; before and knew that it was fenced in with a gate with a lock on <br/>&gt; 
  it, <br/>&gt; &gt; but also knew that i could place the box on the outside of 
  the <br/>&gt; &gt; cemetery without trespassing across state property. now 
  first of <br/>&gt; &gt; all, this cemetery is right on a "main" road, and has a 
  green <br/>sign <br/>&gt; &gt; on the road and an archway sign going into the 
  cemetery. i also <br/>&gt; &gt; should tell you that the cemetery is for people 
  who were at rusk <br/>&gt; &gt; state hospital who had no family to claim their 
  bodies when they <br/>&gt; &gt; died. as i was at the trunk of my car, i did 
  notice a car that <br/>went <br/>&gt; &gt; by, but thought nothing of it. so 
  then i started looking around <br/>for <br/>&gt; &gt; a good place to put the 
  box. i was having difficulty, because <br/>&gt; &gt; the "woods" next to the 
  cemetery had a lot of underbrush/briars. <br/>&gt; &gt; well all of a sudden, a 
  security vehicle drove up and a security <br/>&gt; &gt; guard from rsh got out 
  and started questioning me and telling me <br/>&gt; &gt; that i had been 
  reported as being inside the cemetery (that <br/>would <br/>&gt; &gt; mean that 
  i had crossed over the gate) he noticed the box in my <br/>&gt; &gt; hand, 
  which was taped up with black duct tape, and asked me what <br/>i <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  had taken from the cemetery. i told him that i had just been <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  looking around to see what was there, and assured him that i had <br/>&gt; not 
  <br/>&gt; &gt; crossed over the gate...by the way, there isn't a "no 
  <br/>trespassing" <br/>&gt; &gt; sign anywhere near. i then explained that the 
  box was a hobby of <br/>&gt; &gt; mine, and while i was stopped i had gotten 
  the box out of my <br/>trunk. <br/>&gt; &gt; i did show him the box and its 
  contents (he didnt give me a <br/>choice <br/>&gt; &gt; on this) but i made no 
  mention of my wanting to plant it at this <br/>&gt; &gt; location. he continued 
  to question me for about 5 minutes before <br/>i <br/>&gt; &gt; was finally able 
  to leave. needless to say, i dont think i will <br/>go <br/>&gt; &gt; back and 
  place a box there for anyone else to have the same <br/>&gt; &gt; problems. but 
  i do have to wonder, what are they trying to hide <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; what 
  do they think i would have tried to take from the cemetery? <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  again, the cemetery is about 4-5 miles from the hospital itself. <br/>&gt; &gt; 
  any thoughts from anyone???<br/>&gt; &gt; jb<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt;
