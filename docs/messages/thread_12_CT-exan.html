                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, y'all, and thanks for the invite! Like SilentDoug and a couple <br>
others, we're not Texans but love to follow other regional <br>
letterboxing lists. Each one takes on a flavor of its own, and <br>
everyone knows a Texas board is bound to be FUN.<br>
<br>
Although we don't live in the Great State, we do have an ongoing love <br>
affair with Austin, visiting several times for the music scene and <br>
the bats. My Dad's favorite "war story" from WWII didn't involve his <br>
many missions in bombers over Europe, but rather an adventure he had <br>
at Kelly Field outside of San Antonio. A navigator, he was in TX to <br>
get training on a new bombsight when a hurricane threatened the base. <br>
All the qualified aviators were ordered to fly the aircraft out of <br>
the way of the storm, and his crew didn't have a specific assignment <br>
on where to go. So they flew to my grandfather's ranch in California, <br>
stayed a week entertaining the local girls, and were late getting <br>
back to Kelly. He would get tears in his eyes telling that story.<br>
<br>
For those that don't know us, we've been letterboxing since 1999 and <br>
have a pretty high "PFX" count as a result. We're also involved with <br>
the letterboxing.org website and wll be glad to help anyone with any <br>
questions or problems.<br>
<br>
Wish we could join you at the Gathering!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Welcome Jay & family, it is an honor to have you join us<br>
since I consider you one of the key players in this little<br>
hobby of ours.  I am awed by your PFX count, especially<br>
the P!  Having found one of your boxes in Colorado I<br>
know what a great carver you are, too.<br>
Maybe you could use your "pull" to get the Texas Clue<br>
Page corrected for us.  There are 4 boxes in Nueces County<br>
that are showing up in the Eastern Region instead of the <br>
Gulf Coast Region.  I think in the past when this happened,<br>
Wes just moved the misplaced county to the correct region <br>
and that fixed it.  I have contacted Wes several times<br>
about this but have not heard back.  I know he is busy<br>
and there are other more pressing things to fix, but<br>
since this is fairly minor I figured it could be done<br>
without too much trouble.  Texas is finally starting to<br>
get into letterboxing and I don't want anyone to be<br>
confused by clues being in the wrong place.  Any help<br>
you could give would be greatly appreciated.<br>
