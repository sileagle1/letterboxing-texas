    I had a great few hours in Waco/West to spend boxing today. I was
    early to meet the seller for the 5 tires I was buying (how did that
    happen) so I stopped in to the Tx Ranger Museum and then the nearby
    Oakwood Cemetery. All was well with those 4 boxes. Then on to West.
    I had never stopped there before. Always just drove on by going to
    or from DFW from Austin. The food is great and West is a neat little
    town. The box there was wet, however. The logbook was only damp so I
    was able to salvage and repair a little. Great stamp! After buying
    my tires I headed back to Waco and visited the college campus for a
    couple more boxes including the current Box of the Week and another
    nearby. Then I was running short of time so I just drove around
    checking locations - Cameron Park looks nice.  I stopped in quick to
    the Dr Pepper Museum. That place could use a stamp! I'll have to
    talk to them, see if they are interested in one in the gift shop,
    behind the counter, maybe.  The last location I checked on my way
    home was a little roadside park just south of Belton. There is a
    commemorative marker there and three lonely picnic tables. The area
    has been closed for some time now and seemingly abandoned. The sign
    at the entrance says No Vehicles and they mean it since there are
    large concrete blocks blocking the entrance but that is the only
    warning sign and there is plenty of room to park outside and walk
    in. Interesting place.<br/>
