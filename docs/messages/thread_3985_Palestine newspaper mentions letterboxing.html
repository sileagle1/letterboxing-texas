<p class="storyheadline">Dogwoods, letter boxing bring tourists
</p><div><span class="storycredit">By SUSAN COTTLE-LEONARD</span><br/><span>The Palestine Herald</span><br/></div>
<div><span>PALESTINE</span><span> —</span> <span>A visitor came into the office Wednesday wearing a big smile. “I just saw the first dogwood buds up by Athens” he said. “The trees aren't blooming yet, but I saw the buds.”<br/><br/>“Great, then it looks like the trees will be right on time for the Texas Dogwood Trails,” I replied. “Maybe they'll all bloom on March 20.”<br/><br/>Adding this type of visitor enthusiasm to the calls and inquires about the dogwoods, we know people come to our city to view the blossoms, and that these delicate, ethereal flowering trees and the festival they inspire draw a large number of visitors. <br/><br/>But here's a tourism draw you may not know about: “letter boxing.”<br/><br/>I first heard the term a few years ago from my son-in-law, Jeff, who lived in Corning, N.Y, and now lives in Colorado Springs, Colo. At the time, I assumed the activity was pursued by a small group of nature enthusiasts.<br/><br/>But when
 a local participant stopped by my office this week to tell be about letter boxing, I found the activity is going strong in Texas, and all over the country. <br/><br/>What is letter boxing, you ask? In brief, participants go to the Web site www.letterboxing.org, pick a state and area, then follow clues to the location of a hidden box which contains a tablet. The boxes are hidden at historic sites, natural areas, any place open to the public. <br/><br/>Each participant has a personal stamp, I'm told, and when they find the box, they stamp the tablet, along with a date and the name of their home town. <br/><br/>So, letter boxing is a treasure hunt, but the treasure is the experience of having fun with family or friends, following clues, seeing new sites, and learning about your own or other locations through the hunt.<br/><br/>I letter boxed with my daughter and granddaughter in Colorado Springs a few years ago, my only personal experience with the activity. We
 followed clues from the Internet, starting at The Garden of the Gods Park, a beautiful natural area, and continuing to follow clues until we finally found the letter box, hidden securely in a small crevice of a rocky slope.<br/><br/>It was a nice hike, and an opportunity to explore the city's natural beauty with my family. <br/><br/>As a bonus, letter boxing is relatively inexpensive, unless you want to pursue overseas clues, and it's a family-oriented activity, suitable for all age groups.<br/><br/>A few tourists have come to the Visitor Center looking for the next clue, and I now find that there are many more “treasure hunters” we never see. Evidently boxes are hidden all over the area, with a large number hidden at local historic and natural sites in and around Palestine, offering one more activity for our visitors, a different way to see the sites. <br/><br/>My letter boxing contact said also said many people plan vacations based on this activity. Who
 knew? <br/><br/>For more information, check out www.letterboxing.com and www..atlasquest.com. Some locations are on both sites and some are listed on only one. <br/><br/>Geo-caching is a similar pursuit, but we'll save that for another column. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in the office, we are on our own quest: bringing visitors to Palestine by promoting some of our biggest and best events of the year, the upcoming Texas Dogwood Trails Celebration the last two weekends of March and first weekend of April (including a long list of varied fun-filled events), and the Texas Music Awards Show, April 26, which will include pre-show events that weekend.<br/><br/>Featuring a concert by Michael Martin Murphey, and including the talent of the Texas Music Award nominees, the TMA Show will offer fantastic entertainment.<br/><br/>One major way we spread the word to potential visitors is by advertising, and you can check out the March issue of Texas Monthly to see our Palestine
 Travel Ad, geared to spring visitation. <br/><br/>Additonal advertising promotions appear in Texas Highways, Festivals of Texas and County Line Magazine.<br/><br/>Please stop by the Visitor Depot, or call, for tourism information, including attractions, events, maps, group assistance, meeting planning and booking of the Civic Center and Carnegie Building. We provide local, regional and state information. See www.VisitPalestine.com for upcoming events and additional information.<br/><br/>And please let us know about your group's tourism-related event so we can place it on the calendar and help with promotion. <br/><br/>The Palestine Visitor Center, 825 Spring Street, is open daily 8 a.m. to 5 p.m.; Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.; Sundays, noon to 4 p..m., with the exception of holiday weekends. <br/><br/><br/><br/><b>Upcoming Events:</b><br/><br/>â€¢ Saturday — “Embrace the Arts” Presents Art at the Museum - “Color Me Spring”: The March exhibit features the

 dogwoods, we know people come to our city to view the blossoms, and <br/>&gt; that these delicate, ethereal flowering trees and the festival they <br/>&gt; inspire draw a large number of visitors.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; But here's a tourism draw you may not know about: “letter boxing.”<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I first heard the term a few years ago from my son-in-law, Jeff, who <br/>&gt; lived in Corning, N.Y, and now lives in Colorado Springs, Colo.
