I just got back from Kansas City and have spent the last two hours <br/>
being entertained by all the great postings on this list.  I boxed <br/>
through OK and KS and on the way back.......stamped in the <br/>
Celticlions' Eisenhower-The Green Ash Tree as my 100th find!  <br/>
Wheeeeee!!<br/>
<br/>
As most of my finds were in TX , I just want to thank all of you who <br/>
have planted in our fair state.  You have given me a year's worth of <br/>
great journeys, new experiences, and an outlet for curiousity!<br/>
<br/>
Now, it's time for a new logbook and on to the next 100!<br/>
