more responses, but I must say that I agree with everything BL said.  <br/>
So, for the record, I am for logbooks and will continue providing <br/>
them, if for no other reason than a letterbox should have something <br/>
resembling a letter in it.  Otherwise it would be a stampbox.  Thanks <br/>
to everyone voicing their opinion and hope you are having a fun <br/>
Halloween!<br/>

&gt; Anyway, Silver Eagle, I would still go find your boxes if you <br/>
decided to<br/>
&gt; quit using logbooks, but I wouldn't enjoy them as much, and I would <br/>
probably<br/>
&gt; not get around to logging online, although I would probably still <br/>
send you<br/>
&gt; an email.<br/>
