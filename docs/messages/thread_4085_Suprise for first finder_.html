<div></div>
<div>Usually the first finder's prize is some small sort of something, like a pin or a trinket of some sort. </div>
<div></div>
<div>In my opinion,boxes that truly call for a first finder's prizeare few and far between - as an example, I had a series I planted on scout camp a few years ago then placed in the wild when we were done with them at camp. I put a scout patch (most of which I had designed for various events) in each box as a first finder's prize. A FF prize should be something that strikes you as very fitting to the box...but this is all my opinion.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I appreciate the consideration folks use in placing a FF prize in a box - it's an added touch and an invitation to a finder. For myself though, unless it's something that really strikes me personally, I usually leave them in the box for the next finder who may be more inclined to collect trinkety type stuff. The box is prize enough for me...the effor the placer took to create a stamp and a logbook and to write good clues and to wrap it all up in a good container.<br/>
</div>
<div>If you choose to do a FF prize, remember that it is a gift given because you want to, not something you should feel obligated to do because it is expected of a placer.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I did once find a Snickers bar as a first finder's prize. In May. On a sunny afternoon. Nuff said...(but you had already thought of that).</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"
