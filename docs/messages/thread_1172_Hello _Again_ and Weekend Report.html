                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello.  I haven't been active for a while and I have recently changed<br/>
my "signature" name so I thought I would re-introduce myself to the<br/>
list. My name is Lou Catozzi and I live in Round Rock, Texas, north of<br/>
Austin. I used to use the name "TxHiPowr" to refer to my other hobby<br/>
of high powered model rocketry but I have recently changed to "PI Joe"<br/>
for letterboxing and geocaching.<br/>
<br/>
This past weekend I was in the Huntsville area caching and boxing and<br/>
just generally exploring the area. Friday afternoon and evening I was<br/>
at Huntsville State Park, Saturday I was hiking along the Lone Star<br/>
Hiking Trail network, and Sunday I was boxing and caching in the<br/>
Montgomery area. <br/>
<br/>
Here are my boxing results:<br/>
<br/>
Raven - Missing (I'm sure I found the right tree/stump)<br/>
Red Dragon - Missing (I'm sure I found the right stump)<br/>
Chop-Chop - Found<br/>
Steamboat Sam - Found<br/>
Star Buck - Found by stamp is broken in two - still usable.<br/>
Lone Star Hiker - Missing (I'm sure I found the right tree)<br/>
Ancient Sun Dancer - Found<br/>
Blue Northern - Found<br/>
Dragonfly - Not Found - I found the picnic tables but couldn't get any<br/>
further than that. Ran out of time.<br/>

<div>Lou, we were right behind you on Saturday. My 
husband made me quit after we couldn't find Lone Star Hiker so we only got 2 
boxes. That is the first time we walked in that area.. though we drive through 
Richards all the time on our way to Conroe. </div>

<div>We got Lone Star Start and Chop Chop. We spent an 
hour looking for Chop Chop behind every pine tree on the right hand side both of 
us thinking the other had checked that one pine and just as we were about to 
give up we found it. By then it was after 12 and we were cooked.</div>
