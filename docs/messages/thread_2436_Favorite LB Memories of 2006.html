<div>The Great Book Adventure - okay, it DID hit my logbook, but I was sitting here thinking about the mad, MAD scramble to get all those literary travelers.  Wasn't that fun?  And the storybook walk?  And all the clever games to play?  And Atoy Adventurers showing up in perfect costumes?  And the sugar rush Sunday morning?

<div> </div>
<div>Hueco Tanks - what about Mike's monumental effort to recover and replace those boxes?  And I loved seeing it all through his pictures.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The snake showdown while boxing with my sister-in-law at Livingston State Park and us dubbing Lightning "snake slayer" for the rest of the trip through the park.  He's sound asleep in the living room right now, and he doesn't look like a snake slayer at the moment!

<div> </div>
<div>The week Fearless Fox and Lightning were gone and I was alone, so I went letterboxing every evening.  </div>

<div><font size="2">Okay... I'll play!</font></div>
<div><font size="2">How about exactly one year ago when I saw the Texas Tour Bus had alluded me in Cleburne, but had resurfaced in Tatum? I loaded my letterboxing supplies, filled my Jeep with gas, and set my alarm for 2:30 a.m. I was on the road, driving through the eerie, empty streets of Dallas by 3:00 a.m. on my way to Martin Creek Lake State Park. I got there at 6:00 a.m. and snagged the Tour Bus right out from under Barefoot Lucy's clutches! (Sorry Lucy! I just couldn't help reminiscing! I know how you love that story.)</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The Rusk Event was great. Even the cool, rainy weather added to the fun and atmosphere as we gathered around the fireplace and exchanged stamps, stories and memories. I'm really sorry we overwhelmed Big Bertha and put her out of business though.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The Meese Meet at Lake Grapevine was the first mini gathering for the metroplex boxers. It was so cool that in addition to the local boxers, Dewberry, Silver Eagle and Running Rain could come up for it too. And I always love seeing Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket! And Gryzzled Gryphon - we have no idea where he actually calls home so I guess he's just "of Coryell County", but it was great seeing him again too. The Celtic Lions out did themselves planning this event.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">When I was in Nevada, I found one of Sierra Sally's boxes, so I was thrilled when she was in Arlington at a conference and Viewfinder and I had the opportunity to meet her for an exchange.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I think one of the best parts is all the fun messages I've received from people who have found my boxes or replied back to me when I reported finding their boxes. What a wonderful community of letterboxers! I received a message today from someone in Connecticut who had found a box I placed up there. It's on a rather difficult trail which is not really "hikable" in the winter. I was excited to hear that the weather was nice and sunny up there today and people were out boxing and enjoying themselves. It's really fun to think that all over the country, on any given day, there are letterboxers out there having fun!</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">2006 was a great letterboxing year.  My highlights:<br>
<br>
Spending so much wonderful one-on-one time with SoccerChik.  And <br>
hearing her tell a friend, "I can't go to the mall today.  I'm out <br>
having fun with my mom."  Knowing she'll be off to college in a <br>
couple of years, I'll treasure forever the time we've spent talking <br>
about our dreams, hopes for the future... and just plain ole' girl <br>
stuff.<br>
<br>
I learned to carve!  Practice, practice, practice... that and a <br>
really good light and a pair of very strong reading glasses to see <br>
the details!<br>
<br>
Letterboxing with my Mom in Galveston.  Dashing into a souvenir shop <br>
to buy umbrellas so we could keep letterboxing in the rain, only to <br>
have it stop as soon as we walked out of the store.  <br>
<br>
Losing a planted box for the first time... and getting unexpected <br>
help in replacing it.  (Thanks again Mike!)  Losing two more boxes, <br>
and learning how to be a better planter.<br>
<br>
Participating in my first postal ring, "All for August" (which <br>
continued into September, October, November and December!)  Checking <br>
my mailbox with excitment for each new box... then finally having my <br>
own little box return home and seeing all the stamps and comments.<br>
<br>
Attending the Great Book Adventure and meeting so many of the <br>
wonderful folks on this list!  Going to Snap, Crackle and Clues the <br>
next morning and boxing with Barefoot Lucy and Lightning.  Completely <br>
filling up my first personal log book!  Letterboxing gluttony!<br>
<br>
Meeting Runsforchocolate back out at Burroughs a couple of weeks <br>
later to finish up the boxes we couldn't get to at the gathering... <br>
fighting off the killer mosquitoes, then later enjoying that fabulous <br>
salsa at Los Cucos!<br>
<br>
Meeting Norasta and Guitarzan during their visit to Texas, and <br>
discovering Mercer Arboretum.  Can't believe I've lived in Houston <br>
for over 30 years and have never been there before!<br>
<br>
Playing Candy Land and overloading on sweet treats... including that <br>
Italian chocolate!<br>
<br>
2006 has been so much fun, I can't wait to see what 2007 will bring!<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Here are a few of mine:<br>
<br>
1.  Letterboxing in the snow with Baby Bear while our wives shopped <br>
in Lake Tahoe, then actually winning at craps.<br>
<br>
2.  Relaxing by the fire and talking with Barefoot Lucy, GG, and Sea <br>
Dove at the end of the Rusk Event, while drinking Bl's homemade Irish <br>
Cream!<br>
<br>
3.  Getting to letterbox in New England during our family vacation <br>
and actually finding a few new places to place boxes among the <br>
thousands already there.  It is always fun to receive notes from <br>
letterboxers thanking me for taking them to new places, but it is <br>
even more satisfying when the notes are from people that live there <br>
and discovered new places they had never been.<br>
<br>
4.  Putting together a spur-of-the-moment driving vacation through <br>
Oklahoma and Arkansas using letterboxes (some existing, some that I <br>
wanted to place) as my main guide.  Even my non-letterboxing family <br>
had a good time.<br>
<br>
5.  Watching my daughter Running Rain enjoy getting a special stamp <br>
at the Great Book Adventure Event for dressing up as Hermione.  It <br>
was also great to see Wanda again and finally meet Pete.  The whole <br>
Event was just incredible!<br>
<br>
6.  Squeezing in a couple hours between soccer games in Dallas to <br>
attend the Many Meese Mini-Event that was put on by Ruby Tuesday.  I <br>
am very grateful the metroboxers picked that weekend to hold the <br>
Event, knowing I would be in town.  I did not get to find many boxes, <br>
but getting to visit with all the people while eating moosicles and <br>
moose droppings was well worth it!<br>
<br>
7.  Discovering that Houston is the LB Capital of North America, and <br>
then placing a box in honor of all that made it happen.<br>
<br>
8.  Attending the Kiss From The Sugar Plum Fairy Event and reliving <br>
my childhood memories of playing Candy Land.  It was another great <br>
Event put on by Dewberry and MO5, and was a great ending to a great <br>
letterboxing year!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">New Year's Day always makes me want to box because that's the <br>
anniversary of our first find.  We are not prolific boxers due to <br>
time constraints (We seem to have a severe case of volunteer-itis) <br>
but we really enjoy finding or planting a box now and then.   I have <br>
forced myself to keep this as a fun and relaxing hobby and not get <br>
too hung up on the perfect logbook or record keeping system or <br>
scrapbook.  I still have the urge to go overboard in the organizing <br>
aspect of it all, but am fighting it successfully so far :).<br>
<br>
In 2006, we really enjoyed attending the GBA and finally getting to <br>
put faces with the trail names.   It was crazy and hectic and soo <br>
much fun!  I am trying hard to figure out a way to get us up to <br>
Somerville in March and avoid scout conflicts for that weekend.<br>
<br>
2006 was the year that I was able to work with the San Jacinto GS <br>
council to get boxing started at all the Council GS camps.  I've done <br>
some leader trainings at big training events and really enjoyed <br>
seeing the leaders enthusiasm for the sport.  It is really beginning <br>
to take off and now troops can safely box on camping weekends without <br>
fear of harming public boxes.   Some scout volunteers in this area <br>
are now starting to incorporate letterboxing into their Scout events <br>
(planting a temporary trail of boxes similar to the storybook trail <br>
at the GBA - My SIL Hibisue did this recently and it was a big <br>
success).  We still need a better way to distribute clues to leaders <br>
so that is something I'll work on in 07.<br>
<br>
My other goal for 07 is to plant more boxes (both public and GS <br>
boxes) and actually MAKE more time to get out there and box.  Here's <br>
to another year of fun!<br>

<br>
1) finally finding my 1,000th box.<br>
2) placing my 200th box<br>
3) not getting a fine from the National Park Service!!!!<br>
4) Finding boxes in TX, OK, AR, CA, and Canada<br>
5) I have to admit, looking for boxes in Lake Tahoe with Silver <br>
Eagle probably was the most memorable.  We spent hours digging in <br>
the snow trying to find the clue markers (while watching our time in <br>
order to get back to hotel before the wives finished their movie and <br>
shopping). <br>
6) All the unbelievable people that took time to care for my boxes <br>
in multiple states!!!!<br>
7) Finding "GW" box.<br>
8) Spending time at the Rusk event, around the a large fire, telling <br>
stories.  Along with the winery (never had wine out of a Dr Pepper <br>
barrel before) and the fish fry (all you can eat, Silver Eagle was <br>
in heaven, and even got to meet the cook!). <br>

<div>Some of my favorite letterboxing memories of 2006 include:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every letterboxing adventure with the Frye Team including being chased 
by dogs, coming across an area infested with ticks, almost being rescued by 
Boots Tex, being at the farthest most point from the car in Memorial Park when 
the sky opened and we got caught in a downpour!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Rusk Gathering in March - it was so much fun seeing old friends and 
meeting some new boxers, too!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Letterboxing in Arizona, California, Ohio ( three hours after I ran the 
Flying Pig Marathon!), Maine, and Massachusetts.  One of my favorite finds 
was the Easternmost Letterbox in the U.S. which was near the Quoddy Head 
Lighthouse in Lubec, Maine.  The views were absolutely beautiful up there 
on those cliffs overlooking the lighthouse!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Planting my first out of state letterbox in Arizona last April and having 
lots of people visit the box!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Playing the Houston Letterboxing Challenge in June...and winning!  
:)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Meeting and boxing with Sandibox in October and again playing Candyland 
with her in December.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Dewberry's Winter Wonderland Book Fair.  FINALLY! Some stamps that 
didn't require deciphering her nasty clues!!  :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Candyland event in December- what a great way to end the year 
surrounded by letterboxing friends...and then finding out the MO5's 5 year old 
son thought I was a teenager- too cool!</div>
