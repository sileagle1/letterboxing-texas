<div>I've received a couple of emails this week from people who looked for my Delaney Vineyards box who reported it had fallen down inside the tree. Blooming Flowers had generously offered to rescue it for me, but I'm going to be in Grapevine tomorrow, so I'll take care of it. But thanks, Janet! If anyone searched for it last week, it should be back in it's safe place by Sunday night.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, I had to revise the clues on four of my boxes in the McKinney/Sister Grove area this week due to changes in the landmarks noted in the clues. They are:</div>
<div>Kids' Games (Box #3), Folk Art Series: Quilting, Folk Art Series: Painting, and Wear Are the Letterboxes (Box #2). If anyone is planning to look for these boxes, you'd want to print out the revised clues first!</div>
