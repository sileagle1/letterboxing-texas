                    <html><body><div>I have just spent a most enjoyable evening. When I first got to work, I logged into AQ and told the people of my Quilt Block Swap Postal Ring that finally after waiting since March, I got my first package. It has 6 of the packs in it and a HH. This could be a bit overwhelming for a first time receipt of a postal. But, since this has been long anticipated, I'm going to take it one envelope at a time.</div> <div> </div> <div>Then I proceeded to read the posts from our group. I haven't been able to log on since Thursday night, so it was great being able to read about y'alls adventures this weekend.</div> <div> </div> <div>I had alot of fun reading what everyone loves about Texas. I had to print a few out. I'll be checking out the BBQ and the chocolate places for sure. </div> <div> </div> <div>Thank you all for an enjoyable evening (now, really, I'm going to work now. Well, I better check AQ first, then we'll see),</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet,
