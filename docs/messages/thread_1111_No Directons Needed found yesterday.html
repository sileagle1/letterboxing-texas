resist making a detour to find the LB left at the Nature Preserve by <br/>
Cadenza on her recent Texas visit, and it was worth the short hike in <br/>
the horrible heat to find it!  Ruby Tuesday was the first - and only <br/>
previous - finder (not even the elusive GG has been there yet!  Maybe <br/>
related to the fact that it was almost 100 degrees at 4:00 yesterday <br/>
afternoon while I was there?)  LB is in good shape, but I advise taking <br/>
a stick to poke under that rock - it's a little intimidating. -- <br/>
