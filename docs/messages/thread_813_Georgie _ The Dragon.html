We planted a little series today, Georgie & The Dragon, in the <br>
Montgomery County Nature Preserve, which is a beautiful greenway along <br>
Spring Creek.  No facilities, scant parking, just a trail that goes <br>
along a pond and down to the creek.  There are some rare plant <br>
species, lots of butterflies, dragonflies and damselflies, and birds <br>
galore. Oh, and at least one cottonmouth.  On a beautiful day like <br>
today, it made for a fun trip.  I'm sure it's miserable in the summer.<br>
<br>
The main trail is definitely stroller friendly up to the box, but the <br>
main loop that continues on past it I wouldn't classify as stroller-<br>
friendly.  However, TeamKing might be able to manage it. . .<br>
<br>
LBNA is acting nutty, so the clues are only on AtlasQuest right now.  <br>
Will add them to the lbna site later.<br>
