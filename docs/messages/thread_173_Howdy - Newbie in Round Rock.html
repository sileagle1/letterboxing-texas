have visited a couple boxes earlier that were also geocaches. This<br/>
past March I dropped in on the 1st Texas LB Gathering at Bastrop SP<br/>
and met quite a few of you although don't ask me to connect names with<br/>
faces!<br/>
   My family and I just purchased a travel trailer this Spring and we<br/>
went back to Bastrop over Memorial Day weekend where I introduced by<br/>
three sons (4,8, &amp; 10) to LB'ing. They like the gee-whiz hi-tech part<br/>
of geocaching but they also like the treasure-map and clues part of<br/>
boxing as well. <br/>
   We leave for a three-week trip to Colorado on Friday so we should<br/>
get to see quite a few new stamps and caches on this trip.<br/>
   Now, if I could just find a round tuit so I could start carving and<br/>
placing stamps!<br/>

I remember you from the gathering.  As I remember, you<br/>
are also interested in model rocketry (hence the name<br/>
TxHiPowr?).  <br/>
