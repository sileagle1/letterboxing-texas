qualifies for lurking or not!  I am TxHiPowr from Round Rock (just<br>
north of Austin) and I've been boxing since last September although I<br>
have visited a couple boxes earlier that were also geocaches. This<br>
past March I dropped in on the 1st Texas LB Gathering at Bastrop SP<br>
and met quite a few of you although don't ask me to connect names with<br>
faces!<br>
   My family and I just purchased a travel trailer this Spring and we<br>
went back to Bastrop over Memorial Day weekend where I introduced by<br>
three sons (4,8, & 10) to LB'ing. They like the gee-whiz hi-tech part<br>
of geocaching but they also like the treasure-map and clues part of<br>
boxing as well. <br>
   We leave for a three-week trip to Colorado on Friday so we should<br>
get to see quite a few new stamps and caches on this trip.<br>
   Now, if I could just find a round tuit so I could start carving and<br>
placing stamps!<br>

I remember you from the gathering.  As I remember, you<br>
are also interested in model rocketry (hence the name<br>
TxHiPowr?).  <br>
