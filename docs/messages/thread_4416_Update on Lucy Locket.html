<p><span>Hi letterboxing family. Just wanted to give you an
update on LL. She's  probably not going home today. It appears there
was a LOT of venom injected. There is still a lot of swelling in the
hand, but it begin to get better about 1 AM.  Hopefully will talk to the
doctor today and find out when she will get released. Although, she is looking
better this morning. We give the Lord praise for bringing her through all
of this. So glad we were not too far down the trail when this
happened!  Bell Motel...sorry for leaving your box exposed. I am
hopeing someone found it and put it back in it's place. Just curious, did
anyone stamp in LL's box after we left? That's where she got bit. I heard there

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so glad to hear LL will be ok.  The rest of the Event just wasn't the same without y'all and we were all thinking of you.<br/>
<br/>
After Barefoot Lucy told us what happened, I warned everyone not already on the trails to be careful, then Baby Bear and I went to try and find the snake so it could be identified.  Someone had your backpack and the clues to Bell Motel's box, so we assumed that was the location LL got bit.  When we did not find the box, we went to LL's box and found Bell Motel's there.  We pulled both out, not realizing THIS was the home of the snake, but luckily did not see him.  We replaced both boxes and retrieved LL's logbook that was laying on the ground.  Further down the trail we ran into Rogers 7, who had not heard about the snake bite.  Just minutes after warning them, they found a Copperhead next to the box they were getting.  So LL can take some comfort in knowing she probably saved the rest of us from further mishap.<br/>
<br/>
Special thanks to Barefoot Lucy, Fearless Fox and everyone else who<br/>
helped get through this scary situation.  We really are a family, and it was never more apparent.<br/>

&gt; Hi letterboxing family. Just wanted to give you an update on LL. She's <br/>
&gt; probably not going home today. It appears there was a LOT of venom<br/>
&gt; injected. There is still a lot of swelling in the hand, but it begin to<br/>
&gt; get better about 1 AM.  Hopefully will talk to the doctor today and find<br/>
&gt; out when she will get released. Although, she is looking better this<br/>
&gt; morning. We give the Lord praise for bringing her through all of this.<br/>
&gt; So glad we were not too far down the trail when this happened!  Bell<br/>
&gt; Motel...sorry for leaving your box exposed. I am hopeing someone found<br/>
&gt; it and put it back in it's place. Just curious, did anyone stamp in LL's<br/>
&gt; box after we left? That's where she got bit. I heard there were several<br/>
&gt; more snakes spotted yesterday. So thankful no one else got biten.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; THANK-YOU ALL for your prayers! Please continue to pray for her she<br/>
&gt; needs it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks to Barefoot Lucy and Fearless fox who who went beyond all<br/>
&gt; expectations to help us. A big thank-you to Fearless Fox for the ride to<br/>
&gt; the hospital and the use of his cell phone. We will never forget your<br/>
&gt; kindness!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We love you all!!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I hope she recovers soon, and can get back home.  I hate that this happened.   Silver Eagle and I probably were the next ones to the box, and found both of them in the stump.  We found her binder there also, and returned it to y'alls tent.  We did return Bell's box to its place, not knowing the snake was in the stump (we thought it had been where Bell's box was.   Then we went on down the trail and ran into R7 family and warned them about snake action.  Just after this, they found another copperhead on top of the box they were about to get, but luckily due to the warning he saw it before grabbing the box.  Don't know of any more trouble after this.  <br/>
<br/>
Again, Thanks for bringing the circus to the event, and the great cake clues.  I wish y'all could have enjoyed the whole event, and will be praying for a full recovery.   Take care.<br/>
