"between Bastrop and Smithville" and encompasses (as of this morning)<br/>
about 1200 acres.  At one point, I heard that it was near 71 and<br/>

<div>Today's Austin American Statesman shows 
images of where the fire was, and it was between Bastrop SP and Buescher 
SP.  1200 acres, 23 homes and 12 businesses were consumed, but there is no 
damage to the state parks.  The fire started in Saturday's high winds, when 
a tree at least 60 feet tall fell onto a power line, sparking a blaze that was 
quickly fanned by the gusting winds.  Scary and sad.  Go to <a href="http://www.statesman.com">www.statesman.com</a> for more info and 
photos.  -- Bell Motel</div>

<div>I was reading a story on the internet this morning that the fire had destroyed 25 houses. There were pictures of burned areas. Here's a comment from one lady in the area who said that the fire had come within about 30 feeto of her house:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Went for a drive down Hwy 71, this morning, and was saddened to see that Alum Creek is gone, as well as some of the homes along the Hwy. Going down towards Smithville, there were lots of emergency vehicles, and police there along the road. <br/><br/>Went as far down to the first turnoff at Smithville, and those roads were blocked. <br/><br/>Buecher State Park (which ajoins Bastrop state Park) and roads leading into the areas are blocked by emergency vehicles. I couldn't get down there, and had to turn around. The devastation from the fire is complete, and all one sees and smells is smoke, and the firefighters checking hot spots along the roads, and the hills. <br/><br/>I suppose that they are still fighting the fire as I hear the helicopters flying overhead every now and then. As of this morning, the news said that it's 50% contained. (Depending on what news service you pull up). That's not good, and the beautiful Lost Pines is under threat by this fire. <br/><br/>Continue to pray for it to be contained, and those folks out there, worrying about their livestock and homes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div></div></div>
<div>I remember driving through the park roads connecting Bastrop to Buecher year before last and seeing the burn marks on the trees for miles and miles from a previous fire.</div>
