                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the kudos, but we're sure anyone else would have done the <br>
same.  We're just glad we were able to replace the Cat and the Bones in <br>
the same area as their original locations, because it's such a great <br>
place to go, fun for kids and families or a little individual solitude <br>
with nature.  Thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for putting them <br>
there in the first place (I'd already found them both twice before - <br>
once last winter with my husband, and again in the spring with my <br>
Nature Girl granddaughter, who LOVED the prairie dogs and buffaloes and <br>
turtles.  Now they're ready for more visitors, we hope!) -- Viewfinder<br>
