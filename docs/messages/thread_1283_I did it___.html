River.   I have been worried that my clues wouldn't be detailed <br/>
enough, but after I wrote it out, it didn't seem so bad.  I still <br/>
appreciated when the placer put's approx. time or distance.   Oh well, <br/>
I guess I'll just have to go back next summer and get that <br/>
information.  Maybe it won't rain the whole time.  ;-)<br/>
