                    <html><body><div>We made a flying trip to see SJZ this weekend and had to work around her work schedule, so I had hoped to be able to do a little letterboxing last evening and this morning.  Unfortunately, because we hadn't planned the trip ahead of time, I didn't have time to print clues, but I figured that in the interest of saving trees and using my resources, I would just use Fearless Fox's cell phone for my internet access and to follow clues.  It was a good plan in the concept, but not so great in the execution.

<div>It turns out AQ is, for whatever reason, not accessible by mobile access.  I was able to get the clues hosted on LBNA, but I couldn't go directly to AQ or link to AQ through LBNA.  I'm hoping maybe Ryan knows what was up with that or knows how to work around it, but it turned out that most of the boxes in Denton weren't available to me.  It made me realize, yet again, that it's a really good idea to post clues to two different and independent locations because you just never know when one site will be down or when the technology gremlins will rear their heads, or other problems may arise!

<div>But alas, it wasn't meant to be that I letterbox this weekend because SJZ gave us assignments that filled what time might have been spent letterboxing anyway!</div>
