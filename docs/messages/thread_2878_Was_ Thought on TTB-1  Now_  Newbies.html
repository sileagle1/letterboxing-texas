That is a treasure trove of amazing stamps and so many more people <br>
deserve the chance to find it and record all of these great stamps.  <br>
I'm very willing to have them contact me at any time if yall think <br>
that would be best. <br>

I enjoyed the hunt in both letterboxing and geocaching right off, but <br>
it took on a whole new level of interest when I realized that I enjoy <br>
carving.  My first several stamps were a chore, I considered it a <br>
PITA to have to carve something in order to plant a box.  Then I <br>
found a series of letterboxes in Moultrie, Georgia in which the <br>
stamps blew me away.  I started trying to learn how to make stamps <br>
that impressive, and now I carve more than I plant.<br>

<br>
Yeah, that is weird.  In some cases, you might find that it's an out-<br>
of-towner just passing through who planted one box on his way by.  He <br>
may have lots of boxes somewhere else.<br>

<br>
You'll be amazed at how many LbNA users *resent* AQ, and not only <br>
refuse to use it but will refuse to hunt any boxes in which the <br>
listing on LbNA links to a listing on AQ.  I don't understand it.  I <br>
think the attitude is prevalent in parts of New England, especially <br>
among boxers who have been in the biz since before AQ was <br>
established.<br>
