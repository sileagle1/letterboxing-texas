                    <html><body><div>Got home late Sunday afternoon from the gathering dead tired and entirely satisfied with life and all it has to offer.  Unfortunately, I also  had to hit the ground running right away this week with scouts - pack campout, den campout, two district campouts, a banquet, and the annual kicking of the oldest boys out of the pack all bearing down on us, not to mention a few new scouts joining us, and scouting took back over after the excitement of the gathering .  Throw in with that a bout of laryngitis (not a good thing when you spend most of your work life on the phone) and it's been an interesting week!  I still don't have much voice, but hopefully you won't be able to tell as you read this. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I finally got a chance to sit down this week and look back, and I have to say - this may not have been the biggest gathering, but it certainly was very memorable and reiterated to me yet again how much I enjoy letterboxing for a wide variety of reasons. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First of all, this is the one weekend a year that I know Lightning will be hanging out with me - at least for now, until he outgrows his old mom, as kids do manage to do (I've been down THAT bittersweet road before!).  This year, Fearless Fox decided he would go with the boy scout troop to Beavers Bend, OK, to do an overnight backpacking trip and FF invited Lightning to go - ENTICED him in fact!  I know it was tempting - an opportunity to go hang out with the guys he will soon be joining, and I started to recognize that I might be on my own.  Lightning was firm in his resolve though and while he humored his dad over dinner one night, he glanced over at me and winked subtly as FF was trying to sell him on the Beavers Bend trip.  He politely waited for FF to finish, then told him he thought he should come along with me to the gathering.   My boy!  But this year I realized even more that I wasn't taking him camping - we were going camping together.  He helped pack the car, loaded the wood I bought into the car without being asked, helped set camp and hang hammocks even in the dark, got the fire started and lit the lantern, and helped arrange camp.  He helped me keep camp managed and keep food out of reach of animals and all the sorts of things that keep camping pleasurable.  Gotta say though - he still ain't much for breaking camp! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, after we got camp set on Friday night, we decided we would set about finding other letterboxers.  We had asked at the gate if Silver Eagle and Baby Bear were checked in yet, and while they had not yet arrived, the ranger lady told us where they would be relative to our campsite.  Later on, we had a nice fire going and hesitated to leave to go hunting people, so we contemplated yelling across the little cove that separated our camping area from the pavilion area where they would be.  We finally decided we just needed to be polite campers and let our fire die down and then go look.  Sure enough, they were there by then and set up, and they probably could've heard us if we HAD yelled.  It also turned out that SandiBox with SoccerChik and Element were two sites down from us, and Lucy Locket and Blue Butterfly weren't too far down from us either, so if we had just started yelling, we probably coulda gotten a group together Friday night.  Oh well.  It was our pleasure to get to visit with Silver Eagle and Baby Bear and Clueless Collector quietly for a little while that evening.  And Clueless Collector just gets taller and what a wonderful young man he is becoming. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We headed on back to our site eventually and decided we would turn in.  We were planning to hammock for the weekend (my new favorite way to camp) and had already managed to land on our rear ends a couple times while setting the hammocks.  We had prevailed though and were confident our beds were secure and I tucked Lightning in good and tight and set about battening down the hatches.  Wanting to be fresh as a daisy for the gathering the next morning, I took a half a sleeping pill and tucked myself in too.  Now realize - I rarely if ever take sleep medication and had only borrowed this one pill from FF on the possibility I might have difficulty sleeping, so when I awoke at midnight with Lightning standing over me saying he had to go to the bathroom, I was somewhat woozy as I rolled out of my hammock.  Have you ever seen the dizzy bat contest at a baseball game?  That was what I was like when I first stood up - and then I had to drive to the bathroom!  We got back to the campsite and I realized I had left my cell phone at the bathroom, so I left Lightning in camp to get himself back to bed while I ran back to the bathroom to get it.  When I got back, I found Lightning standing with his bedding all around him.  His hammock kept dunking him and we finally realized a couple of the strings had gotten fowled and we wouldn't be able to fix it until morning.  He prodded the fire back to life and retired to a nearby chair and I positioned myself so I could peek at him periodically and fell back to sleep.  At 4 
a.m. I realized he was no longer by the fire, so I figured that since I wanted to be a good mother, I should go looking for him.  I swung my legs over the side of my hammock, carefully trying to avoid the dizzy bat effect, but I didn't have to go far since my feet kicked him - sleeping on the ground under my hammock.  Did the boy not realize it was in the low 40's?  Did I not WARN him that I had promised his daddy I would keep him warm?  FF did not say "keep him safe".  He didn't say "Make sure he minds.".  He didn't say "Don't lose him".  He said "Keep him warm."  And how can I keep the boy warm if he decides to sleep - ON THE GROUND IN 40 DEGREE WEATHER?  I broke open a couple more Hot Hands and shoved them down into his bag, hoping that would stave off the icicles, and glad at that point that FF had convinced me to go the extra money at Christmas and get Lightning a -0- deg bag instead of a 20 deg bag, thus saving my hide in this particular instance.  I got a little more sleep and awoke to a beautiful sky overhead and birds and sunshine - and the smell of the campfire that Lightning already had going.  My boy! 
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>We got cleaned up and showered and made our Bailey's, then headed on over to the gathering pavilion, only to find that SE, BB, and CC were already there of course, and so were BootsTex and LoneStarQuilter.  I had met them at the Great Book Adventure, but it was a pleasure to get to meet them again.  One of these days, I'm going to get to go boxing in Coldspring and finally plant the box I've been carrying around for their granddaughter for nearly a year.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I still had a stamp to carve, so I sat down to do it and other folks began to show up.  With my head down, I mainly listened for a little while.  I love the sounds of a gathering - have y'all ever noticed that there are almost NO awkward moments at a gathering?  You hear introductions, but you hardly ever hear those things like "Nice weather" or "So what do you do for a living?" or those other lifeline sorts of questions...and you never hear the 7 minute lull.  You know what that is, right?  Anytime you get a group together, there is a moment or two of suspended conversation every 7 minutes or so?  Cool huh?  And so it was - connecting with old friends and meeting new ones.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You know, we had an inordinate number of LSS's at this gathering.  I wonder if that means they are becoming less afraid of the collective group?  Or more resigned?  Or if their partners are just becoming more persistent? 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I had gotten an opportunity to meet SandiBox at the GBA, and we even went boxing together a bit on the Sunday morning breakfast event back in October.  But when she showed up with SoccerChik and Element (SoccerChik's "special" friend), it was like a good old friend arriving.  It just seemed as though we fell right in again.  It was wonderful to get to visit with her, and to meet SoccerChik and Element - both VERY cool, for teenagers anyway (just kidding).  They invited Lightning and me for breakfast Sunday morning, so we had a nice warm breakfast before breaking camp - thanks again, SandiBox!  And thanks too, for the logbook class...I'm still inspired!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Having started out lonely up here in East Texas, it is awfully nice to find faces that have become oh so familiar as to be almost routine - Lucy Locket and Blue Butterfly.  I had just seen them a few weeks before at Rusk Redoux and will see them again in a couple weeks in Arkansas.  Heck - I have family I don't see THAT often!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And I have a question - how can someone who is presumably as fast as Runsforchocolate is, be one of the last ones to the gathering?  Of course, she DID show up just before the big chocolate cake that Can Can brought...I guess that means she paced herself?  (Just kidding, RFC) 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And my old friend, PuddleSplasher, and she managed to finally bring along her LSS.  I know that if I talk to her for very long, she's gonna make me laugh.  It was great fun running into them at Old Baylor Park on Sunday morning too.  I'm really doubtful of his LSS status - he kept looking after PuddleSplasher, Lightning, and I gave up. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And The Polka Dots, who I had also met at GBA.  It takes a guy 6' 9" to allow himself to be called a Polka Dot.  He sure was a good sport about getting teased about tumping his canoe - of course, he was sure to dry out before turning back up at the pavilion!  What a sweet little girl he and Thimble Cat have.  Thimble Cat sat in on SandiBox's logbook lesson and I so enjoyed getting to know her a little better.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And of course, Gryzzled Gryphon, who is so good-natured, he even wears his cootie coat to gatherings, just to humor the kiddos.  And Lightning took advantage - he carved his very first stamp and promptly dropped it into GG's pocket (he gave it back later).    And I did enjoy beating GG out - barely - at the trivia game.  I gotta say - he really had me worried! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Familiar names that were great to finally get to meet - Gingercat and her mom, SkyeBird.  I've seen Gingercat's name around enough that I felt sure I had to have already met her and it seemed moreso after visiting with her a bit!  Batty Girl and her LSS. They almost made it to Rusk, but not quite.  I'm glad they made it to Somerville.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>New boxers that were a pleasure to meet too - Can Can and her son - they slipped in after lunch and stuck around long enough to be FTF on LSQ's new Quilt Block box.  Dream Catchers - was I the only one that felt SURE they had connected with letterboxing through BootsTex and LSQ?  Not so!  Dizzy Monkey - who kept GG on his toes...  And Adams Trail - all of them - they were very tenacious and made quite a showing at the gathering.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But the best part of any gathering always seems to be the end - if you've never stuck around until the last ember dies away, you should do it.  That's when the fun stuff comes out.  I'll never get tired of hearing how GG walked by Silver Eagle while SE was stamping in, oblivious that GG was so close.  Realizing that GG may no longer be a mystery, but he IS still an enigma (but don't you forget Mr. Gryphon - I have your number!!!).  Feeling a bit like we were playing dodgeball while Lightning and Clueless Collector tossed the ball over the building and only occasionally THROUGH the building.  And conspiring with SandiBox to set up a rogue account in the name of Baby Bear to record all those iff-y boxes we might plant - "they" would expect it of him, after all.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Some of the folks I really missed seeing?  Dewberry and her crew.  Mother of Five and her crew, especially Pablo and Armadillo Girl (I need to let her stamp in to my new logbook five or six times!).  Ruby Tuesday and her inimitable LSS, Stillwater.  And CactusLicker.  Sea Dove of BirdsofaFeather.  Viewfinder.  Corazon and Navigator.  TeamKing.  Lena.  JB Kokopelli - another friendly East Texan I've come to enjoy hanging out with.  BusyBee - Wanda - one of the first gatherers who hasn't been with us for a couple years.  Calico Rose likewise.  So many others I've only gotten to know ever so briefly at other gatherings, like Queen Beloved, CozyChairBooks, and The Peas.  Here's hoping that if you couldn't make it to this one, you'll make it to the next one.
<br/><br/>We worked real hard on prolonging the gathering by proceeding to Washington-on-the-Brazos, but by then we were worn out and tired and after running into Blue Butterfly and GingerCat and SkyeBird there, and Puddlesplasher and Curtis at Old Baylor Park, we threw in the towel and headed home.  I've always kind of liked that saying "Call it a day while you're still having fun..."
<br/> </div>
<div>We were still having fun.</div>

letterboxing<br/>
&gt; for a wide variety of reasons.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; First of all, this is the one weekend a year that I know Lightning <br/>
will be<br/>
&gt; hanging out with me - at least for now, until he outgrows his old <br/>
mom, as<br/>
&gt; kids do manage to do (I've been down THAT bittersweet road <br/>
before!).  This<br/>
&gt; year, Fearless Fox decided he would go with the boy scout troop to <br/>
Beavers<br/>
&gt; Bend, OK, to do an overnight backpacking trip and FF invited <br/>
Lightning to go<br/>
&gt; - ENTICED him in fact!  I know it was tempting - an opportunity to <br/>
go hang<br/>
&gt; out with the guys he will soon be joining, and I started to <br/>
recognize that I<br/>
&gt; might be on my own.  Lightning was firm in his resolve though and <br/>
while he<br/>
&gt; humored his dad over dinner one night, he glanced over at me and <br/>
winked<br/>
&gt; subtly as FF was trying to sell him on the Beavers Bend trip.  He <br/>
politely<br/>
&gt; waited for FF to finish, then told him he thought he should come <br/>
along with<br/>
&gt; me to the gathering.   My boy!  But this year I realized even more <br/>
that I<br/>
&gt; wasn't taking him camping - we were going camping together.  He <br/>
helped pack<br/>
&gt; the car, loaded the wood I bought into the car without being asked, <br/>
helped<br/>
&gt; set camp and hang hammocks even in the dark, got the fire started <br/>
and lit<br/>
&gt; the lantern, and helped arrange camp.  He helped me keep camp <br/>
managed and<br/>
&gt; keep food out of reach of animals and all the sorts of things that <br/>
keep<br/>
&gt; camping pleasurable.  Gotta say though - he still ain't much for <br/>
breaking<br/>
&gt; camp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, after we got camp set on Friday night, we decided we would <br/>
set about<br/>
&gt; finding other letterboxers.  We had asked at the gate if Silver <br/>
Eagle and<br/>
&gt; Baby Bear were checked in yet, and while they had not yet arrived, <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; ranger lady told us where they would be relative to our campsite.  <br/>
Later on,<br/>
&gt; we had a nice fire going and hesitated to leave to go hunting <br/>
people, so we<br/>
&gt; contemplated yelling across the little cove that separated our <br/>
camping area<br/>
&gt; from the pavilion area where they would be.  We finally decided we <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; needed to be polite campers and let our fire die down and then go <br/>
look.<br/>
&gt; Sure enough, they were there by then and set up, and they probably <br/>
could've<br/>
&gt; heard us if we HAD yelled.  It also turned out that SandiBox with <br/>
SoccerChik<br/>
&gt; and Element were two sites down from us, and Lucy Locket and Blue <br/>
Butterfly<br/>
&gt; weren't too far down from us either, so if we had just started <br/>
yelling, we<br/>
&gt; probably coulda gotten a group together Friday night.  Oh well.  It <br/>
was our<br/>
&gt; pleasure to get to visit with Silver Eagle and Baby Bear and <br/>
Clueless<br/>
&gt; Collector quietly for a little while that evening.  And Clueless <br/>
Collector<br/>
&gt; just gets taller and what a wonderful young man he is becoming.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We headed on back to our site eventually and decided we would turn <br/>
in.  We<br/>
&gt; were planning to hammock for the weekend (my new favorite way to <br/>
camp) and<br/>
&gt; had already managed to land on our rear ends a couple times while <br/>
setting<br/>
&gt; the hammocks.  We had prevailed though and were confident our beds <br/>
were<br/>
&gt; secure and I tucked Lightning in good and tight and set about <br/>
battening down<br/>
&gt; the hatches.  Wanting to be fresh as a daisy for the gathering the <br/>
next<br/>
&gt; morning, I took a half a sleeping pill and tucked myself in too.  <br/>
Now<br/>
&gt; realize - I rarely if ever take sleep medication and had only <br/>
borrowed this<br/>
&gt; one pill from FF on the possibility I might have difficulty <br/>
sleeping, so<br/>
&gt; when I awoke at midnight with Lightning standing over me saying he <br/>
had to go<br/>
&gt; to the bathroom, I was somewhat woozy as I rolled out of my <br/>
hammock.  Have<br/>
&gt; you ever seen the dizzy bat contest at a baseball game?  That was <br/>
what I was<br/>
&gt; like when I first stood up - and then I had to drive to the <br/>
bathroom!  We<br/>
&gt; got back to the campsite and I realized I had left my cell phone at <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; bathroom, so I left Lightning in camp to get himself back to bed <br/>
while I ran<br/>
&gt; back to the bathroom to get it.  When I got back, I found Lightning <br/>
standing<br/>
&gt; with his bedding all around him.  His hammock kept dunking him and <br/>
we<br/>
&gt; finally realized a couple of the strings had gotten fowled and we <br/>
wouldn't<br/>
&gt; be able to fix it until morning.  He prodded the fire back to life <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; retired to a nearby chair and I positioned myself so I could peek <br/>
at him<br/>
&gt; periodically and fell back to sleep.  At 4 a.m. I realized he was <br/>
no longer<br/>
&gt; by the fire, so I figured that since I wanted to be a good mother, <br/>
I should<br/>
&gt; go looking for him.  I swung my legs over the side of my hammock, <br/>
carefully<br/>
&gt; trying to avoid the dizzy bat effect, but I didn't have to go far <br/>
since my<br/>
&gt; feet kicked him - sleeping on the ground under my hammock.  Did the <br/>
boy not<br/>
&gt; realize it was in the low 40's?  Did I not WARN him that I had <br/>
promised his<br/>
&gt; daddy I would keep him warm?  FF did not say "keep him safe".  He <br/>
didn't say<br/>
&gt; "Make sure he minds.".  He didn't say "Don't lose him".  He <br/>
said "Keep him<br/>
&gt; warm."  And how can I keep the boy warm if he decides to sleep - ON <br/>
THE<br/>
&gt; GROUND IN 40 DEGREE WEATHER?  I broke open a couple more Hot Hands <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; shoved them down into his bag, hoping that would stave off the <br/>
icicles, and<br/>
&gt; glad at that point that FF had convinced me to go the extra money at<br/>
&gt; Christmas and get Lightning a -0- deg bag instead of a 20 deg bag, <br/>
thus<br/>
&gt; saving my hide in this particular instance.  I got a little more <br/>
sleep and<br/>
&gt; awoke to a beautiful sky overhead and birds and sunshine - and the <br/>
smell of<br/>
&gt; the campfire that Lightning already had going.  My boy!<br/>
&gt; We got cleaned up and showered and made our Bailey's, then headed <br/>
on over to<br/>
&gt; the gathering pavilion, only to find that SE, BB, and CC were <br/>
already there<br/>
&gt; of course, and so were BootsTex and LoneStarQuilter.  I had met <br/>
them at the<br/>
&gt; Great Book Adventure, but it was a pleasure to get to meet them <br/>
again.  One<br/>
&gt; of these days, I'm going to get to go boxing in Coldspring and <br/>
finally plant<br/>
&gt; the box I've been carrying around for their granddaughter for <br/>
nearly a<br/>
&gt; year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still had a stamp to carve, so I sat down to do it and other <br/>
folks began<br/>
&gt; to show up.  With my head down, I mainly listened for a little <br/>
while.  I<br/>
&gt; love the sounds of a gathering - have y'all ever noticed that there <br/>
are<br/>
&gt; almost NO awkward moments at a gathering?  You hear introductions, <br/>
but you<br/>
&gt; hardly ever hear those things like "Nice weather" or "So what do <br/>
you do for<br/>
&gt; a living?" or those other lifeline sorts of questions...and you <br/>
never hear<br/>
&gt; the 7 minute lull.  You know what that is, right?  Anytime you get <br/>
a group<br/>
&gt; together, there is a moment or two of suspended conversation every <br/>
7 minutes<br/>
&gt; or so?  Cool huh?  And so it was - connecting with old friends and <br/>
meeting<br/>
&gt; new ones.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You know, we had an inordinate number of LSS's at this gathering.  <br/>
I wonder<br/>
&gt; if that means they are becoming less afraid of the collective <br/>
group?  Or<br/>
&gt; more resigned?  Or if their partners are just becoming more <br/>
persistent?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now I had gotten an opportunity to meet SandiBox at the GBA, and we <br/>
even<br/>
&gt; went boxing together a bit on the Sunday morning breakfast event <br/>
back in<br/>
&gt; October.  But when she showed up with SoccerChik and Element <br/>
(SoccerChik's<br/>
&gt; "special" friend), it was like a good old friend arriving.  It just <br/>
seemed<br/>
&gt; as though we fell right in again.  It was wonderful to get to visit <br/>
with<br/>
&gt; her, and to meet SoccerChik and Element - both VERY cool, for <br/>
teenagers<br/>
&gt; anyway (just kidding).  They invited Lightning and me for breakfast <br/>
Sunday<br/>
&gt; morning, so we had a nice warm breakfast before breaking camp - <br/>
thanks<br/>
&gt; again, SandiBox!  And thanks too, for the logbook class...I'm still<br/>
&gt; inspired!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Having started out lonely up here in East Texas, it is awfully nice <br/>
to find<br/>
&gt; faces that have become oh so familiar as to be almost routine - <br/>
Lucy Locket<br/>
&gt; and Blue Butterfly.  I had just seen them a few weeks before at <br/>
Rusk Redoux<br/>
&gt; and will see them again in a couple weeks in Arkansas.  Heck - I <br/>
have family<br/>
&gt; I don't see THAT often!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And I have a question - how can someone who is presumably as fast as<br/>
&gt; Runsforchocolate is, be one of the last ones to the gathering?  Of <br/>
course,<br/>
&gt; she DID show up just before the big chocolate cake that Can Can <br/>
brought...I<br/>
&gt; guess that means she paced herself?  (Just kidding, RFC)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And my old friend, PuddleSplasher, and she managed to finally bring <br/>
along<br/>
&gt; her LSS.  I know that if I talk to her for very long, she's gonna <br/>
make me<br/>
&gt; laugh.  It was great fun running into them at Old Baylor Park on <br/>
Sunday<br/>
&gt; morning too.  I'm really doubtful of his LSS status - he kept <br/>
looking after<br/>
&gt; PuddleSplasher, Lightning, and I gave up.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And The Polka Dots, who I had also met at GBA.  It takes a guy 6' <br/>
9" to<br/>
&gt; allow himself to be called a Polka Dot.  He sure was a good sport <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; getting teased about tumping his canoe - of course, he was sure to <br/>
dry out<br/>
&gt; before turning back up at the pavilion!  What a sweet little girl <br/>
he and<br/>
&gt; Thimble Cat have.  Thimble Cat sat in on SandiBox's logbook lesson <br/>
and I so<br/>
&gt; enjoyed getting to know her a little better.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And of course, Gryzzled Gryphon, who is so good-natured, he even <br/>
wears his<br/>
&gt; cootie coat to gatherings, just to humor the kiddos.  And Lightning <br/>
took<br/>
&gt; advantage - he carved his very first stamp and promptly dropped it <br/>
into GG's<br/>
&gt; pocket (he gave it back later).    And I did enjoy beating GG out - <br/>
barely -<br/>
&gt; at the trivia game.  I gotta say - he really had me worried!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Familiar names that were great to finally get to meet - Gingercat <br/>
and her<br/>
&gt; mom, SkyeBird.  I've seen Gingercat's name around enough that I <br/>
felt sure I<br/>
&gt; had to have already met her and it seemed moreso after visiting <br/>
with her a<br/>
&gt; bit!  Batty Girl and her LSS. They almost made it to Rusk, but not <br/>
quite.<br/>
&gt; I'm glad they made it to Somerville.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New boxers that were a pleasure to meet too - Can Can and her son - <br/>
they<br/>
&gt; slipped in after lunch and stuck around long enough to be FTF on <br/>
LSQ's new<br/>
&gt; Quilt Block box.  Dream Catchers - was I the only one that felt <br/>
SURE they<br/>
&gt; had connected with letterboxing through BootsTex and LSQ?  Not so!  <br/>
Dizzy<br/>
&gt; Monkey - who kept GG on his toes...  And Adams Trail - all of them -<br/>
 they<br/>
&gt; were very tenacious and made quite a showing at the gathering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But the best part of any gathering always seems to be the end - if <br/>
you've<br/>
&gt; never stuck around until the last ember dies away, you should do <br/>
it.  That's<br/>
&gt; when the fun stuff comes out.  I'll never get tired of hearing how <br/>
GG walked<br/>
&gt; by Silver Eagle while SE was stamping in, oblivious that GG was so <br/>
close.<br/>
&gt; Realizing that GG may no longer be a mystery, but he IS still an <br/>
enigma (but<br/>
&gt; don't you forget Mr. Gryphon - I have your number!!!).  Feeling a <br/>
bit like<br/>
&gt; we were playing dodgeball while Lightning and Clueless Collector <br/>
tossed the<br/>
&gt; ball over the building and only occasionally THROUGH the building.  <br/>
And<br/>
&gt; conspiring with SandiBox to set up a rogue account in the name of <br/>
Baby<br/>
&gt; Bear to record all those iff-y boxes we might plant - "they" would <br/>
expect it<br/>
&gt; of him, after all.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Some of the folks I really missed seeing?  Dewberry and her crew.  <br/>
Mother of<br/>
&gt; Five and her crew, especially Pablo and Armadillo Girl (I need to <br/>
let her<br/>
&gt; stamp in to my new logbook five or six times!).  Ruby Tuesday and <br/>
her<br/>
&gt; inimitable LSS, Stillwater.  And CactusLicker.  Sea Dove of<br/>
&gt; BirdsofaFeather.  Viewfinder.  Corazon and Navigator.  TeamKing.  <br/>
Lena.  JB<br/>
&gt; Kokopelli - another friendly East Texan I've come to enjoy hanging <br/>
out<br/>
&gt; with.  BusyBee - Wanda - one of the first gatherers who hasn't been <br/>
with us<br/>
&gt; for a couple years.  Calico Rose likewise.  So many others I've <br/>
only gotten<br/>
&gt; to know ever so briefly at other gatherings, like Queen Beloved,<br/>
&gt; CozyChairBooks, and The Peas.  Here's hoping that if you couldn't <br/>
make it to<br/>
&gt; this one, you'll make it to the next one.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We worked real hard on prolonging the gathering by proceeding to<br/>
&gt; Washington-on-the-Brazos, but by then we were worn out and tired <br/>
and after<br/>
&gt; running into Blue Butterfly and GingerCat and SkyeBird there, and<br/>
&gt; Puddlesplasher and Curtis at Old Baylor Park, we threw in the towel <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; headed home.  I've always kind of liked that saying "Call it a day <br/>
while<br/>
&gt; you're still having fun..."<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We were still having fun.<br/>
