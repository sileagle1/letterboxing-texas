                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got one ready to plant for Halletsville in LaVaca co., try to plant <br/>
it last week but the weather didn't want me to.  I will get it planted <br/>
in next couple of weeks.  <br/>
<br/>
I haven't been doing this long, but I was really surprise there wasn't <br/>
a LB already in Shiner TX, also in LaVaca co. Come on all you beer <br/>
lovers, the Shiner brewery is there.  I knew they give tours, after <br/>
that, visitors are invited to their hospitally suite.  I think even my <br/>
husband would be up to planting one there.<br/>
<br/>
So heres to another LB plant idea - Tejas Angel<br/>
