                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son and his wife called last night that they were heading home this <br>
morning.  They have arrived and found their home very secured.  No <br>
signs at that time of his call of water damage.<br>
<br>
Their Internet connector on the roof is dangling, but nothing but <br>
fencing knocked down.  Sapling may or may not survive.<br>
<br>
Auntie Em...there's no place like home.  Hoping all of you find your <br>
way there soon.<br>
