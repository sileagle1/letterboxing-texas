My name is Jacqueline, and I am the list owner of Artists of the Round <br>
Table.<br>

I will be hosting an online study of Art Stamping Workshop by Gloria Page.<br>
This is an awesome book, and I highly recommend it to new and well seasoned<br>
carvers.  From what I see at Amazon, there are 10 new books from $15.56,<br>
and 18 used from $9.77.  If you don't have this book, get it while you <br>
can, and<br>
make it a definite keeper for your personal library.<br>

<br>
<br>
She also offers a DVD that demonstrates the techniques in this book.<br>
<br>
Art Stamping Innovations (Looks like it is on sale for $22.95)<br>

<br>
If you would like to see some of the work created from the previous carving<br>
workshop that I hosted, see:<br>

<br>
Before committing to this workshop, realize that this will be a<br>
lengthy one (14 weeks + 2 weeks break).....so, if you are looking<br>
for a fast paced workshop, this may not work for you. We are taking<br>
our time for the consideration of work schedules, and the fact that<br>
this will be a busy time of the year for those observing the upcoming<br>
holidays. The carving basics portion of this workshop will be one lesson<br>
per week so that those new to carving will not feel overwhelmed as they<br>
are learning and getting past the intimidation factor that some feel <br>
towards<br>
carving.<br>
<br>
The workshop begins November 21. If you are interested, please email:<br>
