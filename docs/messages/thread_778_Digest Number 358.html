<div>Carol, I'm very happy that you are somewhere within reasonable driving 
distance from me (in Keller), although my first 6 letterboxes were in New 
England last October.  I'm looking forward to searching for letterboxes you 
plant somewhere in the DFW area, and hope you'll come locate mine (I've planted 
4 but am ready to go with 2 more and planning several yet to come - can't get 
out there to scout the locations yet.)  When I was trying to find my 
trailname, my sister suggested Happy MTNester, since I am, but Viewfinder came 
to me (I'd say in a vision, but bad pun), and that's me. -- Viewfinder (Benny)
