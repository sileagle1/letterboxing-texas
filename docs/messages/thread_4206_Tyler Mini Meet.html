I had no idea it was part of Green Acres, but thought it was a separate church called ROC - if we had realized it WAS part of GABC, we probably woulda figured it out, so we drove around awhile looking for it, then gave up and went letterboxing. Sorry we missed meeting everyone, but glad it was fun!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, I owe a thank you to everyone.  You really made the day worthwhile for me.  I got fed up with missing every meet because I'm in class (I'll be missing the next couple that have been announced, too) and decided to create one that I could attend.  More than once I decided I was in over my head.  I originally called it a Mini Meet in hopes that 2 or 3 others would show up with me, however this morning, I packed my book in my backpack because I was secretly afraid that no one would show up.  I'm so thankful that you did.<br>
<br>
I had met a few of you before, but it was a true honor to meet everyone else.  I finally got to meet Gryzzled Gryphon (My daughter grabs the logbooks first when we 'box and has asked more than once how Gryzzled always finds the boxes before we do.  Alas, that will remain a mystery!).  It was great to find brand new boxers at the event (Rogue Artist and The Heart of Oz who made up their trailname on the way to Tyler this morning).  We also were able to meet JB Kokopelli who is just so darn prolific with planting!<br>
<br>
I think the thing that really defines my day can be related in this story.  At one point this afternoon, I realized that I had smiled so much that either my cheek muscles were fatigued from overwork or they were just cramping.  Thank you to everyone.  Thank you, thank you, thank you.<br>

<br>
I don't know how I do this, but I always seem to miss several people to do exchanges with. This was only my 3rd event so I'm still trying to learn how to manage all the exchanges, collecting PT's, etc.<br>
Those of you I missed I'll have to get at the next one. :)<br>
<br>
Out of all the pictures I took today the one my family thinks is the coolest is one of Gryzzled Gryphon sitting at our table talking to us. They said "He actually came over and sat at our table and talked to us!" LOL You are a true legend and hero to my children Mr. Gryphon. :) <br>
<br>
Beach Bum, that's funny about the cooties. When I read what you posted I ran to my bag to check to see if I had been hit. I was free from all cooties and fleas though. Whew. LOL <br>
<br>
Barefoot Lucy, after we left the event we did some boxing around the area. We must have been coming up right behind you b/c we saw that you had just stamped in that day. I told my husband "I wonder why she wasn't at the event?" Now I know why. :)<br>
<br>
Another fun thing happened that I just have to share. We had left the event and was on the search for one of Blue Butterfly's boxes. We didn't have luck finding it b/c turns out we gave up too soon. We thought we had passed it already but found out later had we gone just a tad bit more down the trail we would have hit it. ARGH! Hiking in the 100 degree temp with 5 kids clouded our thinking. LOL Anyway, back to my story. We had stopped along the trail to re-read the clue when we noticed this HUGE tarantula looking spider crawling across the gravel. We were amazed at this big spider. Well all of a sudden a wasp comes flying up to it and ATTACKS it!!! He proceeded to sting it over and over and over until finally it was DEAD! Then the wasp starts dragging it away!! It was the craziest thing we've ever seen! We had no idea that wasps ate spiders?!!<br>
So even though we didn't find the box on that one, that was one of our favorite moments of the day. So thank you Blue Butterfly for planting that box there. <br>
<br>
Hope to see you all at the meet-ups in Nacgadoches (misp?) and Denton. I'm trying to work it out where either me and my husband or our whole family can come to at least one of those events. :)<br>

After getting back to Irvingtonight around 11:30 and putting the passed out Pink Cookie to bed I decided to clean out the backpack... hummm well to my surprise I had a few unexpected gifts...lol... two cooties and a flea how nice is that! They were my firsts. On top of making the 100marktoday at the event and boxing for two whole days around Tyler we also came home with some lovely hitchhikers who we will send on their way real soon. It was so great visitingwith everyone and making all the new exchanges, hope to see you soon at another event!<br>

> First of all, I owe a thank you to everyone. You really made the day worthwhile for me. I got fed up with missing every meet because I'm in class (I'll be missing the next couple that have been announced, too) and decided to create one that I could attend. More than once I decided I was in over my head. I originally called it a Mini Meet in hopes that 2 or 3 others would show up with me, however this morning, I packed my book in my backpack because I was secretly afraid that no one would show up. I'm so thankful that you did.<br>

> I had met a few of you before, but it was a true honor to meet everyone else. I finally got to meet Gryzzled Gryphon (My daughter grabs the logbooks first when we 'box and has asked more than once how Gryzzled always finds the boxes before we do. Alas, that will remain a mystery!). It was great to find brand new boxers at the event (Rogue Artist and The Heart of Oz who made up their trailname on the way to Tyler this morning). We also were able to meet JB Kokopelli who is just so darn prolific with planting!<br>
