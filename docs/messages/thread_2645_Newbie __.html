                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey guys! <br>
I'm Amy and I'm the list owner for the Yahoo Group SETXPlaygroup. <br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/SETXplaygroup/<br>
Several of our moms are interested in letterboxing in the SETX area, <br>
although none of us has ever actually doen it. We're doing a craft <br>
day in a couple of weeks to make our stamps and talk about placing <br>
some boxes in our area. I'm open to any and all suggestions and ideas <br>
about either topic. We want the kids (preschool aged) to be able to <br>
have easy to use materials for making their stamps. We will, of <br>
course, be helping them, but I can't see us carving them. Is it <br>
acceptable to use stamps cut from foam sheets and glued to some sort <br>
of block? I don't want to offend any hardcore boxers by asking stupid <br>
or uninformed questions, but I really don't have alot of places to <br>
ask, so if I'm ignorant, please excuse me. :)<br>
Also, are there any boxers from the SETX area on here? Most of us are <br>
from the Beaumont area, but we're going to start out by trying to <br>
find the boxes that are in Hardin, Jefferson, and Chambers counties <br>
and we'd love company and/or experience with this area. :)<br>
A little about me:<br>
I'm 31 and have 3 kiddoes who'll be boxing with me. My youngest son <br>
is 10 months old and I have a 3 yr old daughter and an 11 yr old son <br>
(he's the MOST interested). I run the SETXPlaygroup in Beaumont and <br>
have just started a home-based business making soft-structured baby <br>
carriers (ring slings, mei tais, and wraparound carriers) and <br>
boutique-style kids clothes out of bandanas. We are an attachment <br>
parenting family who wear our baby and co-sleep and I breastfeed on <br>
demand still and intend to until lil man decides to wean himself. <br>
(Which I don't imagine will happen anytime soon.....lol ;)<br>
I'm super excited about having found this group and would LOVE any <br>
experience and advice you guys have to lend. :)  <br>

there are not many boxes around here. I can give you some advice <br>
about some that are listed that are not there anymore so you won't <br>

very intimidating but really isn't. I have found it to be very <br>
simple. If you email me offline I can suggest some simple things I <br>

to go. Much more personal. Good luck and I would love to help.<br>
