So I'm wondering...when did he sign in to your box?  <br>
<br>
I've not been down your way since you cluttered up the<br>
area again with boxes after I had found them all, but<br>
I know I need to get down there to replace my Go<br>
Jacks! container.  Guess I shouldn't think I might NOT<br>
find his esteemed stamp in Nac boxes, hmmmm?<br>
<br>
I actually thought I might've found a box he hadn't<br>
found yesterday, which would've really surprised me<br>
because I was really pretty close to his home grounds<br>
and the boxes there are all pretty old, but I suddenly<br>
realized there were two pages stuck together, and sure<br>
enough when I unstuck them, there was his stamp!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">How funny that a discussion (and lovely song) about the mysterious GG <br>
would come up again in the group right now.  <br>
I took my sister-in-law and nieces along with us letterboxing on <br>
Thursday.  We found the Salado College minibox and the kids and I were <br>
busy stamping in to our books while my SIL sat and eagerly looked <br>
through the logbook.  She suddenly made an excited noise and said "I <br>
HAVE to find and meet the Grizzled Gryphon".   I started laughing and <br>
she explained that he must be a fellow (Grateful)Dead-head and she <br>
felt a connection with him.  It was quite hysterical, especially after <br>
I explained all the mystery surrounding him.  So even non-boxers find <br>
him intriguing.<br>
<br>
Also -- new boxers and a new box.<br>
I took some of the extended family with us boxing Thursday.   They had <br>
so much fun designing and carving their own personal stamps, but <br>
weren't sure what the big to-do was about finding the boxes.  Once we <br>
found one though, they caught the boxing fever and I heard "aren't <br>
there any more that we can find today?"  <br>
They helped us plant a new box at our favorite park in Temple (Whistle <br>
Stop Letterbox) so they are hooked for sure now and anxious for their <br>
next trip to Grandma's house to see if anyone has found their box.<br>

*********As one who has met and talked to Gryzzled<br>
Gryphon, I can honestly say...."Hmmmm.  Interesting."<br>
