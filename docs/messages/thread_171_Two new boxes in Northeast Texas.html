of boxes we've been planning.  It sure was hot, but we<br/>
had fun!<br/>
<br/>
The first one was planted at Tiger Creek Wiildlife<br/>
refuge - a place north of Tyler that rescues big cats.<br/>
 It's a really neat place and they do good work.  I<br/>
hope y'all will try to go see it.  I planted the stamp<br/>
so that you don't have to pay to go in and get it, but<br/>
you do have to go during their business hours, since<br/>
the stamp is inside their property.<br/>
<br/>
The other stamp I planted is at Tyler State Park. <br/>
Both are now listed on LBNA.<br/>
<br/>
Hope everyone else had a productive weekend too!<br/>
Lucy<br/>
