******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
I've been exploring Austin's great greenbelt trails for over 20 years now and every now and then I come across a tree fort. Every time this happens memories of my very own tree fort come flooding back out of the past. The hours spent scrounging old discarded lumber and finding nails and borrowing Dad's tools to built my secret place in the trees. Is there anything more American than boyhood memories of building your very own tree fort? <br/>
<br/>
Unless you have been very observant while out letterboxing you will not be able to just go out and get in your car and drive to the right trailhead and go and find this letterbox. Study the picture accompanying this description. Does it look familiar? It was taken from the trail I was hiking when I found this tree fort while out exploring Austin's greenbelts. Maybe I was letterboxing at the time, maybe not.<br/>
<br/>
There are other letterboxes nearby this one so maybe you have walked right past this spot. Were you being observant or did you have your head down in the latest set of letterbox clues or busy counting your steps in search of something else? Print out the picture and stuff it into your letterboxing bag. Keep it handy. You never know when you will stumble onto a hidden castle in the sky.<br/>
<br/>
*******************************************************************<br/>
<br/>
That wording will be followed by a description of how to find the box by starting at the base of the tree in the picture. <br/>
<br/>
What do you think?<br/>
<br/>
I think it will be interesting to see how long it takes some of these boxes to be found. I already have three or four locations in mind.<br/>
