yesterday I got a new winner.   It seems my box placed in St. Marteen <br/>
was attempted by someone from a cruise ship.   They searched the <br/>
location, but only found the zip lock bag.  No box, no stamp, just the <br/>
bag, and some contents.  They opened the bag to find a map, and some <br/>
pirate booty.  It seems some pirate has taken my box, and left a map on <br/>
how to find it.   The Letterboxer did not have time to do this, so for <br/>
now this will be an unsolved mistery.  I guess pirates went after it <br/>
since it was named "2007 Texas Sailing Adventure".   ARGH!!!<br/>

<div>I hate that someone messed with your Sailing Adventure box, but it does sound intriguing. I'd probably have missed my ship by having to follow that map!</div>
