<br/>
****Oh my!  I truly, truly spend much of my life<br/>
barefooted, but I DO wear shoes on the trail! <br/>
<br/>
A few months ago my family was on a really nice trail<br/>
and heading back toward the car when my son decided he<br/>
had to go to the bathroom, so he double-timed it out<br/>
of the woods.  He had begged me to let him take his<br/>
shoes off (and truthfully, I was on the verge of<br/>
taking my own off too because it was a beautiful day<br/>
and the trail was so clear), but I had told him to<br/>
keep them on.<br/>
<br/>
As we walked on, our daughter was slightly ahead and a<br/>
movement on the trail caught her attention - a snake<br/>
striking repeatedly at her!  It was a very small snake<br/>
- a baby really - but it's back had been broken and it<br/>
was scared and striking at anything that moved.  As we<br/>
examined it, we realized it was a baby copperhead!  My<br/>
son had apparently stepped on it as he ran past.<br/>
<br/>
That was enough to convince me - keep those stinking<br/>
shoes on, no matter what!<br/>

all this talk of flip flops and fire ants and snakes just convinced <br/>
me I have to share my "shoeless" adventure I had last week in Port <br/>
Aransas. <br/>
 First of all, I planted a box there as I noticed before I left for <br/>
there, that none of the boxes previously planted there have survived-<br/>
I hope mine fares better-we'll see. <br/>
 Then, my son and I were boogie-boarding in the Gulf.  I kept <br/>
remembering as I bobbed in the warm waters that the newspaper <br/>
reports of shark attacks always mention that the victim was in waist-<br/>
deep water..........................gulp!  So, while I was busy <br/>
watching for fins breaking the surface I didn't notice the GIANT <br/>
JELLYFISH at my feet!  30- seconds later I was running for shore, <br/>
begging my son to PEE ON MY FOOT!!!!!! as I had heard that was a <br/>
last resort for the pain if you didn't have any vinegar (as I <br/>
didn't).  Well, needless to say..............I had to endure the <br/>
pain for the next hour or so as my son was NOT going to do that <br/>
(even behind the dunes!)  "Mom, that is so gross!"<br/>
<br/>
On another note-I just want to reiterate how much I love this <br/>
group!  We took something that could have resulted in a flame war on <br/>
the big list (criticism of artistic stamp carving abilities) and <br/>
made it into a forum for uplifting and wonderful quotes and <br/>
philosophies on life and creativity and trying your best!<br/>
<br/>
Keep on boxing!<br/>

<div>Who would have thought that someone with the trail name "Barefoot Lucy" liked to go without shoes?!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>LOLOLOLOL!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Seriously, though, sometimes we do get too casual or comfortable, and forget that the trail is NOT our back patio, and your experience really points out that even a nice, clean, well-maintained trail can have sudden dangers.</div>

<div>Thanks for pointing out how the group handled the "artistic stamp" issue. I love this group for exactly this reason- we do not flame each other!
