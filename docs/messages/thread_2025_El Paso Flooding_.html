<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I guess a lot of you have heard the news about the 
flooding in El Paso.  Yeah - its true.  Some of it was bad.  
Surprisingly - the worst of it seems to have been on the mountain side, NOT in 
the low areas.<br/><br/>We are living on an island.  The water in out street 
would have needed to get 2 ft deeper to have come in the house.  The back 
yard was a puddle, but drained well into the street.  1/2 mile away the 
roads were impassible.  I saw about 6 inches of the top of one of the 
orange traffic barrels sticking up in what was supposed to be the middle of the 
street.  I went a different way.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I left the jeep in the garage and used the 
van.  It sits higher than most pick-ups, so it fords well, and has a real 
clear view of the road ahead.  One thing people never consider when fording 
it your fan.  When it hits the water, it will pull itself forward into your 
radiator.  This is why electric fans are so popular in jeeps - you can turn 
it off for fording.  The van has the IC-901A on 144, 220, 440, and 1200 - 
so it has good commo with the house all around town.<br/><br/>We picked up about 
50 sandbags - just in case - to block the doors etc if we need to.<br/><br/>The 
newest danger in is Juarez.  There is a dam there that was near to 
bursting.  The Army corp. of engineers went in to Mexico to assess 
it.  Not good.  The city implemented mandatory evacuation for the 
areas down-stream of it.</font></p>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">Bottom line - we are safe.  Other than a few 
leaks discovered in the roof, nothing to cry about.  We have a pretty 
complete bug-out kit for disasters, and it is ready to go.  Load it and the 
dogs, and hit the road.</font></div>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm glad to hear y'all are okay.  When I first heard it was raining in El Paso, I was ready to pop off a "It's raining so much in El Paso..." thing at you, until I realized how bad it was.  I can't even remember it now.  Y'all out there have been in our family's thoughts and prayers for the last few days.  Between Saint Louis and now El Paso and the various other flooding places, you just have to wonder why we can't average all that rain out across the country and all be happy.
