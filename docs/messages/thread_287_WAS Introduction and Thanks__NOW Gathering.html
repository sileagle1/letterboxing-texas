you or anyone else new to the TX letterboxing list is seeking info:<br>

Silver Eagle is apparently the one who organizes the TX gatherings, and<br>
I believe tentatively the next one will be at Brazos Bend State Park on<br>
March 19th.<br>
Here's the link to that park:<br>

I'm sure he'll be providing more information as the date draws nearer.<br>
Hope to meet you then!<br>

<br>
Hi,<br>
I'd love to go to a gathering in Tx. Is there info on it someplace? <br>
If I know far ahead enough, I could probably go. <br>
<br>
There are a grand total of four in Manhattan. The hitchhiker that is <br>
listed is no longer in Central Park. No one seems to know anything <br>
about it. *I* want to place some here but find it very hard trying <br>
to decide on a place I think will be safe. So far I haven't met the <br>
challenge.<br>
