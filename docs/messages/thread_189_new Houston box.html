                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to let you all know that I just posted the clues to a <br>
new Houston box called HAPPY BIRTHDAY BOX.  I actually planted it as <br>
a gift for my sister's birthday, and hadn't gotten around to posting <br>
the clues yet.  Then I got an e mail from a guy who had found it by <br>
accident, and he wrote to ask what letterboxing was all about.  He <br>
said that he was going to try it out, that he had never heard of it <br>
before and thought it sounded interesting.<br>
<br>
We haven't been doing too much letterboxing latley because we have <br>
had visitors from South America staying with us for the last month.  <br>
If you all think it is difficult trying to explain it to you friends <br>
and family, all I have to say is try explaining it in a second <br>
language!  We hope to be getting out soon, we have one we are waiting <br>
to plant in Brazos Bend. - Mother of Four<br>
