what is turning into a military expedition as we<br/>
prepare for our Dallas letterboxing trip this weekend!<br/>
 Our fellers left this morning for their 26 mile hike<br/>
in Arkansas, so we are on our own!  We are leaving<br/>
tomorrow evening and will be gone until Saturday.  <br/>
I know that we have more boxes picked than we can<br/>
find, but hopefully we'll be able to make it all over<br/>
the metroplex - look for our stamps soon in a box near<br/>
you!  <br/>
<br/>
We had a wonderful weekend last weekend - took<br/>
Lightning to his first karate tournament in Tulsa and<br/>
turned the weekend into a letterboxing weekend as a<br/>
bonus.  It WAS my birthday weekend after all, and<br/>
that's what I wanted to do! <br/>
<br/>
We left home a little late Friday evening, passing<br/>
through Paris around 9:00 p.m.  Scoped out the<br/>
Passport Series box there and decided we were hitting<br/>
it at a good time, so we went ahead and snagged it -<br/>
imagine our surprise to find we were the FF's!  Even<br/>
GG hadn't ventured up that way to catch it.  It was a<br/>
nicely done box - way to go Catpawz!<br/>
<br/>
We made our way on up to Tulsa and finally rolled into<br/>
a hotel room about 1:00 a.m.  After what seemed like<br/>
ever so slight of a nap, we headed to the tournament,<br/>
only to find out it started an hour later than our<br/>
dojo had announced, so we were bummed to hear we<br/>
could've had another hour's sleep.  We had a great<br/>
time at the tournament in spite of being tired, then<br/>
found a little hole in the wall restaurant, Ed's All<br/>
American Coneys, and grabbed a bite to eat.  We had<br/>
seen Ed's advertised on the bulletin board at the<br/>
church where the tournament was held and decided a<br/>
good ol hot dog was just right for a mid-afternoon<br/>
lunch.  Now we like to pride ourselves on being<br/>
friendly here in Texas - but I can't recall the last<br/>
time I had the red carpet rolled out for me the way<br/>
Ed's Wife rolled it out for my family.  She was<br/>
Texas-friendly without being intrusive and we wound up<br/>
telling her our story and heard hers, and she even<br/>
walked us to the door as we left.  I wished I had had<br/>
a box looking for a home with me, because I would've<br/>
left it in Ed's and Ed's Wife care. I vote here and<br/>
now to make Ed's Wife an honorary Texan!<br/>
<br/>
I had done careful calculations and knew that Oxley<br/>
Nature Center and Mohawk Park were going to give us<br/>
the greatest payoff box-wise, so we headed off in that<br/>
direction.  We had a couple hours of daylight, but<br/>
even less time before we would get locked into the<br/>
parking lot, so we decided to make good on one trail<br/>
only that day and come back the next day. <br/>
Unfortunately, Baby Bear's box had been reported<br/>
missing, but Silver Eagle's box was there on the trail<br/>
with another box by a local.  We found the local box<br/>
first and I was shocked to see how rough it looked<br/>
after a couple years in the wild.  I also expected to<br/>
find that Oklahoma boxes were pretty lonely, but I was<br/>
greatly surprised to find that wasn't the case at all.<br/>
 There were lots of stamps from all over the place<br/>
there, but not very many familiar stamps at all!  We<br/>
went on to find Silver Eagle's box, and it was in<br/>
pretty rough shape too!  It too was 2 years old, so<br/>
I'm wondering if the rugged condition of both boxes<br/>
was due to the harsher climate in Oklahoma or the fact<br/>
that they were both relatively old boxes.  SE's box<br/>
was also much visited, and I found it comforting to<br/>
see his familiar style as we ventured off into what<br/>
was for us uncharted territory.<br/>
<br/>
We got up the next morning and didn't get out as<br/>
quickly as I would've liked (our daughter, Elmo, was<br/>
with us and while she is doing much better, she is<br/>
still really slow getting started in the morning), but<br/>
we managed to hit the trail at Mohawk Park with<br/>
several hours to box before we had to go.  We took a<br/>
wrong turn getting back to Oxley, but we found<br/>
ourselves in the area where Safari Man's series was<br/>
placed.  We went ahead and got most of that series<br/>
before heading back to Oxley.  Safari Man's boxes were<br/>
a lot of fun and I find his carving style to be<br/>
intriguing.  We were becoming aware of our time<br/>
constraints, but we were getting painfully near a<br/>
landmark, so we didn't want to quit.  <br/>
<br/>
After such a good run at Safari Man's series, we were<br/>
hyped up and ready to get Donna's Oxley series - and<br/>
that's when we hit a dead-end.  It was as though we<br/>
were reading the clues and not understanding them.  It<br/>
has to be one of the strangest things I've encountered<br/>
while letterboxing.  I may not always jive with<br/>
someone's clues, but usually someone else in my family<br/>
does, so that one of us can take the lead and find the<br/>
box no matter what.  It just wasn't the case with<br/>
these clues - we didn't get a single box after we<br/>
arrived at the Nature Center.  We searched and didn't<br/>
find over and over again, becoming more frustrated<br/>
with every box we attempted.  Now let me say - I KNOW<br/>
these boxes are doable because Silver Eagle told me<br/>
what a great series it was.  And since it may be a bit<br/>
of a spoiler to tell you why I know they weren't<br/>
missing, I'll just say I'm fairly certain they were in<br/>
place.  It was US - maybe because we were really<br/>
fatigued, maybe because we were feeling the time<br/>
pressure, maybe the boxes just weren't our style. <br/>
Despite the fact we didn't hit our mark and we missed<br/>
several boxes we tried for, the location is absolutely<br/>
phenomenal and we had a great four mile hike (left<br/>
Elmo in the car for that - she was up to a half mile<br/>
or a little better, but we had done her in with<br/>
that!).  We found the Nature Center to be very<br/>
informative and the staff every bit as friendly as<br/>
Ed's Wife.  Also, while hiking we got to see a<br/>
red-tailed hawk catch and eat it's lunch.  Very cool -<br/>
he flew not even six feet off our right sides as he<br/>
whisked his meal back to the treetops.  Don't be<br/>
discouraged by our failure to find these boxes - if<br/>
you are ever in the Tulsa area, go for them!  <br/>
<br/>
SO - lessons learned from our excursion last weekend. <br/>
Read the clues well, even the parts that seem<br/>
irrelevant.  I learned I really like having a<br/>
confirming clue to support the main clue (this must be<br/>
the accountant in me - you know, double-entry<br/>
bookkeeping - something to balance against).  And<br/>
finally, read your clues in advance so you can do any<br/>
research you need, especially if you are on unfamiliar<br/>
turf - one clue told us the box was behind a bur oak<br/>
tree, which was well and good until we realized none<br/>
of us knew what a bur oak was!<br/>

<br/>
We had a wonderful weekend last weekend  <br/>
<br/>
Sounds like a fun trip.  Let me tell you about our return from the Tucson<br/>
Dog Show last weekend.  It too was a fun trip.  This is the "REPORT" I sent<br/>
to our friends upon our return.<br/>
<br/>
Most of you know we were traveling to Tucson for the dog shows at the<br/>
fairgrounds over the weekend. Moni does the dog shows for real. I just play<br/>
at it. As long as Parker is having fun we play . But since I am getting more<br/>
active in radio again, I do enjoy the ride. <br/>
<br/>
In our free time, Moni lets me do other stuff. Like Geocaching and<br/>
Letterboxing. If you don't know what they are by now, go here: <br/>

<br/>
On the road - she drives (her van anyway). And I play navigator - ham radio<br/>
operator - GPS operator..... I also serve drinks and food etc. On the way<br/>
TO  the shows she discovered she left her Letterboxing kit at home. <sigh><br/>
So she missed out on the "Lordsburg" and "The Thing" Letterboxes on the trip<br/>
TO Tucson.  <br/>
<br/>
The dogs did well.  Sammy won her class all three days.  Parker got a<br/>
qualifying score every day, and got THIRD on Friday.  For a Great Dane to<br/>
place that high in an all-breed shoe against the snappy little dogs is<br/>
fantastic!  We had a great time Geocaching inside the city late Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
We like to sight-see on the return trip. So I planned the return trip to hit<br/>
some letterboxes. The Javelina Letterbox and Bisbee Box to be exact. You can<br/>
read the clues here: <br/>

http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=18228&amp;boxname=Bisbee_Box <br/>
<br/>
Since we needed a break (for the dogs) <grin> I planned the breaks to snag<br/>
the letterboxes at the breaks.  After these, I planned for us to shoot for<br/>
home. <br/>
<br/>
As I read the clues for the Javelina Letterbox, I thought it was somewhere<br/>
before Tombstone. Surely before Bisbee. Well, there was LOTS of construction<br/>
on 80, and I figured we missed the  first clue or it was removed or<br/>
something. By the time we got to Bisbee, I had wadded up the clues for<br/>
Javelina Letterbox and tossed them on the floor.  Maybe next time....<br/>
<br/>
Without giving up too much - we found the Bisbee Box just fine. The "PARK"<br/>
clue wasn't very clear. There is more than one park in Bisbee, and there is<br/>
one that better meets the clue than the one intended.  But the "BREWERY<br/>
GULCH" clue was spot-on. Moni parked the van to hide where the letterbox was<br/>
hidden. She took Parker and Sammy out of the van. Pretty soon everyone was<br/>
around the dogs, and nobody saw me when I pulled out the letterbox. I took<br/>
it to the van, stamped up, and re-hid it again before joining Moni and the<br/>
dogs. We had a great time walking the Great Danes around Bisbee. They always<br/>
make people run. Some run away from us - others run toward us! Had we known<br/>
then that Javelina Letterbox was still ahead, we would not have wasted so<br/>
much time in Bisbee. So when we had enough, we broke off contact with the<br/>
crowd around the dogs, and headed to Douglas and back to I-10 and home.  <br/>
<br/>
I made several contacts on the Bisbee repeaters on the way to Douglas. In<br/>
Douglas I switched over to the EARS system and chatted a bit more. The radio<br/>
got a REAL WORKOUT. More on that later. Out Douglas - still on 80 now going<br/>
north. Somewhere before Rodeo I picked up the Mega-Link on 145.170.  <br/>
<br/>
If you look at a map - 80 starts at Benson AZ, swings southeast to Douglas<br/>
on the border, then back northeast to Road Forks NM. So we were still on 80.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Now picture this. We are cruising up 80 at 65 mph headed for Road Forks. I<br/>
am talking to someone on the ham radio. I shout to Moni "What did that sign<br/>
say? Quick - go back!"  <br/>
<br/>
 THE FIRST CLUE !!!!!   <br/>
<br/>
Ah-ha!!! Where did I toss the clues????? Got them! A village named "DOOR".<br/>
Was this it? It looked promising.  <br/>
<br/>
We talked it over. We had spent so much time in Bisbee because we gave up on<br/>
this one and now it was near sunset. I punched up the GPS for sunset time.<br/>
1.5 hours at the most and it would be dark. Should we? Moni says "Lets see<br/>
how far we get, we can always come back later". God love her! <br/>
