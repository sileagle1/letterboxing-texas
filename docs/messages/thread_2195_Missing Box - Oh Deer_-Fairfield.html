                    <html><body><div>Well I'm terribly upset today!  I received a message from Blue Butterfly about her and Lucy Locket's jaunt yesterday.  I'm sure y'all saw LL's post to say they were going boxing yesterday, and apparently one of the places they stopped was Fairfield State Park because BB hadn't yet found the boxes there.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One of the things she said is that she couldn't find my Oh Deer! box.  Because Lucy Locket has found that box before, and because both BB and LL are diligent seekers who are very good at searching and don't give up easily, I consider this a reliable missing report for my box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've always considered that box to be my first successful box.  It was my third to plant, and although I eventually replanted Killough Monument, I only did that after Oh Deer had been up and running well for awhile.  I believe it was a good hide (it had lasted two years after all!) and really expected it to last a long time more.  I only wish I had gotten the logbook, which was likely very full.
</div>

<div>Fearless Fox and Lightning are going to be passing through Fairfield in a few hours on their return from a scout campout.  I so want to call and ask him to stop and check and then, I don't know, have a little memorial service for my box at the site?  Does that sound a little over the edge to ask my LSS to do?  Still and all, he and Lightning will be upset too, since they also held their breaths countless times with me while we checked to see if anyone had logged in to that box!
