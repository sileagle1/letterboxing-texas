What about the "windmill" or the "train car" (don't know if those would work<br/>
or not, maybe too well manicured), Mission Valley?  Don't know if there is<br/>
anywhere to plant in these places, but I don't believe there are any around<br/>
there.  Colleto Creek Res?  (maybe not actually IN the park as it is<br/>
expensive to enter), Fannin? Bloomington? any of the "mansions"?<br/>
<br/>
CalicoRose is brainstorming<br/>

Sadly, the train is no longer with us. The good news is that it has <br/>
been relocated to Grapevine where it will actually be put back into <br/>
service. Horray! So anyone near there has a new box to make.<br/>
<br/>
I believe the windmill is scheduled to be relocated.  I'll hold off <br/>
on that one.<br/>
