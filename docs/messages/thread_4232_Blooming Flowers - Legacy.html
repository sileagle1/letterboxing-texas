She represented everything that makes a Texas woman special, just like all the other women on this List, and I can only hope that when my time comes I can go out with as much humor and courage as she did.  To me, her legacy is a reminder to live life to the fullest.<br/>

&gt; It's a sad day for us in Texas letterboxing.  She represented the spirit of<br/>
