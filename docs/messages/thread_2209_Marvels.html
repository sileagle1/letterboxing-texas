I'm just seeking a little feedback about the box<br/>
Marvels, if anyone has any.  This one has been placed<br/>
for three months and is still not-found, which is<br/>
rather longer than any of my other boxes I've ever<br/>
placed so far, for the first time to be found.  Is<br/>
there something about this box that has turned people<br/>
away from it?<br/>
<br/>
Just curious,<br/>

<br/>
What you need to know is that in general, any boxes that aren't t<br/>
simple and straightforward, whether puzzle such as Marvels or one with<br/>
a longer hike get MUCH less traffic than those with straightforward<br/>
clues or a short walk.  I have a mystery box not very far away from<br/>
another box.  I've had to replace the logbook on the non-mystery; the<br/>
mystery has only had 5 finders.  On another mystery box, people have<br/>
to walk past mine to get to another box.  But plenty of finders don't<br/>
realize that and never stop at mine.  I am okay with that, because I<br/>
like providing boxes for those who like a challenge.  You know that if<br/>
you solve it, your reward will be a nice carve that will happily<br/>
remind you of your efforts (and it gives you something to do on<br/>
laundry day, right Mother of Five?)<br/>
<br/>
If you keep planting mystery boxes, the finders in your area get more<br/>
sophisticated with their clue-solving.  And, I find that people are<br/>
appreciative of the boxes they have to work for a bit, whether through<br/>
a hike or a intricate cipher.   <br/>
<br/>
But, puzzles and the like are just not for everyone.  If you're not<br/>
okay with fewer finders, you should definitely change the clues.  Each<br/>
box has its audience.  <br/>
<br/>
As an aside, I hope to plant yet another mystery box tomorrow for<br/>
Mystery Box Planting day so look for it--clues to debut on Saturday.<br/>

<div>As someone who loves 
puzzle boxes I can say that when someone does find that box, the stamp will be 
one of their favorites, a reminder of all the work they went through to solve 
the clues.  I have stamped some of dewberry's more evil creations in my 
logbook on several pages, I was so happy to finally be holding the stamp in my 
hand!  There could be other reasons no one has found it yet, I have a stack 
of puzzle clues I have solved, but have yet to go and actually find the 
boxes.  School has started, schedules get busier, and time to go 
letterboxing becomes limited.  Don't give up on puzzle clues, but don't 
expect as many finders as on a more simple box.  I have one box that has 
had only one finder, and may never have another.  That is just fine with 
me, I placed the box with dewberry in mind, hoping to create a puzzle that would 
drive her as nuts as hers have done to me.  While as far as I know she is 
still sane, she did have to work a little bit on the clues, and it was sort of a 
thank you to her for all her amazing puzzles.  (The box is the "Tree 
Hugger"..come on Silver Eagle and Sea Dove, I know you two like puzzles 
too!)  Come on down to Houston and give us some of those great puzzles, 
we'll find 'em!  MO5</div></body></html>

<div> </div>
<div>I've had one eye on Marvels and I have it on my list of boxes next time I box Nac, but I have been swamped since it was first listed and haven't had a chance to sit down and work out the clues.  In fact, that's one reason I haven't yet gone back and cleaned up Nac (there are about 10 boxes down there now that I don't have) - I wanted to wait until I had a chance to work out Marvels so I could get it while I was getting the others.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Don't get discouraged though - as Dewberry and MO5 have told you, puzzle boxes are lower traffic, but higher reward.  The problem I have with puzzle boxes or mystery boxes, especially hard ones, is that once I solve them, the actual finding is kind of anti-climactic.  I solved SP several months ago but have yet to go log it.
