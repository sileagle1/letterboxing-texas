That's great you will be able to make it.  I hope to<br/>
call Bastrop today and reserve the Group Picnic Pavilion,<br/>
then I will make the official announcement of the event.<br/>
I haven't thought of all the details yet but was roughly<br/>
planning on starting at 11:00 am so people driving in that<br/>
morning will have time to arrive.  We can then meet and<br/>
exchange stamps for awhile, then eat, then letterbox.  <br/>
Hopefully we will have the Pavilion all day so can use it<br/>
as a base to meet in between letterboxing.  I will bring a <br/>
pot of chili, bowls and spoons, and I guess others can bring<br/>
whatever they want to drink and any other food items<br/>
they want to share.  I plan on camping with my family and if <br/>
any of you are going to camp I suggest you make reservations<br/>
now.  The pavilion is in the Copperas Creek Campground if <br/>
you want to be close but I think it has electric sites, not <br/>
for tents.  For more information on the park go to:<br/>
<br/>
http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/park/bastrop/<br/>
<br/>
Baby Bear will be carving the Event Stamp that will only<br/>
be available during this event, so anyone participating<br/>
will be part of history!  If anyone has any ideas of how<br/>
to make the event better, please let me or the group know.<br/>
I have only been to 2 events (in Washington State) and they<br/>
were more like informal gatherings, but I liked it that way<br/>
since there was more time to talk to people.<br/>
If you plan on placing a box while at the event, be sure to<br/>
bring pen and paper so you can write the clues for the rest<br/>
of us to follow that day if possible.  There are already 7<br/>
boxes in that park and 2 nearby, not to mention several in<br/>
the Austin area, so there should be plenty of boxes for<br/>
everyone to find.<br/>
Hopefully the weather will be nice, but the Pavilion is<br/>
covered so we can still meet even if it rains.<br/>
Looking forward to meeting my fellow Texas letterboxers!<br/>

<div>I'm really looking forward to this Bastrop event.  I just hope like the dickens that I can come.  Of course, I've never been to an event like this, but have been to other gatherings...Soapmaking gatherings and rubberstamping gatherings.  I'd love to help plan this, if you need any help with it.</div>

                    <html><body><div>These are some good ideas!!   I now plan on bringing my pink block and carving tools, pictures from letterboxing trips Silver Eagle and I have taken, and would love to here everyone's stories about boxes they found (I know we have some good ones - be sure to ask Silver Eagle about the Scorpion!).   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One more thing.  Just so no one is surprised at the gathering, Baby Bear (that is me) is a MALE.   The name comes from camping trips taken years ago with our family, so I thought it would be good name to use.   Needless to say it has given people the wrong mental picture.   Also, my brother is Silver Eagle (he did not want to use his camping nick name of Bubba Bear).   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Look forward to meeting everyone, but if you can't make it I'm sure I'll be finding your boxes in the future.  <br/><br/><b><i>Susan Tashiro &lt;ssmith043@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>
