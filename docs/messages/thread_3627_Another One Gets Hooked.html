Sweet little Strawberry introduced me into LBing back in April. I must <br/>
say I've become rather addicted to the hobby, and even roped my poor <br/>
mother into the whole mess (She's 'I'm the Vampire' on Atlas Quest. I'm <br/>
encouraging her to get online to log her finds - maybe one day.).<br/>
Anyways, I'm no more than two months into this whole ordeal, but it has <br/>
been very worthwhile project and hobby! I have found 34 boxes, <br/>
attempted 6 and even planted one box last week in Trophy Club.<br/>
Anyways, I just wanted to drop a love note into the group and say hi.<br/>
