This was on April 8th.  I do not know if she actually passed away that night or if at all but I know some of you have heard about Barney and his wonderful artistic talent.  JB Kokopelli also has a letterbox toilet seat in Barney's museum which is how I first heard at this wonderful man and his museum.  For those of you who haven't heard about it before it's located just outside of San Antonio.  I was fortunate to go see Barney and his museum a couple of years ago while in the area to attend a bowling tournament.  Barney is 92 now and very spry for his age and smart too.  If you get an opportunity to go please do it soon as you never know how much longer he'll be around.  <br/>

If anyone has heard for sure about Barney's wife can you please let us know. <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Corozon for the information.  Another recent geocaching thread as of May 5th said that Barney was anxiously awaiting the arrival of a nurse for his wife so it looks like she had not passed as previously suspected.  This doesn't mean that she has now not passed.<br/>
<br/>
I appreciate your response and I will keep the group notified as I get more information. <br/>
