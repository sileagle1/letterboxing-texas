                    <div class="plaintext-content">I usually get the messages from the group in a digest, but today I <br/>
decided to check what was going on.  THE TOUR BUS IS IN MY <br/>
NEIGHBORHOOD!!  So out we went.  As we pulled up to the parking area <br/>
there was a man and his todler son leaving and I was sure we missed the <br/>
bus because just before he loaded up he put a small camo cooler type <br/>
box in the back of his truck.  We decided to just check to make sure.  <br/>
After they left we walked down the trail and there is was.  YEA!<br/>
<br/>
We just got home and it has started raining.  Not something we see <br/>
around here lately.  These passengers have been very lucky lately to <br/>
miss the fire and now the rain!  All looks good and dry - we can't wait <br/>
to see who all is on the bus.<br/>
<br/>
I guess I have to learn this carving thing, since I have yet to do <br/>
one.  Looks like my first will be on the bus!!  I will have questions <br/>
when I get to that point and know that you all will give me some <br/>
guidance!  I'm looking forward to getting to bus moving soon!<br/>
