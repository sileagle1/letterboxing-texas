fun to meet you and your families!  It was a treat to return to <br>
Mercer and pick up some new boxes.  As I'm on very slow and <br>
expensive dial up interent that ties up mom's phone line I won't be <br>
sending out too many individual emails for now so I hope this <br>
summary will keep all up to date for now.  Here are our recent finds:<br>
Tall Pine Quilt Block (found Bigfoot HH here)<br>
Drip Drip Drop<br>
Livingston Largemouth<br>
The Jig<br>
Udder Madness (yeehaw!)<br>
Hank Hill<br>
Old Jail stamp by Boots Tex - we couldn't do the 2nd box across the <br>
road, someone was working nearby.  But I think I could see it, might <br>
it be exposed?<br>
A Night at Double Lake - this one was sitting out ON a shrub, beside <br>
the trail!!!!  We rehid it.<br>
Couldn't find "Gone Fishin" by Baby Bear and "Treasure" by Ashby.  <br>
Both may be missing.<br>
Yesterday we found these at Mercer: Pinata box, Ssssnake Sssstory, <br>
Santas Got a Sweettooth, Backward Box, Grandmother's Flower Garden <br>
Quilt Block, and the Panda.  We also hid a box for you to find, <br>
watch LBNA for the clues!<br>
We hope to find a few more boxes in the area before we have to <br>
leave.  Norasta & Guitarzan<br>
