I guess this is the final report.  Justin didn't even make the first <br>
cut.  He was eliminated in the first round.  Hey - these are the top <br>
Great Danes in the nation.  Just being here was honor enough.<br>
<br>
So our total is:<br>
<br>
1 trophy for 1st place (Justin in Rally Obedience)<br>
1 trophy for 3rd place (Sammy in puppy class)<br>
1 gold ribbon (Parker for new title - RN)<br>
1 blue ribbon (Justin in Rally Obedience)<br>
1 yellow ribbon (Sammy in puppy class)<br>
2 green ribbons (Parker and Justin for qualitying scores in Rally <br>
Obedience)<br>
<br>
The good news is that the dog who won the points from Justin is the <br>
son of my dog's brother.  He belongs to my wife's best friend.  It was <br>
the last points he needed to earn his championship.  How fitting that <br>
he is finished at the national finals.  He will compete for Best Of <br>
Breed tomorrow.  This lady is on her 4th round with cancer, so I am <br>
glad she won.  Somehow we don't mind losing to her.  And since my wife <br>
had a lot to do with that breding, she gets some of the credit too.<br>
<br>
Me and Parker - we are going out after lunch.... seems there are about <br>
4 geocaches within walking distance of the show grounds.  <br>
<br>
We depart for Goodyear AZ tomorrow right after Best Of Breed judging <br>
here.  Two more days of showing, then we are on our way back home.  So <br>
far we are quite pleased.  Many will leave here with nothing.  We have <br>
some fine dogs.  Mighty fine.  Of course, Parker is the finest!  <br>
<grin>  He is probably dreaming of lunch right now....<br>
<br>
I will be disconnecting at noon here, may not be back up till we are <br>
home.  Unless the Motel-8 in Goodyear has internet connectivity in the <br>
rooms.<br>
<br>
Y-all have a GREAT weekend.  I hope the weather holds well for the <br>
gathering.  Perhaps some day we will make it out that way too.<br>
<br>
Mike.  With Parker snoring away on the bed.<br>
