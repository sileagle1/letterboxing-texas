This talklist is now over 1 year old and I want to give a<br/>
public "Thank You" to Barefoot Lucy for creating it and <br/>
functioning as its main Moderator.  I have to admit that<br/>
at the time it was created I did not think Texas was ready<br/>
for a Talklist just for them, since there were only about<br/>
10 letterboxers in the whole state.  Happily, I couldn't<br/>
have been more mistaken.  Right after it was created, TX<br/>
letterboxing started taking off and this list has been a<br/>
big part of that.  At a time when I was growing tired of<br/>
the fights on the Main Talklist and the fear that I might<br/>
post something "wrong", this list provided a comfortable<br/>
place to talk freely and I appreciate that.  Not to mention<br/>
it provides a much better way to communicate things like<br/>
Events and box status to fellow TX boxers.  Last year I<br/>
had to put together an email list of every boxer that had<br/>
emailed me about my boxes in order to notify them of the<br/>
first TX LB Event.  Now it is so much easier.  So Happy <br/>
Birthday TX Talklist, and here's to another great year!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well that's just nifty, isn't it?  It's hard to<br/>
believe the list is already a year old!  I thought<br/>
y'all might get a kick out of how I got around to<br/>
setting this list up...<br/>
<br/>
I wish I could say that when I set the list up, I did<br/>
it with a strong sense of purpose and determination, <br/>
but the truth is - I was more pondering and playing<br/>
around than anything.  I was fairly new to<br/>
letterboxing and (I know y'all will find this hard to<br/>
believe) there was a flame war in full swing when I<br/>
joined the big list - talk about intimidating!  Yes, I<br/>
know, it's hard to imagine, but everyone was fighting<br/>
over there!  <br/>
<br/>
I was fascinated by boxing, and I really wanted a<br/>
better outlet for learning about the pasttime than the<br/>
big list, but I didn't know if any Texas boxers would<br/>
really be interested in helping little ol' me or if<br/>
they would even be interested in helping each other. <br/>
I knew who Silver Eagle and Baby Bear were because<br/>
they had planted the only boxes within reach of me,<br/>
and I knew BusyBee because she had welcomed me when I<br/>
posted my intro on the big list, but as far as I knew,<br/>
they were the only three "real" letterboxers in Texas<br/>
and I was faking it til I figured it out!  Now this is<br/>
not meant to slight those other letterboxers who<br/>
really were out there too, that was just my perception<br/>
at the time, based on my very limited knowledge!  I<br/>
guess I kind of had this image of them being three<br/>
letterboxing yodas - masters of the tupperware<br/>
force...  <br/>
<br/>
About the time I joined the big list, a few other<br/>
Texas newbies joined, so I suspected I might not be<br/>
the only one overwhelmed.  I set the list up, then<br/>
hesitated to publicize it because I didn't want to get<br/>
shot down.  Well, I let it simmer a bit, and almost<br/>
forgot about it until BusyBee stumbled upon it.  She<br/>
requested to join, but I didn't get her request for a<br/>
few days because I wasn't tending the list.  I really<br/>
only found her request because I was working on<br/>
another list I help moderate.<br/>
<br/>
I remember gulping nervously when I saw her request,<br/>
then deciding "what the heck" - if the list fails,<br/>
who's gonna know it besides me and the others who<br/>
might want to join.  I accepted her request, but I put<br/>
off publicizing the list.  Finally, BusyBee kicked me<br/>
in the rear end (in her own nice way) and urged me to<br/>
announce the list on the big list.  She also suggested<br/>
I get in touch with Silver Eagle and Baby Bear because<br/>
they were thinking of scheduling a gathering.  Again,<br/>
I gulped, because these were the guys who were bigger<br/>
than life to me.  I emailed them and sure enough they<br/>
joined my little list, and next thing I knew, so were<br/>
other folks!  And then we started talking - wow!  And<br/>
everyone was soooo nice - WOW!  And I was learning by<br/>
leaps and bounds and everyone else seemed to be too -<br/>
WOOOOWWW!<br/>
<br/>
I laugh now when I look back at how insecure I was<br/>
about this list.  It's okay - y'all can laugh at me<br/>
too.  It was silly, wasn't it?  We are the warmest,<br/>
most friendly e-group I've ever belonged to.  When<br/>
things get heated on the big list, this is a great<br/>
place to depressurize.  I've noticed that we go quiet<br/>
sometimes, then suddenly everyone starts talking - I<br/>
like that.  Everyone has a "go for it" attitude and<br/>
encourages one another, no one seems to feel<br/>
threatened by others.  No one gets shot down because<br/>
they aren't as prolific as others.  Newbies can take<br/>
the targets off their chests and relax here (I like<br/>
the newboxers list for that too!). <br/>
<br/>
I want to thank Silver Eagle for agreeing to help<br/>
moderate this list.  Once I knew this list was going<br/>
to be here to stay, I realized it would be a shame for<br/>
it to suffer if I were to ever lose my password or get<br/>
hit by a bus or run over by a letterboxing pteradactyl<br/>
(there ya go Hawk - howzabout that for a box?), so I<br/>
asked him to help make sure it keeps going by being<br/>
able to manage the list along with me.  Not that y'all<br/>
are that hard to manage - far from it!  In fact, I'm<br/>
sure he would agree that we are kind of like the<br/>
Maytag man - not much to do except approve new<br/>
members...<br/>
<br/>
What else has happened in the last year?  How about a<br/>
great gathering organized by Silver Eagle with an<br/>
awesome stamp carved by Baby Bear?  And those great<br/>
t-shirts Ruby pulled together for all of us, and Jeff<br/>
of Birds of a Feather put together the most awesome<br/>
database yet known to letterboxing.  Don't forget that<br/>
Silver Eagle revamped our map too.  <br/>
<br/>
And of course, every one of us who has labored to<br/>
plant a box in the last year has participated in<br/>
seeding the legacy...and everyone who has appreciated<br/>
the pursuit of a box has fueled the flame.<br/>
<br/>
I feel truly honored to have been around Texas<br/>
letterboxing for the past year - it has come a long<br/>
way!  And together we are a formidable force!<br/>

Hmmmmmm...Hawks are a bit intimidated by pteradactyls,<br/>
I think. Maybe it'll have to be a baby pteradactyl<br/>

<div>I think it's great that you wanted to set the list up, and that letterboxing in my home state is growing in leaps and bounds, though I haven't contributed to it since those first two boxes. I haven't been able to make another trip back to my home town since. But they're still alive and well. </div>

Uh, sorry to show my ignorance... Are you saying that the CURRENT LBNA Texas Map is the one that this group requested to have re-drawn?  I thought we were still waiting for that to happen...  the map that I remember fondly from Silver Eagle doesn’t quite match the reality of what I’m still seeing on LBNA.<br/>

through a lack of effort on Silver Eagle's part - and<br/>
I'm sure it will eventually be there.  Drawing from<br/>
the foggy recesses of my mind, discussion on another<br/>
list awhile back was that Wes was wanting to get all<br/>
the changes in from all the regions.  I know that some<br/>
of the other regions got really bogged down in<br/>
semantics.  I wish he would go ahead and make the<br/>
changes he has, since it has been so long at this<br/>
point.<br/>
<br/>
I thought the map looked great after it was all done<br/>
(I know my own area is really awkward as it is drawn<br/>
now, and the new definition will be much nicer), and I<br/>
can't wait to see it on the LBNA site.<br/>
