they are wonderful! DrooP, BusyBeesFamily and BabyBear have created some<br/>
great stamps which just add to the fun of the whole game! <br/>
<br/>
DrooP - I love the way you interpreted the Jail - very creative!<br/>
<br/>
BusyBeesFamily - I have no idea how you carved a stamp and mailed it to me<br/>
(twice!!!) while creating that great CLUE notebook for us all!<br/>
<br/>
And special thanks to BabyBear, who very kindly stepped in at the last<br/>
minute to help out, took on a very tricky concept and executed it with such<br/>
wit &amp; skill!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone - can't wait for you guys to see these stamps!<br/>
