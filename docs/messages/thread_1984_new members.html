                    <html><body><div>Some might call him the patron saint of unfound boxes, and here's why...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let me preface my story with this - When I went and found my first box, it was in a park on a trail I had walked many, many times.  When I first heard of letterboxing and read the clue for THAT box, I could scarcely believe there could possibly be something hidden "that close" to where I had walked so many times.  But sure enough, I peeked where it said to peek, and there was the box.  I was blown away, but that was nothing compared to the feeling of seeing your very first visitor to one of your own boxes!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My first two boxes, Caldwell Zoo and the original Killough Monument went missing in a heartbeat, but I finally planted my very first solid box in Fairfield State Park.  Oh Deer! was GOOD (if I do say so myself, and I STILL think it's good) and I wanted someone else to find it and see how good it was!  I waited on email that someone had found my box (this was before all the kinks in the notification system on LBNA were worked out and before AQ ever existed).  And I waited.  And I waited.  And when I was in the area, I checked it.  Finally, I went to check it yet again, steeling myself for popping the top on the box AGAIN, opening the logbook AGAIN, turning the page AGAIN, and finding it - empty - AGAIN.  Yet, after seven months, I turned the page and it was - NOT EMPTY!  I saw the strangely encrypted highly unique stamp of Gryzzled Gryphon, who was not even a mystery man to the group yet!  He had apparently just started letterboxing, and we hadn't yet put it together what an enigma he was (and is).  But what was equally overwhelming was that GG's stamp wasn't alone - right in the book was also Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (whose stamps I knew because by then I had found several of their boxes and met them at the first Texas gathering), and they had been there the very day I was there checking it.  Now THAT'S a strange feeling!  I jerked my head up expecting to see them walking away from the box in the woods, but they were nowhere to be found, and I later learned that they had been on one of their thrill ride boxing weekends and had paused at my box before sunrise that morning.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finding that very first stamp in one of your own boxes is every bit as thrilling as finding your very first box.  It creates a strong sense of interconnection when suddenly you realize that someone else went and found your box just as you have found others.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As grateful as I am to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for planting boxes around me before I ever had a clue what they were doing, I'm also grateful to Gryzzled Gryphon for finally rescuing my poor lonely box from obscurity and making his mark there.  And my box is not alone - he has been the first, and in some cases, only finder of boxes for quite a long time at a stretch.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm afraid I might've been too discouraged to continue planting if I hadn't finally found those marks in that logbook on that day...</div>

<div><em><font color="#0000ff">... and I have to add to that, Lucy, that hearing 
from a letterboxer after they've found your box, whether it's the first one or 
not, is always a thrill for that same reason, especially if they add some 
information about their experience and you think you helped bring about that 
experience!   That's why I always like to contact the placers after 
I've found a box.  Besides, I know I also like to hear that my boxes are 
still out there and all is well (or if not, then I'm alerted to get out 
there and do something about it!)
