<div> </div>
<div>Let me preface my story with this - When I went and found my first box, it was in a park on a trail I had walked many, many times.  When I first heard of letterboxing and read the clue for THAT box, I could scarcely believe there could possibly be something hidden "that close" to where I had walked so many times.  But sure enough, I peeked where it said to peek, and there was the box.  I was blown away, but that was nothing compared to the feeling of seeing your very first visitor to one of your own boxes!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My first two boxes, Caldwell Zoo and the original Killough Monument went missing in a heartbeat, but I finally planted my very first solid box in Fairfield State Park.  Oh Deer! was GOOD (if I do say so myself, and I STILL think it's good) and I wanted someone else to find it and see how good it was!  I waited on email that someone had found my box (this was before all the kinks in the notification system on LBNA were worked out and before AQ ever existed).  And I waited.  And I waited.  And when I was in the area, I checked it.  Finally, I went to check it yet again, steeling myself for popping the top on the box AGAIN, opening the logbook AGAIN, turning the page AGAIN, and finding it - empty - AGAIN.  Yet, after seven months, I turned the page and it was - NOT EMPTY!  I saw the strangely encrypted highly unique stamp of Gryzzled Gryphon, who was not even a mystery man to the group yet!  He had apparently just started letterboxing, and we hadn't yet put it together what an enigma he was (and is).  But what was equally overwhelming was that GG's stamp wasn't alone - right in the book was also Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (whose stamps I knew because by then I had found several of their boxes and met them at the first Texas gathering), and they had been there the very day I was there checking it.  Now THAT'S a strange feeling!  I jerked my head up expecting to see them walking away from the box in the woods, but they were nowhere to be found, and I later learned that they had been on one of their thrill ride boxing weekends and had paused at my box before sunrise that morning.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finding that very first stamp in one of your own boxes is every bit as thrilling as finding your very first box.  It creates a strong sense of interconnection when suddenly you realize that someone else went and found your box just as you have found others.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As grateful as I am to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for planting boxes around me before I ever had a clue what they were doing, I'm also grateful to Gryzzled Gryphon for finally rescuing my poor lonely box from obscurity and making his mark there.  And my box is not alone - he has been the first, and in some cases, only finder of boxes for quite a long time at a stretch.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm afraid I might've been too discouraged to continue planting if I hadn't finally found those marks in that logbook on that day...</div>

<div><em>... and I have to add to that, Lucy, that hearing 
from a letterboxer after they've found your box, whether it's the first one or 
not, is always a thrill for that same reason, especially if they add some 
information about their experience and you think you helped bring about that 
experience!   That's why I always like to contact the placers after 
I've found a box.  Besides, I know I also like to hear that my boxes are 
still out there and all is well (or if not, then I'm alerted to get out 
there and do something about it!)

mystery man to<br/>

we hadn't<br/>
&gt; yet put it together what an enigma he was (and is).  But what was <br/>
equally<br/>
&gt; overwhelming was that GG's stamp wasn't alone - right in the book <br/>
was also<br/>
&gt; Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (whose stamps I knew because by then I <br/>
had found<br/>
&gt; several of their boxes and met them at the first Texas gathering), <br/>
and they<br/>

them until Sunday.  Guess who found them Sunday?  The Grizzled One!  <br/>
Hamilton is way to close to Coryell County.  I second the thanks to <br/>
Mr. Gryphon...what would we do without him?<br/>

&gt; My daughter and I have planted several boxes now that we have been <br/>
&gt; doing this for a couple of months now. Mostly in Tarrant and <br/>
Johnson <br/>
&gt; county but one in Wise. With the exception of Puddle Splasher <br/>
&gt; marking our "8er in Decatur" the Gryphon is the only one to have <br/>
&gt; found any of our boxes. Thanks Gryphon, it really give a thrill to <br/>
&gt; have your boxes found.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Some might call him the patron saint of unfound boxes, and <br/>
here's <br/>
&gt; why...<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me preface my story with this - When I went and found my <br/>
first <br/>
&gt; box, it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was in a park on a trail I had walked many, many times.  When I <br/>
&gt; first heard<br/>
&gt; &gt; of letterboxing and read the clue for THAT box, I could scarcely <br/>
&gt; believe<br/>
&gt; &gt; there could possibly be something hidden "that close" to where I <br/>
&gt; had walked<br/>
&gt; &gt; so many times.  But sure enough, I peeked where it said to peek, <br/>
&gt; and there<br/>
&gt; &gt; was the box.  I was blown away, but that was nothing compared to <br/>
&gt; the feeling<br/>
&gt; &gt; of seeing your very first visitor to one of your own boxes!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; My first two boxes, Caldwell Zoo and the original Killough <br/>
&gt; Monument went<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing in a heartbeat, but I finally planted my very first <br/>
solid <br/>
&gt; box in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fairfield State Park.  Oh Deer! was GOOD (if I do say so myself, <br/>
&gt; and I STILL<br/>
&gt; &gt; think it's good) and I wanted someone else to find it and see <br/>
how <br/>
&gt; good it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was!  I waited on email that someone had found my box (this was <br/>
&gt; before all<br/>
&gt; &gt; the kinks in the notification system on LBNA were worked out and <br/>
&gt; before AQ<br/>
&gt; &gt; ever existed).  And I waited.  And I waited.  And when I was in <br/>
&gt; the area, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; checked it.  Finally, I went to check it yet again, steeling <br/>
&gt; myself for<br/>
&gt; &gt; popping the top on the box AGAIN, opening the logbook AGAIN, <br/>
&gt; turning the<br/>
&gt; &gt; page AGAIN, and finding it - empty - AGAIN.  Yet, after seven <br/>
&gt; months, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; turned the page and it was - NOT EMPTY!  I saw the strangely <br/>
&gt; encrypted<br/>
&gt; &gt; highly unique stamp of Gryzzled Gryphon, who was not even a <br/>
&gt; mystery man to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the group yet!  He had apparently just started letterboxing, and <br/>
&gt; we hadn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet put it together what an enigma he was (and is).  But what <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; equally<br/>
&gt; &gt; overwhelming was that GG's stamp wasn't alone - right in the <br/>
book <br/>
&gt; was also<br/>
&gt; &gt; Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (whose stamps I knew because by then <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; had found<br/>
&gt; &gt; several of their boxes and met them at the first Texas <br/>
gathering), <br/>
&gt; and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; had been there the very day I was there checking it.  Now THAT'S <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; strange<br/>
&gt; &gt; feeling!  I jerked my head up expecting to see them walking away <br/>
&gt; from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box in the woods, but they were nowhere to be found, and I later <br/>
&gt; learned<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they had been on one of their thrill ride boxing weekends <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; paused at my box before sunrise that morning.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Finding that very first stamp in one of your own boxes is every <br/>
&gt; bit as<br/>
&gt; &gt; thrilling as finding your very first box.  It creates a strong <br/>
&gt; sense of<br/>
&gt; &gt; interconnection when suddenly you realize that someone else went <br/>
&gt; and found<br/>
&gt; &gt; your box just as you have found others.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As grateful as I am to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for planting <br/>
&gt; boxes around<br/>
&gt; &gt; me before I ever had a clue what they were doing, I'm also <br/>
&gt; grateful to<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gryzzled Gryphon for finally rescuing my poor lonely box from <br/>
&gt; obscurity and<br/>
&gt; &gt; making his mark there.  And my box is not alone - he has been <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; first, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; in some cases, only finder of boxes for quite a long time at a <br/>
&gt; stretch.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm afraid I might've been too discouraged to continue planting <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; I hadn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally found those marks in that logbook on that day...<br/>
