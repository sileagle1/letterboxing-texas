Hey all,<br/>
after a 3 month hiatus from any planting I finally got off my butt <br/>
and carved a box and a HH today!  Please be patient on INTO THE <br/>
WOODS-I got in a hurry writing down clues and may have botched one.  <br/>
I will try to go double check it asap!  Also the Powerpuff Girl <br/>
planted one in the same park in Arlington today.<br/>
<br/>
I was an idiot and waited too long to book a campsite at Brazos <br/>
Bend. Now they are all filled for that weekend.  Does anyone know <br/>
any great tent camping spots on the coast.  We would be willing to <br/>
drive an hour or two for the gathering if there were some really <br/>
cool camping spots somewhere.  Has anyone stayed at Goose Island <br/>
S.P. or Galveston Island S.P. or Sea Rim S.P.?  If so , was it nice, <br/>
kid-friendly, etc.?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!-Kantexan<br/>

<br/>
Haven't stayed at Goose island, but we did drive around and through it last<br/>
spring. There appeared to be wooded sites and sites in concrete-type<br/>
structures on the water edge. BabyBear might be a good resource for you.<br/>
It was so rainy when we were there, I don't have a good feel for the park,<br/>
but I do recall a lot of bugs. The trees were interesting - so windswept by<br/>
ocean storms that they were often bent over almost double, and very tangled.<br/>
<br/>
We CelticLions are pretty happy with any camping situation so we may not be<br/>
the most discriminating of critics!<br/>
(There are 3 nearby boxes, BTW!)<br/>
See you in March!<br/>

You might try asking BOXDN or one of the other Louisiana <br/>
boxers if they have room at their campsites, since I<br/>
think they booked several.<br/>
Another option would be to try staying at Stephen F. Austin<br/>
SP, since it is closer than the parks you mentioned and<br/>
I don't think it fills up that often.  It is north of<br/>
Brazos Bend SP, so you could stay there the night before,<br/>
come to the Event, then go back for another night in<br/>
the direction of home.  Another advantage is there are<br/>
a few boxes in the park.  Also, you could explore the<br/>
area around Washington-On-The Brazos, especially if the<br/>
wildflowers are blooming then.<br/>
If you do decide to stay at Goose Island SP, be sure to<br/>
allow enough time to go to Aransas NWR to see the Whooping<br/>
Cranes and find several boxes there.  Glad to hear you<br/>
are planning to come!<br/>
