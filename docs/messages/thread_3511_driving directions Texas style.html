                    <html><body><div>Ya know, what was really getting me about all those comments is they were responding as though the lack of direction was someone being clever, and that wasn't at all what Silver Eagle was referring to (or I don't think it was).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I still agree with Silver Eagle that the fun of letterboxing happens once your feet hit the ground in most cases (although I agree with Mark and Randy and all those folks who know that lack of driving directions CAN be a part of letterboxing) - not while you are driving around town trying to get your bearings in a broad way AND find a very specific place too. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wondered at times during that discussion if the difference of perspective was that we are from a big state and they are all from little states.  You could cross three New England states in the distance between DFW and Houston - so maybe in Texas, inexact driving directions are a lot worse than they are in smaller states.<br/>
