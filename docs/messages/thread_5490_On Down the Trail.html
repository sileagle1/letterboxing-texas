Yeehaw!!! Old Wild Bill came out of his tent yesterday, and told me it was time to move on down the trail. He said there was a ghost haunting them, and a bozo clown that was causing them all to take a swig of whiskey. Now, I don't like folks being restless (or rowdy) so, I told Wild Bill I was heading to Houston on Saturday, and they could hitch a ride as far as Memorial Park. I told him they would enjoy The park, and especially Buffalo Bayou! He said that sounded good to him. Once I entered the park, I took them over to the Rugby (had a hard time explaining that sport to the group). I faced the locked gate, and followed a trail to the right. At the end of the trail, I turned right and found a white bench, and a blue trash can. I faced the woods, and followed the trail 14 steps to a log behind a tree. I told Old Bill this was a good place for him and his crew to stretch their legs and enjoy the bayou while waiting on the next show.<br/>
