elementary school UIL one act play competition, and the spot they drew was 3pm, 
so there was no way to sneak away before or after.  I was so looking

Cardinals.  Oh well, at least Berkman is having a good series!

<div><font size="2">Hey!!! The TEXAS Rangers aren't exactly dog meat! Since we've never won a World Series, this is pretty exciting stuff for us up here in the north part of Texas. Our family was at the Cowboys game yesterday, leaving the stadium just as the Rangers were starting theirs. We had the top down on the car enjoying all the people out tailgating and enjoying a great sports day in the DFW metroplex area and heard the National Anthem being sung for the World Series when a couple of huge Chinook Helicopters did their flyover right over our car. (The Rangers Ballpark and the Cowboys Stadium are right beside each other.) It was a very fun day for our "little" DFW community.</font></div>

> Hey!!! The TEXAS Rangers aren't exactly dog meat! Since we've never won a World Series, this is pretty exciting stuff for us up here in the north part of Texas. Our family was at the Cowboys game yesterday, leaving the stadium just as the Rangers were starting theirs. We had the top down on the car enjoying all the people out tailgating and enjoying a great sports day in the DFW metroplex area and heard the National Anthem being sung for the World Series when a couple of huge Chinook Helicopters did their flyover right over our car. (The Rangers Ballpark and the Cowboys Stadium are right beside each other.) It was a very fun day for our "little" DFW community.<br>
