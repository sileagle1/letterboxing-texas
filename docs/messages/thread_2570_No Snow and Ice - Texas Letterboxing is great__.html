                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from skiing trip to Colorado, and took some clues <br/>
along with me.   1st stop, Coors brewery for tour, tasting, and to <br/>
find Silver Eagles box.  First, it was 15 degrees outside, and I was <br/>
not dressed from the plane ride for this.   I followed the clues, <br/>
found the bridge it would be under, and bent down to find a huge <br/>
chunk of ice.  No way I was getting that box.   Due to the snow, 0 <br/>
degree temp., and ice in other locations, I gave up on finding boxing <br/>
in the mountains.  So, on the last days as we went to far side of <br/>
mountains, I searched for boxes in Glenwood Springs, after placing <br/>
box #247 in Glenwood Canyon (GREAT PLACE!).  One was easy, as it was <br/>
right down the street from hotel and above ground.  The other ended <br/>
up taking me 2 hours, across snow, ice, more ice, more ice, fell <br/>
down, more ice, but luckily the box was not frozen in the ice, just <br/>
the rocks that surrounded it.  I wrestled it out, and was able to log <br/>
the box!   On the last day as we headed to Denver we stopped at Red <br/>
Rocks park, and I decided to check on my old box there.  NOPE.... <br/>
snow plows had buried the spot under 5 feet of snow, which had turned <br/>
into an ice boulder.   Isn't it nice not to have to deal with this in <br/>
Texas (at least most of the time).  Not sure how you make an Ice-<br/>
proof box. <br/>

<div>I know what you mean, Baby Bear.  A year ago my husband and I were in 
CO for some snowmobile adventuring, and tried to find a letterbox right next to 
the highway on Fremont Pass during a really heavy snowfall, icy slick roads, 
freezing temps, but an absolutely beautiful day (for a heavy snowfall 
day!).  Found the clues exactly, marked the precise spot visually -- but 
the short distance off the road - about 15 ' -  to the letterbox would have 
required me to attempt to cross about 6' deep snowdrifts and trek through what 
was probably 4-5' of deep powder to reach it.  You know, I sat there in the 
jeep staring at the spot and really, really considering whether or not I could 
do it, but finally settled for taking photographs of the place and hoping to 
make a return some summer day.  I was also thinking, if I'd been with 
PuddleSplasher instead of my reasonable husband, we'd have probably tried it, 
gotten ourselves buried in the snow up to our necks, frozen ourselves with 
completely wet clothes -- and got the letterbox!  But my husband does have 
good sense, so no attempt was made that day.  Besides, I thought I'd 
probably need an ax to open the box once I got it anyway, and I didn't have an 
ax handy.  Too bad.  About that time a snowplow came along and threw 
even more snow onto those tall roadside drifts, so I knew it wouldn't have been 
a good idea to try it anyway.  I'd have been buried until the spring thaw, 
most likely.  I guess sometimes you do have to use a little restraint in 
certain situations, or at least that's what my husband always tells me.</div>

<div>Hey! I resemble that remark! All I can say is that when you letterbox with me, we may actually get stuck in the mud, but at least you can't say I'm an "ol stuck in the mud" <em>type </em> of person! lol</div>
