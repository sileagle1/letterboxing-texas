                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br/>
<br/>
I just joined this group and wanted to introduce myself. We have been letterboxing off and on for about 6 years, mostly while camping in our vontage RV. I have recently gotten back into it because of my daughter. So sad I won't be able to make it down to TALE... it sounds like a great event! But, we have Girl Scout cookie sales this weekend... which takes me to my question.<br/>
<br/>
My troop is hosting a girl scout "GPS Party" event in May where they will teach other girls about letterboxing, geocaching, waymarking and other GPS games. A coworker shared her Texas Tour Bus book with me, and I thought it would be great to set something similar to this up for our troop so they can see how cool this hobby can be! I was thinking it might be good to create a Girl Scout Garden "Daisy Chain" (since Daisies are the first level of girl scouts) and have folks add flowers to the box as it moves around. Any thoughts or suggestions about that?<br/>
<br/>
Finally, if anyone would be interested in helping girls learn about letterboxing and is availbe in Dallas on May 11, let me know!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div>Welcome to the list!  Since we are all about to be camping any moment 
now at TALE, I’m sure you will receive more replies next week after we all get 
back and rest up a little. I love your Daisy Chain idea.  Have you gotten 
to read the recent discussion on guidelines for traveling boxes?  If not, 
we will repost them next week.  Sorry you can’t make TALE this year.  
Hope you sell a lot of cookies!  -- Bell Motel</div>

We planted a "tour bus" type box for our Girl Scout event and hope folks can help us fill our Girl Scout Garden with awesome floral carves!<br/>

Let me know if you pick it up and where it goes... we need it back in time for a May 11 Girl Scout event.<br/>
