                    <div class="plaintext-content">We switched hotels because the Fort Worth air show was canceled and<br/>
better digs were available.  So we are now near the Texas Motor<br/>
Speedway.  Seeing as how we might be here a few days (depends on gas<br/>
and traffic), contact me off list and let me know what might be some<br/>
fun letterboxes.  I haven't even looked at the website, so haven't<br/>
been able to do my usual printing reams of clues.  I've been too<br/>
anxious, but once I know what the damage is (if any), I may be able to<br/>
relax and have more fun.<br/>
<br/>
Fingers crossed for DrooP and everyone else--more later,<br/>
