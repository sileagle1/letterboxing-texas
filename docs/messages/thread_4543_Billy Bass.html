<div>Oh my gosh, that's the funniest thing I've heard in

<p>Oh, Baby Bear! You do make me laugh. When I lived in Connecticut, our house 
was located on the side of a steep mountain; it was across the road from a state 
forest and at the bottom of our property was the Housatonic River where I kept 
my canoe. Every day when I'd hike down to my canoe, I cross over at least five 
deer trails (I guess they didn't they know they were on my private property?) 
Often, I'd have to climb over or find my way around some huge fallen tree that 
Mother Nature had inconsideratly decided to bring down over my path. She also 
decided my property would be a good place for her to plant her big old 
blackberry thicket, which often drew blood as I passed by (as well as providing 
a great treat in my breakfast bowl during the summer). Obviously Mother N didn't 
realize that was private property either. I was usually generous enough to share 
my property with the wildlife (deer, fox, Mother N, etc) until they bit the 
flowers off all the plants in my gardens. So here's what I did (under the advice 
of my local garden shop): I hung those singing fish plaques on trees around my 
gardens and when the deer would wander by, the fish would start wiggling and 
singing and Bambi would fly over the fence. So.... maybe instead of playing the 
role of "superior big brother", this group who thinks they're qualified to 
decide if a letterbox or geocache is worthy of being in their woods... maybe 
they should just hang singing fish around the woods whenever they discover a 
letterbox and try to scare the letterboxers off. Just sayin....<br/><br/>Puddle 
Splasher (who actually respects Mother N and treads lightly, but doesn't like 
big brother to regulate everything she does!!!!)<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>,

the parks survive the HUNDREDS of deer social trails, or the hunters that come 
into the parks to kill such deer (I'm sure they stay on the trail when they 
shoot Bambi's mom between the eyes and she drops right on the trail, with no 
blood, so nothing is disturbed)!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The point I'm making is that 
Letterboxing overall has a minimal effect on the parks, compaired to natural 
events or other park sponsored events. I will agree that some boxes have been 
put in areas of historic value, and probably should be moved to a less sensitive 
area in that park, but most are in the woods, only yards off a trail, hidden 
behind a tree under a pile of sticks or rocks. I don't think this is a major 
Enviromental issue, and we should stop placing boxes. Common sense and ethics 
should be your guide. If we find a box that crosses the line, then let's discuss 
that box, not Letterboxing as a whole. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Basically, I hope no 
one is offended by my comment, and I'm sure this topic has caused more harm than 
good. Now back to actually doing letterboxing!<wbr/>!!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;
