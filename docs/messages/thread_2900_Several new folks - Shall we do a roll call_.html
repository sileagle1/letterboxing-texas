I live in Fort Worth area and usually box with my daughter PomPom Bear.  One unusual note is I almost always seen some kind of butterfly when I letterbox. Its kinda of joke now with us but its true. It seems like every location we have been to, I've seen some kind of butterfly (I guess the trail name is appropriate!).  If I had to give advice about boxes, some of the very best ones I have run across have been done by Stargazer, Queen Beeloved and the Peas. All these girls are so talented when it comes to carving. I haven't ever been dissappointed by one of their stamps and I seem to be more amazed every time I see a new one.

Midland and raised our family there, we have retired to the little <br>
Piney Woods town of Coldspring in San Jacinto County.  Thinking we <br>
would take it easy, we opened a retreat for quilters and are now as <br>
busy as we want to be, especially on weekends.  We have been <br>
letterboxing for almost 2 years and, between us, have placed over 90 <br>
boxes, including 2 in Italy.  We have found over 600 boxes. <br>
Letterboxing for us is a way to relax and get some exercise at the <br>
same time, and it works.  An interesting fact about us is that we <br>
always letterbox together, as a couple.<br>

letterboxing about 5 months ago. It's a great way to<br>
get techno-junkie kids outside having<br>
three-demensional adventures. We are amazed by the<br>
amount of beautiful parks in Houston. My kiddos get to<br>
have non-pixel-rendered problem solving sessions each<br>
time we go, they learn orienteering and math/science<br>
lessons that they don't seem to pick up as easily in a<br>
classroom. Something interesting about our<br>

letterboxing kit is complete without a well-stocked<br>
picnic basket for supper along the way!<br>

about it on The CBS Early Show. Lucy Locket and I researched it and <br>
decided to give it a try. We found our first box in Vicksburg, Ms. <br>
Now, with over 300 boxes and lots of miles and memories, I am so glad <br>
I found this hobby! <br>
<br>
Advice: Learn all you can about the hobby. There are lots of web <br>
sites and books plus the knowledge of "the old timers" to guide you.  <br>
<br>
Little known fact: Lucy Locket and I leave Stinky Monkey and Roarin' <br>
Lion at home at least twice a year and do a "maraton" boxing trip. <br>
They are FUN!! <br>
<br>
One of my favorite boxes is The Texas Tour Bus #1. I hope it is found <br>
because there are lots of riders on that bux and a book full of <br>
stories to go with it!<br>

Puddle Splasher. I am celebrating my third year of letterboxing this <br>
week. I recently moved to Collin County north of Dallas (from Tarrant <br>
County between Dallas and Ft Worth). I suppose an "interesting <br>
letterboxing fact" about me is that I am tenacious letterboxer. In <br>
other words, I have a real problem giving up on a box that seems to <br>
either be missing or difficult to get to. I've been known to climb icy <br>
paths in winter, cross fast moving streams, crawl under a damp spider <br>
infested wooden structure on my stomach, and make other similar unwise <br>
decisions just to get to the box I'm after. I just love the challenge, <br>
but don't ever take advice from me!<br>

<div>I'm <font color="#8000ff" face="Rage Italic" size="6">Viewfinder.,</font> and 
as my trailname implies,  the best part of  letterboxing for me is 
discovering a new place -- scenic , historic, or just interesting.  I 
also enjoy clever clues, original stamps (even if not the most artistic or best 
carved), and a clever hiding place. I've been letterboxing since 2004 and my 
current count is something like P48 F472 X32 (give or take a few).  One 
not-so-secret fact:  I'm PuddleSplasher's Older and Wiser Sister - I 
<em><u>have</u></em> backed away from some letterboxes for various reasons, some 
of which have involved police activity or extremely heavy and deep snowdrifts 
and snowplows bearing down on me, but I'll usually go back and try again another 
time.  PuddleSplasher introduced me to letterboxing in Connecticut, and one 
of my favorite letterboxing experiences was a rainy wildlife refuge 
trail in Rangeley, Maine, following moose tracks and listening to the calls of 
loons on the lake.  More recently, my letterboxing  involves more 
mosquitoes than moose, not counting all the Meese around Lake Grapevine.  
I've found spme great boxes in Canada, Montana, Colorado, New Mexico, 
Arizona, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Tennessee, Kentucky, and Missouri (crossed the MS 
River on a ferrry to get one there), not to mention more than a few in New 
England and Texas.  Welcome, New Boxers, and remember our motto:  
Recover Well!  </div></font><br/><br/><br/><div><font style="color: black; font: normal 10pt ARIAL, SAN-SERIF;"><hr style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px"/>See what's free at <a href="http://www.aol.com?ncid=AOLAOF00020000000503" target="_blank" title="http://www.aol.com?ncid=AOLAOF00020000000503">AOL.com</a>. </font></div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm SandiBox from Houston.  My daughter, SoccerChik, and I have been <br>
letterboxing since August '04.  I discovered letterboxing through <br>
Family Fun magazine... but in a round-about way.  The article I read <br>
was about Orienteering.  I did some research on the internet, and it <br>
sounded interesting, but a little too intense for me.<br>
<br>
But a link on the orienteering web page led me to webpage with <br>
various "stashing games" and THAT led to LBNA and letterboxing.  I <br>
was so excited!  I called my daughter over to "read this, read <br>
this... We HAVE to try this!"  I read everything I could find on the <br>
topic, and knew we had stumbled onto something very special.<br>
<br>
We found our first box within the week.  But life got in the way and <br>
we didn't go again for a year.  On a trip home from visiting <br>
relatives in El Paso we found another box. Even then, we weren't <br>
really avid boxers until May of '06.  Since then we haven't looked <br>
back!<br>
<br>
I have said again and again... you have to love a hobby that causes a <br>
16-year old girl to tell her friends, "I can't go to the mall today.  <br>
I'm going hiking with my mom."  We have had some wonderful times, <br>
marveling at the beauty of God's creation, talking about those <br>
important life topics, and just spending time together.  We have also <br>
met some wonderful people and seen places that we never would have <br>
have experienced without letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Some of my favorite boxes in the Houston area are Dewberry's mystery <br>
boxes.  Not that I've found a lot of them, mind you.  But the "ah-<br>
ha!" moment when I finally figure out one of her devious clues is a <br>
great feeling.  Just solved one last night, in fact.  Woo-hoo!<br>
<br>
Now I'm just waiting for SoccerChik to get her cast off next week so <br>
we can hit the trails again!<br>

Oh yes, Miss Lucy, you were sitting there all comfy and happily knowing that the box was yours for the taking. BUT, what you hadn't planned on was a sneak attack from someone three hours away who crept out under the cover of darkness to steal that box from under your nose. Ha, ha, ha (that's supposed to read as a diabolical, evil laugh.) It's not easy to <br/>get the best of the best from the best, but it can be done!</font></div>

<div>I've been mostly lurking for a while, because the business of life has gotten to me, so some people who are not so "new" may not even know me!  :)  I am Semalee of MAGS (our Family Trail name).  I don't know how long I have been boxing...  LOL!!  About 4 years maybe?  Anyway, I started after reading an article in Family Fun one year about ways to get your steps in LOL!!  We live in in the Kay area, just west of Houston.  I am also very persistent.  We don't buy souveneirs anymore, we go letterboxing when we travel.  So, the pursuit of the stamp in place of the soveneir can be rather intense LOL!!  A few years ago we went to Colorado to visit my dad.  I had been telling him about this Letterboxing thing and just knew he would enjoy it.  So I brought clues :)  Well, our first box was very straightforward and easy to find.  So, off to the next one...  The clues were not quite as straightforward...  They said something like "continue on the trail until you see a fork in the trail"...  Right- seems easy enough...  Oh- and you could go at the box from two different directions depending on what side of the park you were on, but both sets of clues led up to the fork in the trail part followed by a compass reading....  So, off we go...  and go.... and go.... THREE HOURS UP A MOUNTAIN and we still have yet to see a "fork in the trail"...  (Good thing we brought water!)  As we were talking about how me might have possibly missed it a group of people came walking up to us from the other direction..  The man says, "You have papers!  Are you by chance looking for a box???"  I said yes, and we were infact looking for the same box, but they had come from the other direction...  They too had been hiking for several hours....  I told them we had seen nothing resembling a fork (It was a very well marked trail), so I was pretty sure it wasn't our way.  They told us they had been TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN and there was a fork in the trail up there, but the compass reading went in the middle of the fork, and that went down a really really steep hillside..  We were about 20 minutes from the top of the mountain LOL!!  So, we all went back to the top and sure enough the compass reading went down the middle.  So my dad went climbing down the side of the mountain to see if the clues could work, and I took the trail....  I found the box and didn't touch it, and ran back up the trail to tell the others at the fork.  The other group of people gave up and left.  Poor things!  So I got my family and we all went and got the box!  We were very sore the next day LOL!!!  But we all had a great time!

</p><div>I guess that Chevy ad in Family Fun magazine is getting some attention.  I don't know if they are selling any trucks, but they sure are sparking a little interest in letterboxing!  Seems like we just did a new folks event, but let's do another one for the new newbies. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How about this?  Everyone (old folks and old new folks too), let's do a roll call.  State your trail name, your county (if you don't want to do county, do the nearest large city), and how long you've been letterboxing.  And how about one interesting letterboxing fact about you too? 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As our new members speak up, how about old members making suggestions about good first/next boxes for the new guys to find in their area?  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>New members, please feel free to speak up with any questions or thoughts you may have.  I encourage you to draw from the wealth of experience and hospitality you will find amongst those who have been around awhile.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here goes:  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm BarefootLucy and I've been sober for 4 years - no wait, I've been LETTERBOXING for 4 years.  I live in Cherokee County, which has grown from 3 letterboxes in July '03 to 94 boxes in July '07.  Wow - who said we had to tell one interesting fact about ourselves?  Hmmm...okay, here goes.  I almost always meet "unusual" people while I'm letterboxing.

<div>I'm CalicoRose in south Texas (Calliham at Choke Canyon Lake).   I started letterboxing in 2003.  I ran across the term 'letterboxing' while searching the Internet for more info on geocaching.  I found the LBNA website and learned that there was a Lb just a few blocks from me at an old cemetary.  I immediately grabbed a store bought rubber stamp and ink pad and then found the box.  I was hooked!  The box had been planted by Busy Bee.  After emailing her about the status of the box, I learned she lived just 12 miles from me.  We became letterboxing buddies.  I don't know if Busy Bee is still on the list or not as she has moved on into other interests and hobbies.  At the time nearly all the boxes in S. Texas were planted by her with just a few thrown in by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear.  I've planted a few and my find is over 100.  Corozon and I have been on a couple of adventures together.   I haven't had any success in recruiting any of my friends into letterboxing trips with me so I just read about everyone else's adventures on the list.  I do hope to make the gathering next spring.  If anyone ever comes thru my neck of the woods, please plant a new box for me to find...LOL.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I'll join the roll call.  I'm Batty Gril -- mostly a lurker.  I<br>
have been boxing for one year on August 1.  I have just over 100 finds<br>
and 11 plant with a few more in the "getting ready" stages.  My<br>
husband geocaches (so do I) but goes letterboxing to keep me company.<br>
We live near Justin, which is a few miles north of Fort Worth.  We<br>
have two children.  Our son is 22, just married in Febrrary, and will<br>
be outbound to Irag with the Texas National Gurad on July 17.  Our<br>
daughter is 19, has completed her first year at Midwestern in Wichita<br>
Falls, and is, in my not-so-humble opinion, quite an artist.<br>
<br>
If our vacation goes according to plan, I'll will have my first<br>
opportunity to letterbox outside the state of Texas, not counting one<br>
I did in Oklahoma which was about 1 mile over the border.   When my<br>
husband can't go with me, and I feel I need a companion, my best<br>
friend who is a hiking fanatic goes with me.  She is a moose lover and<br>
has really enjoyed the boxes around Grapevine with moose themes.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, We are here. James and Lois (Adams Trails). We have been <br>
letterboxing since January 2007. We love it so far. We have had a few <br>
health issues that has slowed us down a bit but we are back at it <br>
now. My husband James retired July 1 after working 5 10hr days a week <br>
for years. He is now free to letterbox with me more. I am busy <br>
planting letterboxes in Henderson Co. and Kaufman Co, and Van Zante <br>
Co. at present. We have no letterboxers in this area and I have heard <br>
that if you plant them, they will come. I really don't know if I am <br>
doing it right but they are beginning to come. Thanks GG for being <br>
the first in most of my boxes. I found a HH in Sommerville at the <br>
gathering and planted it. It got all wet because I planted it too <br>
close to the water and as we don't have this much rain in Texas, I <br>
did not expect it. It has been dried out and replaced in another box <br>
all high and dry. It is Hit the Road, Jack. A bonus, I was checking <br>
on my boxes yesterday to see if any needed attention and found a new <br>
HH with one of them. I was so excited. This HH had been all over the <br>
US or almost. Connecticut, Maine,Virgina, Ill., and Az just to name a <br>
few. It had been released in 2002 and there were a lot of names and <br>
dates and places in the log book. I was so excited that I took it. I <br>
don't know if I should have but it has now been released in one of my <br>
other boxes. A new box that I am doing a series. I will have all my <br>
new boxes on the letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com soon. You won't <br>
know which one has the Compass Rose in it so you will have to find <br>
them all. Happy hunting. I will post again when I launch to new boxes <br>
so keep checking. --- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, "Barefoot <br>

I'm Thimble Cat of The Polka Dots, which also includes my DH 6foot9, <br>
my 11yr old DS Gold Arrow and my 9 yr old DD E-Bug.  We've been <br>
boxing about 2 1/2 yrs but have such a pitiful PFX count that I won't <br>
even mention it :).  We are probably way to busy to do this but love <br>
it so much we refuse to quit.<br>
<br>
I found out about letterboxing about through a rubber stamping <br>
forum.  I was injured at the time and could not get out and about to <br>
buy Christmas gifts for the family, so I put together LB kits for <br>
them - binders full of info and clues, handmade logbooks, and hand <br>
carved stamps.  I'm a Stampin' Up! demonstrator so I'm ALL about the <br>
stamps.<br>
<br>
I'm also a Gold Award scout and GS leader and have made it my mission <br>
to get all the San Jacinto Council camps loaded with boxes so my <br>
girls and I can box when we go camping.  I teach LBoxing to GS <br>
leaders twice a year at big council training events.<br>
<br>
I'm also a quilter (when time allows, and that's not very often these <br>
days) and actually had met Boots Tex and LS Quilter before we all <br>
discovered boxing.  As soon as they joined the list I knew exactly <br>
who they were.  We had a fun time exchanging stamps at the next quilt <br>
retreat. <br>
<br>
I'll go back to lurk mode and will hopefully get more boxes out there <br>
and planted in the future.<br>

<div> </div>
<div>I've been mostly lurking for a while, because the business of life has gotten to me, so some people who are not so "new" may not even know me!  :)  I am Semalee of MAGS (our Family Trail name).  I don't know how long I have been boxing...  LOL!!  About 4 years maybe?  Anyway, I started after reading an article in Family Fun one year about ways to get your steps in LOL!!  We live in in the Kay area, just west of Houston.  I am also very persistent.  We don't buy souveneirs anymore, we go letterboxing when we travel.  So, the pursuit of the stamp in place of the soveneir can be rather intense LOL!!  A few years ago we went to Colorado to visit my dad.  I had been telling him about this Letterboxing thing and just knew he would enjoy it.  So I brought clues :)  Well, our first box was very straightforward and easy to find.  So, off to the next one...  The clues were not quite as straightforward.<wbr>..  They said something like "continue on the trail until you see a fork in the trail"...  Right- seems easy enough...  Oh- and you could go at the box from two different directions depending on what side of the park you were on, but both sets of clues led up to the fork in the trail part followed by a compass reading....  So, off we go...  and go.... and go.... THREE HOURS UP A MOUNTAIN and we still have yet to see a "fork in the trail"...  (Good thing we brought water!)  As we were talking about how me might have possibly missed it a group of people came walking up to us from the other direction..  The man says, "You have papers!  Are you by chance looking for a box???"  I said yes, and we were infact looking for the same box, but they had come from the other direction...  They too had been hiking for several hours....  I told them we had seen nothing resembling a fork (It was a very well marked trail), so I was pretty sure it wasn't our way.  They told us they had been TO THE TOP OF THE MOUNTAIN and there was a fork in the trail up there, but the compass reading went in the middle of the fork, and that went down a really really steep hillside..  We were about 20 minutes from the top of the mountain LOL!!  So, we all went back to the top and sure enough the compass reading went down the middle.  So my dad went climbing down the side of the mountain to see if the clues could work, and I took the trail....  I found the box and didn't touch it, and ran back up the trail to tell the others at the fork.  The other group of people gave up and left.  Poor things!  So I got my family and we all went and got the box!  We were very sore the next day LOL!!!  But we all had a great time! </wbr></div>

<p>OK, We are here. James and Lois (Adams Trails). We have been <br/>letterboxing since January 2007. We love it so far. We have had a few <br/>health issues that has slowed us down a bit but we are back at it <br/>now. My husband James retired July 1 after working 5 10hr days a week <br/>for years. He is now free to letterbox with me more. I am busy <br/>planting letterboxes in Henderson Co. and Kaufman Co, and Van Zante <br/>Co. at present. We have no letterboxers in this area and I have heard <br/>that if you plant them, they will come. I really don't know if I am <br/>doing it right but they are beginning to come. Thanks GG for being <br/>the first in most of my boxes. I found a HH in Sommerville at the <br/>gathering and planted it. It got all wet because I planted it too <br/>close to the water and as we don't have this much rain in Texas, I <br/>did not expect it. It has been dried out and replaced in another box <br/>all high and dry. It is Hit the Road, Jack. A bonus, I was checking <br/>on my boxes yesterday to see if any needed attention and found a new <br/>HH with one of them. I was so excited. This HH had been all over the <br/>US or almost. Connecticut, Maine,Virgina, Ill., and Az just to name a <br/>few. It had been released in 2002 and there were a lot of names and <br/>dates and places in the log book. I was so excited that I took it. I <br/>don't know if I should have but it has now been released in one of my <br/>other boxes. A new box that I am doing a series. I will have all my <br/>new boxes on the letterboxing.<wbr>org and atlasquest.com soon. You won't <br/>know which one has the Compass Rose in it so you will have to find <br/>them all. Happy hunting. I will post again when I launch to new boxes <br/>so keep checking. --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Barefoot <br/>Lucy" &lt;barefootlucy@<wbr>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I guess that Chevy ad in Family Fun magazine is getting some <br/>attention.

Everyone (old folks and old new folks too), let's <br/>do a roll<br/>&gt; call.

<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Hi all!
I am semi-new online here. Been letterboxing for about a year and a half. I
live in Fort Worth. My kids love to box with me so I have to be cautious on the
boxes we search for. They are 5 and 8 and the 5 year old tires easy on walking
routes…don’t want to scare her off of the boxes so we pick and
choose many of the ones we go for based on ease of finding. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">My
fav part of the sport is the uniqueness of the stamps carved and the things/people
lertterboxers dedicate special boxes to. I also like history based ones. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">My
favorite share is this: After my friend introduced us to lb-ing and helped us
carve our signature stamp, we were off to Iowa (from Texas) with printed clues
in hand for along the way. Took my father in law with us to locate one (in the
dark even) in a city park. It was our first box and we were so jazzed to find
it so easily! Opened it up and spread out the stuff in it…oh my…match
box cars, carved wooden ball inside a box thing, some cards, a whistle, and
about 8-10 other things. No stamp. No logbook. What gives??? So, I thought so innocently
that the logbook must have gotten lost and so I grabbed the really neat hand
carved wooden ball toy thing and rolled it in my ink pad and logged it in my
log book. It made the coolest “bubble” looking stamp. I wrote all
the things down in my log book that I found in this cool box. After I put the
box all back together again…and noted the word written on the top of it –
geocache – (so I could go look it up later!) we re-hid our find and covered
it well and drove back to the house. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">What
a delightful discovery of yet another avenue of “the hunt”…geocaching
– which is a similar game played without stamps but still has treasures
and a hunt. So to all the newbies that may be as ignorant of this other game…geocaching
is letterboxing without stamps, with a gps or compass or Lat. and Long. knowledge
and a slightly different set of rules. You probably will stumble across one in
your letterboxing search. It is expected that if you find one, you can take a
treasure from the box but you must leave one of equal or more value in its
place. Sometimes there is a log book, sometimes not. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt"><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="background:white"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">I
have enjoyed reading the profiles and anecdotes. Thanks to all for sharing and please,
everyone – add yours to this line! <br/>
<br/>

<br>
My trail name is MoWizLiz, which hopefully, I (or you) won't come <br>
across a second alias of the same.  I started off boxing as an age <br>
old nickname of Red, but after spending most of my early boxing <br>
experience in GA, realized that there was another Red (Red's Bunch), <br>
who is a terrific half of a wonderful couple.  But, I changed my name <br>
thinking that when something obvious manifested, I'd change again.  <br>
So far, nothing has been "The One."<br>
<br>
I talk alot, prattling on and not saying much.  If you don't <br>
understand it, that's okay...you have to be in my head for the first <br>
half of the sentence.<br>
<br>
KEF got into letterboxing because of a friend of his, Quiet Place <br>
(someone I've met elsewhere).  He, in turn, spent about a month of <br>
emails trying to explain to me what the heck letterboxing is.  I <br>
could't get it, but finally, in fall 2003, went out to see firsthand <br>
what he was describing.  That's fun.  I used to travel a lot, chasing <br>
around the same band that these two are into, so it was an easy sell <br>
to pick up a box here and there, plus, letterboxes took me to (and <br>
still does) some really nifty places that I wouldn't normally have <br>
gone. <br>
<br>
I live in Louisville, KY.  Two single brothers live in Dallas (Allen <br>
and Dallas proper) and one lives in Houston.  Because my Allen <br>
brother, who is a year and a week older than me, is best friends with <br>
dh Teepsman, saying often "He's more like a brother to me than my <br>
other two brothers," we make it to Dallas at least once a year to <br>
visit both of them.  When the three sibs get together, the place gets <br>
wordy, we drink a lot of coffee, and by age old decree, have to go <br>
bowling.  Neither of them are boxers, but they will take me to get a <br>
few when I stay with them. <br>
<br>
Letterboxing fact.  Hm, at events other than my own, I could care <br>
less if I get local boxes.  Everyone has a great story to tell.  I'm <br>
there collecting people stamps.  Vivid bold lines and colors are <br>
imprinted in laughter, smiles and anecdotes told at gatherings.  I <br>
love that. :-)<br>

<p>Okay, I'll join the roll call. I'm Batty Gril -- mostly a lurker. I<br/>have

  22, just married in Febrrary, and will<br/>be outbound to Irag with the Texas

  an artist.<br/><br/>If our vacation goes according to plan, I'll will have my 
  first<br/>opportunity to letterbox outside the state of Texas, not counting 
  one<br/>I did in Oklahoma which was about 1 mile over the border. When 
  my<br/>husband can't go with me, and I feel I need a companion, my 
  best<br/>friend who is a hiking fanatic goes with me. She is a moose lover

Actually, I knew a geocacher for which that was true, in a way.  This <br>
guy was a FTF demon.  I asked him once how he was so good at it.  <br>
Turns out he goes geocaching with his dog.  His dog, being a dog, <br>
could sniff out where somebody had been fiddling around in the bushes <br>
recently.  If he got there within a day or two of the geocache being <br>
planted, his dog would find it right away.<br>

Locket and I live in Navarro county.  My mom is Blue Butterfly and <br>
my nephews are Roarin' Lion and Stinky Monkey.  We've been <br>
letterboxing for two years, and I think we'll be letterboxing for <br>
MANY more.  <br>
<br>
LB Fact:  The first LB we found was in the state of Mississippi, but <br>
was planted by Texas Lber Corazon.  When we took a trip to OK in <br>
March, the first two boxes we found there were by Texas LBers Silver <br>
Eagle and Baby Bear.  The influence of TX letterboxers far exceeds <br>
the boundaries of our state.  <br>
<br>
Advice:  Treat each LB you find as if it were your own.  Reseal all <br>
the bags and the box itself well.  Rehide it so that no one will <br>
suspect that anything is hidden there. <br>
<br>
Happy Trails! <br>

<div>LL, your advice just about sums it all up nicely!  Once a letterboxer 
has created his or her own box, thought up an idea for a stamp and carved it, 
created a logbook, put all that camo tape on a plastic container, maybe even 
added a FF certificate or prize, scouted the perfect location and found a good, 
safe hiding place, written up the clues and posted them on both LBNA and AQ, 
then waited to be contacted by some finders,  then they realize what a 
treasure each little box is and how deserving of care and respect from everyone 
finding it.    Great advice! </div>

                    <html><body><p>Very well . . . I am the Gryzzled Gryphon of Coryell County and I have come in fresh from a soggy tour of the Baylor University campus to answer Roll Call. I found my first two boxes (Silver Eagle and Baby Bear productions, of course) on April 24, 2004. Since that day I have continued to find the occasional box as opportunity arises -- something I can do only because of the persistence of our local letterboxing community in planting new and invariably enjoyable boxes. It is difficult for me to tell exactly what my F count is because opinions vary as to what sort of stamp qualifies and what sort does not. In any case, I have a higher F count than most of the newbies, but lower than some of the other members of this list. My P count, on the other hand, is an embarrassingly low SIX -- but I am working on that shortcoming. My advice to new boxers? Have fun! But do your best to insure that the person who follows you has the same or better opportunity to have fun, too. That, in
 my opinion, is the only rule of this game. About the only point of interest I can claim about myself is that I am one of the "unusual" people with whom Barefoot Lucy has met while letterboxing.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've never seen a roll call before, but now I've seen enough of this <br>
one that I think I have the idea.<br>
<br>
I'm Kirbert from Havana, Florida.  I belong to your illustrious group <br>
because I have family in Lakeway so I'm out that way every now and <br>
then, and have planted three boxes in the area.  I haven't found a <br>
single box in Texas yet, I don't think; there's one not too terribly <br>
far from Lakeway that isn't mine, but I haven't gotten up that way to <br>
find it yet.  Whenever I'm there, I usually spend my spare time <br>
taking my niece geocaching.<br>
<br>
About a week before Thanksgiving 2004 I read about geocaching in <br>
Parade magazine and knew I had to try it.  I promptly mail-ordered a <br>
GPS receiver, but since I went with cheap postage I didn't expect it <br>
to show up until after the holidays.  Since we were heading down to <br>
Orlando and Tampa over the holidays, I wanted to do something on that <br>
trip.  On a geocaching forum someone had mentioned letterboxing, so I <br>
looked into that and decided it was something I could start doing <br>
immediately.  There were none within 2 hours of my house, but there <br>
were a couple on my way to Central Florida so I printed out some <br>
clues.  Then my GPS receiver showed up much quicker than expected the <br>
day before we left.  The end result was that I found my first <br>
letterbox and my first geocache on the same day, a letterbox outside <br>
of Gainesville and a geocache on International Drive in Orlando.  My <br>
wife and I were both hooked, but she continues as my assistant, <br>
unregistered with no trail name of her own.<br>
<br>
Nowadays, letterboxing interests me more than geocaching primarily <br>
because I enjoy carving.  Geocaching interests my wife more than <br>
letterboxing because she enjoys looking through the loot (even though <br>
she rarely takes anything), and she'd just as soon we quit <br>
letterboxing.  We both enjoy finding new and out-of-the-way sights <br>
and locales, and for that geocaching is better but both are good.<br>
<br>
I don't even know my find and place counts.  I think my find count is <br>
in the upper 200's somewhere, and my place count is in the 80's not <br>
including stamps carved by me and placed by others or HH's.  I have <br>
ten Blue Diamonds.  My geocache find count is higher, 400+ I think.<br>
<br>
I do enough carving these days that I have a primer up:<br>
<br>
http://www.nettally.com/palmk/Rubber_Stamp_Carving_Tips.html<br>
<br>
I carve more than I place, largely because I've placed enough in my <br>
area that I've basically decided to quit to allow others a chance to <br>
plant stuff without tripping over my boxes.  I plant on trips -- I <br>
have planted boxes in Georgia, Alabama, Texas, Maine, and New <br>
Hampshire, and had one in Michigan before it went missing -- but <br>
planting takes a lot of time and really eats into a vacation if <br>
you're not careful, so I usually limit my planting so the wife <br>
doesn't get impatient.  I planted four in New Hampshire this summer, <br>
the most I've ever planted on such a trip.<br>
<br>
I ship stamps to others to plant, and I was the guy who made the <br>
suggestion that resulted in Gillespie Tribe setting up a system to <br>
match up carvers with planters.  I have stamps planted by others in <br>
Houston, Massachusetts, California, North Carolina, Kentucky, Maine, <br>
and probably a few other states that I can't recall right now.  There <br>
will be boxes with my stamps planted in South Carolina, Connecticut, <br>
and Indiana shortly.<br>
<br>
What's surprising to many others:  Both my wife and I dislike events <br>
and meets; we've attended a couple, probably won't attend any more.  <br>
Picked up a few cooties at one, but have no interest in cooties, <br>
exchanges, PLB's, rings, or the like.<br>
<br>
I do like HH's and have launched a few.<br>

been on the boards you know my parents Boots Tex and Lone Star <br>
Quilter.  BT and LSQ have made a concerted effort to get the whole <br>
rest of the family involved.  These include my brother, sister, <br>
brother-in-law, sister-in-law, one niece, three nephews (the fourth is <br>
too young right now at less then a year), and my aunt (Catitude), <br>
Yeah, she's my aunt.<br>
<br>
My uncle (El Lobo) and aunt (Star Seeker) got is all started during <br>
Thanksgiving 2 years ago.  Last Thanksgiving we went letterboxing and <br>
found a box in a castle...in Italy.  Pretty cool.<br>

We're JKC - living happily in lurkdom (Tyler actually). There are 3 <br>
of us in our little family (+ a dog who always goes along and is  <br>
actually bigger than the #3 -age 10), and we've been 'boxing for <br>
about a year. We read about it in a magazine article as well and <br>
since have planted a few and placed a few. This new activity has <br>
thoroughly been enjoyed by all of us - discovering new places that <br>
we never would have found if it hadn't been for letterboxing. <br>
Interesting fact: we love reading little historic blurbs, personal <br>
relationship to the area/stamp, and local lore on the clue sheets. <br>
Those always make the little adventure just that much more special <br>
to us.<br>
Thanks for all the great boxes out there!<br>
JKC <br>

<br>
What I won't do is recommend one planter over another, as I think<br>
that's just bad form and potentially hurtful to others, even if that's<br>
not what you meant.  <br>
<br>
Everyone has a different style.  One person likes long hikes and<br>
plants on them; another has difficulty getting around so all their<br>
boxes are drive-bys.  One person may be a great carver, but pick lousy<br>
locations for their boxes.  Another may have great mystery clues;<br>
another interesting custom stamps.  All placers are different, but<br>
they tend to have, usually, a certain style to their plants.<br>
<br>
If you're from an area and going to be boxing regularly in it, my best<br>
advice is to find a variety of boxes from a variety of planters. <br>
You'll figure out which planter(s) tend to plant the boxes that you<br>
want to find.  Not every box is for every finder.<br>
<br>
There are lots of components to letterboxing:  the carving, the<br>
logbook, the history of the box or the subject, the location (general<br>
park and specific planting spot), and the clues.  Collectively, the<br>
infinite variety of combinations makes for a unique experience each<br>
time.       <br>

<div>Well said, Dewberry, and I agree totally.  Personally, I like to 
explore and find new places, and while I love beautiful stamps, for me, it's 
more about the experience than just about collecting stamps.  There are 
some placers I lean toward more than others, either because their clues are 
clever or their location s are interesting or because their stamps are 
well-done, but part of the fun is the unexpected discovery, finding something on 
your own after figuring out those clues, and what makes it great for me might 
not be the same for someone else.   Sort of like recommending a movie 
or restaurant - I don't always agree with those critics, either.   So 
my suggestion is:  check out the clues for boxes that sound interesting, 
and then go check out the boxes.  Find out what you like, and then find 
more.   </div>

<div>What is your trail name? I love Stargazer's work. I met her when I first started boxing. I found one of her boxes that she thought was lost in the Botanical Gardens. We have been friends ever since.  Sandy is a really great artist and teaches carving. I know the series you are talking about and that was one of my favorites too. I live in Fort Worth also and work in the medical field. Seems like we have alot in common. We should go boxing sometime.</div>

&gt; little interest in letterboxing! Seems like we just did a new <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about this? Everyone (old folks and old new folks too), let's <br/>
do a roll<br/>
&gt; call. State your trail name, your county (if you don't want to do <br/>
county,<br/>
&gt; do the nearest large city), and how long you've been letterboxing. <br/>
And how<br/>
&gt; about one interesting letterboxing fact about you too?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As our new members speak up, how about old members making <br/>
suggestions about<br/>
&gt; good first/next boxes for the new guys to find in their area?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New members, please feel free to speak up with any questions or <br/>
thoughts you<br/>
&gt; may have. I encourage you to draw from the wealth of experience and<br/>
&gt; hospitality you will find amongst those who have been around awhile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm BarefootLucy and I've been sober for 4 years - no wait, I've <br/>
been<br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXING for 4 years. I live in Cherokee County, which has <br/>
grown from 3<br/>
&gt; letterboxes in July '03 to 94 boxes in July '07. Wow - who said we <br/>
had to<br/>
&gt; tell one interesting fact about ourselves? Hmmm...okay, here <br/>
goes. I<br/>
&gt; almost always meet "unusual" people while I'm letterboxing.<br/>

                    <html><body><div>I totally agree with you. Everyone gets something different out of boxing. I just figured if they are new to the experience it wouldn't hurt to recommend someone that you really enjoy. I'm definitely not saying one over another, simply trying to say I enjoy this particular box in my area and thought you might too. Since they aren't from my area, I thought you might want to recommend some in your area that they would enjoy hunting.  Obviously, it would vary by what they consider to be the best part of the hunt whether its the carving or the hike or the location, etc, etc.  but in my opionion, and this is only my opionion, it doesn't hurt to give a nod to an individual that you think is very talented in a certain area. Whether it is carving, or the way they do their logbook, or the way they write their clues, etc. But like I said, this is just my opionion. </div> <div>Monarch B<br/><br/><b><i>dewberrylb &lt;dewberrylb@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div>

One person likes long hikes and<br/>plants on them; another has difficulty getting around so all their<br/>boxes are drive-bys. One
 person may be a great carver, but pick lousy<br/>locations for their boxes. Another may have great mystery clues;<br/>another interesting custom stamps. All placers are different, but<br/>they tend to have, usually, a certain style to their plants.<br/><br/>If you're from an area and going to be boxing regularly in it, my best<br/>advice is to find a variety of boxes from a variety of planters. <br/>You'll figure out which planter(s) tend to plant the boxes that you<br/>want to find. Not every box is for every finder.<br/><br/>There are lots of components to letterboxing: the carving, the<br/>logbook, the history of the box or the subject, the location (general<br/>park and specific planting spot), and the clues.

 experience and<br/>&gt; hospitality you will find amongst those who have been around awhile.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Here goes:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I'm BarefootLucy and I've been sober for 4 years - no wait, I've <br/>been<br/>&gt; LETTERBOXING for 4 years. I live in Cherokee County, which has <br/>grown from 3<br/>&gt; letterboxes in July '03 to 94 boxes in July '07. Wow - who said we <br/>had to<br/>&gt; tell one interesting fact about ourselves? Hmmm...okay, here <br/>goes. I<br/>&gt; almost always meet "unusual" people while I'm letterboxing.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></div></div></blockquote><br/> <div></div></div><span style="COLOR: white" width="1"></span></div><!-- end of AOLMsgPart_2_58dd3ed5-da78-4fac-a490-4b5338c0a694 --> <div class="AOLPromoFooter"> <hr/>  AOL now offers free email to everyone.

<div><span class="gmail_quote">I've been asked several times from folks who are coming through or to my area to recommend some boxes to them.  Every time I start trying to make a list, I can't help it - I just want to include them all!  So I usually try to pick what I think is the best of each placer's boxes in the area and gear them to the person asking as best I know how to.  But by recommending a wide variety of placers, I know the prospective finder will be pleased by at least a few, if not all, the boxes I suggest.  
</span></div>
<div><span class="gmail_quote"></span> </div>
<div><span class="gmail_quote">I think every placer has a signature of their own, whether it is in the type of place they plant, the type of journey it takes to get to that place, the style of box, the story that goes along with, the type of hide they are known for, the sort of stamp they do, the type of cypher they use.  The only time I really DON'T enjoy finding a box is when all of these elements stink - and yes, there are a few boxes out there like that, aren't there?

<div>There is truly something for everyone in letterboxing.  I would hate to be the one who voiced her opinion loudly enough that someone took it for authority and missed out on an aspect of letterboxing that would've been their niche.

                    <html><body><div>We've been managing fairly well out here in East Texas, but today we got a long deluge and I'm afraid it's about to put us over the edge!  I work in an industrial park with nice wide, paved, sloped, and guttered roads, yet when I looked outside this morning the gutters were completely overrun and the water was running down the middle of the road.  The construction site down the road had the dirt built up to about 20 feet a month ago. It's now down to about 12 feet and I think every bit of it has washed out into the road, and today it was running down the ditches along the highway.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We live with a creek on each side of us, each about two blocks away. I'm beginning to wonder if we might start seeing them creeping toward us here soon!  Thankfully, my house is on pier and beam so the water can run under and not have to go through, at least for a little while.

<p>I love an excellent carved stamp (which is why I think Stargazer's stamps are some of my favs) but the one thing I really remember that impressed me with your Artist Series was your logbooks. You took such time and detail on those that I thought there is no way I could do something like that. You really did an outstanding job on those and although I haven't been able to "swim" out to Grapevine to find the next series, I do have that planned if it ever stops raining!

<div><font color="#ff0000" size="2"><font color="#0000ff">Thank you for the kind words. Since those are MY boxes, I agree... I like them too! However, I have had people write to me and tell me how they didn't enjoy finding those boxes because of the heavy foot traffic in the gardens (especially on weekends) making those boxes to hard to retrieve or replace. So I guess it's like Dewberry eluded to: to each his own. When Viewfinder and I box together, there are boxes she really enjoys which I'm not as enthusiastic about, and some I find a fun challenge that she finds dangerous (remember, she DID mention in her intro that she was my "wiser" sister). I really wouldn't know how to suggest boxes to others, other than say, "I" really enjoyed a box (and it's rare I don't).

<div>What is your trail name? I love Stargazer's work. I met her when I first started boxing. I found one of her boxes that she thought was lost in the Botanical Gardens. We have been friends ever since.  Sandy is a really great artist and teaches carving. I know the series you are talking about and that was one of my favorites too. I live in Fort Worth also and work in the medical field. Seems like we have alot in common. We should go boxing sometime.</div>

<div>Well, my family and I are very new at this. Our first box was on <br/>
Memorial Day. There was a break in the clouds, so we thought it was <br/>
safe to venture out. We were drenched! Had so much fun! I have been <br/>
to a series by Stargazer, which were great! I really liked them <br/>
because they were in cemetaries! Love old cemeteries. <br/>

Anyway...hello to all. I am in the north Fort Worth area, near <br/>

&gt; little interest in letterboxing! Seems like we just did a new <br/>
folks event,<br/>
&gt; but let's do another one for the new newbies.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; How about this? Everyone (old folks and old new folks too), let's <br/>
do a roll<br/>
&gt; call. State your trail name, your county (if you don't want to do <br/>
county,<br/>
&gt; do the nearest large city), and how long you've been letterboxing. <br/>
And how<br/>
&gt; about one interesting letterboxing fact about you too?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As our new members speak up, how about old members making <br/>
suggestions about<br/>
&gt; good first/next boxes for the new guys to find in their area?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; New members, please feel free to speak up with any questions or <br/>
thoughts you<br/>
&gt; may have. I encourage you to draw from the wealth of experience and<br/>
&gt; hospitality you will find amongst those who have been around awhile.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Here goes:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm BarefootLucy and I've been sober for 4 years - no wait, I've <br/>
been<br/>
&gt; LETTERBOXING for 4 years. I live in Cherokee County, which has <br/>
grown from 3<br/>
&gt; letterboxes in July '03 to 94 boxes in July '07. Wow - who said we <br/>
had to<br/>
&gt; tell one interesting fact about ourselves? Hmmm...okay, here <br/>
goes. I<br/>
&gt; almost always meet "unusual" people while I'm letterboxing.<br/>

Ooooh, yes.  So it may actually be better to recommend which boxes to <br>
*avoid*.  As a percentage, there aren't that many boxes that really <br>
stink, but if you know one you might as well tell those who ask to <br>
avoid it.<br>

<br>
But if you're recommending a few boxes, what happens if all the boxes <br>
you recommend happen to be by the same boxer?  Like, even if you <br>
don't mention the boxer by name, you still end up effectively <br>
recommending this particular boxer.  Is that all right?  Or do you <br>
deliberately throw in a recommendation for someone else's boxes even <br>
though they stink?<br>
<br>
There's two factors that apply to me here:<br>
<br>
1)  There are only three or four planters in the area.  It's hard to <br>
make any recommendations at all without noting which ones belong to <br>
which planter.<br>
<br>
2)  Nobody ever asks me for recommendations -- at least not for <br>
*good* boxes.  I'm more likely to get an inquiry about *quick* boxes, <br>
boxes that can be found while zipping past on the freeway without <br>
taking too much time.<br>

<div>That sounds like a good idea in theory, but I don't think I could bring myself to tell someone another person's box stinks - okay, maybe if they asked me point blank and I knew them well enough to know that what I think stinks would be what they think stinks.  I HAVE told folks that a particular box or two of mine aren't anything special - just mainly space fillers.  I guess I could warn folks though if a boxer seems to have notoriously unreliable hides AND they don't update their listings in a timely manner.

<br>
Hey, we happen to have a pair of rest areas here, so I planted a <br>
geocache in each rest area -- except they weren't in the rest area, <br>
they were just OUTSIDE the rest area in a Wildlife Management Area.  <br>
You couldn't get to them from the rest area unless you were willing <br>
to scale a 10-foot fence within sight of the 24-hour security at the <br>
rest area.  But when you looked at the dot on the map (which is what <br>
you see on the clue listing on geocaching.com) it sure LOOKED like <br>
they were in the rest area!<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, I did have some finders scale the fence.  Some <br>
actually found a break in one fence and ended up wearing a path to <br>
it.  I planned on wiring that fence shut myself, but ended up pulling <br>
the boxes anyway when Florida started requiring permits for geocaches <br>
in WMA's.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry it has taken me so long to respond to this, but I have been <br>
away on vacation.  So, here goes:  I am Silver Eagle, and it has been <br>
2 days since I last letterboxed . . .  oops, wrong forum.<br>
<br>
I live in Sugar Land in Fort Bend County and have been letterboxing <br>
almost 5 years (since 8/31/2002).  I am amazed at how much TX <br>
letterboxing has grown in that time and happy so many continue to <br>
participate.  If you want to see our growth, look back at the <br>
beginning of the last few years where I post stats called end of year <br>
reports.<br>
<br>
As for an interesting letterboxing fact, I love to place boxes as <br>
much or more than finding them, but not too close together.  I like <br>
to spread them out for greater exposure to new boxers.  Since I also <br>
love to travel, I have boxes in 32 states and 2 other countries, and <br>
would have a lot more if I had known about letterboxing earlier.<br>
<br>
Welcome to all the newcomers!<br>

I think I already did this (before I saw this message) to introduce<br>
myself.  I just saw that Desert_Warrior, in El Paso, TX is on here. <br>
Hi Mike!  Mike and his wife were the ones who introduced us to<br>
letterboxing and geocaching at a Ham Event in Rusk, TX.  (Yes, I'm a<br>
ham W7AMY)<br>
<br>
Here is a photoblog I have of some of our letterboxing and cache<br>
adventures:  http://geocaching.scrapblog.com<br>

<div><font size="2">Welcome aymztx. I was checking out the photos on your scrapblog and was delighted to see my letterbox was the first one you found (Old Bedford School). Glad to have a new boxer in the DFW area. I've moved from Bedford to McKinney a few months ago, and I'm just now finding time to go letterboxing again.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">In fact, I was out hiding two more boxes today, but they are north of the DFW metro - actually one is north of Denton! I haven't had a chance to enter the clues yet, but will announce those later today.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">We spent the entire day driving around the countryside in my husband's convertible, (hiding my two boxes) so now I need to go put some aloe on my sunburn (real smart) and drink some cold iced tea. Lake Ray Roberts is still really high and the State Park was still closed. I love driving through old small Texas towns, especially when the have a "happening" downtown district.  Today I certainly got my opportunity northwest of McKinney.  By the way Gryzzled Gryphon, esteemed Texas small high school football fan, I saw the Collinsville Pirates practicing today at their "facility". It seemed to be a large metal barn-type structure with about 30 pickup trucks parked around it. I could almost hear the band playing the fight song! It won't be long.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">The best part of today... I was able to find a farm with a stand along the side of a road selling fresh produce, and I got some green tomatoes. Nothing says summer like pinto beans, cornbread and fried green tomatoes!</font></div></body></html>
