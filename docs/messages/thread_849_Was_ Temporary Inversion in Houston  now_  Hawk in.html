Glad you had fun.  It's a really neat installation.<br/>

&gt; The vortex is waaaaaay cool! I had seen it but had not<br/>

&gt; If you do this, be prepared to get down on all fours,<br/>
&gt; then on your belly. You know I always have a camera<br/>
&gt; hanging around my neck, so I must have been quite a<br/>
&gt; sight! Such an undignified position for a hawk! I'm<br/>
&gt; sure Krohm got several photos of the spectacle...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We didn't see anyone collecting any money for<br/>
&gt; admission. I think it's just there for people to<br/>
&gt; enjoy.<br/>

&gt; Be sure to go into the house from the side and see the<br/>
&gt; vortex worming through the house.<br/>
