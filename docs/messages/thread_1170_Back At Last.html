                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm finally back from yet another vacation.<br/>
This one was over 2 weeks in Colorado and Wyoming<br/>
and we had a great time in COOL weather.  I have<br/>
to admit that after a few nights camping in 38 degree<br/>
weather I was happy to be back in the TX heat.  I<br/>
guess I really am just a Southern boy.<br/>
<br/>
I did manage to find and place a few boxes along the<br/>
way and I must say there are some great boxes in<br/>
these states.  Great locations and awesome stamps,<br/>
rivaling any I have seen.  I was almost embarrassed<br/>
to leave my meager efforts, but hopefully the locals<br/>
won't care.  <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of locals, I did get to meet a few in Colorado<br/>
and they are typical of letterboxers I have met everywhere;<br/>
very nice and hospitable.  I even met one on a trail<br/>
by pure luck!  I had on my TX LB shirt, but it was under<br/>
a jacket so she only saw my LBNA patch on my fanny pack.<br/>
Good thing I put it there because it saves me from asking<br/>
if somebody is a letterboxer and getting weird looks.<br/>
<br/>
I only got to find a few boxes in TX, but one I found<br/>
(Drifter in Waco by Rebel) had been visited by GG just 5 <br/>
days previous and the log had a note for him/her to contact<br/>
the placer.  I see from reading some of the posts while I <br/>
was gone that he/she did just that!  Even if she/he decides <br/>
to remain elusive, at least we have a way to notify he/she <br/>
of events if Rebel doesn't mind being the go-between.  I <br/>
would like to know GG's gender, though, and if he/she <br/>
carved their signature stamp.  If so, GG should definitely <br/>
place some boxes because it is awesome.<br/>
<br/>
I also see that Lucy has set a date for the Barn Raising<br/>
LB Gathering and I hope I can make it.  Since it will be<br/>
so close to Dallas, maybe Ruby can either get Julie (first<br/>
TX letterboxer) to come or have a gathering with her in<br/>
Dallas the day before so we can double our pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, I see several new people have joined the list,<br/>
so I say "Welcome to our family".<br/>

Get in touch with Ruby Tuesday about Texas t-shirts<br/>
and patches.  Check the Big List about LBNA patches -<br/>
I think Mohmers handles them...<br/>
