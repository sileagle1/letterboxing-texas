getting conflicting direction, so I'm gonna have to<br>
make this quick!<br>
<br>
I've got two sickies in my house right now, so I<br>
wasn't really inclined to hang out around the house<br>
after work today breathing in the germs.  I headed out<br>
to find a geocache that tricked me once (but only<br>
once, as it turned out today!), and in the meantime I<br>
checked on a couple of boxes in the same general area.<br>
 I have to say - after months of walking on dry<br>
ground, it was really nice to slip and slide around a<br>
little in the mud!  Yea rain!  <br>
<br>
I checked Blue Butterfly's Love's Lookout box.  It is<br>
in fine shape and dry and cozy even after the rain. <br>
Well visited AND well hidden - a nice combination!<br>
<br>
I also checked my own Killough Monument box.  I pulled<br>
up to the very secluded area and noticed they had<br>
brush-hogged around the perimeter, right in the area<br>
my box was!  My heart stopped for a moment because<br>
this box has gone missing once already and I really,<br>
really want to have a box there, but I didn't think I<br>
could take losing another one in that location.  I<br>
approached the place it was and saw no sign of it,<br>
until I saw that the hiding place was actually covered<br>
with leaves.  Dug a little and there it was, the box<br>
was sadly crumpled under the weight of the cover, but<br>
it was happy and dry, and had certainly not been<br>
lonely!  I replaced the container with one I had in my<br>
car and headed off happy to have had a 4/4 success<br>
rate (two gc's tried and found, two boxes checked and<br>
found to be intact).<br>
<br>
Lightning and I are planning to head off on a short<br>
box run tomorrow - no sense sticking around the house<br>
for us healthy folks!  Nobody ever said I would make a<br>
good nurse and besides, they are both adults and not<br>
so sick as to not be able to take care of themselves<br>
or else I would leave care packages at their bedsides<br>
before I leave for the day!  My mama's approach was<br>
"stay in your room until you're well - see ya then!"<br>
