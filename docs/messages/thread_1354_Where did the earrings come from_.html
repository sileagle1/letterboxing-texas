You haven't committed a boxing foul - and this list is<br>
a pretty safe place to ask questions without worrying<br>
about such a thing.  I guess the only real offense you<br>
could commit would be spoiling a box by telling the<br>
list exactly where to find it.<br>
<br>
Another option is that the box might have been found<br>
by a geocacher who found the box and left a trinket<br>
and probably just signed in, since they don't have<br>
personal stamps unless they box also.  It would've<br>
been customary for the cacher to leave a trinket and<br>
also take one, so you have to wonder what they thought<br>
about not having anything to take!  If this is what<br>
happened, it sounds like they were savvy enough to<br>
realize the stamp needed to stay in the box, so they<br>
left it as they should have done.  There are occasions<br>
of geocachers finding letterboxes and not<br>
understanding them, they take the stamp as the<br>
trinket.  Talk about a good way to get a letterboxer<br>
hopping mad!  I'm sure cachers have comparable stories<br>
about letterboxers...<br>
<br>
You can always log on to geocaching.com (you'll have<br>
to make a user name) and look to see if there are<br>
possibly caches near the box.  While boxing leads a<br>
finder to a very specific location, unless both the<br>
placing and the finding geocacher have really, really<br>
good GPS's OR the placer added sufficient clues to the<br>
cache's page to make it possible to identify the<br>
specific location, the finder gets to the right area<br>
and then has to start shuffling around to find the<br>
cache.  That's how a lot of boxes get turned up by<br>
cachers accidentally.<br>
<br>
I think it behooves us all on both sides of the fence<br>
to be at the very least aware of how the other hobby<br>
operates.  Geocaching.com is a good website and has<br>
lots of good information for newbie cachers.  And if<br>
you are so inclined, try it out!  I found several<br>
caches last year, but it just wasn't my thing.<br>
<br>
And if it wasn't a geocacher that left the earrings, I<br>
think we had better re-explore the activities of<br>
BEA's, cause we have a mystery on our hands!<br>

  I have been a Geocacher for about 4 years.  I just learned about 
  Letterboxing.  Guess how I learned.  There is a new type of Geocache 
  called a LETTERBOX-HYBRID.  Think of it as a Letterbox and a Geocache 
  living in the same box.  They are springing up all over.  I suppose 
  it isn't as well established as a real letterbox to a Letterboxer.  Gut 
  given time, and guidance, I think it will be good for both games.  I 
  needed a few weeks to "gear up" for letterboxing.  My thoughts and ideas 
  are still evolving quickly.  I am not artistic, and do not have the time 
  for carving stamps.  But I have taken some digital photos and turned them 
  into stamps.  Not hand-carved, but still quite nice.  I would send 
  one here, but I am not sure it would get through, and I am not sure if it is 
  protocol to reveal stamps.  But as more of us start making 
  letterbox-hybrids, and letterboxing, I believe you will see more Geocachers 
  going to letterboxes too.</font></strong></font></span></div>

******Believe it or not, these have been around<br>
awhile, at least since I started letterboxing (a<br>
little more than two years now).  Maybe they are just<br>
starting to pop up in your area!<br>
<br>
<br>

*****By the way, I read your clue you posted<br>
yesterday, and I really like the way you described<br>
what part of the hybrid was for the boxer and what was<br>
for the cacher.  I'm assuming your clue on the caching<br>
site is equally informative.  I think that's the only<br>
way the two can co-exist happily, is if each hobbyist<br>
understands what is theirs to do with and what is<br>
theirs to look at.<br>
<br>
> The Geocaching rule-of-thumb is TRADE UP, TRADE    ><br>
EVEN, OR DON'T TRADE.  <br>
<br>
*****I'm very glad to know this - the caches in my<br>
area typically had junk in them and I found that<br>
aspect to be less than inviting.  Before I went and<br>
found my first cache, I stressed over what I would<br>
take to exchange.  Didn't want to do too little, but<br>
didn't want to go overboard either.  I got to the<br>
first one and realized I needn't have worried.  While<br>
I letterbox for the location and the art, I found<br>
myself geocaching for the curiosity of what was going<br>
to be there when I got there.  I also found that our<br>
local caches weren't placed in nearly so nice of spots<br>
as letterboxes, so that lessened the appeal of the<br>
hobby for me too.  In one cache there was 7 cents, in<br>
another, $1.05.  Those were the only finds of "value",<br>
and frankly, if all I'm going to find is money, I'll<br>
watch my feet at Walmart and do as well.  There was a<br>
broken kids' ring in another, and a bouncy ball in yet<br>
another (okay, I forgot that one until I started<br>
trying to remember, but that one was pretty cool<br>
because my family LOVES bouncy balls!).  A coke tab in<br>
another, and other stuff of equally forgettable<br>
origins in the others.  My idea of "value" is<br>
something intriguing or quirky, not necessarily of<br>
monetary value.  I had a stock of AFLAC ducks for<br>
awhile (hubby is an insurance agent), so I left those<br>
in three of the caches I found.  I personally thought<br>
they were VERY cool!<br>
<br>
> As in any other thing, over time the geocache      ><br>
deteriorates to useless junk.  <br>
<br>
****You see, that's not particularly true in lb'ing. <br>
The stamp is the find and although it may wear and<br>
have to be replaced, it is still the treasure at the<br>
end of the hunt, that and the logbook with the stamps<br>
of the other finders.  And by stamping its image in my<br>
book, I'm taking home the prize as well as leaving it<br>
behind for the next person.  Barring rude, sick<br>
incidents of vandalism, the box is worth as much at<br>
the last find as it is at the first, and possibly more<br>
because of the history of the logbook.<br>
<br>
<br>

<br>
*****I've heard about caches like that.  I loved the<br>
idea of a themed cache or a cache with a target<br>
audience.  <br>
<br>
Well, it sounds like geocaching in my area is less<br>
than ideal.  That's a shame.  I had original thoughts<br>
of caching as I went boxing, but I lost interest due<br>
to the lack of ingenuity in geocaching.  I'll probably<br>
try it again some day on the strength of your<br>
description, but at the moment I have my head buried<br>
in so many different interests that I don't need to<br>
attack yet another.<br>
