It sounds as though we have enough interest to go ahead and get an order<br>
together. I've written to Wes Garrison for permission to use the logo,<br>
and the next step will be to talk to the T-shirt place.<br>
I'll let you know as soon as I have solid information on prices, colors,<br>
etc.<br>
Hope you all had a wonderful long weekend! <br>
