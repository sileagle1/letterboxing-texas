&gt; I trust you will be notifying the placer(s) of missing boxes in<br/>
&gt; Jacksonville?  I know mine were all in place not too long ago, so <br/>
if one has<br/>
&gt; recently gone missing, I want to run check it before too long <br/>
passes!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, if you don't get a response from the placer after you report <br/>
to them<br/>
&gt; that it's missing, would you email me off the list and let me <br/>
know?  I'd<br/>
&gt; like to check on those as well...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Yesterday, Ashby, myself, Random and Enaj, all of us went<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing before going to the Deaf Festival they were having <br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Jacksonville.  I have to say it was a delightful little trip.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; did not find all the letterboxes, and we think some of them must <br/>
be<br/>
&gt; &gt; missing.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; POOR POOR Enaj!  We split up the search among the four of us,<br/>
&gt; &gt; letting each person have a turn looking for a box, and each time <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was Enaj's turn to find the box...we didn't find it!  And that <br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; after a good long while of looking!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Also, while in Jacksonville, I finally dropped off The Cichlid <br/>
Guy's<br/>
&gt; &gt; hitchhiker "Traveling Pumpkins," and I also wish that i had <br/>
waited<br/>
&gt; &gt; and dropped off the "In this Sign" hitchhiker there in honor of <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Deaf Festival...but oh well.  AND we found the "H. H. Chic"<br/>
&gt; &gt; hitchhiker by Tx2chick.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So all in all, it was a great outing that ended well, and not <br/>
only<br/>
&gt; &gt; that Enaj and Random held up surprizingly well despite the long <br/>
day!<br/>
