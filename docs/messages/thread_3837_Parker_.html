<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">It is with great sadness that I send 
this.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Last </span>Sunday afternoon 
Parker asked me to let him go.  He came to me, and he licked my face, and 
he held out his cancerous leg.  The look on his face <span class="335274501-03112008">said it all </span>- <span class="335274501-03112008">and </span>it just broke my heart. <span class="335274501-03112008"> </span>He was asking me to do something<span class="335274501-03112008">.  He was asking me to make the pain go 
away!</span>  There was only one <span class="335274501-03112008">way I 
could make the pain go away.  He was asking for it</span>.  He said it 
was time.  He said he had given me every moment he could.  <span class="335274501-03112008">He had nothing left to give.  </span>So I did 
it.</font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><span class="335274501-03112008"><font face="Verdana" size="2">At 0850 on Monday 
4 Nov 2008 Parker crossed the Rainbow Bridge.</font></span></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">In April <span class="335274501-03112008">Parker </span>was diagnosed with bone 
cancer.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Dr. Julie </span>said he would 
live two to four weeks<span class="335274501-03112008"> more</span>.  Moni - 
God love her - got on the internet<span class="335274501-03112008">, found 
</span>and started a treatment program.  She had a goal, <span class="335274501-03112008">but </span>one step at a time.<span class="335274501-03112008">  </span>First <span class="335274501-03112008">step </span>was his birthday, 1 June.  He made it. 
 Next <span class="335274501-03112008">step </span>was the trip to 
Oklahoma in July.  He made it.  Then my birthday - 30 Aug.  He 
made it.  Then my son's visit<span class="335274501-03112008"> - early 
Oct.</span>  He made it.  Next <span class="335274501-03112008">step </span>on the list was <span class="335274501-03112008">to be </span>Thanksgiving.  We had a huge 
Turkey <span class="335274501-03112008">dinner 
</span>planned.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Parker </span>would 
have surely had his share<span class="335274501-03112008"> and 
more</span>.  <span class="335274501-03112008">He couldn't make 
that.  And I couldn't ask him to hold on any longer.  He was 
tired.</span></font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"><span class="335274501-03112008"></span></font><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><span class="335274501-03112008"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Parker slept 
peacefully Monday night.  His pain medication helped.  He was on our 
bed.  I slept fitfully beside him.  Sometimes after a dream he would 
wake and lick my face.  This morning he followed me everywhere, he wouldn't 
leave my side.  He had a great breakfast, not sprinkled with medications 
for once.  He gobbled it up.</font></span></div>
<div><span class="335274501-03112008"></span> </div>
<div>
<div><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Dr. Julie, wonderful person that she is, 
endured my over-emotional demeanor and gave Parker the rest he needed.  I 
sat with him on his favorite <span class="335274501-03112008">blanket</span>, 
hugged him and kissed him and assured him that I have never had a more wonderful 
dog.  And that I loved him.  And that I would miss him terribly.<span class="335274501-03112008">  That it was OK for him to go.  As he slid 
down I went down with him.  And when his breathing and heart stopped I 
think mine did too.  And then I cried.  We all 
cried.</span></font></font></div></div></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">Moni was looking for a photo of Parker. 
 Just Parker.  She doesn't have one.  Every photo is of Parker 
with me.  He loved me 100%.  It was mutual. </font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"> </font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana"><font size="2">Parker was my companion.  He was with 
me everywhere - even to places other friends couldn't follow.  Especially 
those places - the high lonesome mountain trails.<span class="335274501-03112008">  Right up to his last seconds we were 
together.  </span></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><span class="335274501-03112008"></span></font></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><span class="335274501-03112008">Parker earned 5 show titles.  We hiked 
hundreds of miles together.  We traveled thousands of miles to dog shows 
together.  We never just sat in the motel room after the show.  Every 
day - there was always a new adventure calling us.  Driving to and from the 
shows, there was always a back-road to explore, and we always stopped to smell 
the fire hydrants.  Parker volunteered at the Child Crisis Center.  He 
worked the Alzheimer's wing at Desert Springs.  He visited the old folks at 
many retirement centers.  He supported the El Paso Humane Society, marched 
in parades, and attended events in the Civic Center.  As a "neutral dog" he 
helped train dozens of therapy dogs.  He was the Franklin Mountain State 
Park Volunteer Mascot.  He loved camping and hiking.  And he 
would walk up to someone just to say "Hi".    He was 
always ready to go say "Hi".  He loved meeting people and 
socializing.  Those of you who met him, you know what a friendly guy he 
was.  He had a wonderful life.  I was lucky to have 
him.</span></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although his awards are listed from highest to 
lowest, I think the last <span class="335274501-03112008">one </span>was the 
most important.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Spoiled Rotten 
Companion.  </span>The rest of it was earned because he loved it, and 
because I loved him.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Our enthusiasm 
fed off each other.  He did it because I loved him, and I did it because he 
loved me.  I can't think of anything left undone.  </span>I don't 
think I can stand to be without him.  But I couldn't ask him to suffer 
just for me any longer.  It was time.  Time for his pain to go 
away.  Time for my pain to start.</font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have so many memories.  But right now I 
can't think of a one.  It just hurts so much.  I am sure with time the 
sadness will lessen, and I will remember the great times we had together.  
The hikes.  The dog shows.  The adventures.  The love.  
</font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">I had a nick-name for Parker.  "The Finest 
Dog".  In our family - he certainly was.  No dog in our house has ever 
in the 20+ years Moni has had dogs attained the number of awards and titles 
Parker earned.</font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">I guess God needed a good dog.  So he picked 
one.  The Finest Dog.</font></div>

<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">There is a bright side to all this.  If this 
is all I have to worry me, life is truly good.  God has blessed me with one 
of his finest creatures for 8 years.  We are supposed to care for our 
animals.  Sometimes <span class="335274501-03112008">I think </span>it 
is the animals who care for us.  There is a new pup.  <span class="335274501-03112008">His name is River.  </span>He will never replace 
Parker in my heart.  But I think <span class="335274501-03112008">- in 
time - </span>I can give him the chance to make his own place.  As much as 
it hurts to lose them, the saddest times of my life were those times when I 
didn't have a dog.  I will get through this.  It will just take a few 
days. </font></div>

<div><font face="Verdana"><font size="2"><span class="335274501-03112008">Parker earned 5 show titles.  We hiked hundreds of miles together.  We traveled thousands of miles to dog shows together.  We never just sat in the motel room after the show.  Every day - there was always a new adventure calling us.  Driving to and from the shows, there was always a back-road to explore, and we always stopped to smell the fire hydrants.  Parker volunteered at the Child Crisis Center.  He worked the Alzheimer's wing at Desert Springs.  He visited the old folks at many retirement centers.  He supported the El Paso Humane Society, marched in parades, and attended events in the Civic Center.  As a "neutral dog" he helped train dozens of therapy dogs.  He was the Franklin Mountain State Park Volunteer Mascot.  He loved camping and hiking.  And he would walk up to someone just to say
 "Hi".    He was always ready to go say "Hi".  He loved meeting people and socializing.  Those of you who met him, you know what a friendly guy he was.  He had a wonderful life.  I was lucky to have him.</span></font></font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">Although his awards are listed from highest to lowest, I think the last <span class="335274501-03112008">one </span>was the most important.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Spoiled Rotten Companion.  </span>The rest of it was earned because he loved it, and because I loved him.  <span class="335274501-03112008">Our enthusiasm fed off each other.  He did it because I loved him, and I did it because he loved me.  I can't think of anything left undone.  </span>I don't think I can stand to be without him.  But I couldn't ask him to suffer just for me any longer.  It was time.  Time for his pain to go away.  Time for my pain to start.</font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">I have so many memories.  But right now I can't think of a one.  It just hurts so much.  I am sure with time the sadness will lessen, and I will remember the great times we had together.  The hikes.  The dog shows.  The adventures.  The love.  </font></div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Verdana" size="2">I had a nick-name for Parker.  "The Finest Dog".  In our family - he certainly was.  No dog in our house has ever in the 20+ years Moni has had dogs attained the number of awards and titles Parker earned.</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The flowers were swaying in the gentle breeze<br>
the sun was shining; thru the leaves on the trees<br>
The meadows are green; and the grass grows tall<br>
off in the distance; is a waterfall.<br>
<br>
Over the falls; down through the creek<br>
the water flows gently; a rabbit sneaks a peek<br>
Far up above; in the deep blue sky<br>
the birds soar high; as they fly by.<br>
<br>
The animals play; at the bridge by the fall<br>
chasing each other; and just having a ball<br>
They play all day; from morning to night<br>
there's no more rain; just warm sunlight<br>
<br>
Off in the distance; the trumpets would blow<br>
all would look up; and notice a bright glow<br>
The harps would play; and the angels would sing<br>
as another pet has come home; who had earned his wings.<br>

A good dog comes, enriches our lives, and leaves us better than <br>
before.  It's sad that they have to leave so soon. I'm very sorry for <br>
your loss.<br>

is with great sadness that I send this.  Last Sunday afternoon
Parker asked me to let him go.  He came to me, and he licked my face, and
he held out his cancerous leg.  The look on his face said it all
- and it just broke my heart.  He was asking me to do
something.  He was asking me to make the pain go away!  There was
only one way I could make the pain go away.  He was asking for
it.  He said it was time.  He said he had given me every moment he
could.  He had nothing left to give.  So I did it.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

April Parker was diagnosed with bone cancer.  Dr. Julie said he
would live two to four weeks more.  Moni - God love her - got on the
internet, found and started a treatment program.  She had a goal, but
one step at a time.  First step was his birthday, 1 June.  He
made it.  Next step was the trip to Oklahoma in July.  He made
it.  Then my birthday - 30 Aug.  He made it.  Then my son's
visit - early Oct.  He made it.  Next step on the list
was to be Thanksgiving.  We had a huge Turkey dinner
planned.  Parker would have surely had his share and
more.  He couldn't make that.  And I couldn't ask him to hold on
any longer.  He was tired.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

slept peacefully Monday night.  His pain medication helped.  He was
on our bed.  I slept fitfully beside him.  Sometimes after a dream he
would wake and lick my face.  This morning he followed me everywhere, he
wouldn't leave my side.  He had a great breakfast, not sprinkled with
medications for once.  He gobbled it up.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

Julie, wonderful person that she is, endured my over-emotional demeanor and

favorite blanket, hugged him and kissed him and assured him that I have
never had a more wonderful dog.  And that I loved him.  And that I
would miss him terribly.  That it was OK for him to go.  As he slid
down I went down with him.  And when his breathing and heart stopped I
think mine did too.  And then I cried.  We all cried.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

5 show titles.  We hiked hundreds of miles together.  We traveled
thousands of miles to dog shows together.  We never just sat in the motel
room after the show.  Every day - there was always a new adventure calling
us.  Driving to and from the shows, there was always a back-road to
explore, and we always stopped to smell the fire hydrants.  Parker volunteered
at the Child Crisis Center.  He worked the Alzheimer's wing at Desert
Springs.  He visited the old folks at many retirement centers.  He
supported the El Paso Humane Society, marched in parades, and attended events
in the Civic Center.  As a "neutral dog" he helped train dozens
of therapy dogs.  He was the Franklin Mountain State Park Volunteer
Mascot.  He loved camping and hiking.  And he would walk
up to someone just to say "Hi".    He was always
ready to go say "Hi".  He loved meeting people and socializing. 
Those of you who met him, you know what a friendly guy he was.  He had a
wonderful life.  I was lucky to have him.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

his awards are listed from highest to lowest, I think the last one was the

earned because he loved it, and because I loved him.  Our enthusiasm
fed off each other.  He did it because I loved him, and I did it because

<br>
The Power of the Dog<br>
by Rudyard Kipling<br>
<br>
<br>
    There is sorrow enough in the natural way<br>
    From men and women to fill our day;<br>
    And when we are certain of sorrow in store,<br>
    Why do we always arrange for more?<br>
    Brothers and sisters, I bid you beware<br>
    Of giving your heart to a dog to tear.<br>
<br>
    Buy a pup and your money will buy<br>
    Love unflinching that cannot lie--<br>
    Perfect passsion and worship fed<br>
    By a kick in the ribs or a pat on the head.<br>
    Nevertheless it is hardly fair<br>
    To risk your heart to a  dog to tear.<br>
<br>
    When the fourteen years which Nature permits<br>
    Are closing in asthma, or tumour, or fits,<br>
    And the vet's unspoken prescription runs<br>
    To lethal chambers or loaded guns,<br>
    Then you will find--it's your own affair--<br>
    But ...  you've given your heart to a dog to tear.<br>
<br>
    When the body that lived at your single will,<br>
    With its whimper of welcome, is stilled (how still!)<br>
    When the spirit that answered your every mood<br>
    Is gone--wherever it goes--for good,<br>
    You will discover how much you care,<br>
    And will give your heart to a dog to tear.<br>
<br>
    We've sorrow enough in the natural way,<br>
    When it comes to burying Christian clay.<br>
    Our loves are not given, but only lent,<br>
    At compound interest of cent per cent.<br>
    Though it is not always the case, I believe,<br>
    That the longer we've kept 'em, the more do we grieve:<br>
    For, when debts are payable, right or wrong,<br>
    A short-term loan is as bad as a long--<br>
    So why in--Heaven (before we are there)<br>
    Should we give our hearts to a dog to tear?<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
TRIBUTE TO A DOG<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
The one absolutely unselfish friend that man can have in<br>
this selfish world,  the one that never deserts him,  the<br>
one that never proves ungrateful or treacherous, is his<br>
dog.  A man^s dog stands by him in prosperity and in<br>
poverty.  In health and in sickness.  He will sleep on the<br>
cold ground, where the wintry winds blow and the snow<br>
drives fiercely, if only he may be near his master^s side.<br>
He will kiss the hand that has no food to offer; he will<br>
lick the wounds and sores that come in encounter with<br>
the roughness of the world.  He guards the sleep of his<br>
pauper master as if he were a prince.  When all other<br>
friends desert, he remain.  When riches take wing and<br>
reputation falls to pieces, he is as constant in his love as<br>
the sun in its journey through the heavens.<br>
<br>
 Senator George Vest, 1870<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
To love at all is to be vulnerable.  Love anything, and your heart<br>
will certainly be wrung and possibly be broken. If you want to make<br>
sure of keeping it intact, you must give your heart to no one, not<br>
even to an animal.  Wrap it carefully round with hobbies and little<br>
luxuries; avoid all entanglements; lock it up safe in the casket or<br>
coffin of your selfishness.  But in that casket --safe, dark,<br>
motionless, airless -- it will change.  It will not be broken; it will<br>
become unbreakable, impenetrable, irredeemable...<br>
<br>
C.S. Lewis<br>
