<div>Lately, I've run across a surprising number of letterboxes left just out in 
the open, not even covered. or, in some cases, replaced casually near but not 
exactly where the original hiding place was supposed to be.  Today, for 
example, I found one lying right in open sight in a planting bed near a 
water feature where it was supposed to be hidden under some brush.  I've 
noticed in several instances that the previous finder was a person who is not 
listed on either AQ or LBNA as a letterboxer, although I've seen this same stamp 
in several logbooks in my area in recent weeks.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My guess is that it might be a child who is boxing with adults, and they 
are letting the child replace the box and not checking to be sure it's well 
covered, or it may be a new letterboxer who doesn't realize the risk to the 
letterbox if it isn't well-covered and they just aren't being careful in 

replacing it.  I'd have emailed the previous finder and reminded them about 
the importance of "RECOVERING WELL," but since they aren't listed on either 
website, I don't have a way to contact them directly.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I guess the point of this message is to ask, once again, for <u>every 
finder</u> to be sure they the have taken the time to rehide the letterbox 
exactly where the clues said it would be, and recover it well, so it will be 
there for the next finder.  Even well-hidden boxes in urban areas are 
always at risk, but considering the time and thought and effort involved in 
creating and placing a letterbox, finders do have a responsibility to RECOVER 
WELL if they are going to play.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Until very recently, I'd been very lucky and none of my 33 boxes had gone 
missing, but over the past few months I've lost 4 or 5, some of those in the 
best hiding locations, too.  When I see a letterbox carelessly left lying 
in plain sight, it really distresses me for the owner as well as for future 
finders who might not be able to enjoy the letterbox if it winds up missing 
first!  Thanks for listening, and please be sure: 
 Always, RECOVER WELL!  Thanks. </div>
