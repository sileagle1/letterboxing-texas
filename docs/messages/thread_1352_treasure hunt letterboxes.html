<div>I'd give the link to the clues, but they're all WOM so far. They are 5 of them, all in Colorado, in different locations, miles and miles apart. I can't remember what the clues are based on (it's something you would recognize) and she is off on a grand first time out of the country vacation with her sister in Italy right now. But you have to solve the clues in each treasure chest in order to get to the next one. I guess she gives out the clues for the first one. She carved all the stamps of course, and made all the logbooks. They are AWESOME. The whole thing has all kinds of cool stuff in it, invisible ink that you heat up to get the clues to appear, a 3D photo and 3D glasses to look at it with, all kinds of things like "gold" coins, a pipe that she made, just all kinds of totally awesome and cool stuff that she made, except for the ammo boxes and the wooden treasure chests. It took her months to make everything, weeks to find the right locations. Several people have worked their way to the last one and won a "prize" of some kind. The first few people raced to get to the end. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>She isn't making the clues public because she put SO much work into it, she doesn't want them to get messed up (or go missing) by those less than careful boxers that we all know are around, although one of them was already not put back together right. She would like them to last a long time. I helped her hide two of them when I was out there. We had a blast. </div>
