<br>
The problem as I see it is how do you ensure your boxes remain <br>
findable after you are gone.  This means finding a way to make sure <br>
your clues remain accessible so the boxes don't become lost relics, <br>
which would be nothing more than litter.  Ideally, you would also <br>
have someone adopt your boxes so they could update the status and <br>
perform maintenance if possible.<br>
<br>
In my case, my clues are on my own website which LBNA links to.  This <br>
means I would have to make sure someone kept my website alive or the <br>
clues would have to be transferred to LBNA.  However, just because <br>
they are on LBNA does not mean they will last forever.  What if the <br>
administrators decide to delete all clues from letterboxers that have <br>
not logged on in a set period of time?  Also, the clues would not be <br>
updated so missing boxes could only be surmised by "attempts" in the <br>
status field.  <br>
<br>
One solution is to make the adoption process easier, but this would <br>
put a huge burden on anyone adopting all my boxes.  And what happens <br>
when they leave the game?<br>
<br>
The only solution I have come up with is to get my son to agree to <br>
take over my boxes when I'm gone, but that is no guarantee by any <br>
means.<br>
<br>
As one boxer on the Big List stated, this problem should not be a <br>
high priority for things to worry about after you are gone, but I <br>
thought it deserved some discussion.<br>

Looks like you are trying to get the last laugh on the Rangers by <br>
hiding a box on NPS land after you are gone!  Also, you might be <br>
tempting letterboxers to turn grave robbers if they want your <br>
original BB#1 stamp!  Thanks for a good laugh.<br>

<p>Too bad I will probably go first, but if not, I will try to comply. <br/>Looks like you are trying to get the last laugh on the Rangers by <br/>hiding a box on NPS land after you are gone! Also, you might be <br/>tempting letterboxers to turn grave robbers if they want your

How about having the casket painted with primer, then everyone can <br>

I'm sure the webmaster would give you access to these <br/>&gt; boxes to take over. If boxes are not hosted on LBNA (or Altas Q), <br/>&gt; then you should probably include instruction for how to access <br/>them. <br/>&gt; If you do not have a partner, or family member that wants to <br/>handle, <br/>&gt; then I guess the boxes would become orphans, and hopefully we can <br/>&gt; access and update. I would hate to see my legacy of boxes just <br/>&gt; disappear. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; PS - Let this serve as notice to Silver Eagle, if I die you are
 to <br/>&gt; take over all 250+ boxes and maintain (HAVE FUN).
