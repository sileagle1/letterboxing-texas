<br/>
The problem as I see it is how do you ensure your boxes remain <br/>
findable after you are gone.  This means finding a way to make sure <br/>
your clues remain accessible so the boxes don't become lost relics, <br/>
which would be nothing more than litter.  Ideally, you would also <br/>
have someone adopt your boxes so they could update the status and <br/>
perform maintenance if possible.<br/>
<br/>
In my case, my clues are on my own website which LBNA links to.  This <br/>
means I would have to make sure someone kept my website alive or the <br/>
clues would have to be transferred to LBNA.  However, just because <br/>
they are on LBNA does not mean they will last forever.  What if the <br/>
administrators decide to delete all clues from letterboxers that have <br/>
not logged on in a set period of time?  Also, the clues would not be <br/>
updated so missing boxes could only be surmised by "attempts" in the <br/>
status field.  <br/>
<br/>
One solution is to make the adoption process easier, but this would <br/>
put a huge burden on anyone adopting all my boxes.  And what happens <br/>
when they leave the game?<br/>
<br/>
The only solution I have come up with is to get my son to agree to <br/>
take over my boxes when I'm gone, but that is no guarantee by any <br/>
means.<br/>
<br/>
As one boxer on the Big List stated, this problem should not be a <br/>
high priority for things to worry about after you are gone, but I <br/>
thought it deserved some discussion.<br/>

Looks like you are trying to get the last laugh on the Rangers by <br/>
hiding a box on NPS land after you are gone!  Also, you might be <br/>
tempting letterboxers to turn grave robbers if they want your <br/>
original BB#1 stamp!  Thanks for a good laugh.<br/>

He has told me that he does work, but ....how is he always on top of LB's right after they are planted? It doesn't even matter where in TX they are placed either....North or South, East or West...he always seems to get

I'm sure the webmaster would give you access to these <br/>&gt; boxes to take over. If boxes are not hosted on LBNA (or Altas Q), <br/>&gt; then you should probably include instruction for how to access <br/>them. <br/>&gt; If you do not have a partner, or family member that wants to <br/>handle, <br/>&gt; then I guess the boxes would become orphans, and hopefully we can <br/>&gt; access and update. I would hate to see my legacy of boxes just <br/>&gt; disappear. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; PS - Let this serve as notice to Silver Eagle, if I die you are
 to <br/>&gt; take over all 250+ boxes and maintain (HAVE FUN). Also, I want my <br/>&gt; Baby Bear Stamp #3 to become a box, somehow located at my grave <br/>(do I <br/>&gt; need to put this in my will). Baby Bear #2 will be the wife's <br/>&gt; responsibility, and will probably be located on Half Dome (if she <br/>can <br/>&gt; make that hike again). BB #1, the original store bought stamp is <br/>to <br/>&gt; be buried with me. All my log books can go to the Letterboxing <br/>&gt; Museum...I assume there will be one by then. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Baby Bear<br/>&gt; (Avoiding death and rangers) <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a> , "Barefoot Lucy" <br/>&gt; &lt;barefootlucy@&gt; wrote: <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Silver Eagle introduced this topic on The Big List and it <br/>didn't <br/>&gt; get the<br/>&gt; &gt; coverage I thought it should've, so I thought we might bring it <br/>&gt; over
