James has shared much of what he has done with me.  Including this account,<br/>
within hours of it occurring.<br/>
<br/>
James and I were instant-messaging tonight.  We were discussing many of the<br/>
actions K-troop saw in Mosul.  This one in particular haunts James.  <br/>
<br/>
On this mission James was the gunner for the Lieutenant's Hummer.  His duty<br/>
assignment was outside, manning the 240-Bravo in the hummer - providing security<br/>
to the crews inside.  As the battle unfolded James was called into the fight as<br/>
a medic.  He was the paramedic attending Sergeant Regalado.<br/>
<br/>
What follows is the story as written by the imbedded reporter.<br/>
<br/>
==============================================<br/>
<br/>
When an Ally Turns on You<br/>
<br/>
By Wesley Morgan<br/>
<br/>
MOSUL, Iraq - For a moment, I thought it was a misfire. The soldier standing in<br/>
the doorway thought so too. <br/>
<br/>
But after the shortest of pauses - a second or two, no more - that first shot<br/>
was followed by the long, loud crackling of an automatic burst. <br/>
<br/>
As I slammed my helmet onto my head I saw Sgt. First Class David Neuzil raise<br/>
his rifle and open fire outside the open doorway. After a few seconds the<br/>
ear-splitting buzz of sustained fire from American rifles was the only sound.<br/>
And then the shouts for medics.<br/>
<br/>
When the firing stopped I learned the shooter was not an insurgent but an Iraqi<br/>
soldier, Pvt. Muhammad Abdullah al-Hadidi. Now dead on the pavement, Private<br/>
Hadidi wore the standard Iraqi uniform of beige desert fatigues, with body armor<br/>
and a green helmet. <br/>
<br/>
Altogether, Private Hadidi killed two American soldiers and injured six others,<br/>
five of them badly enough that they have since been evacuated to the United<br/>
States.<br/>
<br/>
Having embedded with American forces in Mosul as part of a research project on<br/>
American military operations, I happened to be there that day, Nov. 12,<br/>
attending a meeting in an office just off the courtyard where the shooting<br/>
occurred.<br/>
<br/>
Not much is known about Private Hadidi. A native of Nineveh Province, he had<br/>
served four years in the battalion that was manning the outpost, and he had been<br/>
wounded in action more than once. <br/>
<br/>
When soldiers from two American cavalry platoons had arrived at the outpost<br/>
Private Hadidi rolled back the concertina wire to allow their Humvees to pass,<br/>
the Americans said.<br/>
<br/>
The platoons, part of K Troop, 3rd Squadron, 3rd Armored Cavalry Regiment based<br/>
out of Fort Hood, Texas had come to the outpost in the Zanjili neighborhood of<br/>
Mosul so that their lieutenants could meet with Iraqi commanders. <br/>
<br/>
While the meeting was underway, a dozen heavily armored American soldiers<br/>
settled down in the small courtyard outside. As they stood and sat there,<br/>
according to survivors I interviewed, Private Hadidi stepped out of a back room<br/>
and, without hesitation, started firing - first one shot and then the burst. <br/>
<br/>
Specialist Steven Bullock, who was himself shot in the leg, said they were there<br/>
"maybe ten minutes" before an Iraqi soldier came out of a back room and "started<br/>
gunning everybody down." <br/>
<br/>
He added: "We heard a single shot, and after that he wouldn't let go of the<br/>
trigger."<br/>
<br/>
As American soldiers began to fall, Sergeant Neuzil, the senior sergeant in Red<br/>
Platoon, returned fire. Three other soldiers joined him seconds later. "I<br/>
figured out afterward I shot him 19 times," Sergeant Neuzil said later.<br/>
<br/>
After being shot repeatedly the shooter fell to the ground, but then continued<br/>
to fire until Staff Sgt. Tony Carter, who had also been in the office, shot him.<br/>
<br/>
With the shooter down for good, First Lt. Christopher Hanes, the leader of Red<br/>
Platoon, rushed out of the office. I followed him.<br/>
<br/>
When the shooting ceased, I stepped out into the courtyard. It was an ugly<br/>
scene. <br/>
<br/>
One soldier - I later learned that he was Specialist Corey M. Shea, 21, of<br/>
Mansfield, Mass - was slumped over a flowerbed in the middle of the courtyard.<br/>
He had been shot in the head. "He's dead," Sergeant Neuzil said as he checked<br/>
Specialist Shea's vitals.<br/>
<br/>
About 10 or 15 feet to the right of where Specialist Shea had fallen lay the<br/>
crumpled, bloody corpse of the shooter, Private Hadidi. His Kalashnikov rifle,<br/>
with a large drum magazine, lay next to him. <br/>
<br/>
To the left of Specialist Shea's body, five other soldiers lay on the concrete,<br/>
wounded. They had been standing in a cluster, it appeared, and had been shot in<br/>
quick succession. A seventh soldier, Specialist David Ashley, was standing alert<br/>
in the courtyard, his rifle ready, but had a long gash on his face. <br/>
<br/>
As some soldiers peeled off to the right to secure the rooms that the shooter<br/>
had come from, I walked across the courtyard and knelt beside one of the wounded<br/>
soldiers, Staff Sgt. William Greenwood. I had been riding in his Humvee for the<br/>
past few days. <br/>
<br/>
The magazines strapped to his chest armor had been shattered by bullets, and he<br/>
had two visible injuries: gunshots to his arm and leg. As I opened the first-aid<br/>
pouch on my armor to dig for a tourniquet, I realized that the soldier kneeling<br/>
next to me evaluating Sergeant Greenwood's wounds had been hit. It was<br/>
Specialist Bullock. He kept working.<br/>
<br/>
Soldiers rushed in from the street where the Humvees were parked, responding to<br/>
the shouts for medics. A few feet away, soldiers pushed one of the most badly<br/>
wounded onto a stretcher and moved out. Someone laid a stretcher down next to<br/>
Sergeant Greenwood, and two soldiers and I pushed him onto it and carried him<br/>
out, toward a pair of hulking Bradley armored vehicles that would serve as<br/>
combat ambulances.<br/>
<br/>
After we had loaded Sergeant Greenwood into the back of one of the Bradleys, I<br/>
walked back into the compound. The wounded had all been rushed out. One soldier<br/>
was hurriedly gathering up the first aid gear and pieces of armor scattered on<br/>
the pavement.<br/>
<br/>
Others were maneuvering Specialist Shea's body onto another stretcher. One asked<br/>
where they should put him - the Bradleys were full. A Humvee, came the answer.<br/>
As the last soldiers and I left the courtyard and dashed to the trucks, the body<br/>
of the shooter lay untouched. <br/>
<br/>
On the breakneck ride through the streets of Mosul to the base hospital, the<br/>
interpreter and driver cried. Since Sergeant Greenwood had been the vehicle<br/>
commander, someone else had to do his job. Specialist Ashley, the soldier who<br/>
had been shot in the face, stepped up to the task. Twenty-five minutes after the<br/>
first shot was fired, medics wheeled the wounded into the trauma ward.<br/>
<br/>
Waiting outside the hospital for word on the casualties, I tried to piece<br/>
together what had happened. Where had the shooter come from? From the back rooms<br/>
of the outpost - there had been no Iraqi soldiers in the courtyard at all when<br/>
we first walked in. But why had he opened fire? There had been no shouting or<br/>
commotion from the courtyard beforehand - nothing at all. <br/>
<br/>
Over the next few days, trying to make sense of what I had seen, I talked to as<br/>
many of the soldiers who had been in the courtyard as I could find.<br/>
<br/>
None of the Americans I spoke to remembered seeing the shooter in the courtyard<br/>
until the moment he opened fire. Sergeant Neuzil was emphatic: "I do not<br/>
remember seeing him. I do not remember him walking in, I do not remember him -<br/>
the only time I was aware of his presence was when he started shooting."<br/>
