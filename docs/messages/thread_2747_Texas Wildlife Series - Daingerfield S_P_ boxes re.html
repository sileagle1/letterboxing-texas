                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to let everyone know that the boxes that were destroyed <br>
in the recent controlled burn at Daingerfield S.P. have finally been <br>
replaced. I had placed a series of 8 there - 3 of which were melted <br>
and/or gone. Two other boxes were melted, but the contents intact. <br>
Many thanks go out to tx dragonfly for her sitrep and to grizzled <br>
gryphon for his clue suggestions. In the process of replacing those <br>
boxes that were destroyed, I made some changes in location as well and <br>
then updated the clues accordingly. I hope the park goes awhile before <br>
they do another burn. Being such a big series that trails through the <br>
entire park, please let me know if you happen by there and how those <br>
boxes are doing. Thanks for your patience while I recarved and <br>
reassembled. Kandy (JKC)<br>
