<br>
We (Wisconsin Hiker, Martini Man & Tabby Tales) have booked flights, <br>
car & lodging.  Here's our plan:<br>
<br>
Arrive late Friday NOV 18 in Austin<br>
NOV 19-20 Austin area<br>
NOV 21 - head northwest, overnight in Marble Falls<br>
NOV 22 - head southwest, overnight in Ingram<br>
NOV 23 - Ingram area<br>
NOV 24 - head to San Antonio, overnight in San Antonio<br>
NOV 25 - San Antonio area<br>
NOV 26 - head back to Austin, flight home at 5 pm.<br>
<br>
If anyone in those areas would like to meet for some boxing, or <br>
dinner one night, or just an exchange, please email me.<br>
<br>
We've already received a recommendation for Coopers BBQ and Inmans <br>
Kitchen.  We'd welcome any other restaurant suggestions (including <br>
what may be open in San Antonio on Thanksgiving).<br>
<br>
We've also heard about the wineries and an apple place.  If there are <br>
any other interesting spots you'd like to call to our attention, <br>
please do so.<br>
<br>
In researching our trip, I noticed that there will be a big event on <br>
Friday NOV 25 on the San Antonio Riverwalk (lighting ceremony, <br>
floats, etc).  Has anybody been to this?  Should we get tickets?<br>
<br>
Since we'll be spending a fair amount of time letterboxing, we're <br>
interested in purchasing some Texas patches.  Is there anyone we can <br>
buy them from while we're down there, or should we just order and <br>
have them mailed to us?<br>
<br>
Thanks for all the advice so far that has helped us in our planning.  <br>
We're hoping to meet a few of you during our trip if possible!<br>

I recently bought some Great Lakes patches from you because we had intended<br>
to visit family/play tourist in your area. With all the college visits with<br>
our youngest, we have not been able to get up there, but the patches are<br>
GORGEOUS!<br>
Write to me offlist at:<br>
Celticlions at Comcast dot net<br>
And I'll let you know the info about Texas patches.<br>
