group in the next few days.  Latest I read was that Yahoo expected to <br>
do some maintenance on groups tomorrow night late, but that the <br>
maintenance may have to be postponed until another time.<br>
<br>
We aren't really a bunch of late-nighters so we may never know that <br>
the group is down, but just in case you have a case of insomnia and <br>
log on to kill a little time, only to find the group is dead, I wanted <br>
you to know we haven't run out on you.  If you happen to post a <br>
message to the group while it is down, your message will be queued <br>
until the group returns.<br>
<br>
This applies to any Yahoo Groups you may belong to, so keep it in mind!<br>
