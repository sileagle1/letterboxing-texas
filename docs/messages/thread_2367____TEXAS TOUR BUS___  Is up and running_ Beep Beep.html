I went to see what was going on and there I saw a wild sight! A bus full of amazing passengers all tangled in thorns back in near a nature trail! It's a good thing that there was a winch on that bus, because it was really up in the brambles! But everyone worked together to tie her in and before you knew it she'd been righted, turned around, and with a quick fanfare from the horn was setting off again! The kind driver dropped me off at work and began to head out on the open road! I met a lot of interesting folks on that bus and am curious about where it will end up next! I'm sure we'll here from it soon.</p>

<p>I just dodged a crazy bus at South Lakes Park in Denton! This driver <br/>was nuts! Jumped the curb at the basketball courts -Some poor lady dove <br/>into a bathroom stall from fear! You should have SEEN her face! It took <br/>out the nets at the tennis courts...just kept on going with 'em stuck <br/>on the windshield! (I think the driver turned on the wipers -to no <br/>avail!) At any rate... I saw him swerve left at the first nature trail, <br/>skidding on loose gravel... almost took out the second nature trail <br/>sign with the map! It banked a sharp right after side swiping the green <br/>post on a bearing of 320 degrees, ricocheted off the evergreen and <br/>landed with a screetch behind a short tree bearing 30 degrees. Out the <br/>rear window I saw Janis flash the peace sign and smile cheerfully, so <br/>I'm sure all is well. A little shaken but not stirred! They're gonna <br/>have a frightful time pulling that poor bus out of the thorns around <br/>there! I'm glad no one was hurt. -Didn't get his plates but I did <br/>notice they were from Houston... boy, I've heard about those Houston <br/>drivers... but I NEVER would've believed it if it weren't for this! ;-)<br/> <br/>-Queen Beeloved<br/> *who drives like a granny!* </p>

<div>Way to go Beneficus Rex - hope you made some interesting acquaintances on your ride on that bus. I've heard they're a pretty rowdy bunch.</div>
