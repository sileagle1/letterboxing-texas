                    <div class="plaintext-content">Bird Dog and I had opportunity on Sat to roam the backroads of the Painted Churches. It was a most beautiful day--blue sky, warm sun, cool breezes. Headed east on 290, then south to Serbin to see St. Paul Lutheran. I have taken my parents and visitors to see these churches many times in years past, but that was BLB. It was fun to remember having visited with my dad, and then to have a letterbox matching the church! And wonder of wonders GG hadn't been there yet!<br/>
Then we hit the road south thru LaGrange to Praha, intending to then circle back. And there was the Houston-to-Austin 150M Bicycle race. Lots of bicycles! Lots and lots of bicycles! Made it thru and headed on to Praha, circled north again to High Hill, then east to Piano Bridge. Several folks taking pictures, so drove on to  St. Cyril and Methodius, then on back to the Bridge. Amateur photographers gone, but loud rumble coming our way. Harleys this time. Lots of Harleys. Lost count as they made that bridge sing, and we waved and they saluted. What a fun place, and shout out to Cancan, who was instrumental in seeing that historic bridge restored.<br/>
Now on to Ammannsville, where we encountered a tour group. Churches, cemeteries and bluebonnets. Seems like a rite of spring in central Texas. <br/>
By this time day was waning, so just enough time to circle back thru LaGrange and pick up AstroD's new box Far Afield. But what do we encounter but more of the bicycle route. We had no choice, no place to turn around, so there we were driving along side the riders, we in the left lane as they were in right lane. Apparently oncoming traffic was stopped as no one came our way. I don't know how many riders there were, but I did see on with a number 8xxx. <br/>
All in all, it was a beautifully relaxing day. Lots of India Blanket and paintbrush, yellow flowers, white ones, and bluebonnets. And lovely carves along the way. Thank you, Silver Eagle, for planting this series. And AstroD for adding to the mix.<br/>

Some time I would like to do that route and see all the painted churches, they are so lovely. Glad you had time to find my box. The clues are on AQ and have some restrictions, so, if you can't see them there...well, that's not the only place you can find them....:-)<br/></div></body></html>
