&gt; I'm really glad it isn't like that too!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT - there is a lot to be gleaned from the Big List.  That's where <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; long-term folks hang out, the ones who were in it from the <br/>
beginning, the<br/>
&gt; ones that can give some depth to the game for those who are just <br/>
coming into<br/>
&gt; it.  And therein is the rub...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You may or may not have noticed that there is sort of a <br/>
generational thing<br/>
&gt; in letterboxing.  The generations are a lot shorter now than they <br/>
are in<br/>
&gt; real life.  I visualize the scene as a big ol' family farm, with <br/>
lots of<br/>
&gt; dogs.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The newbies are the puppies.  They are very excited and romp <br/>
around, yapping<br/>
&gt; along and tugging on the tails of the bigger dogs.  They think they<br/>
&gt; discovered the stick.  Every new game is a great idea and they jump <br/>
in with<br/>
&gt; all four feet to play.  Without puppies, the farm will eventually <br/>
run out of<br/>
&gt; dogs, but goodness, are they ever obnoxious sometimes.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And puppies get older - the young dog is above all that romping <br/>
around and<br/>
&gt; silliness.  He envisions himself much wiser than the puppy, although<br/>
&gt; occasionally he can be caught playing with the stick too.  But he <br/>
knows the<br/>
&gt; puppy didn't invent the stick - after all, HE invented the stick.  <br/>
He knows<br/>
&gt; there is a lot he doesn't know, but he wants to hang with the old <br/>
dogs, so<br/>
&gt; he pretends.  If he's a smart dog, he learns not to howl with the <br/>
big dogs,<br/>
&gt; but to listen to them howling and notice what makes them howl.  <br/>
Somewhere in<br/>
&gt; there, he vows not to become like those old grouchy dogs though.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And the young dog becomes the working dog.  Who knows what job he <br/>
has, but<br/>
&gt; who cares.  He doesn't have time for that stick, and he gets really<br/>
&gt; irritated watching the younger ones playing with it - after all, he <br/>
is now a<br/>
&gt; working dog and he has to worry about what must be done and how it <br/>
must be<br/>
&gt; done and who cares if it gets done.  He's gotten it all figured <br/>
out, but<br/>
&gt; he's too busy working to realize it.  Occasionally at the end of <br/>
the day, he<br/>
&gt; kicks back on his haunches and howls away with the old dogs, but he <br/>
tries<br/>
&gt; not to howl as loud as them because he feels like he hasn't quite <br/>
earned the<br/>
&gt; right.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, there are the old dogs.  Retired they are.  They've <br/>
done their<br/>
&gt; due and it's time for them to relax on the porch.  They sleep most <br/>
of the<br/>
&gt; day, dreaming of their glory days.  They are pretty happy, until <br/>
one of<br/>
&gt; those young yappers accidentally slaps him with the stick, and <br/>
then, oh<br/>
&gt; then, he comes alive and all but eats the pup for lunch.  By now he <br/>
realizes<br/>
&gt; the stick has been there all along and dogs long before him had the <br/>
stick<br/>
&gt; too.  He looks at those puppies and realizes how silly they are, <br/>
how they<br/>
&gt; have all these silly games they play, but he knows they really <br/>
don't have a<br/>
&gt; point in the end.  He has a little respect for the working dogs, he<br/>
&gt; tolerates the young dogs, but those puppies?  They really, really <br/>
get on his<br/>
&gt; nerves.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That's how I see the big list and why I think there are so many <br/>
flames<br/>
&gt; there.  It is, after all, the original letterboxing talk list for <br/>
the US and<br/>
&gt; that's where the first boxers wound up.  Now as new folk come along <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; start trying to use the Big List for a sounding board for their new <br/>
ideas or<br/>
&gt; thoughts or concepts, the porch dogs get cross and shoo them away <br/>
because<br/>
&gt; they have already been there and done that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

<div>I have an old black lab and a new kitten. This feisty kitten really wants the lab to play with her. She lays down under his chin and rolls around swatting at him with her paws in hopes that he'll hop up and have a good game of chase with her. I looked into his eyes last night and saw him thinking, "just one good gulp and that little rascal  will be history!" She'd better watch her step around "old cranky".</div>

<div>My four year old grandson was telling me yesterday that his speech therapist is<em>old </em>(she's about 30); I shuttered and asked him is she was <em>old</em> like me, and he replied, "No! You're NEW." Age.... it is a state of mind, isn't it?</div>

Well said, everyone!  I used to peruse the Big List when I first <br/>
started back in 04, but quickly ran away, squealing, with my tail <br/>
between my legs!<br/>
<br/>
The Texas List is more like a big old wooden porch, with plenty of <br/>
comfy cushions for the "old dogs", plenty of bones for the young dogs <br/>
to gnaw on, and plenty of sticks for the puppies to chase!  I'm always <br/>
so thankful that Texas boxers are the nicest "Dogs" in boxing!<br/>
