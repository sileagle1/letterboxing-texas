Well said, everyone!  I used to peruse the Big List when I first <br>
started back in 04, but quickly ran away, squealing, with my tail <br>
between my legs!<br>
<br>
The Texas List is more like a big old wooden porch, with plenty of <br>
comfy cushions for the "old dogs", plenty of bones for the young dogs <br>
to gnaw on, and plenty of sticks for the puppies to chase!  I'm always <br>
so thankful that Texas boxers are the nicest "Dogs" in boxing!<br>
