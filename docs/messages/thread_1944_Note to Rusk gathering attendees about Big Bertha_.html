memories of that night, and the warmup at Maydelle<br/>
winery.  In fact, I plan to break out the bottle of<br/>
wine I bought there later this year and toast our<br/>
successful gathering.<br/>

P.S.  After our dinner that night I went back in the<br/>
kitchen to personally thank Bertha for the great meal<br/>
by giving her a kiss on the cheek.  I hope that wasn't<br/>
the cause of her closing down!<br/>
