                    <div class="plaintext-content">I want to assure all who are questioning purpleintexkim's honesty <br>
that she is, in fact, telling the truth. I have personally seen the <br>
damage to her family's shop building the same day it happened. They <br>
live in a small mobilehome and use the building for storage. She had <br>
her girls summer clothes stored along with some of her and her <br>
husbands clothing. She also had several boxes of collectibles along <br>
with items handed down from her grandmother. All of which is broken. <br>
They also had a lot of thier girls toys stored in the shop. A lawn <br>
tractor and garden tiller were in the shop as well as her husbands <br>
tools and camping/fishing stuff. Kim had stored all the items from <br>
her kitchen, living room, bedroom in the shop building that would'nt <br>
fit in her home after her husbands medical eqipment was moved in.He <br>
is still not well and will never be able to work again.I have <br>
resently found out that the fire department was never called out <br>
because there were no injuries or fire. Thank God for watching over <br>
them.What we really need to be thankful for is that Kim and her <br>
family were not injured and still have thier home. Kim has been a <br>
really good friend to me and I trust her, she has always been honest <br>
with me. I have never know Kim to be deceitful or dishonest. In fact <br>
she has been brutally honest with me at times, and I am grateful. <br>
