today and planted a couple more on our way home.<br/>
<br/>
Michelle kindly agreed to take Ant M to Kansas, so my<br/>
son and I went and planted a box along her route so<br/>
she could pick up Ant M and take her on to Kansas for<br/>
tornado season.  I'll post the clues to that one<br/>
tomorrow as soon as I know she's passed through so Ant<br/>
M doesn't accidentally get picked up by someone else. <br/>
I WILL say though - it's somewhere in Buffalo, along<br/>
with a couple new boxes within 10 miles of Buffalo.<br/>
<br/>
My LSS husband has been wanting me to do a series of<br/>
brands - you know, like ranch brands?  On the drive to<br/>
Buffalo, I spotted a couple of brands I could carve<br/>
and drop on my way home, so that's what I did.  I<br/>
invited anyone who wants to contribute to this series<br/>
to go right ahead.  I'm calling it the Branding Iron<br/>
Series.  The nice thing about cattle brands is they<br/>
are usually easy to draw because they are intended to<br/>
be almost a signature, not just on the rumps of<br/>
cattle, but in correspondence and notes and so forth.<br/>
So....for you folks who are a little afraid of<br/>
carving, why don't you go out and find a ranch with a<br/>
distinctive brand and add your effort to this series? <br/>
I really like the idea of doing branding irons because<br/>
they are so closely identified with Texas!<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the host box I planted and the HH I<br/>
left there, and the two Branding Iron Series boxes, I<br/>
also may have accidentally left a little bit of a pest<br/>
problem in one box - oh well, Time to Spray!<br/>
