                    <div class="plaintext-content">My two youngest daughters and I headed out to Waxahachie this <br/>
afternoon. We made it to SCC at 5:00. It was pretty creepy. The <br/>
parking lot should've been full of cars vying to get to the exit <br/>
first to go home. <br/>
<br/>
Carrie, 21 now as of the 8th, pointed to a place that in her <br/>
interpretation would've been where the clues led us. I said, "No way. <br/>
It's over there somewhere." Man I hate when the kids are right. We <br/>
walked and drove around for 15 minutes before I gave in to show her <br/>
how wrong she was. Okay, so she was right this time. <br/>
<br/>
Cassie, still 5, slept from downtown, through the entire find, all <br/>
the  way back to Bedford.<br/>
<br/>
As we were leaving the parking lot, a Sheriff drove by, then another <br/>
one came in behind us and followed us the entire 5 miles back to the <br/>
freeway. He was less than two car lengths behind us as we did from 45 <br/>
to 55 the whole way. I think someone must have called in. He was <br/>
probably looking at all the crazy things that have involved my car in <br/>
the last year. It was pretty nervewracking.<br/>
<br/>
We made it safely home. Gary, who didn't get off in time to go, is <br/>
making chicken strips and mashed potatoes. I don't have the heart to <br/>
tell him that we got lost on the way home (287) and stopped at <br/>
Braum's for an ice cream.<br/>

                    <html><body><div>I think at least part of that facility must be Sheriff property now, because we also saw a sheriff's car there when we were there, parked over by the next building down from the one where you park for the box.  Something I read somewhere made me believe Ellis County was leasing space there, like maybe storage space for extra equipment.  So yeah, he was probably really wondering why you were out there around their stuff!  I wonder how long it will be before one of them pulls one of us over to ask what we were doing there!

<div>I think you're making the right decision in not telling him you've already had Braum's - maybe you can manage to slip your chicken strips to the dog while he's not looking!</div>
