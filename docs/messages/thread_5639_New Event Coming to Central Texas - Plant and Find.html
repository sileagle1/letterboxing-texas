                    <html><body><p>The central texas letterboxers are extending an invitation to all interested boxers to a new event and a new event style - plant &amp; find. The event focuses on spending time planting boxes and then getting together as a group to exchange clues and eat and then heading back out to look for boxes.Â  This worked out well at Reimers Ranch County Park a couple weeks ago and so we are going to try it again at Colorado Bend SP during the first weekend of April. Saturday will be for people to plant whatever boxes they want along trails in the park. Then we will get together for dinner somewhere and exchange clues and Sunday will be spent out searching for the newly planted boxes. The event is posted on AQ at <a href="https://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.php?eventId=4141" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">https://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.php?eventId=4141</a><br/></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>
