<div>I pulled a search of boxes within 25 miles of Denton.  I've identified the ones I really want to find.  I see the little check boxes next to the box names and I click the ones I chose.  Now I clicked the "Add tags" button and my selections have a star beside them.  What the heck do  those little stars do for me?

Say you have identified about 15 boxes (that's just a random number,<br>
it can be anything) you want to find.  You can do a search just for<br>
your tagged boxes and then they'll pop up.  From there, you can click<br>
those boxes and print whichever you want to print.<br>
