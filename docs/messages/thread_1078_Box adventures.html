<br>
The Daily Grind -- full of water. I have brought this<br>
one home to revive it and will get it back to the<br>
hiding spot within a couple of days. I didn't ride my<br>
bicycle to the coffee shop today, but I had a good<br>
excuse, and it wasn't the rain: I rode in the Katy<br>
Flatlander bicycle ride this morning. It was 34 miles<br>
of furious pedaling fun!<br>
<br>
Strings Attached -- Missing. Seems like nearly all my<br>
boxes are coming up missing lately. I think the<br>
beignet-eating-aliens have developed a taste for hawk<br>
eggs. :(<br>
<br>
A Little Stamp Mystery -- dry and AWESOME!<br>
<br>
Missing Spots? -- is Missing. I'm positive I was<br>
searching in the right Spot, but, well, the only thing<br>
in the area were some extremely wet, irritated, and<br>
stealthy fire ants that swarmed up my legs before I<br>
noticed them and began gnawing on me. Yikes! I'm<br>
covered with battle wounds! ...And no stamp to placate<br>
me... :(<br>
<br>
Hawk<br>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We had a good boxing day. Old Baylor Park, 2 boxes, 
Brenham Ice Cream and Letter For a Son in Chappell Hill. My husband is a mason 
and this was a real experience for him.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The Ice Cream box was our first urban box and three 
is a lot of traffic there. So we got the map out and spread it over the area and 
just felt around. Due to the lack of rain the bushes were kind of sparse and the 
box was really in plain view.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">When we rehid it we covered it up a little with 
some mulch.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hopefully the rains we had this weekend will get 
everything growing again.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Always love going to Brenham cause we get to eat at 
Purcell's!</font></div>
