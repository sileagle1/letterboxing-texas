Of course, you would still have to go through the permitting process, but I encourage you to try it.  I don't know if any of the old boxes are still there, but we are going to place a couple of boxes there in the next couple of weeks and, when we do, we'll look for all the old ones that might have survived the storm.  I asked about the old boxes and was told that they would, in this park at least, consider them "grandfathered" and wouldn't require a permit since it wasn't necessary when they were placed.

    Good to know Martin Dies is back and in good shape.  That used to be
    one of our favorite camp grounds but after Rita we knew it was
    closed "indefinitely" and never check to see if it had been
    reopened....<br/>

I've been post-hurricanes and found most boxes that are listed in the park. In April of this year I found Baby Bear's Campfire Bears, Hawk's Sqirrelly Camper, and Hawk's Day Hiker. I'm pretty sure Hawk's Can U Canoe was a storm casualty, though. If you visit the park, Maydelle Queenbee's HOH in Jasper is alive and nearby, but jb kokopelli's Charlie's Arm is a definite MIA - I found the battered Tupperware that used to house it (interesting story on that box, though. Worth the trip to the cemetery just for that.)<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - just chiming in. The park sure makes for a nice weekend of letterboxing and could benefit from a few more boxes.<br/>

SQZ was 11-ish and Dvir was a baby (so this has been well over 10 years ago). We decided to take a quick walk around what I believe must have been the Island Trail. While we were out there on the trail, we found ourselves in the middle of an amazing display of fireflies - they were everywhere around us! We were all spellbound and must have stood there watching them for about 10 minutes. There were so many of them that they almost lit up the area around us. Finally, they drifted on by and we continued down the trail. As often happens in the woods, the daylight was shorter than we had expected when we got out of our car. We found ourselves on that trail in the dark pushing a stroller with a baby and a walking child and no flashlight - on an island with one trail in and out. It got VERY dark out there and a couple of times we walked into the edges of the water. We missed the trail off the island and made an extra pass around. Thankfully most especially for Fearless Fox, who can make just about anything fun, and we laughed our way back to the car finally.<br/>
