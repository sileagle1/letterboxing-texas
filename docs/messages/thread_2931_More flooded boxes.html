Option B:  Fasten the container securely in place.  I have several <br/>
letterboxes in locations that might flood, and they are tied down <br/>
with metal chains.  I use a clip to attach the chain to the container <br/>
so finders can unclip it and carry it to somewhere convenient to <br/>
stamp in.<br/>
<br/>
In some cases, I tie a bit of stainless steel wire around the <br/>
container to form a loop to fasten the clip to.  It's gotta be <br/>
stainless, I've found regular steel wire rusts away in only a couple <br/>
of months.  I've also considered using copper wire, or perhaps <br/>
insulated copper wire with black, brown, or dark green insulation.<br/>
<br/>
I've got tons of chain laying around, light-duty stuff intended for <br/>
hanging plants or whatever.  I typically connect it to the clip with <br/>
a key ring.<br/>
<br/>
I usually fasten the chain down to a tree or something with a big <br/>
screw.  Sometimes I just wrap it around a tree or root and fasten it <br/>
with another key ring, but that doesn't work too often.<br/>
<br/>
Needless to say, if the place floods you're gonna be hoping that the <br/>
container is truly watertight!  Lock&amp;Locks reportedly work, and <br/>
probably the imitators, but it's not easy to fasten a chain to them.  <br/>
Some just use duct tape, which will probably work for a good long <br/>
while.<br/>
<br/>
Most everything else leaks.  I'm using big-mouth screw-top jars (like <br/>
peanut butter jars) and adding a bit of vinyl under the lid as a <br/>
gasket.  Seems watertight, but I haven't tested them in an actual <br/>
flood yet.<br/>

<div>Ah ha! So YOU'RE the one! About a year ago, while I was out scouting a spot for a letterbox, I found a large geocache (not yours actually) chained to a tree. It was most quite obvious and  extremely unsightly. I remarked to the person I was boxing with that is the reason rangers get so upset thinking we are going to trash their parks. I figured once the park staff came upon that, they would most certainly ban letterboxing/geocaching from their park. I would suggest that chaining a box to a tree is not a good idea. I don't think boxes washing into the creeks is much better though, so we do need to come up with places and ways to hide our boxes that aren't environmentally problematic. I probably lost six boxes in the recent rains, so I'm certainly doing my part to contaminate the environment. Although this type of flooding generally occurs in our area only about every six years, and this year was more significant than we've seen in decades, I will certainly be more careful when I select places to hide future boxes.</div>

<br/>&gt; container to form a loop to fasten the clip to. It's gotta be <br/>&gt; stainless, I've found regular steel wire rusts away in only a <br/>couple <br/>&gt; of months. I've also considered using copper wire, or perhaps 
<br/>&gt; insulated copper wire with black, brown, or dark green insulation.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've got tons of chain laying around, light-duty stuff intended <br/>for <br/>&gt; hanging plants or whatever. I typically connect it to the clip 
<br/>with <br/>&gt; a key ring.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I usually fasten the chain down to a tree or something with a big <br/>&gt; screw. Sometimes I just wrap it around a tree or root and fasten <br/>it <br/>&gt; with another key ring, but that doesn't work too often.
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Needless to say, if the place floods you're gonna be hoping that <br/>the <br/>&gt; container is truly watertight! Lock&amp;Locks reportedly work, and <br/>&gt; probably the imitators, but it's not easy to fasten a chain to 
<br/>them. <br/>&gt; Some just use duct tape, which will probably work for a good long <br/>&gt; while.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Most everything else leaks. I'm using big-mouth screw-top jars <br/>(like <br/>&gt; peanut butter jars) and adding a bit of vinyl under the lid as a 
<br/>&gt; gasket. Seems watertight, but I haven't tested them in an actual <br/>&gt; flood yet.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- Kirbert<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></span></div>

&gt; Ah ha! So YOU'RE the one! About a year ago, while I was out scouting a<br/>

<br/>
&gt; I would suggest that chaining<br/>

<br/>
We can agree to disagree on that.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't think boxes washing into<br/>
&gt; the creeks is much better though<br/>
<br/>
Oh, c'mon!  It's MUCH worse!  One creates litter, the other does not!<br/>
<br/>
&gt; so we do need to come up with places<br/>
&gt; and ways to hide our boxes that aren't environmentally problematic.<br/>
<br/>
I don't believe anchoring a box is environmentally problematic.  If I <br/>
did, I probably wouldn't be letterboxing at ALL, since clearly just <br/>
leaving something made of plastic in the woods is environmentally <br/>
problematic.<br/>
<br/>

&gt; probably lost six boxes in the recent rains, so I'm certainly doing my<br/>

Ah ha! So YOU'RE the one!  :-)<br/>
<br/>
Seriously, after doing so much littering, I don't see how you can <br/>
claim that not anchoring a box is more environmentally acceptable <br/>
than anchoring one.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Although this type of flooding<br/>
&gt; generally occurs in our area only about every six years, and this year<br/>
&gt; was more significant than we've seen in decades, I will certainly be<br/>
&gt; more careful when I select places to hide future<br/>
<br/>
Many of our nicest parks *are* parks because the land is too low to <br/>
safely build houses on.  Many of our prettiest places are along <br/>
rivers or waterfronts or on lakes, places inherently subject to <br/>
flooding.  Either you're going to have to hide your boxes in the tops <br/>
of trees, or you're going to eliminate *most* of the nice places out <br/>
there from consideration for hides.  I simply don't accept that, and <br/>
will continue to anchor my hides responsibly.<br/>

Friendly discussions are always welcome on the Texas list. It amazes me <br/>
that as large and diverse as this state is, how much we respect each <br/>
other's opinions. It's a very congenial group of boxers who try to <br/>

About a year ago, while I was out <br/>scouting a<br/>&gt; &gt; spot for a letterbox, I found a large geocache (not yours <br/>actually)<br/>&gt; &gt; chained to a tree.

All my hides are well-hidden, nothing <br/>&gt; unsightly about them.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I would suggest that chaining<br/>&gt; &gt; a box to a tree is
 not a good idea.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We can agree to disagree on that.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I don't think boxes washing into<br/>&gt; &gt; the creeks is much better though<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Oh, c'mon!

If <br/>I <br/>&gt; did, I probably wouldn't be letterboxing at ALL, since clearly just <br/>&gt; leaving something made of plastic in the woods is environmentally <br/>&gt; problematic.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; probably lost six boxes in the recent rains, so I'm certainly <br/>doing my<br/>&gt; &gt; part to contaminate the environment.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Ah ha! So YOU'RE the one! :-)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Seriously, after doing so much littering, I don't see how you can <br/>&gt; claim that not anchoring
 a box is more environmentally acceptable <br/>&gt; than anchoring one.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Although this type of flooding<br/>&gt; &gt; generally occurs in our area only about every six years, and this <br/>year<br/>&gt; &gt; was more significant than we've seen in decades, I will certainly <br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; more careful when I select places to hide future<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Many of our nicest parks *are* parks because the land is too low to <br/>&gt; safely build houses on. Many of our prettiest places are along <br/>&gt; rivers or waterfronts or on lakes, places inherently subject to <br/>&gt; flooding. Either you're going to have to hide your boxes in the <br/>tops <br/>&gt; of trees, or you're going to eliminate *most* of the nice places <br/>out <br/>&gt; there from consideration for hides. I simply don't accept that, and <br/>&gt; will continue to anchor my hides responsibly.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- Kirbert<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt;

<div></div>
<div>You know, the rains we had this year are 100-yr. flood events, certainly 
not typical.  In my town we had one storm event that dumped <u>7" in 
an hour and a half</u>, and that was after two solid weeks of heavy rains (and 
it kept up for another solid week after that), so the ground was so saturated 
all that water had to go somewhere.  Places that aren't even close to flood 
plains became small lakes, and everything sloping became a rushing creek and 
creeks became roaring rivers.  Letterboxes (and houses, trees, fences, 
yards, vehicles, roads, bridges, even animals and people) were swept away in 
some of these ferociously rushing waters, so chaining anything to a tree would 
only mean that it went -- along with the tree -- to become part of the flood 
debris somewhere else.  </div>
<div>       I think we all have to be careful 
of where we plant letterboxes, of course:  try for high and dry locations, 
tuck them well into an existing crevice and put rocks over them rather than 
just a few leaves or light bark scraps that will blow or wash away (NEVER 
dig holes to hide them, though - that's against LB etiquette, isn't it?), maybe 
use velcro straps camo-taped to the box to strap it to a branch 5' above the 
ground, wedge it tightly into the inner branches of trees, whatever.   
Lock&amp;lock boxes well-disguised with camotape and logbooks and stamps 
double-bagged for protection should be enough, if only every finder will 
remember to Recover Well.   </div>
<div> </div>
<div>But if I have to start using chains and ammo boxes to plant a logbook and 
stamp, then that's where I'll draw my own line in the sand (or mud).   
I can't imagine a conversation with a TPW official about how 
environmentally-friendly letterboxing is if they start finding chains around 
their trees with ammo boxes attached to them all over the parks, or 
casually-tossed and poorly-hidden big plastic boxes lying in the woods 
carelessly exposed.  That's just litter.</div>
<div>    </div>
<div>Well, that's my 4-cents worth (I think I went beyond the 2-cent 
mark).</div>

&gt; You know, the rains we had this year are 100-yr. flood events,<br/>
&gt; certainly  not typical.<br/>
<br/>
Perhaps.  But my brother lives on Lake Travis, it reached 702 feet a <br/>
few days ago, and it's been deeper than that at least twice in the <br/>
past couple of decades.  Of course, that lake is weird, it can get <br/>
full when other places aren't flooded.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I think we all have to be careful  of where we plant<br/>
&gt;        letterboxes, of <br/>
&gt; course:  try for high and dry locations,  tuck them well into an<br/>
&gt; existing crevice and put rocks over them rather than  just a few<br/>
&gt; leaves or light bark scraps that will blow or wash away<br/>
<br/>
Whether or not rocks are a good idea seems to depend on the box, but <br/>
in general I think not.  I have found many plastic containers that <br/>
have been cracked by having heavy rocks on top of them, and others <br/>
that weren't cracked but were distorted enough to make them leak.  If <br/>
you can put rocks OVER them without actually resting ON them, that's <br/>
just great -- I've managed to do that a few times myself.  The box <br/>
that is "trapped" by rocks is arguably the ideal hide in flood-prone <br/>
areas, provided the rocks are small enough to be moved by women and <br/>
children.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; (NEVER  dig<br/>
&gt; holes to hide them, though - that's against LB etiquette, isn't it?)<br/>
<br/>
I have never fully buried a letterbox, primarily because I haven't <br/>
needed to.  I have found existing holes to hide them in, and <br/>
sometimes I've even widened the hole a bit to make the box fit.  In <br/>
these cases I haven't put dirt back on top to complete a burial.<br/>
<br/>
I don't actually think doing so would violate LB etiquette, though.  <br/>
It's definitely a no-no in geocaching, because the GPS will only get <br/>
you to within 30 feet or so, you'd have to be digging the whole area <br/>
up to find a geocache.  But with a letterbox, you could tell someone <br/>
*exactly* where to dig.  It would still be a no-no if you had to dig <br/>
up plants or whatever to get to it, but if you can dig a hole and <br/>
bury the box without disturbing the area, I think that'd be OK.<br/>
<br/>
Fact is, I actually found such a box once.  It was on the beach, <br/>
buried in the sand.  Clues described exactly where to dig for it.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; maybe  use velcro straps camo-taped to the box to strap it to a branch<br/>
&gt; 5' above the  ground<br/>
<br/>
This is somehow better than using string or chain?<br/>
<br/>
&gt;, wedge it tightly into the inner branches of<br/>
&gt; trees, whatever. <br/>
<br/>
Alas, wedging is asking for trouble, too.  I've found several boxes <br/>
that leaked because wedging the box into place had distorted the <br/>
container and destroyed the seal.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; But if I have to start using chains and ammo boxes to plant a logbook<br/>
&gt; and  stamp, then that's where I'll draw my own line in the sand (or<br/>
&gt; mud).<br/>
<br/>
I don't use ammo boxes primarily because they're too big and cost too <br/>
much.  They do seal well, though.  Just what do you have against <br/>
them?<br/>
<br/>
And I really don't understand what people here have against chains.  <br/>
I originally used string but I found it wasn't durable enough.  I <br/>
would check on my boxes and find the string had rotted into pieces or <br/>
had been chewed by critters.  The chain has served much better.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe you guys don't understand what sort of chain I'm using.  It's <br/>
the really small stuff, 1/4" wide or so, like you'd use to hang a <br/>
plant.  It's not the big load-carrying heavy-duty stuff.  That'd be <br/>
too expensive for this job.<br/>
<br/>
&gt;    I can't imagine a conversation with a TPW official about how <br/>
&gt; environmentally-friendly letterboxing is if they start finding chains<br/>
&gt; around  their trees with ammo boxes attached to them all over the<br/>
&gt; parks, or  casually-tossed and poorly-hidden big plastic boxes lying<br/>
&gt; in the woods  carelessly exposed.  That's just litter.<br/>
<br/>
I can easily imagine a conversation with a ranger explaining that the <br/>
box is secured to keep it from floating away in a flood.  If he <br/>
understands letterboxing at all, he'll understand that.  Much better <br/>
than trying to explain why he found letterboxes two miles downstream <br/>
from where they were supposed to be.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, I don't expect a ranger to *ever* find one of my boxes.  <br/>
If he does, I didn't hide it well enough.<br/>

<div><span class="gmail_quote">In fact, I recently saw two new clues come across 
  for Texas boxes that call for digging.  One of them said the box is 
  completely buried, the other said "bring something to dig with" - YIKES!  
  It got me to thinking - what do you do when you run across clues that call for 
  something considered unacceptable?  I just wouldn't find 'em.  I'm 
  still debating whether I want to notify the placers that what they are doing 
  is not okay, but then, who am I to tell them that?  What do y'all think?

<div>I think you should, BL, because if not you, then who?  And you would 
certainly be nicer about it than others might be.  If I did a no-no without 
realizing it was a no-no, I'd want to be told (maybe gently), because I'd want 
to fix it if possible.  </div>
<div>--- and I agree with your concern about strapping a box with a velcro 
strap, too, especially if the strap is something constrictive.   I've 
found some really good boxes that were actually suspended in various ways and 
wish I'd thought of it myself (and intend sometime to try it), but the loops or 
hooks with which they were suspended were large, loose things or straps with 
hooks and they were looped over small limbs inside a bush or tree or fence, 
enough to keep them from falling.   They could be easily lifted from 
the branch or, if velcro, could be un-looped and returned in the same way.  
Of course, these were very responsible LBers who kept close tabs on their boxes, 
too, so they wouldn't be there long enough to damage a tree, or could easily be 
moved from branch to branch.  I think that's also key to good LB 
maintenance: Visit Often.  </div>

&gt; My concern about using chains is damaging the tree, especially if a<br/>
&gt; big screw is drilled into the tree or if the chain wrapped too tightly<br/>
&gt; inhibiting grown.  Both could potentially cause damage.<br/>
<br/>
I own 73 acres of woods with about a billion trees on it.  Let me put <br/>
your mind to rest:  Putting a screw into a tree doesn't hurt it at <br/>
all.  Over the past 100 years or so, the trees in my woods have had <br/>
big spikes, fencing nails, barbed wire, No Trespassing signs, you <br/>
name it attached to trees.  The trees happily grow around all of it.  <br/>
In one place on a neighbor's property a spike was put into a tree and <br/>
a wrapped-up garden hose hung from it, and the tree grew around it <br/>
all, so there was a garden hose sticking out of a tree.<br/>
<br/>
It'd do the same thing to a chain wrapped too tightly, I expect, but <br/>
there is some chance it might choke the tree.  That's why I never <br/>
wrap the chains tightly at all.  In fact, I generally avoid wrapping <br/>
them around a tree, although that's primarily because they're usually <br/>
plainly visible when you do.  I'm more likely to wrap the chain <br/>
around one root of the tree -- and I'll still do that loosely.<br/>

<div>By piercing the outer and inner bark, you are exposing the inner core of the tree to airborne and other bacteria that CAN (not saying it always does) harm the tree.  That's just common sense.</div>
