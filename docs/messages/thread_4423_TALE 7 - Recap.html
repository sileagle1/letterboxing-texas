                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a recap of this year's Texas Annual Letterboxing Event.  Festivities started Friday night at the "Come and Get It" meet and eat at the City Market in Gonzales.   I figured from the poster stamps that about 35 people showed up for this, and I believe we all had a good time (except the last minute lost arrival...).   Saturday's event started at 10am, but many were busy hiding boxes around the park and have breakfast with friends (I almost look forward to this more than anything else - Thanks LSQ and BT).   From the picture we took I'm estimating we had about 65 to 70 people at the event.   The food was great, and the facilities were excellent.  Many new boxers attended (I was shocked at how many new exchanges I got).   The park itself turned out to be almost perfect (would have been perfect without copperheads).  New trails that all connected made this a great place to hide boxes, and believe it or not the park will hold more!!  We wrapped up the event at 6pm, wich many people helping to clean up (and again a specail thanks to BT and LSQ for keeping an eye on the pavilion all day for everyone).  The campfire gathering started at 7pm, much to the displeasure of the campground host (wish he would have spent more time on the young campers that stayed up partying until 2am).   After the broken flashlight, camera, matches, etc (including one burnt IRA ghost), we settled in for stories and good natured ribbing.  I guess what I loved about this event was getting to spend more time actually with the other Letterboxes, versus being to busy to talk to anyone.   As we left on Sunday, we stopped at the Ranger station for our deposit.  While waiting for them to check the status of the facility, the ranger behind the desk asked us, "so what was your gathering about"?   We both looked at each other and paused (trying to thing of what to say.....Geocaching), but finally hosesty was the best policy and Silver Eagle said we all share a hobby called Letterboxing.   She said: "oh, one of our rangers found one of those the other day hanging from a tree, and it had all these letters in it". That was probably my box - Palmetto 2.   Anyway, she quickly said she thought there were 5 Geocaches in the park, and moved on to other work.  SO, looks like this park may be safe for LB's, as long as we do not push it to far.   Once again, thanks to everyone for attending and sharing your weekend with us.  I can't wait for next year, and already have some ideas for that event (I will be posting some time soon for information from each of you).   Take care, and safe letterboxing this year!!!<br>

<div></div>
<div>We interacted several times with the staff and the hosts and on each encounter, Fearless Fox and I commented on how they were so nice, courteous and professional. Funny that folks like them can make such a difference in a park stay, even when what you really want is to not have to deal with them. They somehow balanced being involved as needed and aware of what was going on with staying inconspicuous.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The facility itself was great and the park was beautiful. It's definitely made its way to my favorite TSP's, right alongside Mission Tejas.</div>

I figured from the poster stamps that about 35 people showed up for this, and I believe we all had a good time (except the last minute lost arrival...). Saturday's event started at 10am, but many were busy hiding boxes around the park and have breakfast with friends (I almost look forward to this more than anything else - Thanks LSQ and BT). From the picture we took I'm estimating we had about 65 to 70 people at the event. The food was great, and the facilities were excellent. Many new boxers attended (I was shocked at how many new exchanges I got). The park itself turned out to be almost perfect (would have been perfect without copperheads). New trails that all connected made this a great place to hide boxes, and believe it or not the park will hold more!! We wrapped up the ev ent at 6pm, wich many people helping to clean up (and again a specail thanks to BT and LSQ for keeping an eye on the pavilion all day for everyone). The campfire gathering started at 7pm, much to the displeasure of the campground host (wish he would have spent more time on the young campers that stayed up partying until 2am). After the broken flashlight, camera, matches, etc (including one burnt IRA ghost), we settled in for stories and good natured ribbing. I guess what I loved about this event was getting to spend more time actually with the other Letterboxes, versus being to busy to talk to anyone. As we left on Sunday, we stopped at the Ranger station for our deposit. While waiting for them to check the status of the facility, the ranger behind the desk asked us, "so what was your gathering about"? We both looked at each other and paused (trying to thing of what to say.....Geocaching), but finally hosesty was the best policy and Silver Eagle said we all share a hobby called Letterboxing. She said: "oh, one of our rangers found one of those the other day hanging from a tree, and it had all these letters in it". That was probably my box - Palmetto 2. Anyway, she quickly said she thought there were 5 Geocaches in the park, and moved on to other work. SO, looks like this park may be safe for LB's, as long as we do not push it to far. Once again, thanks to everyone for attending and sharing your weekend with us. I can't wait for next year, and already have some ideas for that event (I will be posting some time soon for information from each of you). Take care, and safe letterboxing this year!!!<br>
