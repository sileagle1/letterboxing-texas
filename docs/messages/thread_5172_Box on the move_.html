                    <div class="plaintext-content">That can be arranged!  Let's see, we need to book the show and put up posters around town, place an ad in the newspaper.  Wait, we don't have a newspaper, so  we'd have to post it here.  Dogwoods are in bloom, hummingbirds are swarming, it's a beautiful time of year in the forest.<br/>
