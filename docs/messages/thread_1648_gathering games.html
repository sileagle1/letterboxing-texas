                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, who's coming when to the gathering?  Any earlybirds?<br/>
<br/>
I have been soliciting boxes from boxers across the country to add a<br/>
bit of spice to the gathering.  Last year we had the fabulous clue<br/>
game organized by the Celtic Lions, and I think something similar<br/>
might be fun.<br/>
<br/>
Lucy has graciously agreed to be the maintenance woman on the boxes<br/>
that will be permanent for the out-of-staters.  To that end, I have<br/>
asked that boxes/stamps be sent to me no later than February 25th. <br/>
Lucy is also scouting hiding places both in Rusk State Park and other<br/>
areas around Rusk/Palestine that would be appropriate (yea lucy!)<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of organizing a boxcar bingo game for the day.  The way<br/>
I think it would work is that you would be given a card with the names<br/>
of boxes on it (maybe 5squares x5squares).  You'll need to go out into<br/>
the wild, find boxes, stamp them onto the card in addition to your<br/>
logbook and try to get boxcar "BINGO."<br/>
<br/>
To pull it off, I think help is required, to hide some of the<br/>
long-distance submissions on Friday or maybe earlier.  And if you're<br/>
carving a box that you're going to hide and would like it to be part<br/>
of the bingo, I'll just need to know the name of your box in advance.  <br/>
<br/>
BTW, so far I have boxes/commitments from SewSoBizzy, So Hill<br/>
Hendersons, Dixie Kin, Penguin Patrol, Speedsquare, Fungus Woman,<br/>
Happy Hyper Hikers, Mumma &amp; Bunny Boy &amp; a couple of others I can't<br/>
recall right now.  I think it should add to the fun for everyone.  <br/>

<div>Dewberry, In the spirit of our Texas LBing folklore (ie: BEA, LSS, etc), I will be carving a stamp for the Boxcar Bingo titled: "Letterboxing Canis Latrans" aka: Letterboxing Coyotes! Viewfinder and I have reservations for the Best Western in Jacksonville for Friday night (thinking we would do some boxing along the way from Dallas). We're open for anything.</div>

<div>I didn't know you wanted stamps for the gathering. I wrote to Silver Eagle and was told that rather than looking for boxes, it was more of a meet, greet, and exchange gathering.  Otherwise I would have asked you about doing one.</div>

games add another dimension to a gathering (as long as you don't<br/>
exclude poor Rudolf).  Of course, my personal gathering experience is<br/>
really limited to 2 hours at last year's TX event, but I read<br/>
enviously about the fun things others do, and think hey, we can do<br/>
that too!  I think since we're coming from such a wide area and never<br/>
see each other, we absolutely need time to meet, chat, exchange &amp;<br/>
greet.  You wouldn't want to overplan activities, but I thought that<br/>
one would be a welcome addition.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I could be totally wrong and off-base.  Since I'm not a host,<br/>
I'm certainly willing to can the whole idea of the bingo game if<br/>
that's not what people want as part of the Texas gathering.  I'll just<br/>
plant the boxes already sent, call off the others, and leave it at<br/>
that.  Makes it much easier for me, rather than making oodles of bingo<br/>
cards and strategizing that whole activity.  <br/>
<br/>
We're hoping to put on a greater Houston area event sometime and we<br/>
can leave the games for that one, if that's the general preference.  <br/>

I would definitely not want to step on our hosts' tootsies, or paws<br/>

&gt; that will be permanent for the out-of-staters.  To that end, I have<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; To pull it off, I think help is required, to hide some of the<br/>

<div>I love the idea of the bingo letterboxing game. Of course everyone will be checking into the host campsite, so if some don't want to participate, they can definitely hang around the campsite and meet and greet folks all day long as people come and go. Probably be a good idea for us to plan to all be there at the same time (for Silver Eagles chili!) at some point so we have the opportunity to exchange stamps and meet each other.

<div><br/></div><tt>Well, I like games and I like letterboxes and I feel like letterboxing<br/>games add another dimension to a gathering (as long as you don't<br/>exclude poor Rudolf).  Of course, my personal gathering experience is<br/>really limited to 2 hours at last year's TX event, but I read<br/>enviously about the fun things others do, and think hey, we can do<br/>that too!  I think since we're coming from such a wide area and never<br/>see each other, we absolutely need time to meet, chat, exchange &amp;<br/>greet.  You wouldn't want to overplan activities, but I thought that<br/>one would be a welcome addition.  <br/><br/>However, I could be totally wrong and off-base.  Since I'm not a host,<br/>I'm certainly willing to can the whole idea of the bingo game if<br/>that's not what people want as part of the Texas gathering.  I'll just<br/>plant the boxes already sent, call off the others, and leave it at<br/>that.  Makes it much easier for me, rather than making oodles of bingo<br/>cards and strategizing that whole activity.  <br/><br/>We're hoping to put on a greater Houston area event sometime and we<br/>can leave the games for that one, if that's the general preference.  <br/><br/>I would definitely not want to step on our hosts' tootsies, or paws<br/>and talons as the case may be.<br/><br/>Thoughts?<br/><br/><br/>--- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, "JuneMcAllister"<br/>&lt;nfmoon@m...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I didn't know you wanted stamps for the gathering. I wrote to Silver<br/>Eagle and was told that rather than looking for boxes, it was more of<br/>a meet, greet, and exchange gathering.  Otherwise I would have asked<br/>you about doing one.<br/>&gt; missmoon<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>&gt; From: dewberrylb <br/>&gt; To: letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/>&gt; Sent: 1/28/2006 1:29:04 PM <br/>&gt; Subject: [letterboxingtexas] gathering games<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Ok, who's coming when to the gathering?  Any earlybirds?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I have been soliciting boxes from boxers across the country to add a<br/>&gt; bit of spice to the gathering.  Last year we had the fabulous clue<br/>&gt; game organized by the Celtic Lions, and I think something similar<br/>&gt; might be fun.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy has graciously agreed to be the maintenance woman on the boxes<br/>&gt; that will be permanent for the out-of-staters.  To that end, I have<br/>&gt; asked that boxes/stamps be sent to me no later than February 25th. <br/>&gt; Lucy is also scouting hiding places both in Rusk State Park and other<br/>&gt; areas around Rusk/Palestine that would be appropriate (yea lucy!)<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I am thinking of organizing a boxcar bingo game for the day.  The way<br/>&gt; I think it would work is that you would be given a card with the names<br/>&gt; of boxes on it (maybe 5squares x5squares).  You'll need to go out into<br/>&gt; the wild, find boxes, stamp them onto the card in addition to your<br/>&gt; logbook and try to get boxcar "BINGO."<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; To pull it off, I think help is required, to hide some of the<br/>&gt; long-distance submissions on Friday or maybe earlier.  And if you're<br/>&gt; carving a box that you're going to hide and would like it to be part<br/>&gt; of the bingo, I'll just need to know the name of your box in advance.  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; BTW, so far I have boxes/commitments from SewSoBizzy, So Hill<br/>&gt; Hendersons, Dixie Kin, Penguin Patrol, Speedsquare, Fungus Woman,<br/>&gt; Happy Hyper Hikers, Mumma &amp; Bunny Boy &amp; a couple of others I can't<br/>&gt; recall right now.  I think it should add to the fun for everyone.  <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Dewberry<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; YAHOO!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Silver Eagle is off on a {everybody breathe a sigh of<br/>
envy here} kid-free vacation this week, so we won't be<br/>
hearing from him.  <br/>
<br/>
Here's what I would imagine he has in mind, and bear<br/>
in mind that I'm ONLY guessing, based on the last two<br/>
gatherings that he's planned and I've been to (and<br/>
maybe some of the previous participants can help in<br/>
guessing his thoughts - we can call this the<br/>
"Pre-Gathering Guess what Silver Eagle is Thinking<br/>
Game"):  Meet and do pot luck for lunch, do exchanges<br/>
and "meet and greet".  Meet and Greet went well into<br/>
the evening at both of the prior gatherings, and it<br/>
would be nice if it did again this year, but I think<br/>
that he doesn't want to put pressure on anyone to<br/>
think they HAVE to bring boxes or prepare in any way,<br/>
but to keep it informal.  Make it so everyone has<br/>
plenty of time to sit around and get to know each<br/>
other.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, I think he appreciates others<br/>
taking the initiative to add to the event in other<br/>
ways, just like that infamously epic Clue game was a<br/>
great addition last year, and that will mean that<br/>
those folks who don't sit still well will have<br/>
something to do to keep them busy, and they will still<br/>
have a place to come back and sit down for a bit and<br/>
visit before they are off again.  Those folks who<br/>
really JUST enjoy getting to know other boxers don't<br/>
have to feel pressured to play games JUST because they<br/>
are on the schedule.  So that way, there is something<br/>
for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
And as for another activity, I'm still pulling for a<br/>
Scarlet Pimpernel Clue Solving Session.  Please. <br/>
Pretty Please.  Pretty Please with Sugar on Top. <br/>
Either that, or someone just give me the stinking<br/>
answer!  (Okay, just kidding on that part!)<br/>

<div>Being one of those who finds it very hard to sit still even in wonderful 
circumstances for very long, I appreciate this!  I like having the best of 
both - opportunities to sit and visit and opportunities to jump up and go 
explore!  SOOO looking forward to this gathering! -
