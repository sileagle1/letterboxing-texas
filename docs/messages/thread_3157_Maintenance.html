stung, I drove over there today (70 miles) armed with my wasp spray and <br/>
wearing NO perfume! I thoroughly checked the bush the box is hidden in <br/>
didn't find any wasps or other stinging type creatures or a nest, but I <br/>

     I also got a report that the finders of my Delaney Vineyards box <br/>

<div>I LOVE for you to! Not to worry if you can't reach it, but if you can, that would be fabulous. I had to do this once before (a little over a year ago), so I know it can be done! If you can't get to it, that's fine too, but if you can, I'd really appreciate it! Thanks!</div>

<div>Thanks again. No harm (as far as the finder who accidentally dropped it into the tree). I thought she was great for letting me know. That's a risk I realized I would take with that box when I placed it in that tree. When it disappeared inside that tree before, no one told me, but it started getting reported as missing. When I checked, I found it was still there... just a few inches out of reach! That box is also in a place where there is a street very close by with traffic entering the Hobby Lobby parking lot, so when I went before to rescue the box, I went on a Sunday (Hobby Lobby's are closed on Sundays) evening when there was little traffic and no one at the winery to spot me fishing inside a hollow tree. Good luck with this mission, should you decide to accept it. And as always, this tape will self-destruct. Okay, maybe a bit too dramatic. P.S.</div>

<div>I think that is what happened to my Sleeping Panther box.  I don't think there are tongs long enough to retrieve it.   I guess it'll just rest down there until the tree rots away or gets chopped down.  </div>

<div>I'm glad you mentioned Delaney Vineyards.  I haven't gotten that one yet.  Once you get it back up and running, I'll hit it for sure!</div>

No harm (as far as the finder who accidentally dropped it into the tree). I thought she was great for letting me know. That's a risk I realized I would take with that box when I placed it in that tree. When it disappeared inside that tree before, no one told me, but it started getting reported as missing. When I checked, I found it was still there... just a few inches out of reach! That box is also in a place where there is a street very close by with traffic entering the Hobby Lobby parking lot, so when I went before to rescue the box, I went on a Sunday (Hobby Lobby's are closed on Sundays) evening when there was little traffic and no one at the winery to spot me fishing inside a hollow tree. Good luck with this mission, should you decide to accept it. And as always, this tape will self-destruct. Okay, maybe a
 bit too dramatic.
