This box was once named Box of the Week by AQ, so I thought it should be replaced.  I actually found the original box exactly where it was supposed to be but with the logbook missing.  The stamp was intact, which technically made it an active letterbox, right?  At any rate, I took the old box and left the new one with a new but similar stamp and a new logbook.  I don't think even geocachers would take the logbook and leave the stamp.<br>
