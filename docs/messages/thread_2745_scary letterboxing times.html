<div>When I first read these 
posts I thought..."geeze, nothing like that has ever happened to me while 
letterboxing"...then today I remembered the near heart attack I had last summer 
trying to complete the Houston Letterboxing Challenge.  One of the boxes 
was in a pretty manicured park along a walking trail around a mown field.  
I was with kids #1 and #5 (who had just become a competent walker at the 
time)  She wanted to get out and run, and so I got her out of the stroller 
and she was toddling along a little ahead of us, when my oldest son yelled 
"SNAKE!"  He wasn't kidding...it was a 4 foot long rat snake (I think, I 
can't be sure, because as I said I was nearly having a heart attack) right in 
the middle of the path.  I grabbed her up, put her back in the stroller, 
and turned around and walked the LONG way around back to the car (in Houston 
July heat...on blacktop, mind you.)  I am always on the lookout for snakes 
in the woods, and won't go near tall grass, especially if there is water around, 
but in a park with such short grass I guess I let my guard down.  I am not 
afraid of snakes (ok, maybe a little afraid of cottonmouths :) ) but I am 
cautious, and almost always see them because I am almost always on the 
lookout.  Almost, except for that one time I almost let my one year old 
step right on a big ol' snake.  It is getting hotter by the minute, and 
they are out.  Don't forget to be on the lookout, no matter where you 
are!  MO5</div></body></html>
