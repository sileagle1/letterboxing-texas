I was a little nervous about attending my first event, especially one that has been around awhile (and one where folks already seemed to know each other), but now with 20/20 hindsight, I know my doubts were totally unfounded. Everyone was so friendly and welcoming, the boxes were a blast, the potluck was delicious and bountiful, and to top it all off, the weather was gorgeous. It could not have been a better weekend.<br/><br/>Thank you, and hope to see you all again at future events or on the trails!<br/><br/>Origami Hen (along with Reflective Friend and Venomfire)</span></p></body></html>
