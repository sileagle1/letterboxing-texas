                    <div class="plaintext-content">Two months to go until our gathering at Fort Parker SP!!!   More detailed information will be posted later, but here is some of the planned events:<br/>
<br/>
Friday - March 4th <br/>
Many will arrive at park and set up camp.  That night we plan on getting together in Mexia at one of the local food establishments.  Will either be Pizza place or BBQ, but more on that later.  Plan on meeting there at 7pm for the Fort Parker Chow Down Gathering.<br/>
<br/>
Saturday - March 5th<br/>
Plan on bringing lunch items (listing on Atlas Quest) and starting event as Scheduled.   Be sure to stamp into event book, stamp the poster, and bring your clues.  We are only going to have 3 formal items on the agenda (below), and the rest of the time will be for just talking and boxing.   The formal items will be:<br/>
  1) EATING!!! - Self explanitory<br/>
  2) Group Picture <br/>
  3) Raffle -  New this year.  Tickets will be $1 each, and you can<br/>
         buy as many as you want.  "VALUABLE" prizes will be given<br/>
         out, which you can pick from when your number is called. <br/>
         The money collected will be used to pay for next year's <br/>
         TALE 9 event (location we picked will cost more),<br/>
         and to buy even "Better" prizes for the next raffle.  So<br/>
         save your dollars and hopefully we will have some fun with <br/>
         this!<br/>
Saturday night Silver Eagle and I again invite you all to come to our campsite for a campfire gathering.  Bring your favorite beverage, and some fun trail stories (write them down now)!  Bring your chairs also!<br/>
<br/>
Sunday - 6th<br/>
No formal event items, but I'm sure many will be on the trails finding boxes.  Which leads me to the last item of discussion.  Each person attending can decide on there own how they want to handle placing boxes in the park.  I personally will place a box on Friday, but will remove it Sunday before I leave and hide it down the road somewhere out of the park.  If you are going to leave it in the park and try to permit it, please do the permitting on Sunday, after the event.   <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure there is more to cover, and we will do so in the coming weeks as information becomes available.   Look forward to seeing you all at the event!!!<br/>
