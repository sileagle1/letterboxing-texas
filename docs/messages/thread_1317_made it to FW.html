                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey all, we are holed up on the west side of Fort Worth.  No offense<br>
to anyone, but this is not the most scenic side of town.  Also,<br>
fighter jets fly over head a lot.  However, we are more than delighted<br>
to be here.  If it wasn't 800 million degrees outside, we would have<br>
gone to the zoo or some other attraction today--there are lots of fun<br>
things for kids in the Ft. Worth area.  I stocked up on supplies this<br>
morning at a Target near here, which is funny, because I left a<br>
fully-stocked house behind.  Oh well.  It was throwing out all the<br>
stuff in my freezer that was the hardest.<br>
<br>
We left Houston at 7:30 last night and got here at 4:30 this morning.<br>
 This is better for me, because my littlest one has asthma and I don't<br>
want him in 90+ degree heat with no a/c.  So, from DFW I can make it<br>
to my mom's house in Missouri if need be.<br>
<br>
I keep telling my kids it's an adventure and it certainly is!<br>
<br>
Stay safe all.  check in when you can.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We love the Dallas Aquarium.  <br>
<br>
Also, we almost always go to the Science Place to see<br>
what's going on there.  If nothing is happening that<br>
we are interested in or haven't already seen, we spend<br>
an hour or two roaming the park behind the Science<br>
Place.  Love the little lake...<br>
<br>
The Science Place is above average as compared to<br>
other places like it - we hit 'em all wherever we go,<br>
but we make it a point to go back to the one in<br>
Dallas.  There is an IMAX theatre there to check out<br>
also.  <br>
<br>
The Dallas Art Museum is worth a short walk through,<br>
depending on the ages of your kids (it's worth a long<br>
walk-through if you are kid-free).  My 9 year old son<br>
tolerates it if there are some cool Indian artifacts<br>
or something on display that he can relate to.<br>
<br>
There's a cool little restaurant - Kathleen's Art Cafe<br>
- in the University Park area.  Quirky menu.  And a<br>
neat pizza place in the same general area called<br>
Slider and Blues - it's loud, but the pizza is good<br>
and they have a game room.  <br>
<br>
And take them to the restaurant in the ball - Reunion<br>
Tower.  Go during off-peak times (we usually go about<br>
3 p.m.), order an appetizer and drinks, and you can<br>
hang out there for quite awhile and watch the world go<br>
round - literally.  My kids LOVE this!  They have an<br>
observation deck also if you just don't want to order<br>
food or anything, but it isn't nearly as<br>
comfortable...<br>
<br>
My family is a little quirky, but we have this thing<br>
about riding public transportation in whatever city we<br>
are in - even when we lived in San Diego, we rode mass<br>
transit for entertainment.  Dallas has a great transit<br>
system and it gives you a nice birdseye view of the<br>
city.  There is a run that takes you through downtown<br>
and there are some pretty interesting looking places I<br>
still want to visit along that run.  The bonus is the<br>
interesting people we see along the way - I think it's<br>
a good place for kids to see another side of life<br>
sometimes.  We are big on people-watching and we have<br>
a good time figuring people out and (ahem)<br>
occasionally making a bit of fun of them between<br>
ourselves (I know y'all won't believe that, but it's<br>
true).  Of course, we make fun of ourselves too, so<br>
it's okay that we make fun of other people, as long as<br>
they don't know we do it.<br>
<br>
On the subject of public transit, we plan to have a<br>
race across Dallas on our next trip up there.  We're<br>
going to split into two pairs and see which pair can<br>
get from Point A to Point B 1) quickest, 2) using the<br>
most forms of public transportation, and 3) cheapest,<br>
and whichever wins two of the three categories wins.<br>
<br>
So that's what happens when the hillbillies hit Dallas<br>
- maybe the locals will have some new and different<br>
ideas.<br>

<p>Not sure the age of the your kids, but Rigmar Mall (I30 and Green Oaks) has a movie theater and an indoor play area.  It's also a large mall, so if you just need to get out and walk around it's a great place to go.</p>
