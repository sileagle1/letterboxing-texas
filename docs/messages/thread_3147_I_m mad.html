My daughter and I began this week tracking down letterboxes around <br/>
our area. The one's in the libraries were good!! We went to check on <br/>
the one out by the soccer fields and still can't find it. Do we walk <br/>
to the BIG concrete bride that now has white guard rails or head back <br/>
down into the wooded area along the walking path? Both sidewalks run <br/>
beside pastures. Can you tell us if we should be on the north <br/>
sidewalk or south sidewalk?<br/>
Thanks so much for going to all of the trouble. The people at the Tri <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand why you're upset.  I think you have a right to be.  But,<br/>
there are lots of facets here.<br/>
<br/>
If you pull your clues (which is certainly your right), then you<br/>
definitely drastically reduce the number of people who are going to<br/>
find your boxes and hopefully you protect them a little bit from the<br/>
casual, careless letterboxer.   <br/>
<br/>
If you leave your clues open &amp; accessible, they are more likely to be<br/>
found by people who are new to the game and haven't done their<br/>
homework.  This may put them in greater jeopardy.  But, it also could<br/>
be your box that inspires someone enough to really get into the game,<br/>
and then they could turn into THE planter in your area who plants cool<br/>
boxes for you to find.  <br/>
<br/>
And of course, even by asking people to write you there are no<br/>
guarantees.  Some finders have found a lot of boxes, but have never<br/>
absorbed the conventions.  They leave boxes out in the open, hurriedly<br/>
dashing to the next one, never making sure that the last one is hidden<br/>
or sealed correctly.  That I've seen repeatedly.  (And that's almost<br/>
more frustrating than a newbie who hasn't yet learned).<br/>
<br/>
It's the ongoing struggle...and people take different approaches based<br/>
on the level of accessibility/risk factors.   You are the only one who<br/>
can weigh the trade-offs and come up with an arrangement that you're<br/>
comfortable with.<br/>
<br/>
Personally, I publish almost all my clues (although there are a few in<br/>
unconventional spots).  I do make some of them harder than others. <br/>
And if boxes go missing, I retire them and usually plant something<br/>
new.  I don't expect my boxes to last forever.  And although I have a<br/>
moment of mourning when one goes missing, it doesn't usually last too<br/>
long before I've thought of something else I'd like to plant.<br/>

<div>You can always just list your boxes on AQ and place a F requirement on them, requiring people to have found an "x" number of boxes before they can have access to your clues. That doesn't insure that they can't get the clues from other boxers, but it might deter a "casual" boxer. I do have to say this, however; when I started letterboxing in Connecticut, I'm glad that there were lots of boxes available for me to find in my local area. I'm sure I must have made a few mistakes before I learned the subtle nuances of finding and rehiding, but I always seemed to get positive feedback from the planters when I would email them. Each of us was once a newbie, and it's helpful when we take a positive approach to educating those who are just joining the fun. Hopefully, by spilling the beans about your library box, it didn't put it into jeopardy, but it sounds like the newbie who made that mistake was just purely excited about it. I agree with you that I wish new boxers would take the time to learn about the "rules", but if that doesn't happen, it's probably a good idea if we each take the time to encourage and educate them in a positive manner. I've been around long enough to remember when there were so few boxes in the DFW metroplex, I had found them all and we were all waiting for a new box to be planted. I think I prefer it the way it is today with lots of new boxers participating and adding to the excitement.</div>

<div>Stargazer, do you feel comfortable emailing the group that is planning to letterbox at the gardens this weekend? My request would be that they make a group stamp, or at least one for each family involved and not have 20 different stamps. I've already added two more logbooks to the original ones in my boxes there. I like to leave the original ones in those boxes because they are visited by so many people from all over the country (world), and I like for folks to be able to look back through the logbooks if they want to. However, the boxes are getting a bit crowded with three logbooks inside each one. Feel free to forward my message to them if you'd like. (Those are my favorite boxes and have been out there for quite a while. They are also blue star boxes so I'd hate for them to be discovered by non-boxers. Thanks, Puddle Splasher</div>

<p><span>We did that with our 4-H group. We met with our kids and talked
about it. Next meeting, each family carved a box stamp AND each member made a
sig. stamp. Over a two week period, we all went out and hid our family stamp at
the botanical gardens and wrote up our clues. Next meeting, each family hunted
for each other’s family boxes and stamped in. Then we gathered up our
hidden boxes to plant wherever we wanted. Because the kids saw the amount of
work that went into a planted box…and heard from the veteran letterboxers
in the group how difficult it is to maintain a box in the Gardens, they all
chose to hide their boxes in other locations for the public. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I love it when little kids get involved. My youngest (6) adores stamping
in. My oldest (8) enjoys the hunt itself – as well as exploring the area
we are in. I love just being out and about with them. I let mine find it as
well as re-hide it. I still pause while they walk off and double check their
hiding skills. I’ve had boxes go missing and was really upset at first
only because carving one to me is difficult. I expect too much from myself and
get frustrated when the carving takes a bad turn. (I am getting better at not
being so frustrated though! LOL!)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I think people need to be more responsible and treat each box
like it is the crystal punch bowl you borrowed from your neighbor….treat
it better than your own stuff and always return it in better shape than you
found it. Newbies may sometimes not take the sort of care veterans do only
because they don’t grasp the extent of the time it takes to plant one.
That comes with their first plant and experience with having it tampered with. <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>

<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I know that's what several group leaders do, before they take their kids out to find actual boxes that others have planted.  I'm thinking of all of Barefoot Lucy's letterboxing lesson sessions she's done with her boy scouts, where they really learn all about the game, plus the related skills of carving stamps, creating logs, following clues, using a compass, and the necessary subtlety and stealth and care and responsibility involved in finding something and logging their find in a box that someone else has created.  I admire that and applaud that kind of activity (and I know of at least one girl scout troop leader in our area who has done a similar thing).   I just don't think some folks consider that each letterbox out there has an actual creator behind it, someone who came up with an idea for a box or was inspired by a particular location, carved a stamp, made a logbook (sometimes those are actually better than the stamps), fixed up the container by covering it with camo-tape or something else to make it less obvious in its setting, carefully planted the box, composed the clues and posted them, and then enjoys hearing from every finder about their experiences, too.   So there is a responsibility that goes with being a finder as well as a planter, to ensure future finders get to enjoy the box too.  OK, that's my 45 cents worth (can't stop at just 2 cents). </div>

<p>I really understand your frustration.  I have to say that we are homeschoolers, so I hope you don't think all homeschoolers are cruddy letterboxers.  But I also have to say that several of my worst letterboxing disasters were caused by other homeschoolers.   
</p></span></div>
<div><span class="gmail_quote"></span> </div>
<div>***************************************</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, I know what you mean!  I learned about letterboxing through a homeschooling group and I actively engage my cub scouts in letterboxing. I've done a carving class with our local girl scouts and I'm booked to speak about letterboxing to some other cub scout groups in the next couple of months.  I firmly believe there is a place for kids in letterboxing (although I do not believe letterboxing is a kids' activity).  Every time I read about someone having an experience with a kid group, I hold my breath until I get to the end to find out whether it was a good experience or not.  It really hurts my feelings when I hear a bad story because I can't help feeling it reflects indirectly on what I've promoted.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Needless to say, the problem (when there is one) isn't the kids - it's the adults with them.  It irks me no end when these grown-ups - presumably responsible and mature adults - let kids get away with the sorriest kind of letterboxing, almost as if letterboxes are disposable playtoys.  They are perpetuating an injustice on the letterboxing community, but even worse, they are exacting an injustice on the kids.  Most kids want to do their best at something fun like letterboxing, and when they aren't given a high standard to meet, it says to them that their leader thinks they aren't capable of stepping up.  Let me just say I don't think the problem is the adult leaders that wind up here on this and other lists - the ones who set out to learn and understand the game, but the ones that read a blurb in a magazine and head out on a lark, sort of like the homeschool mom Lois is mad at.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Perhaps what irks me worst is that these leaders are all involved in programs that are intended to raise kids awareness, enhance their educations, widen their horizons, and generally better them.  If they cheat kiddos in an activity like letterboxing, where else are they cheating them?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well well well.  Tonight is Roundtable for me - the monthly meeting I lead for cub scout leaders throughout our district.  I think my topic of the evening will be Doing Right by the Kids You Lead.</div>

It's really hard for any large group to be inconspicuous and that's<br/>
just the way it is.  I think they'd be much better off planting boxes<br/>
of their own for their group to find, and then, if one family liked it<br/>
and wanted to learn more, they could pursue it on an individual basis<br/>
or in a smaller group.  <br/>
<br/>
You really could do some fun homeschooling projects on history or<br/>
science, with the reward being both the knowledge you gained and the<br/>
box at the end (something's always a bit sweeter when you work for it).<br/>
<br/>
I have a couple of letterboxes that get found by scout groups.  I am<br/>
happy to see their stamps in my book.  And I'm even happier when<br/>
they've used one group stamp and rehidden the box correctly.  There<br/>
really are conscientious group leaders out there.  And then, there are<br/>
those who aren't.<br/>

<div><span class="Apple-style-span">Stargazer, do you feel comfortable emailing the group that is planning to letterbox at the gardens this weekend? My request would be that they make a group stamp, or at least one for each family involved and not have 20 different stamps. I've already added two more logbooks to the original ones in my boxes there. I like to leave the original ones in those boxes because they are visited by so many people from all over the country (world), and I like for folks to be able to look back through the logbooks if they want to. However, the boxes are getting a bit crowded with three logbooks inside each one. Feel free to forward my message to them if you'd like. (Those are my favorite boxes and have been out there for quite a while. They are also blue star boxes so I'd hate for them to be discovered by non-boxers. Thanks, Puddle Splasher</span></div>

I have an even better idea.  Why don't you meet with<br/>
the group and maybe "show them how it's done" so that<br/>
way everyone will be on the same page as you.  No, I<br/>
have not planted a letterbox yet, or even searched for<br/>
one.  But I can tell you I have read everything that<br/>
I've been able to get my hands on about the subject so<br/>
I won't mess things up, as you say. I also have<br/>
figured out that not everyone has a stamp to stamp the<br/>
log.  So I can only assume that there are times that<br/>
there is no record of who looked at it last.<br/>
<br/>
I feel that if you only want certain ones to view your<br/>
box you should not post clues.  You should have them<br/>
send you a resume so that you can check them out and<br/>
see if they are worthy of looking for your box. <br/>
<br/>
I know that I'll be very aware of who the planter is<br/>
before I waste my time on one of your boxes and pass<br/>
it on to others not to waste theirs either.<br/>

&gt; all of the advice I could get.   And the two times<br/>
&gt; I've contacted new  <br/>

&gt; less than sweet.<br/>

Over a two week period, we all went out and hid our family stamp at the botanical gardens and wrote up our clues. Next meeting, each family hunted for each other's family boxes and stamped in. Then we gathered up our hidden boxes to plant wherever we wanted. Because the kids saw the amount of work that went into a planted boxand heard from the veteran letterboxers in the group how difficult it is to maintain a box in the Gardens, they all chose to hide their boxes in other locations for the public.

<div>I think, HP, if you knew some of the things our boxes have suffered at the hands of large groups, you would be more understanding of Sandy's and other's concerns.  Most of us love to have our boxes found by any and everybody, we just don't love having them mishandled by folks who don't take the time to learn the game, including the nuances and the community behind the boxes.

<div>You say you've put a lot of time and effort into learning - well GOOD!  YOU are the sort of new boxer we like to see come along, but for everyone like you, there is another one that hasn't gone to that same effort.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>May I suggest that instead of turning on Star Gazer for her desire to protect her own and other's boxes, you take the knowledge you have gained by doing your research and teaching it to other homeschoolers, the ones who haven't done their homework about letterboxing?  If you were to do that, it would help them AND help us and we can all enjoy this wonderful hobby together.

of Stargazer, not that she's asked me to.<br/>
<br/>
We were discussing (in a pretty congenial manner) something that has<br/>
been an issue in the past.  Sandy approached the homeschooling group<br/>
on behalf of a number of concerned planters.  This is because of past<br/>
negative experiences when there is an influx of people.  <br/>
<br/>
However, in spite of that, I want to make it clear that this is not a<br/>
newbie vs. oldbie debate.  <br/>
<br/>
It's a question of how to handle a large group of people descending on<br/>
your boxes at one time.  Certain venues lend themselves to this better<br/>
than others.  The Botanical Gardens is probably not one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Homeschooling is immaterial to the heart of this issue (and no one was<br/>
attacking homeschooling (or scouts), itself, just the negative<br/>
experiences we've had with some of them.  By being a responsible<br/>
letterboxer and teaching others how to be one too, you can help erase<br/>
some of those negative residual feelings.<br/>
<br/>
The bottom line is if you treat others on this list (and their boxes)<br/>
with respect, you're always welcome here in my book.<br/>

<div>You know HP, people 
come to find out about letterboxing many different ways, from friends, through 
scouts, homeschool groups, magazine articles.  This is great for us, 
because it means there will always be new people entering the game.  But it 
can also be potentially dangerous if people begin without learning a little 
about letterboxing first.  It seems like you have done some investigating, 
and that will make for a better experience for you and your group.  I 
don't think Star Gazer (or anyone else on this list) is against new boxers 
joining the game.  She was merely giving a "heads up" to fellow 
letterboxers about a situation which, in the past, has been dangerous for 
existing boxes.  Letting them know they might want to go check on 
their boxes in a couple of days.  When we all work together and take care 
of each other's boxes they will be around for a long time, and there for many 
new boxers, like yourself, to enjoy.  -Mother of

&gt; I really understand your frustration.  I have to say that we are  <br/>
&gt; homeschoolers, so I hope you don't think all homeschoolers are <br/>
cruddy  <br/>
&gt; letterboxers.  But I also have to say that several of my worst  <br/>
&gt; letterboxing disasters were caused by other homeschoolers.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
I am not mad or think all homeschoolers' moms are cruddy but I do <br/>
know some who are. Both my daughters homeschooled their children for <br/>
a period of time. One daughter has a colledge degree and was very <br/>
good with her children. One of her children had a special needs that <br/>
the school could not provide at that time is why she started. The <br/>
other daughter took her children out of school to home school because <br/>
she had a run in with a teacher who wanted to correct one of her <br/>
children (who needed it by the way). This daughter has been tested <br/>
several times and has a mind of a 10 year old child and is currently <br/>
on SSI because she can not support herself. I have seen both sides of <br/>
the homeschool coin. Also some of my friends homeschooled their <br/>
children and all of them did really well in life. I am not against <br/>
homeschoolers or their moms. And the child of this mom did not go <br/>
hollering in the libriary about the letterboxing. It was the mom. I <br/>
don't blame children at all but the suppervising. And yes I have made <br/>
mistakes in letterboxing too. Hopefully I did not put anyones boxes <br/>
in jepporty. I did write this mom again and told her about joining <br/>
letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com. Told her she might just get more <br/>
interested in letterboxing and that it could be a good hobby for her <br/>
and her family. I hope I did right. Lois<br/>

Knowing Stargazer personally, there is (in my opinion), no way that she was being a snob or stepping over the line here. As the majority of us know, when you put alot of time and effort into a box and have it disappear, it is hard. So I feel that she was just advising on what might be a problem if the issue wasn't addressed up front. I agree with dewberry that its not about homeschoolers or any other group, rather, just doing what responsible letterboxers do.  We take care of each other's boxes so that they will be there for others to enjoy. I feel this is what she was doing and that if people are offending by her comments they shouldn't be.  Sandy we are behind you and I for one, don't think you did anything wrong here.</div> <div>Monarch B<br/><br/><b><i>dewberrylb
