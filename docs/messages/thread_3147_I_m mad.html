Another Homeschooler Mom wrote me and told me that her and her kid <br>
was going to letterbox THIS WEEK and they had decided to pick mine as <br>
they were in their area. yuck! She said that they had found already <br>
my letterboxes in the libraries and guess what? she said. None of the <br>
ladies that worked at the library knew that it was there. I was <br>
livid. I wrote her back that descretion was the way this game was to <br>
be played. No one was to be told about the letterbox. I know it was <br>
too late. This shows that people out there do not investigate the <br>
rules and suggestions of the game before they set out to play. They <br>
just make up their own rules and tough on anyone else. She had gotten <br>
on lb.org and did not even sigh up so she is not serious. Just going <br>
to do it for a week. I am going to pull my clues off of both sites <br>

'Message: <br>
Adams Trails,<br>
My daughter and I began this week tracking down letterboxes around <br>
our area. The one's in the libraries were good!! We went to check on <br>
the one out by the soccer fields and still can't find it. Do we walk <br>
to the BIG concrete bride that now has white guard rails or head back <br>
down into the wooded area along the walking path? Both sidewalks run <br>
beside pastures. Can you tell us if we should be on the north <br>
sidewalk or south sidewalk?<br>
Thanks so much for going to all of the trouble. The people at the Tri <br>
County library didn't have any idea that the Butterfly was there. It <br>
was rather funny! We homeschool and decided to take this week to <br>
check out the letterboxes. We have had a good time!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I understand why you're upset.  I think you have a right to be.  But,<br>
there are lots of facets here.<br>
<br>
If you pull your clues (which is certainly your right), then you<br>
definitely drastically reduce the number of people who are going to<br>
find your boxes and hopefully you protect them a little bit from the<br>
casual, careless letterboxer.   <br>
<br>
If you leave your clues open & accessible, they are more likely to be<br>
found by people who are new to the game and haven't done their<br>
homework.  This may put them in greater jeopardy.  But, it also could<br>
be your box that inspires someone enough to really get into the game,<br>
and then they could turn into THE planter in your area who plants cool<br>
boxes for you to find.  <br>
<br>
And of course, even by asking people to write you there are no<br>
guarantees.  Some finders have found a lot of boxes, but have never<br>
absorbed the conventions.  They leave boxes out in the open, hurriedly<br>
dashing to the next one, never making sure that the last one is hidden<br>
or sealed correctly.  That I've seen repeatedly.  (And that's almost<br>
more frustrating than a newbie who hasn't yet learned).<br>
<br>
It's the ongoing struggle...and people take different approaches based<br>
on the level of accessibility/risk factors.   You are the only one who<br>
can weigh the trade-offs and come up with an arrangement that you're<br>
comfortable with.<br>
<br>
Personally, I publish almost all my clues (although there are a few in<br>
unconventional spots).  I do make some of them harder than others. <br>
And if boxes go missing, I retire them and usually plant something<br>
new.  I don't expect my boxes to last forever.  And although I have a<br>
moment of mourning when one goes missing, it doesn't usually last too<br>
long before I've thought of something else I'd like to plant.<br>

<div><font size="2">You can always just list your boxes on AQ and place a F requirement on them, requiring people to have found an "x" number of boxes before they can have access to your clues. That doesn't insure that they can't get the clues from other boxers, but it might deter a "casual" boxer. I do have to say this, however; when I started letterboxing in Connecticut, I'm glad that there were lots of boxes available for me to find in my local area. I'm sure I must have made a few mistakes before I learned the subtle nuances of finding and rehiding, but I always seemed to get positive feedback from the planters when I would email them. Each of us was once a newbie, and it's helpful when we take a positive approach to educating those who are just joining the fun. Hopefully, by spilling the beans about your library box, it didn't put it into jeopardy, but it sounds like the newbie who made that mistake was just purely excited about it. I agree with you that I wish new boxers would take the time to learn about the "rules", but if that doesn't happen, it's probably a good idea if we each take the time to encourage and educate them in a positive manner. I've been around long enough to remember when there were so few boxes in the DFW metroplex, I had found them all and we were all waiting for a new box to be planted. I think I prefer it the way it is today with lots of new boxers participating and adding to the excitement.</font></div>

<div>Oh dear, that really makes me nervous!  I have a couple of my 
favorites there, as I know you and others do, too, and they get lots of 
out-of-the-area visitors so the logs are really full of stamps I don't want to 
lose!  Large groups of letterboxers, especially involving lots of children 
and people not really used to the etiquette of the game, are a potential 
disaster in such a public place with really careful maintenance crews always at 
work, too!  All those boxes in the Botanic Gardens are always potentially 
at risk of loss anyway, aren't they?  I just hope they'll be subtle, 
stealthy, and extra-careful in resealing, rehiding, and recovering everything 
very well, and not create a problem with letterboxing in those gardens for the 
future!  Maybe you could post a very polite reminder of the need to be 
subtle in finding and careful in replacing?</div>

<div><font size="2">Stargazer, do you feel comfortable emailing the group that is planning to letterbox at the gardens this weekend? My request would be that they make a group stamp, or at least one for each family involved and not have 20 different stamps. I've already added two more logbooks to the original ones in my boxes there. I like to leave the original ones in those boxes because they are visited by so many people from all over the country (world), and I like for folks to be able to look back through the logbooks if they want to. However, the boxes are getting a bit crowded with three logbooks inside each one. Feel free to forward my message to them if you'd like. (Those are my favorite boxes and have been out there for quite a while. They are also blue star boxes so I'd hate for them to be discovered by non-boxers. Thanks, Puddle Splasher</font></div>

<blockquote><font color="#000000" face="Georgia" size="2" style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent">There is a <font color="#ff0000">large group of homeschoolers</font> going to find the boxes in our local Botanical Gardens this week.  I found out because they were discussing their "field trip" on a board I'm on.  I wrote to them asking that they please read the AQ Code of Conduct first.  I failed to mention to them that<font color="#ff0000"> letterboxing en masse probably isn't a good idea</font>.  I can't imagine a better way to draw attention to the boxes! </font></blockquote></div>
<div></div>
<div>Oh dear, that really makes me nervous!  I have a couple of my favorites there, as I know you and others do, too, and they get lots of out-of-the-area visitors so the logs are really full of stamps I don't want to lose!  Large groups of letterboxers, especially involving lots of children and people not really used to the etiquette of the game, are a potential disaster in such a public place with really careful maintenance crews always at work, too!  All those boxes in the Botanic Gardens are always potentially at risk of loss anyway, aren't they?  I just hope they'll be subtle, stealthy, and extra-careful in resealing, rehiding, and recovering everything very well, and not create a problem with letterboxing in those gardens for the future!  Maybe you could post a very polite reminder of the need to be subtle in finding and careful in replacing?</div>

<div>
<div>I know that's what several group leaders do, before they take their kids 
  out to find actual boxes that others have planted.  I'm thinking of all 
  of Barefoot Lucy's letterboxing lesson sessions she's done with her boy 
  scouts, where they really learn all about the game, plus the related skills of 
  carving stamps, creating logs, following clues, using a compass, and the 
  necessary subtlety and stealth and care and responsibility involved in finding 
  something and logging their find in a box that someone else has created.  
  I admire that and applaud that kind of activity (and I know of at least one 
  girl scout troop leader in our area who has done a similar thing).   
  I just don't think some folks consider that each letterbox out there has an 
  actual creator behind it, someone who came up with an idea for a box or was 
  inspired by a particular location, carved a stamp, made a logbook (sometimes 
  those are actually better than the stamps), fixed up the container by covering 
  it with camo-tape or something else to make it less obvious in its setting, 
  carefully planted the box, composed the clues and posted them, and then enjoys 
  hearing from every finder about their experiences, too.   So there 
  is a responsibility that goes with being a finder as well as a planter, to 
  ensure future finders get to enjoy the box too.  OK, that's my 45 cents 
  worth (can't stop at just 2 cents). </div>

about it. Next meeting, each family carved a box stamp AND each member made a
sig. stamp. Over a two week period, we all went out and hid our family stamp at
the botanical gardens and wrote up our clues. Next meeting, each family hunted
for each other’s family boxes and stamped in. Then we gathered up our
hidden boxes to plant wherever we wanted. Because the kids saw the amount of
work that went into a planted box…and heard from the veteran letterboxers
in the group how difficult it is to maintain a box in the Gardens, they all
chose to hide their boxes in other locations for the public. <o:p></o:p></span></p>

hiding skills. I’ve had boxes go missing and was really upset at first

get frustrated when the carving takes a bad turn. (I am getting better at not

what several group leaders do, before they take their kids out to find actual
boxes that others have planted.  I'm thinking of all of Barefoot Lucy's
letterboxing lesson sessions she's done with her boy scouts, where they really
learn all about the game, plus the related skills of carving stamps, creating
logs, following clues, using a compass, and the necessary subtlety and stealth
and care and responsibility involved in finding something and logging their
find in a box that someone else has created.  I admire that and applaud
that kind of activity (and I know of at least one girl scout troop leader in
our area who has done a similar thing).   I just don't think some
folks consider that each letterbox out there has an actual creator behind it,
someone who came up with an idea for a box or was inspired by a particular
location, carved a stamp, made a logbook (sometimes those are actually better
than the stamps), fixed up the container by covering it with camo-tape or
something else to make it less obvious in its setting, carefully planted the
box, composed the clues and posted them, and then enjoys hearing from every
finder about their experiences, too.   So there is a responsibility
that goes with being a finder as well as a planter, to ensure future finders
get to enjoy the box too.  OK, that's my 45 cents worth (can't stop at
just 2 cents). <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p>I really understand your frustration.  I have to say that we are homeschoolers, so I hope you don't think all homeschoolers are cruddy letterboxers.  But I also have to say that several of my worst letterboxing disasters were caused by other homeschoolers.   
</p></span></div>
<div><span class="gmail_quote"></span> </div>
<div>***************************************</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, I know what you mean!  I learned about letterboxing through a homeschooling group and I actively engage my cub scouts in letterboxing. I've done a carving class with our local girl scouts and I'm booked to speak about letterboxing to some other cub scout groups in the next couple of months.  I firmly believe there is a place for kids in letterboxing (although I do not believe letterboxing is a kids' activity).  Every time I read about someone having an experience with a kid group, I hold my breath until I get to the end to find out whether it was a good experience or not.  It really hurts my feelings when I hear a bad story because I can't help feeling it reflects indirectly on what I've promoted.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Needless to say, the problem (when there is one) isn't the kids - it's the adults with them.  It irks me no end when these grown-ups - presumably responsible and mature adults - let kids get away with the sorriest kind of letterboxing, almost as if letterboxes are disposable playtoys.  They are perpetuating an injustice on the letterboxing community, but even worse, they are exacting an injustice on the kids.  Most kids want to do their best at something fun like letterboxing, and when they aren't given a high standard to meet, it says to them that their leader thinks they aren't capable of stepping up.  Let me just say I don't think the problem is the adult leaders that wind up here on this and other lists - the ones who set out to learn and understand the game, but the ones that read a blurb in a magazine and head out on a lark, sort of like the homeschool mom Lois is mad at.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Perhaps what irks me worst is that these leaders are all involved in programs that are intended to raise kids awareness, enhance their educations, widen their horizons, and generally better them.  If they cheat kiddos in an activity like letterboxing, where else are they cheating them?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well well well.  Tonight is Roundtable for me - the monthly meeting I lead for cub scout leaders throughout our district.  I think my topic of the evening will be Doing Right by the Kids You Lead.</div>

I like to leave the original ones in those boxesbecause they are visited by so many people from all over the country (world), and I like for folks to be able to look back through the logbooks if they want to. However, the boxes are getting a bit crowded with three logbooks inside each one. Feel free to forward my message to them if you'd like.

<br>
It's really hard for any large group to be inconspicuous and that's<br>
just the way it is.  I think they'd be much better off planting boxes<br>
of their own for their group to find, and then, if one family liked it<br>
and wanted to learn more, they could pursue it on an individual basis<br>
or in a smaller group.  <br>
<br>
You really could do some fun homeschooling projects on history or<br>
science, with the reward being both the knowledge you gained and the<br>
box at the end (something's always a bit sweeter when you work for it).<br>
<br>
I have a couple of letterboxes that get found by scout groups.  I am<br>
happy to see their stamps in my book.  And I'm even happier when<br>
they've used one group stamp and rehidden the box correctly.  There<br>
really are conscientious group leaders out there.  And then, there are<br>
those who aren't.<br>

My request would be that they make a group stamp, or at least one for each family involved and not have 20 different stamps. I've already added two more logbooks to the original ones in my boxes there. I like to leave the original ones in those boxes because they are visited by so many people from all over the country (world), and I like for folks to be able to look back through the logbooks if they want to.

I have an even better idea.  Why don't you meet with<br>
the group and maybe "show them how it's done" so that<br>
way everyone will be on the same page as you.  No, I<br>
have not planted a letterbox yet, or even searched for<br>
one.  But I can tell you I have read everything that<br>
I've been able to get my hands on about the subject so<br>
I won't mess things up, as you say. I also have<br>
figured out that not everyone has a stamp to stamp the<br>
log.  So I can only assume that there are times that<br>
there is no record of who looked at it last.<br>
<br>
I feel that if you only want certain ones to view your<br>
box you should not post clues.  You should have them<br>
send you a resume so that you can check them out and<br>
see if they are worthy of looking for your box. <br>
<br>
I know that I'll be very aware of who the planter is<br>
before I waste my time on one of your boxes and pass<br>
it on to others not to waste theirs either.<br>

Over a two week period, we all went out and hid our family stamp at the botanical gardens and wrote up our clues. Next meeting, each family hunted for each other's family boxes and stamped in. Then we gathered up our hidden boxes to plant wherever we wanted. Because the kids saw the amount of work that went into a planted boxand heard from the veteran letterboxers in the group how difficult it is to maintain a box in the Gardens, they all chose to hide their boxes in other locations for the public.

<div>I think, HP, if you knew some of the things our boxes have suffered at the hands of large groups, you would be more understanding of Sandy's and other's concerns.  Most of us love to have our boxes found by any and everybody, we just don't love having them mishandled by folks who don't take the time to learn the game, including the nuances and the community behind the boxes.

<div>You say you've put a lot of time and effort into learning - well GOOD!  YOU are the sort of new boxer we like to see come along, but for everyone like you, there is another one that hasn't gone to that same effort.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>May I suggest that instead of turning on Star Gazer for her desire to protect her own and other's boxes, you take the knowledge you have gained by doing your research and teaching it to other homeschoolers, the ones who haven't done their homework about letterboxing?  If you were to do that, it would help them AND help us and we can all enjoy this wonderful hobby together.

of Stargazer, not that she's asked me to.<br>
<br>
We were discussing (in a pretty congenial manner) something that has<br>
been an issue in the past.  Sandy approached the homeschooling group<br>
on behalf of a number of concerned planters.  This is because of past<br>
negative experiences when there is an influx of people.  <br>
<br>
However, in spite of that, I want to make it clear that this is not a<br>
newbie vs. oldbie debate.  <br>
<br>
It's a question of how to handle a large group of people descending on<br>
your boxes at one time.  Certain venues lend themselves to this better<br>
than others.  The Botanical Gardens is probably not one of them.<br>
<br>
Homeschooling is immaterial to the heart of this issue (and no one was<br>
attacking homeschooling (or scouts), itself, just the negative<br>
experiences we've had with some of them.  By being a responsible<br>
letterboxer and teaching others how to be one too, you can help erase<br>
some of those negative residual feelings.<br>
<br>
The bottom line is if you treat others on this list (and their boxes)<br>
with respect, you're always welcome here in my book.<br>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">You know HP, people 
come to find out about letterboxing many different ways, from friends, through 
scouts, homeschool groups, magazine articles.  This is great for us, 
because it means there will always be new people entering the game.  But it 
can also be potentially dangerous if people begin without learning a little 
about letterboxing first.  It seems like you have done some investigating, 
and that will make for a better experience for you and your group.  I 
don't think Star Gazer (or anyone else on this list) is against new boxers 
joining the game.  She was merely giving a "heads up" to fellow 
letterboxers about a situation which, in the past, has been dangerous for 
existing boxes.  Letting them know they might want to go check on 
their boxes in a couple of days.  When we all work together and take care 
of each other's boxes they will be around for a long time, and there for many 
new boxers, like yourself, to enjoy.  -Mother of

<p>Sandy,<br/>I have an even better idea. Why don't you meet with<br/>the group 
  and maybe "show them how it's done" so that<br/>way everyone will be on the 
  same page as you. No, I<br/>have not planted a letterbox yet, or even searched 
  for<br/>one. But I can tell you I have read everything that<br/>I've been able 
  to get my hands on about the subject so<br/>I won't mess things up, as you say. 
  I also have<br/>figured out that not everyone has a stamp to stamp the<br/>log. 
  So I can only assume that there are times that<br/>there is no record of who 
  looked at it last.<br/><br/>I feel that if you only want certain ones to view 
  your<br/>box you should not post clues. You should have them<br/>send you a 
  resume so that you can check them out and<br/>see if they are worthy of looking 
  for your box. <br/><br/>I know that I'll be very aware of who the planter 
  is<br/>before I waste my time on one of your boxes and pass<br/>it on to others 
  not to waste theirs either.<br/><br/>PROUD Homeschooling Mother of SIX!!! <!-- |**|end egp html banner|**| --></p></div><!-- ygrp-msg --><!-- Sponsor -->

I am not mad or think all homeschoolers' moms are cruddy but I do <br>
know some who are. Both my daughters homeschooled their children for <br>
a period of time. One daughter has a colledge degree and was very <br>
good with her children. One of her children had a special needs that <br>
the school could not provide at that time is why she started. The <br>
other daughter took her children out of school to home school because <br>
she had a run in with a teacher who wanted to correct one of her <br>
children (who needed it by the way). This daughter has been tested <br>
several times and has a mind of a 10 year old child and is currently <br>
on SSI because she can not support herself. I have seen both sides of <br>
the homeschool coin. Also some of my friends homeschooled their <br>
children and all of them did really well in life. I am not against <br>
homeschoolers or their moms. And the child of this mom did not go <br>
hollering in the libriary about the letterboxing. It was the mom. I <br>
don't blame children at all but the suppervising. And yes I have made <br>
mistakes in letterboxing too. Hopefully I did not put anyones boxes <br>
in jepporty. I did write this mom again and told her about joining <br>
letterboxing.org and atlasquest.com. Told her she might just get more <br>
interested in letterboxing and that it could be a good hobby for her <br>
and her family. I hope I did right. Lois<br>

Knowing Stargazer personally, there is (in my opinion), no way that she was being a snob or stepping over the line here. As the majority of us know, when you put alot of time and effort into a box and have it disappear, it is hard. So I feel that she was just advising on what might be a problem if the issue wasn't addressed up front. I agree with dewberry that its not about homeschoolers or any other group, rather, just doing what responsible letterboxers do.  We take care of each other's boxes so that they will be there for others to enjoy. I feel this is what she was doing and that if people are offending by her comments they shouldn't be.  Sandy we are behind you and I for one, don't think you did anything wrong here.</div> <div>Monarch B<br/><br/><b><i>dewberrylb

Sandy approached the homeschooling group<br/>on behalf of a number of concerned planters. This is because of past<br/>negative experiences when there is an influx of people. <br/><br/>However, in spite of that, I want to make it clear that this is not a<br/>newbie vs. oldbie debate. <br/><br/>It's a question of how
 to handle a large group of people descending on<br/>your boxes at one time. Certain venues lend themselves to this better<br/>than others. The Botanical Gardens is probably not one of them.<br/><br/>Homeschooling is immaterial to the heart of this issue (and no one was<br/>attacking homeschooling (or scouts), itself, just the negative<br/>experiences we've had with some of them. By being a responsible<br/>letterboxer and teaching others how to be one too, you can help erase<br/>some of those negative residual feelings.<br/><br/>The bottom line is if you treat others on this list (and their boxes)<br/>with respect, you're always welcome here in my book.<br/><br/>dewberry<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, H P &lt;hdp463@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Sandy,<br/>&gt; I have an even better idea.
