<div>This event is scheduled for a Sunday.  We'll have a casual meetup in the morning followed by potluck at 1:00 p.m. for the folks who want to attend church before the gathering.  </div>

                    <html><body><div>While there is a little rain in the forecast for the Redoux this weekend, the chances are much slighter than they were a few weeks ago, and the temps promise to be more moderate - so it looks like we'll be having a gathering!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm finishing up with the clue books this evening, so if you have any last minute additions, get 'em to me quick!  I'll still be able to add something tomorrow, but after that, it will be iff'y.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the clue book, I'm including personal travelers (although you're gonna be sunk if you haven't done your research on most of those before Saturday!), and I'm including boxes in Rusk and Maydelle.  There are other boxes close at hand, but I simply had to make a decision on where to draw the line.  If you have boxes in close proximity to Rusk and you would like to make sure gathering attendees have them on Sunday afternoon, please bring your own copies - about 20 should be enough.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>We are still planning on potluck lunch, so please bring your favorite recipes.  We have access to power and I'll bring a power strip and extension cord, so if you HAVE to have power it'll be there.  I will also be there early for those who want to come and hang out and visit and get an early start hunting.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Looking forward to seeing you Redoux'ers this weekend, but I sure hate to miss my good friends who aren't going to be able to be there!</div>
