                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings, Fellow 'Boxers,<br>
<br>
I am new to this group, though I do not really consider myself a newbie to letterboxing. True, I have only found around 40 'boxes and planted only 2, but I am fairly confident in my knowledge and abilities, although of course there is always room for growth and improvement.<br>
<br>
An article in the Austin American Statesman sparked my interest in letterboxing earlier this year. My first find was the excellent 'Boots,' by Dolphinfish...the first one is unforgettable, you know? Since then, I have been 'boxing whenever the opportunity presents itself. I have sought boxes from Austin to Houston, including New Braunfels, Gruene, Boerne, Tomball, Cypress, and Somerville. A big thank you to anyone who has plants in these places-I may not have had enough time or energy to find them, but I certainly wanted to.<br>
<br>
My main (read: faraway) goal in letterboxing is to eventually plant extraordinarily great 'boxes. I know, that's almost everyone's goal, right? However, I am by nature more of a planter than a finder, and I am currently working on some 'boxes that I hope will please some of ya'll over here in Austin. I look forward to learning from all of the 'boxers on these boards.<br>
<br>
On the topic of boards, I am more of a lurker than a frequent poster, but I appreciate all those who contribute topics, and I will be chipping in occasionally.<br>
<br>
Well, that's about it-a very long and uninformative post, no? I appreciate a certain amount of anonymity, and that is one of the reasons why I find letterboxing so appealing. You go to places where others have been before, and though you see their marks, you rarely get to connect faces to the stamps. Thank you everybody, and happy 'boxing.<br>

I am new to this group, though I do not really consider myself a newbie to

I am fairly confident in my knowledge and abilities, although of course there
is always room for growth and improvement.<br/>

An article in the Austin American Statesman sparked my interest in letterboxing

first one is unforgettable, you know? Since then, I have been 'boxing whenever
the opportunity presents itself. I have sought boxes from Austin to Houston,
including New Braunfels, Gruene, Boerne, Tomball, Cypress, and Somerville. A

My main (read: faraway) goal in letterboxing is to eventually plant

letterboxing so appealing. You go to places where others have been before, and
though you see their marks, you rarely get to connect faces to the stamps.
