Thanks to all for the Birthday wishes!  The Birthday box was GREAT!<br>
<br>
Just returned from vacation to Washington state.  We had a great time, <br>
found a few boxes and placed 4 new ones, NONE in National Parks (in <br>
case Ranger Rick is still on my tail).  Victoria, BC (Canada) is <br>
beautiful, as were Olympic, North Cascades and Mt Rainier National <br>
Parks.<br>
<br>
Hope to find some time soon to get out and find some of the new boxes <br>
and plant some more.  Hope you are all doing well!<br>
<br>
PS - I recarved my personal stamp, so you should start seeing the new <br>
image soon, or at next event I am able to attend.<br>

I don't know whether I'm sad or psyched about your new stamp - I loved your<br>
old one! Hmmm...is there any chance the new stamp is a silver metallic<br>
Gryphon with upraised paw and strange lettering ;-)???<br>
Hope you guys will be able to come to the Barn-Raising in Waxahachie. Yikes<br>
- it's coming up sooner than I thought -need to get those stamps carved!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad to see most of you are safe, as my family is, but I<br>
will feel better once I hear from Droop.  We did not <br>
evacuate but had a houseful of family.  We got hardly<br>
any rain and minimal wind, so glad we stayed out of the<br>
traffic.  Glad we dodged the bullet, but sorry for East<br>
TX.  Lucy, you probably got more of the storm than I did!<br>
I'm also glad Mike took my advice and joined this group.<br>
I sent an email to the NM boxer on this list to try and<br>
get them aware of each other.  I think we now have a<br>
letterboxer in every region of TX!<br>
Riding out Rita ended up being fun for my kids since it<br>
was not that bad and family was over.  I was worried how<br>
they would deal with it since I still have vivid memories<br>
of the last big hurricane to hit Houston area, Carla in 1961<br>
when I was 6 years old.  I'm so glad we avoided that trauma!<br>
Good luck to everyone getting back to their normal lives and<br>
back to letterboxing when time allows, and thanks for being <br>
such a great, supportive group.<br>

had probably not gotten a lot, but we didn't know if<br>
you had evacuated or not.  It seems like as<br>
Houstonians go, probably the ones that got the worst<br>
of it are the onces that evac'd.  Hard to know what to<br>
do two or three days out, but if you wait much longer,<br>
it's too late!<br>
<br>
We spent the night at home last night, but it was a<br>
miserably hot, humid night, so tonight we're packing<br>
up and camping out at my husband's office (assuming we<br>
don't get power, but I'm still hoping we might!). <br>
Meanwhile, I"m sitting here glad to be at work for a<br>
change...<br>

I will not be able to make it to Wax. event.  I have been trying to <br>
