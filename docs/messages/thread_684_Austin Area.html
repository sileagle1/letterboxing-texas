Hey, I went boxing in the Austin area this week.<br/>
<br/>
Barton Creek- found<br/>
Hiking Pug- found<br/>
<br/>
Texas sized - not found<br/>
Bevo- not found I think the recent rains made a creek right where <br/>
the box was supposed to be, in fact the roots of the tree were all <br/>
washed out, anything that was there was gone in the water<br/>
<br/>
Town butterfly- not found, but If I was counting, I would count this <br/>
one because it was one of the more challanging boxes I've ever hiked <br/>
for (almost 3 mile) and the hamburger Rock and the 17 water <br/>
crossings were the most fun, and darn it, I'm sorry if I can't find <br/>
the dip and teepee- but I did complete the hike alive and I'm proud <br/>
of that- sorry, no stamp to prove I was there. Ok, I'm going back <br/>
for that one, and the Town dragonfly- thank you to the placer for a <br/>
lot of fun.<br/>
<br/>
Still trying to go to Brazos next week<br/>
<br/>
WOW<br/>
