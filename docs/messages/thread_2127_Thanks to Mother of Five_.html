<div>Viewfinder and I were out letterboxing in the rain today - reminded me of letterboxing in Maine! It was so cool with the gentle rain. We ran into a "new family" letterboxing. They had just found their first box. We did an exchange with them (they had two adorable little daughters - complete with their stamps, logbook and wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas - so cute!) After finding the three boxes in Denton we were looking for (Beneficus Rex - you are a very talented carver - great stamps), we went downtown and had a bowl of gumbo at Ruby's on the square. Wonderful rainy day!!!!</div>
