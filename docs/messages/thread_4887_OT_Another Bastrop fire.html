A brush fire has ignited northeast of Bastrop and Camp Swift Tuesday<br/>
afternoon.<br/>
According to a Bastrop County government official, the fire is east of FM<br/>
2336 on<br/>
Oak Hill Cemetery Road, near the Griffith League Scout Ranch.<br/>
Residents on Herron Trail south of the ranch are being evacuated as a<br/>
precaution.<br/>
Fire officials say it's about 100 acres and growing, with a steady north<br/>
wind blowing. It is not contained.<br/>
The flames are close to the area that has already been scorched by the <br/>
massive Sept wildfire that tore through 34,000 acres and destroyed more <br/>
than 1,500 homes.<br/>
