<div>    My LSS and I have been traveling a little 
lately (KY, TN, and Lake Tahoe area) and very busy in between, so I haven't been 
on this list much recently (haven't even read many of the posts and feel 
like I'm behind!).  I noted several new members, so welcome to Texas 
letterboxing! </div>
<div>    Update on the Grapevine Heritage Park boxes:  
I have replaced (June 28) the first (and so far, to my knowledge, ONLY) missing 
letterbox of all those I've planted so far:  In the Creek - Lauren's 
Turtle.  It was sad that it disappeared because it was the very first stamp 
I ever carved and I was pretty proud of it, and the first letterbox I made, 
though not the first I placed.  But it's now back out there, same location 
in Grapevine's Heritage Park Botanic Gardens, not far from In the Tree - 
Meghan's Bird, which was also temporarily pulled until the soggy logbook could 
be dried sufficiently.  Many of the earlier stamps in this logbook are now 
history, though.  I'll be checking on the others as I can get to all of 
them, but I've heard pretty frequently from finders on most of them and no 
others have been reported missing or wet!</div>
<div>    This week I also found PuddleSplasher's Tombs and 
Tees letterbox in the Bear Creek Cemetery in Euless, immediately adjacent to the 
DFW Airport and the Bear Creek Golf Course.  What a great place!  This 
old, quiet, historic cemetery, tall cedars and oaks surrounding it.  I was 
sitting and stamping in and kept thinking I heard voices, then realized that 
just across the creek beyond the trees, golfers were teeing off!  And then, 
the planes lifting off overhead, although with the tree cover, they were hard to 
see.  Really cool letterbox, too!</div>
<div>      Lake Tahoe in early June  - 
beautiful views of the deep blue lake, snow-capped peaks around the lake, and 
tall tall pines along the trails.  What could be better?  Finding a 
great box in a cool place with interesting stamps!  Found 4:  Birds of 
Tahoe #2 by ArtTrekker, Rainbow Bridge and Patty Reed's Doll, both near the 
Donner Pass, by doublesaj&amp;Old Blue, and Golden Bear in Reno, by 
PuddleSplasher.  All great stamps, wonderful finds!  Looked for 2 
others which we weren't able to find, one I'm pretty sure is missing at 
Inspiration Point overlooking Emerald Bay, and one at the Donner Pass Summit 
that I just couldn't get to for remains of snow and ice covering up the trail 
and the downed trees where the box is probably waiting. (Wish just a little 
of that were here in Texas with us!)   The area is full of boxes that 
we just weren't able to look for (of the 2 of us, only 1 is passionate about 
letterboxing.  The other is a pretty good sport, but would rather just 
hike, explore, and ignore the boxes!)  I was pretty excited when I got home 
and entered these recent finds (including about 6 others in KY and TN and 
Arkansas last month) to discover that I'd passed the F300 mark several boxes 
ago.  Even more exciting, though, is the discovery that while I've not been 
paying attention, at least 15 or 20 letterboxes are around this area that I 
haven't even looked for yet - spread out in every direction!  Yay!  
Many more days of letterboxing right here at home!
