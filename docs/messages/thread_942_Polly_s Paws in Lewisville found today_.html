finally, today, made it to Lewisville to find this LB in a very pretty <br>
little park, nice short walk in the SHADE - hooray! This is one that <br>
would be great to take kids along because the park has a wonderful <br>
playground, the walk isn't long or hot, and the LB is pretty <br>
accessible. Cute paws stamp, too.  Thanks very much, Red Berry, for <br>
planting it.  I was delighted to be FF AND to refind the 1st <br>
Anniversary HH, which had been sent to me from Puddle-Splasher in CT <br>
(she'd been FF for that one)and which had been released in the <br>
CelticLions' LB in Denton previously.  Now, it can continue its travels <br>
around TX after I release it again in the next couple of weeks.   <br>
