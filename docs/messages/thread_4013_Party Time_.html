                    <div class="plaintext-content">Now, you see, here I was minding my own business and I get accused of some sort of shenanigans, along with pore ol' Bozo.  I haven't been in Collin County since last Tuesday when I was lookin' for a haunted courthouse.  Sounded like a letterboxing opportunity.  I got confused because I found 3 courthouses in Collin County and didn't have a clue which one was haunted.  One of 'em aint even in McKinney, which was the county seat, last I heard.  It was in someplace called Melissa.  Now what kind of name is that for a town?  I know that Collin County and the county seat, McKinney were named for that great Texas patriot, Collin McKinney, but who is Melissa?  Anyway, I didn't pick up no group of rowdy bus passengers, so don't go accusin' me of nuthin' like that.<br/>
