The LBNA web site at:  http://www.letterboxing.org/<br>
has clues to most boxes in North America.  Just click<br>
on Clues, then click on the state you want to look at.<br>
In the case of ZZ Top & Black Beans, click on Texas, then<br>
the North Prairie Region and you will see them.  You can<br>
also search for boxes by clicking Search For Boxes on the<br>
main page, then pick the state and/or other search criteria,<br>
then click Search Boxes and it will bring up a list.<br>
Since you live in Pasadena, you might want to click on the<br>
Coastal Region of Texas to find some near you.  Hope this<br>
helps.<br>
