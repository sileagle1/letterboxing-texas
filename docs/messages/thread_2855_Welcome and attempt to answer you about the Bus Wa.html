                    <html><body><div>Welcome, welcome. You can catch frogs and hunt for letterboxes at the same time. I almost brought home a turtle on my tour bus excursion, but<em> </em>I felt that the turtle had done nothing (besides poop) to me, so I figured he didn't deserve that kind of torture.</div> <div> </div> <div>I read all the notes today, I don't think anyone answered your question about the Texas Tour Buses. So, being the friendly sort that I am, I'm going to attempt it. Y'all, please, correct me if I am wrong in any part.</div> <div> </div> <div>Somebody carved a bus and driver, they put them in a large Rubbermaid (or other type) of plastic box with camo tape on it. They hid the box and posted the clues only in this Yahoo Group with "Texas Tour Bus" in the Subject Line (This allows a quick search of those posts to follow the bus). Boxer #2 sees the clues on the group and goes and finds the box. Instead of leaving it there, they take it and add a passenger (A Texan).
 After stamping/logging in and adding their passenger, they take the box out and hide it somewhere else and add the clues to this group so the hunt can continue. The bus is not allowed to leave Texas (something about the driver not having the proper papers and license to cross the state line, j/k). </div> <div> </div> <div>You can search the archives for Subject: Texas Tour Bus and it'll show alot of the clues (I'm not good at that kind of stuff, but I have done it once to read the clues). Some of them are hilarious. I would be entertained just reading them. There are two buses out there now. I haven't heard much about them, but one down South somewhere, just waiting. But, I bet it doesn't last past this weekend before heading out to a new destination.<br/></div> <div>Happy Hunting,</div> <div>Janet, BF</div> <div><br/><b><i>Amy &lt;kevamy1@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff
 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hello all! I am brand new to letterboxing after reading about it in a <br/>magazine. I'm in Houston and I was happy to find many boxes near my <br/>home. I've taken my kids out a couple of times and so far we've found <br/>3 boxes. We love the outdoors and this is a great alternative to the <br/>frog-catching my hubby does with them! Our trail name is Treasure Bugs <br/>as we seem to always be together. I am originally from Chicago, but <br/>transplanted here 11 years ago for a teaching job. It was very <br/>appropriate that the first box I found was called "An Apple for my <br/>Teacher."<br/>I look forward to finding more boxes and to eventually one
 day actually <br/>hiding one. <br/>Can someone please explain the tour bus to me...<br/><br/>Thanks!<br/>Amy<br/><br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/><p>
