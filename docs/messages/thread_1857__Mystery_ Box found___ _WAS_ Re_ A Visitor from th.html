evacuate the location rather quickly due to a groundskeeper who wanted <br>
to go home 10 minutes early. When I found the hiding spot (I think), <br>

back to the car so I wouldn't get trapped in the cemetery, knowing that <br>
I would see SilverEagle today...<br>

When I got to the next stop, I went to stamp in and discovered that <br>
what I had found was not what I was expecting. I have a Ziploc <br>
container that has in it a green ink pad and a store-bought stamp. <br>
Perhaps the stamp has something to do with the name written in faded <br>
Sharpie on the lid: Garcia Middle School.<br>
<br>
Does anyone know about this "mystery" box? Silver Eagle's still <br>
scratching his head... ;-) I still have it in my possession...<br>
