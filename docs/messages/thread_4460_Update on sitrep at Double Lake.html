The last box, You Ain't Nuthin' but a Hound Dog, has never been found and it's been out there for 2 years.  The reason?  I forgot to post the clues and only noticed that when I was printing out clues for all the boxes.  Now, Lone Star Quilter doesn't know that I forgot to post the clues, so the only way she'll know is if you tell her.  I'll get them posted tonight.  Most of the 33 boxes there were found at the event in March 2008 and have only been found a couple of times, if at all, since then.  It's really a shame because there are some very nice boxes out there.  The 2 series above, by dewberry, consist of boxes made for the event by guest letterboxers:  CW Sunseeker, MoWizLiz & Teeps;man, Flutterby, Fungus Woman, Sahalie, Triple T, Jabber & Jo Bob, SHH and JACKS.  Where else are you going to find their boxes in Texas?  Just throwing in a little plug for Coldspring.  I hope this was winter's last blast so we can all go hunt some letterboxes.  There are another 6 or 7 boxes on the Lone Star Trail close to Double Lake, so I'll check them out in a day or two.<br>

margin-left:.5in">After a very wintery weekend, today was a warm and sunny day,
so I went out to Double Lake Recreation Area to finish checking on the boxes
there. Last week I checked out 17 and found 16 and today I checked out 18 and
found 17. So, there are 33 letterboxes in that park. The only one I didn't find
was "A Gift for Princess Aurora" by Barefoot Lucy. Sorry, Lucy, that
was a favorite of mine because, as you know, Princess Aurora is my 9 year old
granddaughter. The only box I found missing last week belonged to her, so she's
not going to be very happy. The boxes that I did find and that, other than a
couple of damp logbooks, were:<br/>
<br/>
Four Legged Letterboxers by dewberry (a series of 5)<br/>
Best in Breeds by dewberry (another series of 5, although I found one of them
last week)<br/>
A Dog-Gone Good Time by Lucy Locket<br/>
The Legend of the Dogwood by Baileys Bunch<br/>
Some Days You're the Dog….. By SandiBox<br/>
The LetterBOXER's Companion by SandiBox<br/>
Double Lake by Boots Tex<br/>
Flying Geese Quilt Block by Lone Star Quilter<br/>
It Is What It Is by El Lobo<br/>
You Ain't Nuthin' but a Hound Dog by Lone Star Quilter<br/>
<br/>
The last box, You Ain't Nuthin' but a Hound Dog, has never been found and it's
been out there for 2 years. The reason? I forgot to post the clues and only
noticed that when I was printing out clues for all the boxes. Now, Lone Star
Quilter doesn't know that I forgot to post the clues, so the only way she'll
know is if you tell her. I'll get them posted tonight. Most of the 33 boxes
there were found at the event in March 2008 and have only been found a couple
of times, if at all, since then. It's really a shame because there are some
very nice boxes out there. The 2 series above, by dewberry, consist of boxes
made for the event by guest letterboxers: CW Sunseeker, MoWizLiz &amp;
Teeps;man, Flutterby, Fungus Woman, Sahalie, Triple T, Jabber &amp; Jo Bob, SHH
and JACKS. Where else are you going to find their boxes in Texas? Just throwing
in a little plug for Coldspring. I hope this was winter's last blast so we can
all go hunt some letterboxes. There are another 6 or 7 boxes on the Lone Star
Trail close to Double Lake, so I'll check them out in a day or two.<br/>

This is a good time to come.  The weather has been just about perfect the last couple of days, the dogwoods are starting to bloom, there are no mosquitos, no spider webs across the trails with big yellow spiders and if you come on a weekday, you'll have the place mostly to yourself.  I went back out today to check on a few boxes that are on the Lone Star Trail close to Double Lake, but not actually in the park.  I picked up a couple of the boxes to dry out the logbook and they'll go back out tomorrow, so the letterboxes out there will all be accounted for and maintained.  They are:<br>
<br>
The Joker  by Baby Bear<br>
Quilted Boots  By Silver Eagle<br>
Muppets Take Texas Series: Gonzo   by Pastry Princess<br>
Shoolfly Quilt Block    by Lone Star Quilter<br>
Picoides Borealis   by Boots Tex<br>
Holy Anole   by Wills World<br>
<br>
And who knows, Princess Aurora's box, Mr. Bobbles, may be replaced by the time you are here.<br>

I wonder where Gryzzled Gryphon is?  The cinnamon rolls are about to come out of the oven and I haven't seen hide nor (gryzzled) hair of him.  Knowing his mysterious nature, he'll probably come and go before we know it, and to heck with the sweets.  Oh, well......we have a family meeting here this weekend, maybe he'll drop in and meet the relatives.  After a beautiful week, it's cool and breezy again today.  It's been more than 6 weeks since Groundhog Day, hasn't it?<br>

<p>Just to finish off the boxes in Coldspring, I checked on the two remaining boxes in town, JB Kokopelli's "Unsolved Mysteries" and LSQ's "Courthouse Steps" quilt block and they are both where they should be, alive and well.  I wonder where Gryzzled Gryphon is?  The cinnamon rolls are about to come out of the oven and I haven't seen hide nor (gryzzled) hair of him.  Knowing his mysterious nature, he'll probably come and go before we know it, and to heck with the sweets.  Oh, well......we have a family meeting here this weekend, maybe he'll drop in and meet the relatives.  After a beautiful week, it's cool and breezy again today.  It's been more than 6 weeks since Groundhog Day, hasn't it?<br/>

&gt; Let us know when you're coming, Mosaic Butterfly.  As you can see by my report, there are a lot of boxes and Double Lake is a very pretty park.  This is a good time to come.  The weather has been just about perfect the last couple of days, the dogwoods are starting to bloom, there are no mosquitos, no spider webs across the trails with big yellow spiders and if you come on a weekday, you'll have the place mostly to yourself.  I went back out today to check on a few boxes that are on the Lone Star Trail close to Double Lake, but not actually in the park.  I picked up a couple of the boxes to dry out the logbook and they'll go back out tomorrow, so the letterboxes out there will all be accounted for and maintained.  They are:<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Joker  by Baby Bear<br/>
&gt; Quilted Boots  By Silver Eagle<br/>
&gt; Muppets Take Texas Series: Gonzo   by Pastry Princess<br/>
&gt; Shoolfly Quilt Block    by Lone Star Quilter<br/>
&gt; Picoides Borealis   by Boots Tex<br/>
&gt; Holy Anole   by Wills World<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And who knows, Princess Aurora's box, Mr. Bobbles, may be replaced by the time you are here.<br/>

&gt; &gt; As mentioned previously, I am hoping to be out your way next week.  This was<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;  <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; After a very wintery weekend, today was a warm and sunny day, so I went out<br/>
&gt; &gt; to Double Lake Recreation Area to finish checking on the boxes there. Last<br/>
&gt; &gt; week I checked out 17 and found 16 and today I checked out 18 and found 17.<br/>
&gt; &gt; So, there are 33 letterboxes in that park. The only one I didn't find was "A<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gift for Princess Aurora" by Barefoot Lucy. Sorry, Lucy, that was a favorite<br/>
&gt; &gt; of mine because, as you know, Princess Aurora is my 9 year old<br/>
&gt; &gt; granddaughter. The only box I found missing last week belonged to her, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; she's not going to be very happy. The boxes that I did find and that, other<br/>
&gt; &gt; than a couple of damp logbooks, were:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Four Legged Letterboxers by dewberry (a series of 5)<br/>
&gt; &gt; Best in Breeds by dewberry (another series of 5, although I found one of<br/>
&gt; &gt; them last week)<br/>
&gt; &gt; A Dog-Gone Good Time by Lucy Locket<br/>
&gt; &gt; The Legend of the Dogwood by Baileys Bunch<br/>
&gt; &gt; Some Days You're the Dog... By SandiBox<br/>
&gt; &gt; The LetterBOXER's Companion by SandiBox<br/>
&gt; &gt; Double Lake by Boots Tex<br/>
&gt; &gt; Flying Geese Quilt Block by Lone Star Quilter<br/>
&gt; &gt; It Is What It Is by El Lobo<br/>
&gt; &gt; You Ain't Nuthin' but a Hound Dog by Lone Star Quilter<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; The last box, You Ain't Nuthin' but a Hound Dog, has never been found and<br/>
&gt; &gt; it's been out there for 2 years. The reason? I forgot to post the clues and<br/>
&gt; &gt; only noticed that when I was printing out clues for all the boxes. Now, Lone<br/>
&gt; &gt; Star Quilter doesn't know that I forgot to post the clues, so the only way<br/>
&gt; &gt; she'll know is if you tell her. I'll get them posted tonight. Most of the 33<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes there were found at the event in March 2008 and have only been found a<br/>
&gt; &gt; couple of times, if at all, since then. It's really a shame because there<br/>
&gt; &gt; are some very nice boxes out there. The 2 series above, by dewberry, consist<br/>
&gt; &gt; of boxes made for the event by guest letterboxers: CW Sunseeker, MoWizLiz &amp;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Teeps;man, Flutterby, Fungus Woman, Sahalie, Triple T, Jabber &amp; Jo Bob, SHH<br/>
&gt; &gt; and JACKS. Where else are you going to find their boxes in Texas? Just<br/>
&gt; &gt; throwing in a little plug for Coldspring. I hope this was winter's last<br/>
&gt; &gt; blast so we can all go hunt some letterboxes. There are another 6 or 7 boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the Lone Star Trail close to Double Lake, so I'll check them out in a day<br/>
&gt; &gt; or two.<br/>
