<big><i>So, I met Corazon on
the trail in Bastrop last Saturday, then on Sunday Jackie and I ran
into the Belton Gals at Confederate Park, and today on the Baylor
campus in Waco... zturtle, Jackie and I meandered past a couple who
were deep in though cyphering some code on paper.  We wondered if they
were the couple from Santa Fe, NM who had stamped the log books at a
cemetery just before us.  As previously instructed by Corazon, I
approached them and asked which was was North, to which the gentleman
pointed straight up.  It was lionsmane and AstroD and they were working
on Travelin' Ts' Baylor Walking Tour.  We took pix and exchanged
stamps.  They spent yesterday in Dallas and today in Waco, as they
letterbox their way to Bastrop!  So, in the past week, I've met 7
fellow letterboxers on various trails. </i></big><i><big>What a small world! <br/>
We had a great day today... although it was very windy!  Jackie's hubby
printed off directions to lots of letterboxes for us... and we were
bound and determined to find each and every one of 'em!  He probably
won't help print out directions for us anymore, since it was way past
supper time 'til we got home!LOL<br/>

Looking forward to meeting you in
Bastrop!  zturtle, Granny J, and I had a great time finding some of
your boxes on the Baylor campus.  Can't recall what the names of all
the boxes were, but the one located by the angel statue is missing. 
Looks like the groundskeepers removed the ground cover and probably the
box, too.<br/>
