                    <html><body><div>In preparing for the gathering next weekend, I've been spending a lot of time thinking back over my time in letterboxing, now about 3 and a half years worth.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't have to tell y'all - again - how lonely it was around here when I first got started.  Suffice it to say that it was such a situation that if a new box had been placed around here, it would have hit the ground with a sonorous, reverberating thud, sufficient to draw the attention of even a sleeping boxer.  Kind of like how it would be to believe yourself to be the only person on a desert island, only to stumble across a half-eaten bologna sandwich one day.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well gone are those days - and thankfully so!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Two evenings this week Lightning and I loaded up after I got off work and headed out for a little after-work/before dark boxing.  The first evening Fearless Fox even went with us!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>TaterTexas has been placing boxes here in Cherokee County lately and although they had been on the ground for a few weeks, I had not yet gotten to get out and hunt his boxes.  I had gotten to peek at his artwork in JBK's logbook at the Rusk Redoux so I was anxious to collect the images for myself.  We set out Wednesday evening with about an hour and a half of light.  We quickly found Vogue in a cemetery a stone's throw from the house I grew up in.  I loved the style of this stamp!  We continued on to Gallatin, where we also found the first of his Winnie-the-Pooh series and two of the three Faith Series (one is currently missing) and Circle of Hearts.  Imagine - we found FIVE boxes in an hour and a half!  After seeing his art, I'm pretty impressed that he jumped right in and started carving and does it so well!  I think Vogue was my fave, followed closely by Circle of Hearts.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even more impressive to me than finding five boxes in one evening, is the fact that I can no longer count on being first finder.  Of course, I gave that idea up long ago when PuddleSplasher jumped my turf and snagged the Tour Bus, but I digress.  Anyway, I got a notice that there was a new box in my area, in fact two new ones - by JBK.  Memorials to her grandparents.  I thought to myself - Thursday evening?  New boxes down Highway 79?  Hmmm..PTK and TaterTexas on the loose?  Not to mention GG?  And then there IS always that terribly unpredictable PuddleSplasher...It started adding up to a sick day at work, but I realized I couldn't do that either because we were already short-handed.  I guess I should've had the wherewithal to get up and get 'em BEFORE work, but I didn't! I collected Lightning from the house immediately after I got off and we went straight to the two new boxes, but sure enough, PTK had already hit them.  Drats!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had ambitions of getting six more boxes by PTK, but before I got to New Summerfield, Fearless Fox called me and invited me to go see On Golden Pond at the local civic theatre.  It was an awfully nice evening to be outdoors, but the play was enticing too, and since it WAS our anniversary, I agreed to go.  We made plans to meet at the house and head to Rusk for the play (and for the record, the stage version of On Golden Pond is hilariously funny and poignant, all at the same time.  It's easy to make me laugh, but hard to make me cry.  This play did both).  ANWAY, I realized I would have to cut my letterboxing a little short then, so we went on to New Summerfield and got PTK's Anniversary box then called it off and headed home.  I thought it was especially cool to get her Anniversary box ON my own anniversary!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On a side note - did y'all realize that the appropriate gift for a 22nd anniversary is floor tile?  That's what Fearless Fox told me and he put his money where his mouth is, so surely that must be correct!  Either that or I got hoodwinked into a heck of a lot of hard work!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, I was planning to head out to Scout Camp today to scope out hiding places for the 15 boxes I'll be planting for our scout event.  I was going with She Who Reads, who had to participate in a camp inspection.  I had pulled down several boxes to find on our way home, along with the ones I wasn't able to get to last night, but alas, I woke up and it is raining.  Raining.  Raining.  Raining.  There was no need for me to go to camp, so I sent her along without me, although Lightning opted to go with her.  He's gonne come home like a muddy dog.  I just know it!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - if the weather were to clear even a little bit, I might have to venture out for the Lake Striker boxes and my first glimpse of PTK's hand-carving!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm really glad to have been a part of the old days when letterboxing life was hard to come by, but it sure is nice having folks around to play with, and especially nice to have a healthy backlog of boxes to find!

<div><font size="2">That reminds me of a time in Connecticut I took my "black" lab letterboxing with me. It was a hot day, but he was too excited to stop and drink his water. Finally, to cool off, he found a muddy creek bed to lay in. He became a huge, 90 pound, brown mud ball. I had to help him into the back of my Jeep which got me as muddy as he was. On the drive home, I stopped at the Housatonic River and let him go for a swim to wash the mud off. I'll never forget how funny it was watching him swim by with a brown trail of mud behind him.</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">OK, I have a problem. Maybe someone can help me, Lucy please. My <br>
husband and I went letterboxing in Jacksonville and surounding areas <br>
yesterday, Sat. 2/24/2007. We maybe so new that we have not gotten <br>
the idea yet or can't read directions but we looked for 6 boxes and <br>
only found 2. I really believe that the ones we could not find were <br>
missing and it was not our miss directions. We went to Bucknell Park <br>
to look for 2 there "Dragonfly Springs by texasluvbug" and "Sunflower <br>
Summer also by texasluvbug. I am full confident they are missing. <br>
Also "Life is a Picnic by texasluvbug" in Nichols Green Park is <br>
missing. We did find the place where it was hid and it was a good <br>
place. We could see where it had been and was not there. "Water from <br>
the Rocks" by texasluvbug was also missing. Has texasluvbug quit and <br>
removed their boxes or what? I guess I should have started out with <br>
the newly planted boxes and I would not have been so disapointed. In <br>
a few weeks we will be back in the area to look again. Comments and <br>
suggestions appreciated. Adams Trails (Lois)<br>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm so disappointed you had that experience - there are quite a few great boxes around Jacksonville, but we have one planter, TexasLuvBug, who has quit the game and unfortunately, has never removed or managed her clues.  There is no good way to communicate the problem except to periodically mention it here, which I do.  And if I know someone is coming to my area, I let them know not to look for her boxes.  All but two are definitely gone, and those two I believe are still in place but I haven't gotten to go check them in awhile.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you are unfamiliar with an area, it never hurts to post a message on this list asking for insight or to email placers through the clue websites and ask them for help.  Say something like "I plan to visit the Jacksonville area and I wonder if anyone can tell me which boxes are especially good to look for, or are there any that I should avoid or that are known to be missing?"  Besides telling you to avoid TLB's listings because she abandoned her boxes and her listings, I would've sent you some clues for my Girl Scout Series which is in Nichols Green and given you some suggestions for boxes to look for by a variety of placers in this area (I always try to showcase everyone with boxes in my town and area), boxes that are known to be there.  And I would've offered you my cell phone number so I could help you out if you got stuck on something and probably offered to exchange with you, depending on where I would be.  BUT - not asking doesn't make it your fault you had the experience you did, it's just a suggestion for future reference.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The particular problem you reference is by far my biggest pet peeve in letterboxing, and it is one of the most difficult to solve, as many can tell you!  As to TLB, It's fine if she doesn't want to letterbox anymore, but it was wrong for her to walk away and leave her boxes and clues in place without offering to adopt them out (I've been willing from Day One to adopt them).  What she did was litter up a bunch of areas with trash (which is what an abandoned letterbox amounts to) and it reflects badly on all of us.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please though, don't resort to only looking for new boxes.  For one thing, you will miss out on finding some older boxes with rich history.  I have one out right now that is two years old and I received word this week that it has an overflowing logbook   By not looking for it because it's old, you would miss out on all those wonderful stamps from old-timers and passers-through.  And while it makes sense on the surface that new boxes are more likely to be in place, it isn't necessarily true.  New boxes actually have a higher rate of disappearance in their first month or two because the placer has introduced something foreign into a location and it is very difficult to tell who or what might notice.  I figure if my box makes six months - basically, a winter and a spring, or a fall and a winter - it may well stick.  Otherwise, I try not to get too attached until it's been there awhile.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I'm heading to an unfamiliar area, I try to choose a variety of placers, a variety of box ages, and a variety of locations.  I also draw more clues than I can possibly find (although on this point, I do it because my heart still earnestly believes I can find 25 boxes spread between three towns in one day AND enjoy the finding of them all, while my head knows this is ridiculous) and frankly, I don't spend a lot of time looking for ones I am having trouble with - I just move on to the next one.  The exception to this is if I am really enjoying the location and I want to hang out and spend a little more time there anyway.  I read over my clues to make sure there isn't something I need to familiarize myself with before searching (like - how can I tell a black oak from a blackjack oak?), or a clue I need to solve, or something that doesn't make sense on the surface.  I then also contact a placer I know in the area, or I contact the placers listed on the clue websites.  Most placers are eager to have new finders around and are more than willing to offer what information they can, as long as you aren't asking for answers to puzzle clues (asking for hints is okay), or asking for special consideration.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But Lois, let me make it up to you.  When you next come to this area, let me know in advance and if I'm in town I'll take y'all to lunch at Legends, the best burger joint in town (if it isn't on a Sunday).  It's becoming my new hangout because it has great lighting and a relaxed environment, so that I often go there to eat and carve.

<p>OK, I have a problem. Maybe someone can help me, Lucy please. My <br/>husband and I went letterboxing in Jacksonville and surounding areas <br/>yesterday, Sat. 2/24/2007. We maybe so new that we have not gotten <br/>the idea yet or can't read directions but we looked for 6 boxes and 
<br/>only found 2. I really believe that the ones we could not find were <br/>missing and it was not our miss directions. We went to Bucknell Park <br/>to look for 2 there "Dragonfly Springs by texasluvbug" and "Sunflower 
<br/>Summer also by texasluvbug. I am full confident they are missing. <br/>Also "Life is a Picnic by texasluvbug" in Nichols Green Park is <br/>missing. We did find the place where it was hid and it was a good <br/>
place. We could see where it had been and was not there. "Water from <br/>the Rocks" by texasluvbug was also missing. Has texasluvbug quit and <br/>removed their boxes or what? I guess I should have started out with 
<br/>the newly planted boxes and I would not have been so disapointed. In <br/>a few weeks we will be back in the area to look again. Comments and <br/>suggestions appreciated.

<br/>for<br/>&gt; myself. We set out Wednesday evening with about an hour and a half <br/>of<br/>&gt; light. We quickly found Vogue in a cemetery a stone's throw from <br/>the house<br/>&gt; I grew up in. I loved the style of this stamp! We continued on to
<br/>&gt; Gallatin, where we also found the first of his Winnie-the-Pooh <br/>series and<br/>&gt; two of the three Faith Series (one is currently missing) and Circle <br/>of<br/>&gt; Hearts. Imagine - we found FIVE boxes in an hour and a half!

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another thing I would mention is that while it's a good idea to post here about a pending trip, I would be cautious in posting too much about a pending trip.  Despite the fact this is a friendly list, you never know whose out there lurking.
<br/><br/>Well here's hoping I'll be around when you visit again (I have six camping weekends coming up here before the first of May!)...and good luck in the meantime!</div>

<p>Thanks Barefootlucy and Lucy Locket for all your help. I am sorry I <br/>did not contact or post anything about our trip to find boxes in <br/>Jacksonville. We kinda decided to go on the spur of the moment and I <br/>thought asking some of those questions would be cheating, I guess but 
<br/>that sounds like a great idea. We will be going back to Jacksonville <br/>in a couple of weeks. I will need some clues to your boxes Barefoot <br/>lucy so I will contact you and Thanks again for the help. Adams <br/>Trails.

</p><div><span class="e" id="q_110fc6802759b1f9_2">&gt; Ahhhh Lois!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I'm so disappointed you had that experience - there are quite a few <br/>great<br/>&gt; boxes around Jacksonville, but we have one planter, TexasLuvBug, 
<br/>who has<br/>&gt; quit the game and unfortunately, has never removed or managed her <br/>clues.<br/>&gt; There is no good way to communicate the problem except to <br/>periodically<br/>&gt; mention it here, which I do. And if I know someone is coming to my 
<br/>area, I<br/>&gt; let them know not to look for her boxes. All but two are <br/>definitely gone,<br/>&gt; and those two I believe are still in place but I haven't gotten to <br/>go check<br/>&gt; them in awhile.<br/>&gt; 
<br/>&gt; If you are unfamiliar with an area, it never hurts to post a <br/>message on this<br/>&gt; list asking for insight or to email placers through the clue <br/>websites and<br/>&gt; ask them for help. Say something like "I plan to visit the 
<br/>Jacksonville<br/>&gt; area and I wonder if anyone can tell me which boxes are especially <br/>good to<br/>&gt; look for, or are there any that I should avoid or that are known to <br/>be<br/>&gt; missing?" Besides telling you to avoid TLB's listings because she 
<br/>abandoned<br/>&gt; her boxes and her listings, I would've sent you some clues for my <br/>Girl Scout<br/>&gt; Series which is in Nichols Green and given you some suggestions for <br/>boxes to<br/>&gt; look for by a variety of placers in this area (I always try to 
<br/>showcase<br/>&gt; everyone with boxes in my town and area), boxes that are known to <br/>be there.<br/>&gt; And I would've offered you my cell phone number so I could help you <br/>out if<br/>&gt; you got stuck on something and probably offered to exchange with 
<br/>you,<br/>&gt; depending on where I would be. BUT - not asking doesn't make it <br/>your fault<br/>&gt; you had the experience you did, it's just a suggestion for future<br/>&gt; reference.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The particular problem you reference is by far my biggest pet peeve 
<br/>in<br/>&gt; letterboxing, and it is one of the most difficult to solve, as many <br/>can tell<br/>&gt; you! As to TLB, It's fine if she doesn't want to letterbox <br/>anymore, but it<br/>&gt; was wrong for her to walk away and leave her boxes and clues in 
<br/>place<br/>&gt; without offering to adopt them out (I've been willing from Day One <br/>to adopt<br/>&gt; them). What she did was litter up a bunch of areas with trash <br/>(which is<br/>&gt; what an abandoned letterbox amounts to) and it reflects badly on 
<br/>all of us.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Please though, don't resort to only looking for new boxes. For one <br/>thing,<br/>&gt; you will miss out on finding some older boxes with rich history. I <br/>have one<br/>&gt; out right now that is two years old and I received word this week 
<br/>that it<br/>&gt; has an overflowing logbook By not looking for it because it's <br/>old, you<br/>&gt; would miss out on all those wonderful stamps from old-timers and<br/>&gt; passers-through. And while it makes sense on the surface that new 
<br/>boxes are<br/>&gt; more likely to be in place, it isn't necessarily true. New boxes <br/>actually<br/>&gt; have a higher rate of disappearance in their first month or two <br/>because the<br/>&gt; placer has introduced something foreign into a location and it is 
<br/>very<br/>&gt; difficult to tell who or what might notice. I figure if my box <br/>makes six<br/>&gt; months - basically, a winter and a spring, or a fall and a winter - <br/>it may<br/>&gt; well stick. Otherwise, I try not to get too attached until it's 
<br/>been there<br/>&gt; awhile.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; When I'm heading to an unfamiliar area, I try to choose a variety of<br/>&gt; placers, a variety of box ages, and a variety of locations. I also <br/>draw<br/>&gt; more clues than I can possibly find (although on this point, I do 
<br/>it because<br/>&gt; my heart still earnestly believes I can find 25 boxes spread <br/>between three<br/>&gt; towns in one day AND enjoy the finding of them all, while my head <br/>knows this<br/>&gt; is ridiculous) and frankly, I don't spend a lot of time looking for 
<br/>ones I<br/>&gt; am having trouble with - I just move on to the next one. The <br/>exception to<br/>&gt; this is if I am really enjoying the location and I want to hang out <br/>and<br/>&gt; spend a little more time there anyway. I read over my clues to 
<br/>make sure<br/>&gt; there isn't something I need to familiarize myself with before <br/>searching<br/>&gt; (like - how can I tell a black oak from a blackjack oak?), or a <br/>clue I need<br/>&gt; to solve, or something that doesn't make sense on the surface. I 
<br/>then also<br/>&gt; contact a placer I know in the area, or I contact the placers <br/>listed on the<br/>&gt; clue websites. Most placers are eager to have new finders around <br/>and are<br/>&gt; more than willing to offer what information they can, as long as 
<br/>you aren't<br/>&gt; asking for answers to puzzle clues (asking for hints is okay), or <br/>asking for<br/>&gt; special consideration.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But Lois, let me make it up to you. When you next come to this <br/>
area, let me<br/>&gt; know in advance and if I'm in town I'll take y'all to lunch at <br/>Legends, the<br/>&gt; best burger joint in town (if it isn't on a Sunday). It's becoming <br/>my new<br/>&gt; hangout because it has great lighting and a relaxed environment, so 
<br/>that I<br/>&gt; often go there to eat and carve.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/></span></div>

<br/>areas<br/>&gt; &gt; yesterday, Sat. 2/24/2007. We maybe so new that we have not gotten<br/>&gt; &gt; the idea yet or can't read directions but we looked for 6 boxes <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; only found 2. I really believe that the ones we could not find 
<br/>were<br/>&gt; &gt; missing and it was not our miss directions. We went to Bucknell <br/>Park<br/>&gt; &gt; to look for 2 there "Dragonfly Springs by texasluvbug" <br/>and "Sunflower<br/>&gt; &gt; Summer also by texasluvbug. I am full confident they are missing.
<br/>&gt; &gt; Also "Life is a Picnic by texasluvbug" in Nichols Green Park is<br/>&gt; &gt; missing. We did find the place where it was hid and it was a good<br/>&gt; &gt; place. We could see where it had been and was not there. "Water 
<br/>from<br/>&gt; &gt; the Rocks" by texasluvbug was also missing. Has texasluvbug quit <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; removed their boxes or what? I guess I should have started out <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; the newly planted boxes and I would not have been so disapointed. 
<br/>In<br/>&gt; &gt; a few weeks we will be back in the area to look again. Comments <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; suggestions appreciated.

ground<br/>&gt; &gt; with a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sonorous, reverberating thud, sufficient to draw the attention <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; even a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sleeping boxer. Kind of like how it would be to believe yourself<br/>

<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Two evenings this week Lightning and I loaded up after I got off<br/>&gt; &gt; work and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; headed out for a little after-work/before dark boxing. The first<br/>&gt; &gt; evening
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox even went with us!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; TaterTexas has been placing boxes here in Cherokee County <br/>lately and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; although they had been on the ground for a few weeks, I had not

images<br/>&gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself. We set out Wednesday evening with about an hour and a <br/>half<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; light. We quickly found Vogue in a cemetery a stone's throw from<br/>&gt; &gt; the house
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I grew up in. I loved the style of this stamp! We continued on <br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Gallatin, where we also found the first of his Winnie-the-Pooh<br/>&gt; &gt; series and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; two of the three Faith Series (one is currently missing) and 
<br/>Circle<br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hearts. Imagine - we found FIVE boxes in an hour and a half!<br/>&gt; &gt; After seeing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; his art, I'm pretty impressed that he jumped right in and <br/>started
<br/>&gt; &gt; carving<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and does it so well! I think Vogue was my fave, followed closely<br/>&gt; &gt; by Circle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of Hearts.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Even more impressive to me than finding five boxes in one 
<br/>evening,<br/>&gt; &gt; is the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; fact that I can no longer count on being first finder. Of <br/>course,<br/>&gt; &gt; I gave<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that idea up long ago when PuddleSplasher jumped my turf and<br/>
&gt; &gt; snagged the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Tour Bus, but I digress. Anyway, I got a notice that there was a<br/>&gt; &gt; new box in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my area, in fact two new ones - by JBK. Memorials to her<br/>&gt; &gt; grandparents. I
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thought to myself - Thursday evening? New boxes down Highway 79?<br/>&gt; &gt; Hmmm..PTK<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and TaterTexas on the loose? Not to mention GG? And then there <br/>IS<br/>&gt; &gt; always<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that terribly unpredictable PuddleSplasher...It started adding 
<br/>up<br/>&gt; &gt; to a sick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; day at work, but I realized I couldn't do that either because we<br/>&gt; &gt; were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; already short-handed. I guess I should've had the wherewithal to
<br/>&gt; &gt; get up and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; get 'em BEFORE work, but I didn't! I collected Lightning from <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; house<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; immediately after I got off and we went straight to the two new
<br/>&gt; &gt; boxes, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sure enough, PTK had already hit them. Drats!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I had ambitions of getting six more boxes by PTK, but before I <br/>got<br/>&gt; &gt; to New<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Summerfield, Fearless Fox called me and invited me to go see On
<br/>&gt; &gt; Golden Pond<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at the local civic theatre. It was an awfully nice evening to be<br/>&gt; &gt; outdoors,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but the play was enticing too, and since it WAS our <br/>anniversary, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; agreed to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; go. We made plans to meet at the house and head to Rusk for the<br/>&gt; &gt; play (and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for the record, the stage version of On Golden Pond is <br/>hilariously<br/>&gt; &gt; funny and
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; poignant, all at the same time. It's easy to make me laugh, but<br/>&gt; &gt; hard to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; make me cry. This play did both). ANWAY, I realized I would have<br/>&gt; &gt; to cut my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing a little short then, so we went on to New 
<br/>Summerfield<br/>&gt; &gt; and got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; PTK's Anniversary box then called it off and headed home. I<br/>&gt; &gt; thought it was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; especially cool to get her Anniversary box ON my own <br/>
anniversary!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On a side note - did y'all realize that the appropriate gift <br/>for a<br/>&gt; &gt; 22nd<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anniversary is floor tile? That's what Fearless Fox told me and 
<br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; put his<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; money where his mouth is, so surely that must be correct! Either<br/>&gt; &gt; that or I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; got hoodwinked into a heck of a lot of hard work!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, I was planning to head out to Scout Camp today to <br/>scope<br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hiding places for the 15 boxes I'll be planting for our scout<br/>&gt; &gt; event. I was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; going with She Who Reads, who had to participate in a camp
<br/>&gt; &gt; inspection. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had pulled down several boxes to find on our way home, along <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; the ones I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't able to get to last night, but alas, I woke up and it is
<br/>&gt; &gt; raining.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Raining. Raining. Raining. There was no need for me to go to<br/>&gt; &gt; camp, so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sent her along without me, although Lightning opted to go with<br/>&gt; &gt; her. He's
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; gonne come home like a muddy dog. I just know it!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT - if the weather were to clear even a little bit, I might <br/>have<br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; venture out for the Lake Striker boxes and my first glimpse of 
<br/>PTK's<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand-carving!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm really glad to have been a part of the old days when<br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxing life<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was hard to come by, but it sure is nice having folks around to
<br/>&gt; &gt; play with,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and especially nice to have a healthy backlog of boxes to find!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
