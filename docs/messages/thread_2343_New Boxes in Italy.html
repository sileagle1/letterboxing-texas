and that we planted two new boxes over there.  I placed Spaghetti <br/>
Western and Lone Star Quilter planted Morning Star. That makes 5 boxes <br/>
in Italy, just in case you are headed that way (hint to Runs for <br/>
Chocolate).<br/>

the husband taught himself how to drive a standard.  Our poor car received

for my life, are probably still there!</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are brave souls.  Italian drivers are just crazy!  Our daughter <br/>
and son-in-law did all the driving and they have gotten very good at <br/>
it, but even so, we knocked off a couple of mirrors on the narrow <br/>
streets.  But, saying that, driving a car offers a lot more freedom <br/>
and the opportunity to see the REAL Italy by going places the <br/>
tourists don't go.  You couldn't get to any of the letterboxes by <br/>
riding the train, except maybe the one in Pompeii.  These boxes are <br/>
all in great locations and worth finding.  The one called "Old World <br/>
Charm" is in a small medieval village on the top of a mountain and <br/>
the town and the view are spectacular.  Good luck and have fun!  <br/>
I'll try to post a few pictures today.<br/>
