                    <html><body><div>KC did a great rendition of Ticket to Ride, and I frankly liked her version much better than the Beatles - she made it sound like she had lived it.  Of course, I felt that way about most of the Carpenters' music.  I confess - I am a huge Carpenters fan, but an even bigger John Denver fan.  AND I STILL AM A FAN OF BOTH!  
<br/> </div>
<div>When I first began learning to play the guitar, I broke out mostly on gospel music, but I also got a Carpenters songbook, a John Denver songbook, and an Olivian Newton John book and I learned many of the songs out of all three.  ONJ never quite fit me, although I loved her music.  I eventually got several more JD songbooks and I can sing and play most of his songs by heart, even now.  BUT - when I really want to get soulful with some good music and my guitar, I go Carpenters.  My current genre that I am exploring is folk music and I find I can really wallow down into it too!  The Dreamsicles are awesome...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My family had land and a greenhouse/landscaping business as I was growing up and we had a fertilizer salesman who worked our area one day a week.  He set himself up with a little travel trailer on a piece of our land and when he hit town, he would come up to the house with his guitar and he taught me how to play honky-tonk and I taught him how to play JD.  We would jam until the wee hours of the morning when he was in town.  When I was 18 or 19, he got me an audition and a virtually guaranteed gig for me to go and play and travel with an Oklahoma bar band who needed a guitar player and vocalist.  I never had the nerve to do it because I just knew my mother would have a cow.  The issues were 1) I wouldn't be in college, 2) I wouldn't be in church, 3) I WOULD be in bars, and 3) I'd be traveling with a bunch of guys.  That's one of those paths not taken that I DO regret.  I can still play a heck of a Folsom Prison Blues though...

<div>Omigosh! I love that song. My Nany (mother's mother) had the Carpenter's Best Hits Album (for all of you younguns, that's the big black thing that we put on top of a stereo and this arm with a needle, no good for carving, and it would turn around and play music. And sometimes, if they got scratched, we melted them over a can and make a beautiful bowl out of them). Where was I? Oh, yeah, the Carpenter's. So, when I would spend the night, which was all the time, because I was the only GD and we had a most special bond,  on Saturday mornings I would play that album over and over again and sing to it because the album had the words in a cool pamplet. Heavy sigh. Those were the best of times. I really miss my Nany. She would have loved the idea of letterboxing and she would've been an awesome carver and her logbooks would make you say, "Wow".

<div>Thanks for bringing back a great memory. I've got to google that album and see if I can buy the cd (if they have one, which I doubt) or the cassette at least. Do I even have a cassette player that works? Anyone have an 8 track I can borrow?

AND I STILL AM A FAN OF BOTH! <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; When I first began learning to play the guitar, I broke out <br/>mostly on gospel music, but I also got a Carpenters songbook, a John <br/>Denver songbook, and an Olivian Newton John book and I learned many <br/>of the songs out of all three. ONJ never quite fit me, although I <br/>loved her music. I eventually got several more JD songbooks and I <br/>can sing and play most of his songs by heart, even now. BUT - when I <br/>really want to get soulful with some good music and my guitar, I go <br/>Carpenters. My
 current genre that I am exploring is folk music and I <br/>find I can really wallow down into it too! The Dreamsicles are <br/>awesome... <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My family had land and a greenhouse/landscap<wbr/>ing business as I was <br/>growing up and we had a fertilizer salesman who worked our area one <br/>day a week. He set himself up with a little travel trailer on a <br/>piece of our land and when he hit town, he would come up to the house <br/>with his guitar and he taught me how to play honky-tonk and I taught <br/>him how to play JD. We would jam until the wee hours of the morning <br/>when he was in town. When I was 18 or 19, he got me an audition and <br/>a virtually guaranteed gig for me to go and play and travel with an <br/>Oklahoma bar band who needed a guitar player and vocalist. I never <br/>had the nerve to do it because I just knew my mother would have a <br/>cow. The issues were 1) I wouldn't be in college, 2) I wouldn't be <br/>in church, 3) I WOULD be in bars, and 3)
 I'd be traveling with a <br/>bunch of guys. That's one of those paths not taken that I DO <br/>regret. I can still play a heck of a Folsom Prison Blues though... <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; On 5/8/07, Carolyn Ramirez &lt;danielcgarcia@<wbr/>...&gt; wrote: <br/>I was the biggest Carpenter's fan (probably because that was my last <br/>name!) and I don't remember them doing this song... but I do remember <br/>the Beatles doing it!
