<div>I have been staying in the garage the last few evenings working at my workbench.  When I first started letterboxing, I kept the original artwork for every stamp I carved (why did I stop doing that?  It was such a good idea).  I came across the artwork for my box at Fairfield - that whole thing makes me really sad all over again.  I wonder if it's been long enough that we can hit them up about their policies...<br/>

                    <html><body><div>I wound up staying in my garage today.  Tuesdays are cheap nights at our theatre, so I'll try to go then.  It was just too pretty a day to stay indoors.  Fearless Fox is really puzzled by this garage thing.   He would come traipsing to the door, open it, and peer around the corner at me for a minute, then leave.  He finally stuck around awhile and we decided that if we can get a portable building to store all the scout stuff we have, we'll clean the garage up and make it a studio for us both instead of storage/garagey type stuff.  Soooo - if anyone knows of someone in the eastern half of the state who wants to get rid of a storage building, let me know!</div>
