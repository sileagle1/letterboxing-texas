<div>Can I ask you why you feel the need to "drum up" letterboxing business and "get the word out"? Why can't you just let it happen naturally? And if it doesn't, then so be it. </div>
<div>This hobby used to have a very underground and kind of secret, special quality that made it just that..... "special". The more people that are drummed up by artifical means, the less special it is going to become. I know you mean well, but sometimes more is not better and sometimes leaving well enough *is*. Or at least this is my opinion, and the opinion of a lot of people I know. Making this hobby more and more mainstream is going (actually already has) result in more and more missing and vandalized boxes, poor rehiding of boxes by people that do it for a few weekends and lose interest and move on to another hobby. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't mean to attack you and I hope it doesn't come across like that, but this is just such a unique and special hobby that I dread seeing it ruined. People stumble into doing it all the time, by accident, by simple word of mouth, friend to friend, finding boxes by accident, and I think this is enough. </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course, we all had to find out about it some way.  You'll get some<br>
skepticism from many letterboxers about whether to introduce others to<br>
the hobby, because we've seen the damage that short-termers can do. <br>
You want people who are going to enjoy letterboxing, respect the<br>
environment and others' efforts and in their own way contribute something.<br>
<br>
Press publicity can be dangerous to the health of area letterboxers. <br>
I would suggest introducing a few like-minded friends to the hobby and<br>
really stressing to them the importance of few key things like<br>
DISCRETION and REHIDING WELL.  To be honest, though, we have sorta had<br>
limited success with this approach--most of our family and friends<br>
think we're weird.  But they probably already thought that anyway!  <br>
<br>
Another approach that I think works well is to always answer your<br>
contact the placer emails.  Build bridges with those who show an<br>
interest.  Encourage new letterboxers to get more hooked in, through<br>
this list, or AtlasQuest, etc.  By doing this, you can encourage the<br>
participation of those who have a natural interest and are in your<br>
area.  And perhaps they will become the hiders of great boxes for you<br>
to find.  It was directly due to the encouragement of some local<br>
letterboxers that led to our placing our first box and getting hooked<br>
on that part of the game too.  Now we have some great friends who we<br>
enjoy letterboxing with!<br>

<div>That's not my attitude either. I guess you missed this part of the note.  I have no desire to keep it a secret, but I'm content with  people finding out about it on their own instead running around and shouting about it all the time.  I don't think it is a shouting about kind of hobby. </div>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm a member of this list because I was born and raised in Texas and used to have a couple of boxes there until they went missing. Now I only have one as part of an exchange. I live in New York City and there are next to no boxers here and very few boxes in comparison to other areas. But so far it's been almost a year and a half and I haven't lost interest yet. I get out of the city and go boxing when I can and have planted several urban boxes here, which I will continue to do.  I go to events. I have two traveling event boxes. </div>

*****While I see June's point of view, I really relate<br>
to Mike's...  When I first began boxing two years ago,<br>
there were precious few boxes within an hour's drive<br>
from me, and every one of them was by Silver Eagle and<br>
Baby Bear.  Thank goodness for them!  Further, for<br>
over a year I was, to my knowledge, the only<br>
letterboxer anywhere in Northeast Texas (no new boxes<br>
being planted by others and no entries by anyone else<br>
in existing boxes).  Thankfully, I heard Silver<br>
Eagle's and Baby Bear's story early on and was<br>
encouraged by the fact that they had stuck with it<br>
when there weren't but a handful of letterboxers and<br>
boxes in the whole state!  So I planted...<br>
<br>
So how did there come to be more boxes and more boxers<br>
in my area?  Interestingly, it came through media<br>
coverage.  A local reporter contacted the placers of<br>
boxes in my county and she netted Silver Eagle, Baby<br>
Bear, and me.  I can't remember if Baby Bear opted not<br>
to be interviewed or if he and the reporter just<br>
couldn't ever connect, but Silver Eagle and I wound up<br>
talking to her.  Before we did though, we talked<br>
between ourselves about what needed to be emphasized<br>
and what needed not to be disclosed.  We stressed to<br>
her not to publish clues in her article, but that she<br>
could publish the website.  I let her go with us while<br>
we planted a box right in town for the purpose of the<br>
article.  The clues were purposely cryptic, so that<br>
anyone who was half-hearted would probably not get it.<br>
 We also emphasized the need for discretion and<br>
respect of property, including boxes.  She graciously<br>
honored our requests, and while the article had a few<br>
flaws, she respected the points we insisted upon.  <br>
<br>
The net result of the article was TXLuvBug, among<br>
others.  She became a prolific placer and a diligent<br>
finder.  Others who flowed either directly or<br>
indirectly from that article are Blue Butterfly and<br>
Lucy Locket.  As you probably know, they are also<br>
eager letterboxers who have cast the circle of boxes<br>
out a little wider still.  For each of them, I am<br>
thankful.  <br>
<br>
Do I think news media is the answer?  While it sure<br>
helped letterboxing in my area, I have to admit I'm<br>
still very leery.  I had an equally bad experience<br>
with media coverage in another group I belong to -<br>
same paper, different reporter, but the reporter was<br>
ham-handed with the information he got from me and the<br>
result was some pretty cruddy new members.  If you<br>
pursue media coverage, be very clear about what you<br>
expect to get from it and maintain control over the<br>
process.  Research the reporter and figure out if<br>
their style is really what you think will serve your<br>
purpose.  And if you find a reporter who bites, don't<br>
get excited and give up the whole ball of wax (you<br>
know, the "auction" reflex).  Leave a little on the<br>
table so that anyone interested still has to do a<br>
little research to find us.<br>
<br>
While I understand being lonely and wanting more<br>
letterboxers in an area, I still firmly believe that<br>
we are all better off being box-lonely than being in<br>
the company of careless fools.  In my opinion,<br>
letterboxers are high level individuals - on the<br>
whole, we have a wide array of interests and we have a<br>
keenly developed sense of a big game.  Think about it<br>
- how many folks in the general population have all<br>
the characteristics of a letterboxer:  are up for<br>
clue-solving, like the outdoors, have an eye for<br>
detail, are creative thinkers, are technologically<br>
capable, and hopefully have a small amount of artistic<br>
bent?<br>
<br>
If I were to look for other ways to promote<br>
letterboxing, I would think of groups that exhibit at<br>
least a couple of those traits, which is why Mike's<br>
plan of planting hybrids may just work.  You could<br>
also offer to hold a class at a nearby<br>
park/library/bookstore on boxing (but if I did that, I<br>
would plant a series for the purpose so you aren't<br>
giving up real boxes to people who may not "get it"). <br>
Talk to orienteering groups.  But even so, be cautious<br>
and don't give away the whole game by revealing real<br>
boxes without at least warning the placer.<br>
<br>
Besides that, I really encourage you to take the Baby<br>
Bear/Silver Eagle approach and plant, plant, plant. <br>
That way, when someone starts sniffing around, there<br>
are boxes for them to find and hopefully you can hook<br>
'em before they lose interest.<br>
<br>
But I'm not sure if lack of boxes is the motivation of<br>
Sandy's question...<br>

<div>Two things that are close to my heart are letterboxing and the Appalachian Trail. Last year while in CT, I went in search of a box that had been placed on the Trail. After a long, wonderful hike, I came to the area where the box was hidden. Leading away from the main trail, an obvious social trail had developed to the site of the box due to many visits. When I opened the logbook, I found that it had been FILLED with messages from a youth group, telling me that Jesus loves me, quoting scriptures, and messages about who had crushes on whom, along with a couple of store bought stamps. Now that's great and all.... needless to say I was thrilled to read that Jesus loves me, because I was hoping He did, but reading that in a logbook of a letterbox just confirmed it for me. Sorry... my tongue is caught in my cheek a bit. I do feel that this group had good intentions, but they did ruin the logbook by filling it with personal messages. New letterboxers do need instruction on the aspects of letterboxing from how to appropriately stamp into a box, rehide it, as well as respect for the environment.  I do worry that too much <em>general</em> publicity about the sport may attract many "casual" boxers which can be bad for the sport as well as harmful to the boxes. One of the major concerns of the officials in most parks and nature areas is that social trails start to develop to the boxes that eventually harm the environment. To quote Dewberry, we all had to find out about it some way, and I actually did first learn of letterboxing from an article in a newspaper in Connecticut, looked it up the website and ran willy-nilly into the forest. I've introduced family and friends to letterboxing, and they in turn have introduced family and friends and so on. I would conservatively estimate that I am responsible for hundreds of very good letterboxers that have learned of the sport from me or from those that I've introduced to boxing. I do feel that personally introducing people to letterboxing is the best way to cultivate and nurture the sport.</div></div>

It isn't the lack of boxes that disturbs me, as much as the lack of finders. It is frustrating to plant a box and have its log stamped a few times, knowing that those finders are the only "regulars" in your area. I feel like I could leave the box there for 5 years and only end up with a handful of stamps. I may sound impatient...I'm not.

also agree, that's the best way to interest people appropriately in this 
activity.  It seems to me (who has been letterboxing now for just over a 
year) that the number of local boxers has almost exploded - when I first 
discovered Texas letterboxing (after first doing a little bit of CT boxing with 
my sister) and checked the LBNA list for Tarrant Co. and Dallas Co. and all 
the surrounding counties, too, there were very few boxes, and most of them were 
planted by either Kantexan in Tarrant Co. or Celtic Lions in Dallas Co., and I 
got to as many of these as quickly as I could and was completely hooked.  
Almost immediately I began planning my own boxes and when I received those first 
emails from finders, I was thrilled!  I've noticed that within this past 
year, there seem to be many new boxers, or recently relocated experienced 
boxers, in this vicinity, and most seem willing to travel across the state if 
necessary to find good boxes.  Since I've visited your boxes and know what 
good locations and great stamps you've got, I'm sure they'll find many more 
visitors, but it may take awhile.  There seem to be periods of low activity 
and spurts of heavy boxing (I've had to replace a few smaller logbooks on about 
6 of my boxes in pretty good locations).  I've inspired a boxer or two - or 
three - to begin this activity when it came up in conversation (because I'd just 
come from finding boxes and had my logbook and was eager to show it),  or 
they overheard me talking about things like "Gryphon Bait" and "Beignet-Eating 
Aliens" and solving mystery clues and being First Finder and how exciting that 
was, and their interest was provoked to the point they pursued more information 
on the website and became intrepid boxers, adding to the game.  So I agree 
-- all this to say, keep putting those good stamps in interesting locations and 
posting those clues and be patient.  If you plant it, they will come, 
eventually from far and wide.  I might also say that if you want more 
widespread participation, you might check into PLBs - they travel everywhere and 
get a variety of stamps, but you don't get to go out and find them!
