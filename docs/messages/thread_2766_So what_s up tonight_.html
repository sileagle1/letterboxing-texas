<div>This site is really cool. I just got home from a date with my daughters - went to the movies. Now I'm going to be up all night reading about all the interesting folks buried in Texas. Thanks a lot, Lucy, for a sleepless night.</div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And SJZ just called and we talked on the phone until our cell phones both died.  Do you know - my husband had the nerve to say it isn't my job to tell her how to run her life?  I was NOT telling her how to run her life.  I was comiserating with her about difficult coworkers.  And we were laughing about him and what a bad patient he is.  And about Lightning, who got a motorcycle helmet today and wore it all day long and I kept whacking him in the head with the broomstick and he liked it.  If they weren't such easy fodder, I'd have to resort to telling her how to run her life.  I so enjoy her being out of the house, but it is nice when she calls and has time to just hang out on the phone.  Gotta lobby for longer batteries.

And, yes, I did notice that.  Also, it's interesting to just look at <br/>
some of the cemetery names.  There's one in Navarro County <br/>
called "Crybaby Cemetery".  There's got to be a sad story there.<br/>
I've found six different cemeteries named "Oakwood" with twelve <br/>
former governors interred in them.  That's a letterbox series in <br/>

&gt; The Corsicana and Palestine ones were the ones I was wondering <br/>

Corsicana???<br/>
&gt; It's kind of like Oak Grove Cemetery in Nacogdoches.<br/>

&gt; I have a GC'er friend who bases out of Palestine.  He probably <br/>

one in<br/>
