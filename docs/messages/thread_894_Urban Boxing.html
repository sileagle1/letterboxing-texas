<br/>
We were in Cleveland (Ohio) visiting good friends and I decided I  <br/>
wanted to plant a box at the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame downtown. So, I  <br/>
checked LBNA and Atlas Quest but didn't see that any were there. Then  <br/>
I checked with a Cleveland area boxer to confirm and they mentioned  <br/>
something to the effect of 'it might be hard to put one there, it is  <br/>
a very urban location'. Well, this made me laugh. When I think of the  <br/>
urban boxes in Houston and Dallas alone, I figure we can urban box  <br/>
with the best of them! LOL<br/>
<br/>
I ended up placing the box right out in front of the entrance in the  <br/>
ever-present flower bed.<br/>
<br/>
It had a first finder within a week. Yeah! Success!<br/>
