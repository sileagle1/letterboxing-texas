be a little leery of meeting us in person, but if you want to attend <br>
TALE5, I think you will have fun.  There will be demos on carving and <br>
discussions on the pros and cons of box placement, so it can be a <br>
learning experience, too.  There are already several people planning <br>
on attending that have never been to a TX LB Event, so why not join <br>
us?  I will include links to it at the end of this post.  <br>
<br>
As far as carving quality goes, practice does help, and you will be <br>
amazed how much better you will get.  However, some people will be <br>
better carvers than others no matter how much practice is involved, a <br>
fact I have learned to live with.  I am no artist and will never be <br>
great at carving, but I carve well enough to please myself and I <br>
enjoy doing it, so that is good enough for me.<br>

I suggest looking at previous messages, Files and Photos to get a flavor of what goes on here.  It should be entertaining and possibly helpful.<br>
