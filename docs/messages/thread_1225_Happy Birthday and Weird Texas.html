                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
First, Happy Birthday , Baby Bear.  Even though this will make you <br>
blush as a guy, I still think your personal stamp is the CUTEST I have <br>
ever seen!<br>
<br>
On another note, if you guys haven't been to a book store lately, <br>
there is a new book out by the two Marks on TV that have that Weird <br>
U.S. show called Weird Texas!<br>
I bought it two days ago and can't put it down.  I think practically <br>
every place mentioned in the book is just screaming for a letterbox!  <br>
Ruby Tuesday will even chuckle when she sees the page dedicated to <br>
Goff's Hamburgers and the Lenin statue!  There are quirky things in <br>
there from all over the state.  Now I finally know what the Houston <br>
boxers were talking about when they mentioned the Orange Show.<br>
<br>
Staying out of the heat and yearning for more box-friendly weather!<br>
