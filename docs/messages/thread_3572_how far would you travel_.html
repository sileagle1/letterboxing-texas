<div>When I first started

various stops along the way just to look for letterboxes.  I am still

<div>Now which far away 
boxes call my name?  If I could figure out how to swing it I would love to 
go to New Mexico to search out some Astro D and Lionsmane boxes.  And I 
know someday I will figure out how to make the trip to Midland for Boots Tex's 
"Homerun that Never Was", still the best baseball story I have ever read, and a 
box I would love to find.  MO5</div></body></html>
