                    <html><body><div>Hi, I'm Janet (from Bedford). I have already posted a couple of posts. I think I was reading my emails upside down. The one inviting me to the group was at the bottom. It says to introduce myself. My family's trail name is Blooming Flowers (our last name is Flowers). Husband 40, daughter 5, and me (not telling). We went out this weekend. Our feet are killing us, but we had a blast. Our 20 and 22 year old daughters went with us at separate times. </div> <div> </div> <div>I was the one who discovered Letterboxing from Family Fun Magazine. What a way to spend time with your family, get exercise and learn about the country all in one fell swoop. Sign me up!</div> <div> </div> <div>Oh, and my favorite color is periwinkle. (They said to include that in the introduction).</div> <div> </div> <div>Happy Hunting! </div><p>
