                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back from a trip to West Texas (for a family wedding), <br>
but had to take the opportunity to do some letterboxing on the way <br>
back.  But first, I posted some pictures on this site of our <br>
letterboxing in Italy trip.  For more, better pictures of that trip, <br>
go to the following blog:<br>

<br>
This site belongs to our daughter, known in letterboxing as "Flash <br>
Dreamer", who lives in Naples.  She recently placed two boxes of her <br>
own in Italy called "On the Rim" and "Old World Charm".  Check them <br>
out.  She is a great photographer and gives letterboxing a nice plug <br>
on her blog.<br>
<br>
We picked a few of El Lobo's boxes in the outer reaches of West <br>
Texas, then went to San Angelo for the two boxes placed there by <br>
Runs For Chocolate.  Then, we went to the Hill Country and found the <br>
boxes in Kerrville, Hunt and Lost Maples.  We got the one <br>
called "Here Everything's Better", then went to Uvalde to get that <br>
one there and spend the night.  We got up and headed for Garner <br>
State Park, only to find that it is closed for hunting.  What a <br>
bummer that was!  I let the poor ranger know that I was not a happy <br>
camper (couldn't have camped if I had wanted to), for all the good <br>
it did.  There are about six active boxes there, but that's a long <br>
way to go to find the park closed, so if you are heading that way, <br>
you should probably check first.  Lost Maples is spectacular, even <br>
if it's a little late for the turning of the leaves.  We made the <br>
entire 4.9 mile trek up the side of the mountain, and it was worth <br>
it.  We replaced a couple of boxes along the way and a couple of <br>
others have condition problems, which I'll pass on to the owners of <br>
the box.<br>
<br>
Be sure to check out Flash Dreamer's blog.  You'll have to copy and <br>
paste since the link isn't actove for some reason.<br>

Happy Letterboxing, Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br>
