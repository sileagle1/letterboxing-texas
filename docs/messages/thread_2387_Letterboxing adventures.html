This site belongs to our daughter, known in letterboxing as "Flash <br/>
Dreamer", who lives in Naples.  She recently placed two boxes of her <br/>
own in Italy called "On the Rim" and "Old World Charm".  Check them <br/>
out.  She is a great photographer and gives letterboxing a nice plug <br/>
on her blog.<br/>
<br/>
We picked a few of El Lobo's boxes in the outer reaches of West <br/>
Texas, then went to San Angelo for the two boxes placed there by <br/>
Runs For Chocolate.  Then, we went to the Hill Country and found the <br/>
boxes in Kerrville, Hunt and Lost Maples.  We got the one <br/>
called "Here Everything's Better", then went to Uvalde to get that <br/>
one there and spend the night.  We got up and headed for Garner <br/>
State Park, only to find that it is closed for hunting.  What a <br/>
bummer that was!  I let the poor ranger know that I was not a happy <br/>
camper (couldn't have camped if I had wanted to), for all the good <br/>
it did.  There are about six active boxes there, but that's a long <br/>
way to go to find the park closed, so if you are heading that way, <br/>
you should probably check first.  Lost Maples is spectacular, even <br/>
if it's a little late for the turning of the leaves.  We made the <br/>
entire 4.9 mile trek up the side of the mountain, and it was worth <br/>
it.  We replaced a couple of boxes along the way and a couple of <br/>
others have condition problems, which I'll pass on to the owners of <br/>
the box.<br/>
<br/>
Be sure to check out Flash Dreamer's blog.  You'll have to copy and <br/>
paste since the link isn't actove for some reason.<br/>
