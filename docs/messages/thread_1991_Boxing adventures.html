<div>Lucy, I loved your story.  Funny how that happens when you're just out 
innocently pursuing a nice, recreational pastime.  So far, it's happened to 
me 3 times, or almost.... First was that Taos-area letterbox last January 
-- my husband and I detoured all the way around to the Rio Grande 
Gorge to find it, only to discover the entire vicinity blocked off by police 
helicopters, cars, and way too much activity, searching for an alleged murderer 
around the gorge.  Abandoned that letterbox pursuit (drat!).  Then in 
June, while we were in Reno, there was supposed to be one near the big Reno 
sign that arches across the street by all the casinos downtown, but as we drove 
through downtown (under that sign), again, streets all blocked off with lots of 
police activity: a sniper had just shot at a judge and they were searching all 
the area - didn't stop to look around for that one, either!  And again, two 
days before the 4th of July, my sister (Puddle Splasher) and I were out doing a 
little local letterboxing and were passing the FW Botanic Gardens.  One of 
her boxes in there I haven't yet looked for, so why not stop?  Pulled in - 
police cars blocking the quick route to the box, fencing all around the 
area.  No problem, we'd go the long way.  Parked, started off: blocked 
again with signs "By order of the Fire Marshall."  Of course!  The big 
concerts in the park followed by fireworks - just didn't realize it was right 
where the letterbox is and there was, again, no way to get to it, even though 
she did offer to create a diversion for me to go in and get it if I promised to 
take a picture of her arrest.  Decided against it.  So that makes 3, 
count 'em, 3 close encounters with police activity while just trying to find 
Tupperware in the great outdoors (or city).  </div></body></html>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="161031322-13072006">Drat - you folks get ALL the fun.  I miss the days 
of a swift NOE helicopter ride in.  You feel the nose come up hard and you 
squash down in the seat from the increased G-force.  You know what is 
coming, so you pop the safety belt off, then you pop the safety of your M-16 
off.  As the nose comes level again, out you go ready to take on whatever 
stands in the way to your objective.  I miss the rush !!!!!  Had that 
stuff happened to me, I would have volunteered to assist the snipers!
