<div>Just thought I would 
let you all know that Dewberry has solved and found my "Fairy Talk" box (what a 
surprise, that she would be the first solver, I know!) actually, she solved it 
long ago, but has now actually found the box.  Talk about letterboxing 
thrills....how about writing a puzzle that took Dewberry more than 10 minutes to 
solve!  (Actually, she had it figured out in less than one evening's 
time.  Guess I'll have to keep trying.)
