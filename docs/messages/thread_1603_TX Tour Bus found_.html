<div>We didn't think that Bus would sit out there for very long before some 
really avid boxer went for it, but I was thinking maybe a day or two!  Wow, 
you must have been up and out pretty early this morning.  I doubt you 
actually "stumbled" across it, unless you normally jog uphill over rocks and 
leap over logs lying in the woods and dislodge piles of debris, but then, some 
of those trail runners out there ARE pretty crazed!   We had the 
same concerns about carrying that oversized camo-covered box for a mile along 
that trail, so we hid it in a large backpack.  I don't think we could have 
disguised it under a jacket - you must have longer arms than either of us!  
Good work, and have fun reading that great logbook and playing with all those 
cool stamps! -- Still laughing,  Viewfinder</div></font></body></html>

<div>Thanks for the compliments, PQuest - that is a great trail, great views, 
but some of those bike-portage places are a little rough (I only walk them, I 
don't bike them!).  Glad you enjoyed the experience even if the bus was 
already gone, but here's the upside of that:  it will show up again soon, 
with still more passengers!  I may have to go looking for it again if it's 
in our area, just to add the newest stamps, although I wouldn't be picking it up 
to move it along again.  Well, maybe not . . . - Viewfinder.

I just <u>knew</u> they were on their way to get the Bus.  The weather was perfect and I had the best time walking along the trail.  It was so nice to be without the kiddos (although I love em), enjoying the day.  So glad you put in your clues that the trail was not stroller friendly, because we would've tried!  I knew the Bus was big, so I wore my LSS's golf pullover jacket.  Figured if I had to (!!) I could hide it under there.  My parents were so 
intrigued by what I was doing and they made me open the Bus and show them every part of it before they left.  They think I'm a little nuts, but if it makes me happy....</p>

<div>You are as obsessed as my sister, PuddleSplasher, who woke up at 3:00 a.m. 
and drove 6 hours round-trip to find it (I was in Colorado at the time, but I 
called and said, "If you aren't on the road to get that Bus, why not?!!" - only 
to find that she'd already picked it up!).  Thankfully for me - probably 
because I threatened her - she held onto it until I could add my stamp and 
passenger, also. Who else would understand this obsession but another

i just don't know how you or viewfinder or puddle splasher had the <br>
courage to go on that trail on foot.  those mountain bikers are <br>
serious about their sport and fly along those narrow, narrow <br>
trails.  then there was me, on my borrowed bike with leaky, non-<br>
treaded tires and with nothing but the front brakes being <br>
operational, trying to keep up the pace set by those fanatics.  i, <br>
however, was not in full body spandex attire.  no, i was sporting <br>
the ever in-style blue jeans and t-shirt (and my brand new running <br>
shoes for good luck).  <br>
in any case, the trail can change instantly from quiet nature spot <br>
along a nice lake full of sail boats to the loud rush of multiple <br>
bikers bearing down on you quicker than makes you comfortable.  and <br>
then they have the gall to yell at you.  now, that being my first <br>
time, i had no idea there was appropriate lingo to be used to inform <br>
other trail users to beware of, say, someone on a bike about to run <br>
you over.  i do know that i--with my cat-like reaction time--was <br>
able to respond quickly to my first 'near road kill' experience with <br>
an apt expression that let them know i was a force to be reckoned <br>
with, one that let the oncomer know i was there and that i wasn't <br>
going to budge.  i'm not sure if i remember word for word, but it <br>
approximated to:<br>
him: "BIKE UP!! ONE BACK!!"<br>
me: "OH GOD, PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!"<br>
i think it might have intimidated him...well, i mean, he gave me a <br>
weird look as he went by.<br>
in the end, viewfinder has given me perspective: i can happily wait <br>
for the bus to reappear with even more passengers on it.  maybe, <br>
when i eventually get it, i'll put it three hours out of town to see <br>
who else has the fever.<br>

<div>P Quest - love your story!  My first near-death experience with 
an unexpected biker from nowhere on that trail was in one of those places where 
the trail deeps suddenly and steeply and you can't see them coming over the hill 
until they're on you - the biker yelled his warning and I jumped (off the trail 
thankfully) and in my surprise yelled something referring to the Deity, which 
probably surprised the biker even more.  He probably wasn't used to being 
called something like Lord, only not exactly that.  But lots of people 
DO walk that trail, with or without dogs, kids, even carrying picnics sometimes, 
but you have to watch out for the bikes.  Weekends are busiest, though, but 
during the week there's often almost no one out there.  Nice and quiet, can 
hear the waves and the birds.  </div></font></body></html>

<div>Great story! Having hiked that trail going back about eight years, I've noticed the bike traffic has really picked up on it. I don't know why - maybe it's because the trail up Mt Everest is getting too crowded. Most of the bikers are great about yelling "on your left" or "bike" or some warning so you can jump off the trail, but many don't warn you making it a much more fun sport! My favorite way to "bike" is to put my bike on my Jeep and drive it around. If I find a good rutted dirt road, I feel like I get a particularly good workout and the tires on my bike last forever!</div>
<div>By the way - in light of the drought, I've been considering changing my trail name to "Dust Splasher" but it just doesn't seem to have the same ring.</div>

ONE BACK!!"<br/>me: "OH GOD, PLEASE DON'T HURT ME!"<br/>i think it might have intimidated him...well, i mean, he gave me a <br/>weird look as he went by.<br/>in the end, viewfinder has given me perspective: i can happily wait <br/>for the bus to reappear with even more passengers on it.  maybe, <br/>when i eventually get it, i'll put it three hours out of town to see <br/>who else has the fever.<br/><br/>p ?uest<br/><br/><br/><br/></tt></font></blockquote></body></html>

Message from Finder:<br>
alive and well.<br>
your clues were even funnier when we got there and saw<br>
what a small place reklaw is. this is where we started<br>
our all-day saturday excursion, working our way back<br>
west to the dfw area.<br>
cute stamp, and to prove the accuracy of your clues, i<br>
laid down on my back in the road by the park and sang<br>
the abc's. no one was even out in a car to run me<br>
over, let alone outside to even HEAR my beautiful<br>
rendition of that classic.<br>

**************<br>
<br>
Now bear in mind, we've passed by this box every day<br>
for the past four days and every time we drive by, we<br>
speculate about that nut (no offense p ?uest) that<br>
laid in the street and sang at our box!<br>
