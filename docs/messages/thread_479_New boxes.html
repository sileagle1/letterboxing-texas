                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, boxers,<br>
<br>
We just wanted y'all to know that we planted some new letterboxes <br>
today, so check the clues before you leave for the Great Book <br>
Gathering this weekend.  We placed two in Burroughs Park.  They're <br>
called "America's Storyteller" and "Elm Creek Quilts - Quilt Block <br>
Series" (yes, it's based on a series of books, well known in the <br>
quilting world).<br>
<br>
While we were in that neck of the woods, we also placed a couple in <br>
Telge Park just for fun.  They're called "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" <br>
and "Stingy Jack".<br>
<br>
All four boxes are listed on Atlas Quest and LbNA.  By the way, <br>
Burroughs Park is in very good condition considering all the rain, <br>
but Telge Park is WET! In some places the paths are underwater and <br>
difficult to get through unless you don't mind wading.  This was our <br>
first time in the park.  Is there a trail next to the creek on the <br>
park side?  Some of the box clues seemed to indicate that.  If so, <br>
it is under several feet of water.<br>
<br>
If you are familiar with the location of the Frye Team's box "A True <br>
Goblin", the water in the creek was within a couple of feet of the <br>
three pine trees.  The box was safe and dry, but exposed and about <br>
to slip down the slope to the creek.<br>
<br>
We also saw what we hope was a King snake.  There are no Coral <br>
snakes in this area, right?  I forgot how to tell the difference.<br>

the same one as "A True Goblin" is located on.  Glad to hear the box <br>
is safe.  We found it full of water last weekend, and brought the <br>
logbook home to dry out since it was completedly soaked, pages <br>
sticking together, etc.   While we recovered it well, I guess the rain <br>
and runoff must have uncovered it.  Has anyone heard from Frye Team <br>
lately?  We tried to contact them about the logbook, but haven't heard <br>
back.<br>
<br>
Just a note of caution to anyone who might be visiting Telge near dusk.<br>
While at the park we helped a woman catch her dog that was making a <br>
break for freedom.  She told us that she had seen some very large <br>
wolves down by the creek the night before.  Of course, that didn't <br>
stop me from finding "just one more box" right at dusk!<br>

<p>The other "good" thing about coral snakes is that they don't have a hinged 
  jaw  - they have to latch on to a small appendage like a finger or a 
  toe.  Cottonmouths, rattlesnakes, and water moccasins all have the hinged 
  jaw and can strike on a leg or arm which, along with a more aggressive nature, 
  makes them a greater risk.  <br/><br/>

<p>I saw a coral snake in Memorial Park about a month ago. It was a 
    true<br/>coral snake. They are very non-agressive, and he ran off when 
    I<br/>yelled "get back." Not like the cottonmouth we saw up in

    me. <br/><br/>Telge floods. Usually in the spring though. But these rains

for me.  Very generous, and I thank her very much.  The box, by the <br>
way, is called "Old Leathercoat", as was the Texas governor that the <br>
box honors.  The box is posted, so you can look it up if you want to <br>
know the gentleman's name.  We headed east from where we live to a <br>
spot east of Livingston, where we placed two new boxes.  Mine is <br>
called "The Alabama-Coushatta" for lack of a better name and honors <br>
the Indian Tribe of that name.  Lone Star Quilter placed a box <br>
called "Indian Chief - Quilt Block Series", and it has one of her <br>
lovely little quilt blocks in the box waiting for the first finder.  <br>
I intended to plant another governor box in Tyler County, which <br>
desperately needs more boxes, but couldn't find an appropriate <br>
place, so decided to do more research.  This gentleman, like many <br>
other Texas governors (deceased ones), is buried in the State <br>
Cemetery in Austin and I'm not sure I can hide letterboxes there, <br>
having never been in that particular cemetery.  Has anyone been <br>
there who could advise me regarding letterbox placement?  My thought <br>
is that, if they are there, I'll find a place in their hometown, but <br>
my experience today was frustrating.  Anyway, keep tuned for more <br>
governors in the future.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good job!  I have updated the map in the Files section but will <br>
probably wait to notify the webmasters about updating the TX Clue map <br>
since they just updated it recently.<br>
<br>
For those that don't know, a couple of years ago the TX Clue map on <br>
LBNA was updated by the webmasters to show counties with letterboxes <br>
colored in green.  We took up the challenge to populate the "virgin" <br>
counties, thus coloring the whole state green.  I created a map <br>
showing our progress and put it in the Files section of this list.  <br>
When letterboxers place boxes in virgin counties, they let me know <br>
(or post to the List) and I update the map.  Then every 6 months or <br>
so I send an updated map to the webmasters so they can update the TX <br>
clue map on LBNA.  Right now the TX Clue map accurately reflects <br>
counties that have boxes, except for these 4 new ones.  However, I <br>
noticed that 4 counties that used to have boxes are no longer colored <br>
because those boxes were removed from LBNA.  They are:  Foard in <br>
North Region, Lee in Central Region, Live Oak in South Region, and <br>
Dawson in Panhandle.  Even though I show them colored in my map, they <br>
will have to be repopulated before they can be colored on the <br>
official TX Clue map.<br>
<br>
As you can see, we have come a long way since we started this goal <br>
back in December, 2006, and hopefully we can complete the Central <br>
Region before the end of this year.  If someone can repopulate Lee <br>
county, I hope to get to Kinney in a month or so.  Keep those boxes <br>
coming!<br>
