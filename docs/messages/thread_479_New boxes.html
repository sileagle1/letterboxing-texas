<br/>
We just wanted y'all to know that we planted some new letterboxes <br/>
today, so check the clues before you leave for the Great Book <br/>
Gathering this weekend.  We placed two in Burroughs Park.  They're <br/>
called "America's Storyteller" and "Elm Creek Quilts - Quilt Block <br/>
Series" (yes, it's based on a series of books, well known in the <br/>
quilting world).<br/>
<br/>
While we were in that neck of the woods, we also placed a couple in <br/>
Telge Park just for fun.  They're called "Legend of Sleepy Hollow" <br/>
and "Stingy Jack".<br/>
<br/>
All four boxes are listed on Atlas Quest and LbNA.  By the way, <br/>
Burroughs Park is in very good condition considering all the rain, <br/>
but Telge Park is WET! In some places the paths are underwater and <br/>
difficult to get through unless you don't mind wading.  This was our <br/>
first time in the park.  Is there a trail next to the creek on the <br/>
park side?  Some of the box clues seemed to indicate that.  If so, <br/>
it is under several feet of water.<br/>
<br/>
If you are familiar with the location of the Frye Team's box "A True <br/>
Goblin", the water in the creek was within a couple of feet of the <br/>
three pine trees.  The box was safe and dry, but exposed and about <br/>
to slip down the slope to the creek.<br/>
<br/>
We also saw what we hope was a King snake.  There are no Coral <br/>
snakes in this area, right?  I forgot how to tell the difference.<br/>

the same one as "A True Goblin" is located on.  Glad to hear the box <br/>
is safe.  We found it full of water last weekend, and brought the <br/>
logbook home to dry out since it was completedly soaked, pages <br/>
sticking together, etc.   While we recovered it well, I guess the rain <br/>
and runoff must have uncovered it.  Has anyone heard from Frye Team <br/>
lately?  We tried to contact them about the logbook, but haven't heard <br/>
back.<br/>
<br/>
Just a note of caution to anyone who might be visiting Telge near dusk.<br/>
While at the park we helped a woman catch her dog that was making a <br/>
break for freedom.  She told us that she had seen some very large <br/>
wolves down by the creek the night before.  Of course, that didn't <br/>
stop me from finding "just one more box" right at dusk!<br/>

<p>The other "good" thing about coral snakes is that they don't have a hinged 
  jaw  - they have to latch on to a small appendage like a finger or a 
  toe.  Cottonmouths, rattlesnakes, and water moccasins all have the hinged 
  jaw and can strike on a leg or arm which, along with a more aggressive nature, 
  makes them a greater risk.  <br/><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Seems everyone is getting out in the beautiful weather and getting <br/>
the letterboxing fever.  We were no different, except that we had a <br/>
couple of boxes to place and, where we went, none to find.  I'd like <br/>
to thank Puddle Splasher for placing one of my "Texas Governor" <br/>
boxes for me in Collin County.  That's just where it had to be and, <br/>
since I couldn't make it up right away, she volunteered to hide it <br/>
for me.  Very generous, and I thank her very much.  The box, by the <br/>
way, is called "Old Leathercoat", as was the Texas governor that the <br/>
box honors.  The box is posted, so you can look it up if you want to <br/>
know the gentleman's name.  We headed east from where we live to a <br/>
spot east of Livingston, where we placed two new boxes.  Mine is <br/>
called "The Alabama-Coushatta" for lack of a better name and honors <br/>
the Indian Tribe of that name.  Lone Star Quilter placed a box <br/>
called "Indian Chief - Quilt Block Series", and it has one of her <br/>
lovely little quilt blocks in the box waiting for the first finder.  <br/>
I intended to plant another governor box in Tyler County, which <br/>
desperately needs more boxes, but couldn't find an appropriate <br/>
place, so decided to do more research.  This gentleman, like many <br/>
other Texas governors (deceased ones), is buried in the State <br/>
Cemetery in Austin and I'm not sure I can hide letterboxes there, <br/>
having never been in that particular cemetery.  Has anyone been <br/>
there who could advise me regarding letterbox placement?  My thought <br/>
is that, if they are there, I'll find a place in their hometown, but <br/>
my experience today was frustrating.  Anyway, keep tuned for more <br/>
governors in the future.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good job!  I have updated the map in the Files section but will <br/>
probably wait to notify the webmasters about updating the TX Clue map <br/>
since they just updated it recently.<br/>
<br/>
For those that don't know, a couple of years ago the TX Clue map on <br/>
LBNA was updated by the webmasters to show counties with letterboxes <br/>
colored in green.  We took up the challenge to populate the "virgin" <br/>
counties, thus coloring the whole state green.  I created a map <br/>
showing our progress and put it in the Files section of this list.  <br/>
When letterboxers place boxes in virgin counties, they let me know <br/>
(or post to the List) and I update the map.  Then every 6 months or <br/>
so I send an updated map to the webmasters so they can update the TX <br/>
clue map on LBNA.  Right now the TX Clue map accurately reflects <br/>
counties that have boxes, except for these 4 new ones.  However, I <br/>
noticed that 4 counties that used to have boxes are no longer colored <br/>
because those boxes were removed from LBNA.  They are:  Foard in <br/>
North Region, Lee in Central Region, Live Oak in South Region, and <br/>
Dawson in Panhandle.  Even though I show them colored in my map, they <br/>
will have to be repopulated before they can be colored on the <br/>
official TX Clue map.<br/>
<br/>
As you can see, we have come a long way since we started this goal <br/>
back in December, 2006, and hopefully we can complete the Central <br/>
Region before the end of this year.  If someone can repopulate Lee <br/>
county, I hope to get to Kinney in a month or so.  Keep those boxes <br/>
coming!<br/>
