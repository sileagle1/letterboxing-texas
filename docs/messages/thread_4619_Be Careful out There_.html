<br/>
Blue Butterfly and I letterboxed our hearts out today.  However, we came to one box that had a snake skin lying next to it in the box's hidey-hole.  Needless to say, we didn't want to have an encounter with the owner of the skin, so we left without nagging that box.  This is just a friendly reminder to PLEASE be careful!! <br/>
