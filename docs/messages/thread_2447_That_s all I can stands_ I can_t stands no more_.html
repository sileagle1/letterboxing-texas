<div>I'm pretty sure he's one of the A's - don't know if he eats beignets or 
not, but I do recall CelticLion's GG Mystery Box (for which I WAS indeed FF, and 
proudly so!).  It was one of those UFO - Unidentified Finders Out there, 
and the other UFO mystery box was the BEA UFO box, for which GG was FF (I 
remember reading his message in the logbook: "It takes an alien to find an 
alien," so that's confirmation of his A status (or maybe, A+ status?) . . .
