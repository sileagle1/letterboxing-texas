<div>I'm pretty sure he's one of the A's - don't know if he eats beignets or 
not, but I do recall CelticLion's GG Mystery Box (for which I WAS indeed FF, and 
proudly so!).  It was one of those UFO - Unidentified Finders Out there, 
and the other UFO mystery box was the BEA UFO box, for which GG was FF (I 
remember reading his message in the logbook: "It takes an alien to find an 
alien," so that's confirmation of his A status (or maybe, A+ status?) . . .

<div>    While walking my dogs and dodging tornados a few days ago, I was once again assaulted by that menace of the roadways who drives the Texas Tour Bus. This being the sixth time that I have had to take evasive action to avoid becoming yet another statistic due to this maniac, I determined to take care of the matter once and for all. To that end, I commandeered the Bus, and, having subdued the driver, transported the lot to my lair. In order to insure that the driver cannot find his way back too easily, I intend to take the Bus to a county where no letterbox has ever been planted -- a county that is not even contiguous to any other county in which a letterbox has ever been planted. I would have done so already, but Earl wanted me to wait until the Bowl games were over, and when the Tyler Rose talks, I listen. In any case, once I succeed in relocating the Bus, I will so advise you. And until it is found again, I can walk the trails without having to look over my shoulder. What? There's a SECOND Bus?

<div>    While walking my dogs and dodging tornados a few days ago, I was once again assaulted by that menace of the roadways who drives the Texas Tour Bus. This being the sixth time that I have had to take evasive action to avoid becoming yet another statistic due to this maniac, I determined to take care of the matter once and for all. To that end, I commandeered the Bus, and, having subdued the driver, transported the lot to my lair. In order to insure that the driver cannot find his way back too easily, I intend to take the Bus to a county where no letterbox has ever been planted -- a county that is not even contiguous to any other county in which a letterbox has ever been planted. I would have done so already, but Earl wanted me to wait until the Bowl games were over, and when the Tyler Rose talks, I listen. In any case, once I succeed in relocating the Bus, I will so advise you. And until it is found again, I can walk the trails without having to look over my shoulder. What? There's a SECOND Bus? Oh, dear.                                                                                                Best regards,                           Gryzzled Gryphon of Coryell County
