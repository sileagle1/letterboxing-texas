Have you ever felt as though you're wading through molassess;-)???<br>
<br>
I picked up the T-shirts Monday and as soon as I began packing<br>
envelopes, immediately realized the numbers were wrong. For some reason<br>
known only to the gods of Murphy's Law, the Youth Small Texas<br>
Letterboxing T-shirts were sent to Oklahoma...I'm not even going to try<br>
to repeat the story I was told.<br>
So...for those of you who *did not* order those small T-shirts, your<br>
orders went out today. <br>
To those of you with little kids waiting on those shirts, I'm so sorry -<br>
the silk screen company here in Dallas is going to try to get them back<br>
here by tomorrow afternoon & I'll mail them out immediately ( if the<br>
Post Office is still open!) or Friday.<br>
<br>
Ready for the good news? I thought I was experienced in getting T-shirts<br>
made, but I have learned so much that I think if we ever want to order<br>
more, this whole process could be MUCH faster and easier!<br>
<br>
NOTE: Three people have not sent in their payment for the shirts. I've<br>
nagged a couple of times, and it's been about a month since I first<br>
requested payment. <br>
No hard feelings - I understand how life happens sometimes. But I'm sure<br>
you guys understand that I don't want to carry the expense, either. Any<br>
shirts unpaid for by Saturday, September 4th will be put back up for<br>
sale and made available to newcomers.<br>
<br>
Hope you enjoy wearing your new Lone Star Letterboxing threads this<br>
weekend!<br>
