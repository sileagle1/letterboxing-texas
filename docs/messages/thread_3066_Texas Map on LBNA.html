<div>I certainly don't care if I'm first to plant a box in Montague County or not, but I do have a few ideas in the works for the town of Nocona in Montague Cnty. However, with the onset of hotter weather, just haven't been inspired to travel up there. We used to travel to Nocona from Wichita Falls when I was a kid to buy Nocona Boots, but the factory has since closed. However, the Montague Boot Company is operational now in downtown Nocona making boots for Larry Mahan's line for Cavendar Boots. There was a company making leather sporting equipment in the old Nocona Boots factory including some darn good baseball gloves, but the factory burned last year. They are still operating out of a temporary building though. The town was named after the Comanche Indian, Chief Peta Nocona, husband to Cynthia Anne Parker and father to Quannah Parker. Needless to say, there are many other interesting facts about Montague County that are screaming out for letterboxes. I guess I'll do mine when I get to it, and anyone else who wants to plant some up there should too. I've never heard anyone complain of too many boxes!</div>

<div>Super! I'm trying to place my boxes closer to home so I can check on them and maintain them more readily. I just hate it when one of my boxes needs a new logbook or something and it's "out of my reach". I have to drive about 150 miles round trip now to check on my boxes in the FW Gardens. I just try and combine the trip with a stop by the art museums, gardens or zoo, one of my favorite restaurants, and a trip to the Naval Air Station while on that side of town. There's really no reason for me to go up to Montague County other than to letterbox, so I look forward to you and Wagtime and JBKokopelli planting a bunch of boxes up there so I can go "hunting"!</div>

&gt; Is there not SOMEBODY who could reach out and touch Dewitt County <br/>
down near San Antonio and Montague County up north of Dallas?  If we <br/>
could get those two done, the eastern half of the state would have a <br/>
solid (albeit very jagged) edge!  <br/>

<div>AND... my LSS and I were in Gainesville Wednesday at an antique sale, but were unable to letterbox there either! Has anyone else felt the frustration of being in the car with "non-boxers" while passing so closely to letterboxes? It's so frustrating to want to just quickly hop over a find that little box! On the way home, we drove by Isle de Bois State Park at Lake Ray Roberts where Barefoot Lucy's box is hidden and it does look like they are open again. Now I NEED to get back up there!</div>

Thanks, that is so nice! I was in Ft Worth yesterday. My two <br/>
daughters and two grandsons went to the apple farm north of town so <br/>
we could pick some apples, but when we got there, there was a sign on <br/>
the gate that they were closed for the day. So then we took the boys <br/>
over to the Texas Motor Speedway which is close by (my nephew, <br/>
Viewfinder's son-in-law, has an office there overlooking the track) <br/>
so the boys could see race cars.... but none were on the track at <br/>
that time. So then we followed my nephew up to Mike Starr's racing <br/>
school so the boys could sit in the race cars, but noooooo.... they <br/>
were closed for lunch. So then we decided to head to the Naval Air <br/>
Station, and since we weren't in my car which is registered at West <br/>
Point, I had to go through clearance to get my daughters and <br/>
grandsons on base which took 45 minutes, but we finally got on... <br/>
found some bleachers by the tarmac, and watched jets take off and <br/>
land... practically in our laps! Loud, fast, exciting.... what more <br/>
could a couple of four year old boys want? The pilots would wave at <br/>
the boys when they'd taxi by us and the kids thought they had died <br/>
and gone to heaven (as did my daughters). Mission accomplished. <br/>
Obviously no time for letterboxing, but as we would drive near <br/>
locations where I knew there were new boxes, I would promise myself a <br/>
return trip before long.<br/>

<div>It always amazes me when someone is able to see the simple solution to my BIG problem. Why didn't I think of THAT? It kind of reminds me of Ruby Tuesday always "accidentally" spilling the contents of her purse whenever she needed to scoop up a letterbox in a urban location when people were around.

<p>I have family in Nocona.  I know of a few locations up there that might be good as well.  There's a cemetery my grandfather was buried in, and a little park near the community center that we used to take the kids over to during family reunions. <br/><br/>aymztx<br/><br/><b><i>Maribeth Jagger &lt;cjagger405@earthlin<a href="http://k.net/" target="_blank">k.net</a>&gt;</i></b> wrote:

<div>I certainly don't care if I'm first to plant a box in Montague County or not, but I do have a few ideas in the works for the town of Nocona in Montague Cnty. However, with the onset of hotter weather, just haven't been inspired to travel up there. We used to travel to Nocona from Wichita Falls when I was a kid to buy Nocona Boots, but the factory has since closed. However, the Montague Boot Company is operational now in downtown Nocona making boots for Larry Mahan's line for Cavendar Boots. There was a company making leather sporting equipment in the old Nocona Boots factory including some darn good baseball gloves, but the factory burned last year. They are still operating out of a temporary building though. The town was named after the Comanche Indian, Chief Peta Nocona, husband to Cynthia Anne Parker and father to Quannah Parker. Needless to say, there are many other interesting facts about Montague County that are screaming out for letterboxes. I guess I'll do mine when I get to it, and anyone else who wants to plant some up there should too. I've never heard anyone complain of too many boxes! </div>
