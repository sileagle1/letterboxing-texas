Very cool!  I've coached baseball for one year, soccer<br>
for ten years, and I train soccer coaches. I've also<br>
done lots of corporate training.  Right now, we're<br>
really into scouts, and besides being an Assistant<br>
Cubmaster I'm a Council trainer and the Roundtable<br>
Commissioner.  Ya never know, I may just have to hit<br>
you up for insight since you've been there and done<br>
that!  It's funny how everything I get involved in I<br>
wind up coaching in some form.  Sounds like you can<br>
relate!  I like to think of what I do as training<br>
people (especially young people, and young-at-heart<br>
people) to THINK, rather than teaching them<br>
information.  Very rewarding and one of these days<br>
I'll figure out how to make a living at it while<br>
living out here in the boonies.<br>
<br>
I'll start working on the patches then.  Would you<br>
mind emailing me the t-shirt artwork, and I'll use<br>
that for the patches.  Everyone else, can I go ahead<br>
and start getting a head count on those who are<br>
interested in patches (you are NOT commiting - just a<br>
rough count).<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If these are just the TX logo as a patch, I'd like 12, I think - if they<br>
have numbers (like the national ones - F Counts - , I'd have to figure that<br>
out more carefully!)<br>
12 would cover all the CelticLions, two-footed and four-footed. I'll sew the<br>
patches on bandanas for the four-footed variety and probably on backpacks<br>
for the rest of us.<br>
When I started pricing them, I believe I recall that a 2 inch patch was<br>
going to come in at under $2.00 ($1.28 or something?) if we could get 100<br>
patches ordered. (If the price is much higher than that, I might not order<br>
as many, so I'll firm up my order when you let us know;-)!)<br>
<br>
Thanks so very much for taking this job on, Lucy - you're a gem!<br>
