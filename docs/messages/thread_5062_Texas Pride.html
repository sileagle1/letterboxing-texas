When I was crossing the border into Canada the man asked where I was from, expecting me to say my country.  Instead I said Texas, like all Texans do when asked where they hail from.  He chuckled and asked me why all Texans answer that way and I told him it was part of our heritage, perhaps because of our rebel spirit.  Thankfully he let me in anyway.<br>

Well, it was either that or hypocrisy!  I was born in Mississippi, but that doesn't really count, b/c I was only there a year.  Dad was in the military, so really, I'm more from nowhere, though I spent 11 years in KS before moving here. No one famous in my ancestry that I know of, so I haven't the dispensation there --maybe I should spin a Texas-size yarn and invent an acceptable ancestry! Most of my kraut relatives are German-Russians, so what we lack in proper Southern raisin', we more than make up for with excellent beer.  Think Shiner.  Prosit! er. . . ahem.. ye-HAW?! (Worth a try.)<br>
