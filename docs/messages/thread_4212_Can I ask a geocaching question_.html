Now,for some background.  We have letterboxing experience and are trying to get into geocaching also.  We have about 20 finds in geocaching and decided to plant one.

So again, I emailed this guy back and asked if this was a no no.  <br>
The guy responded with read the guidelines, which I have a few times and I can't find anything about what he is referring to.<br>
He also suggested joining to online forum groups which I have but the moderaters have to approve the posts before they are posted.  <br>
I want an answer.  <br>
To be honest, I'm not sure I'm liking this geocaching thing, they aren't nearly as friendly as letterboxers.<br>

I think you hit the nail on the head, our own geocacher/letterboxer, Mike Olbrish the obvious exception.  He's probably the one to answer your question on this list.  I've had a couple of bad experiences with geocachers, but they involved territorial rights between caches and letterboxes, so that's a litte different.  One of them actually took over a spot (hollow tree stump) where we had a box hidden and put our letterbox inside his geocache ammo box (I assume he did it because the box was there before the cache).  Then, when we removed the letterbox and moved it, he complained to the LbNA moderators that we had stolen an item from his geocache and turned it into a letterbox.  But, on the other hand, I have heard from other geocachers, who accidentally found one of our boxes, who were very nice and considerate.  I think it's just the person.<br>

                    <html><body><div>My experience with gc'ers has been far to the positive with a few negatives thrown in . In my area, they and we do a pretty good job of understanding both games, so they are good about communicating with "issues" or suggestions or questions and vice versa. BUT - just as there are careless or thoughtless letterboxers, there are also careless or thoughtless gc'ers. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Their forums are far less friendly, in my opinion, than any of ours are, so unless you get an in with a gc'er personally, it's hard to break in and understand what they have going on.</div>
<div></div>
<div>They have a limit of 1/10 of a mile between caches (so I think they misinformed you - perhaps your cache was 321' from another and that's what they meant to say, butthe limit is 528' between caches). Personally, I think it's a good practice so that an area isn't littered with caches, but it's easy for them to monitor that because they can tell by overlaying coords to determine proximity. Here's the link to the part of their guidelines that address this: </div>
<div></div>
<div><a href="http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#sat">http://www.geocaching.com/about/guidelines.aspx#sat</a></div>
<div></div>
<div>If, by chance, that doesn't go through right, look at their guidelines and go to the part about Cache Saturation.</div>
<div></div>
<div>I tried geocaching for awhile and didn't get hooked. It was fun, but it didn't scratch my creative itch. When my GPSr's cratered, I wasn't driven to replace them. If I can find software to make my phone a gc'able GPS (it works great for roads), I'll try it again, but I probably won't spend the money again for one until we get into some serious back country backpacking. I did make one really good friend through geocaching and got reacquainted with an old school mate because of it. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I think it's great when folks either do both or have at least tried both. It makes us all more understanding of the other side of the fence.<br/></div><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are no hard rules for letterboxing, but rather it's all based on respect. In fact, the subject is outlined on AQ under: "Respect" <br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/about/rules/respect.html<br>
It does suggest that you not hide your letterbox near another box. It's been widely accepted in letterboxing that you should contact the placer of nearby box before placing your box to make sure they don't object to having a new box placed nearby. Personally, I don't mind having other boxes located in the same general area as mine, as long as they aren't basically side by side. Last year at the TALE, Lucy Lockett and I hid our boxes extremely close to each other without realizing it. (Neither of our clues had been published when we hid our boxes.) That's pretty easy to do at a big event. However, when we realized it, we both agreed that we liked having a "neighbor" for our boxes and were happy to leave them where they were. Also, it's sometimes easy to place a box near a mystery box and never know it's there if you haven't solved the mystery. When this happens, the placer of the mystery box may feel their box might be compromised and contact you and ask if you would mind moving yours. You definitely should! Like the AQ topic states, it's all about respect.<br>

<p>I know this is a letterbox forum but I have a geocache question and I need 
  an answer. I hope I don't offend anyone and apologize in advance if I do for 
  asking here but y'all are always so helpful.<br/><br/>The question is: In 
  geocaching, is there a safe or proper distance that should be observed between 
  hides? <br/><br/>Now,for some background. We have letterboxing experience and 
  are trying to get into geocaching also. We have about 20 finds in geocaching 
  and decided to plant one. Because of a miscommunication between husband and I 
  we posted the wrong coordinates. The first person that went looking for it 
  nicely emailed us. We went out immediately and got the correct coordiantes. I 
  emailed this guy back with the correct information. He then responded that the 
  new coordinates couldn't be correct because they are within 321' of another 
  cache. Yes, that is correct. There is another cache on the other side of this 
  small cemetary. So again, I emailed this guy back and asked if this was a no 
  no. <br/>The guy responded with read the guidelines, which I have a few times 
  and I can't find anything about what he is referring to.<br/>He also suggested 
  joining to online forum groups which I have but the moderaters have to approve 
  the posts before they are posted. <br/>I want an answer. <br/>To be honest, I'm 
  not sure I'm liking this geocaching thing, they aren't nearly as friendly as 
  letterboxers.<br/>thank you in advance<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>
