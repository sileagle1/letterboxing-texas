"My friend and I were doing a scavenger hunt this weekend at Meridian State park. We were competing against our children. She and I took one trail, and the children took the another. We found your box inadvertently, and I promise you it was comical. My friend was afraid to open it, but I just had to know what it was. I opened it and was pleasantly surprised. We took pictures of it, and placed everything back as it was and put it back in its spot. I came home to log on and find out what this is all about. I am excited and plan to start doing this. It is really neat! Our kids "won" the scavenger hunt but hey were most upset we discovered the "treasure" and not them. Your box gave us a lot of memories and excitement this weekend."<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thank you, Silver Eagle, but that would be true of your boxes as well.  I remember our first day out hunting letterboxes around our area: Coldspring, Huntsville, and The Woodlands.  We found boxes by Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, Dewberry, Runs For Chocolate and The Frye Team.  We didn't find them accidentally, but I'd say you guys set a pretty high standard for us to follow. <br/>
