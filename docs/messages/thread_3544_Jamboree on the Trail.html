<div>Either we grossly misjudged the apparent results or the phone calling made a huge difference, because he won with 71% in a three-way race, and that was beating out the incumbent!  At any rate, the only trail I took yesterday was the campaign trail...<br/>

<div>Sorry I didn't make it - my Assistant Cubmaster was running for City Council and I had been doing phone calling for him.  He had a couple folks drop out of calling, so I picked up a little more.  I told him I had to be gone at noon, but it was sounding like such a close race I hated to quit, then we got caught up in giving folks rides to the polls.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Either we grossly misjudged the apparent results or the phone calling made a huge difference, because he won with 71% in a three-way race, and that was beating out the incumbent!  At any rate, the only trail I took yesterday was the campaign trail...<br/>

<p>Well, Jamboree on the Trail is over and our Cub Scout Pack had a great time.  They did some letterboxing which was made to help them with their compass skills; fished; worked on a fancy knot, had a scavenger hunt geared toward tree and plant identification, cooked hot dogs over a campfire and made smores.  What else can you ask for?</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Jamboree on the Trail series of letterboxes are now open game for anyone to find.  I have placed them on LBNA and Atlas Quest.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I was thinking about the gathering next Saturday and noted that there are going to be about 40 letterboxes available within less than 10 miles of Palestine by the gathering time.  I hope this is enough to draw some more people to come.  </p>

<div>Well, Jamboree on the Trail is over and our Cub Scout Pack had a great time.  They did some letterboxing which was made to help them with their compass skills; fished; worked on a fancy knot, had a scavenger hunt geared toward tree and plant identification, cooked hot dogs over a campfire and made smores.  What else can you ask for?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Jamboree on the Trail series of letterboxes are now open game for anyone to find.  I have placed them on LBNA and Atlas Quest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was thinking about the gathering next Saturday and noted that there are going to be about 40 letterboxes available within less than 10 miles of Palestine by the gathering time.  I hope this is enough to draw some more people to come.  </div>
