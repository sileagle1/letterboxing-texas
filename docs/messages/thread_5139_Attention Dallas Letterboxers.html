<br/>
I know that Jerry Rashall, the ranger at Village Creek S.P. checks LBNA and Atlasquest; he contacted me after I had placed a box there and asked me to go through the permitting process. Once I did, he walked the clues and checked out the box and approved it no problem. I appreciate that he was aware that I had planted, and then he reached out to me and helped me get in compliance.  I just planted another at V.C.S.P. this weekend, and I went ahead and filled out the permit while I was camping and left it with him. <br/>
<br/>
If I knew that personnel at all parks were that aware and cooperative, I would think I would fill out permits every time. I guess that if I were to head to, say, Enchanted Rock this weekend, I would be inclined to ask folks in this group what their experience was with staff there.  <br/>

He was aware of but didn't care about Letterboxing or Geocaching when he was the superintendent of the El Paso area.  That was a few years ago and his attitude may have changed depending on the environmental sensitivity of Enchanted Rock.  It is pretty hard to hurt the Franklin Mountains, Enchanted Rock might be different.<br/>

If you see Ray, tell him I said HI.<br/>

&gt; I know that Jerry Rashall, the ranger at Village Creek S.P. checks LBNA and Atlasquest; he contacted me after I had placed a box there and asked me to go through the permitting process. Once I did, he walked the clues and checked out the box and approved it no problem. I appreciate that he was aware that I had planted, and then he reached out to me and helped me get in compliance. I just planted another at V.C.S.P. this weekend, and I went ahead and filled out the permit while I was camping and left it with him. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If I knew that personnel at all parks were that aware and cooperative, I would think I would fill out permits every time. I guess that if I were to head to, say, Enchanted Rock this weekend, I would be inclined to ask folks in this group what their experience was with staff there. <br/>
