placed by Der Mad Stamper in 1998 as part of his Columbia River Gorge <br/>
Waterfalls series near Portland, OR.  It was in the fall of 2002, <br/>
just a few months after I started letterboxing, when I got to take a <br/>
Business trip to the Pacific Northwest.  So far I had only found a <br/>
few boxes placed by Baby Bear (except for my first find in Spokane) <br/>
so I was pleased to be going to an area rich in letterboxes.  After <br/>
my conference, I took a few days of vacation to enjoy the area and <br/>
letterbox.  I worked my way down from Seattle, WA to the Portland, OR <br/>
area, finding every box I looked for and having a great time.  The <br/>
scenery was beautiful, but nothing compared to the Columbia River <br/>
Gorge.  I was getting spoiled by finding every box, so I was <br/>
confounded when I couldn't locate the Multnomah box.  The clues call <br/>
for you to find Five trees together, two are twins from one trunk, <br/>
with Multnomah Falls at 125 degrees.  I looked for hours with no <br/>
luck, but every time I tried a new location I would look up at the <br/>
falls at 125 degrees and just sigh with its beauty, so it was a <br/>
pleasure.<br/>
<br/>
Well when I got home, I started hearing that everyone has trouble <br/>
finding that box and it became an obsession with me.  I thought about <br/>
it off and on for a year until I finally had an inspiration.  Luckily <br/>
I had another trip to the area in fall 2003, so I headed back to the <br/>
Gorge.  This time I was successful and it was even sweeter after a <br/>
year thinking about it.  So this box was a "not found the first <br/>
time", not a "never found" box.<br/>
