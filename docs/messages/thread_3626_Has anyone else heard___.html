i was in coldspring week before last and saw you out there on your <br/>
tractor. i had planned to plant a box your way, but couldn't find <br/>
the cemetery, so i will have to come back that way again and get it <br/>
planted, now that i have better directions.<br/>

<div><strong><em>In other words, how many boxes would NOT be added yearly if 
they were to quit???</em></strong></div>
<div> </div>
<div>            -- 
According to LBNA Silver Eagle has planted 242 boxes, and Baby Bear has planted 
298 - so a total of 540 boxes between</div>
<div>              
 them. (I know this doesn't include listings that were deleted, but I 
figure it's close enough for our purposes.)   Silver </div>
<div>               
Eagle's website says that he planted his first box (Zube Zephyr) in September of 
2002 and we can assume that Baby Bear </div>
<div>               
planted his first box around the same time as well.  Therefore they have 
been planting boxes for approximately 69 months.</div>
<div>             
  That averages to 7.826 boxes per month, or 93.913 boxes per year.  
  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You're right... they are slowing down!!!</div>
