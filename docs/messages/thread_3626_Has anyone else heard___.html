It's Texas. It's summer. It's hot. That has been enough to keep me from 
finding his latest box... and it's only about 15</div>

<div><strong><em>In other words, how many boxes would NOT be added yearly if

<div> </div>
<div>            -- 
According to LBNA Silver Eagle has planted 242 boxes, and Baby Bear has planted 
298 - so a total of 540 boxes between</div>
<div>              
 them. (I know this doesn't include listings that were deleted, but I 
figure it's close enough for our purposes.)   Silver </div>
<div>               
Eagle's website says that he planted his first box (Zube Zephyr) in September of 
2002 and we can assume that Baby Bear </div>
<div>               
planted his first box around the same time as well.  Therefore they have 
been planting boxes for approximately 69 months.</div>
<div>             
  That averages to 7.826 boxes per month, or 93.913 boxes per year.  
  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You're right... they are slowing down!!!</div>

<p>I think it's your imagination - lack of sleep perhaps? :D<br/><br/>Your "Most Prolific Planters List" of May 30th showed Silver Eagle <br/>had 240 planted boxes. Today, LBNA shows he has 242 plants. So his <br/>
plants have actually increased by two during the past several weeks. <br/><br/>Unless you know something you're not telling us...
