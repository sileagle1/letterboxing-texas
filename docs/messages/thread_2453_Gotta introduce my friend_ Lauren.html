                    <html><body><div>I just got a message across my inbox requesting to join our fine group from a friend of mine, Lauren.  It's been awhile since I had heard from her; in fact, it has been since she left the Jacksonville newspaper.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lauren is the writer that wrote the story about letterboxing in Cherokee County.  My family thoroughly enjoyed working with her on the article and in fact, I still have people come up to me and say "Are you still doing that mailbox stuff I read about in the paper?"  That's how memorable an article it was!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Even after the article was done, I enjoyed bumping into Lauren around town and it always seemed like we were able to fall right in to good conversation (sounds letterboxer-ish, doesn't it?).  She left the paper and I've really missed her since, both in terms of reading her articles and in getting that occasion to talk to her!  If I'm not mistaken, she moved to Denton or thereabouts.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now, she just falls out of the sky and right into my inbox!  How cool is that?  She says she has been hanging on to her curiosity all this time and wants to give it a shot now, especially since she's got a lot of boxes around her now.  I'll not give away her last name for security reasons, and she says she's working on a trail name so we'll see her incognito very soon, I'm sure.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't normally make a big production of bringing people out on this list in case they want to stay in the shadows, but I guess I'm not giving her that option - sorry Lauren!  Glad you're here though.  (And PS, check out how many boxes we have in Cherokee County NOW!)
