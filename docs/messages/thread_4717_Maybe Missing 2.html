We went this week to check and everyone of them were safe and sound and right where they were suppose to be. Before you go look for Children's Stories and Rhymes series, check the clues again as the arboretum has put in new trail markers and benches and also have removed some. I have redone the clues to reflect the changes. Also the  "Texas Passport Series #1--Athens", which is planted there too, is safe and sound too. Be sure to put it on you list before you go. <br>
