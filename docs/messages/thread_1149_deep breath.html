<div>I took a deep breath when I read the post about the 
stamp not being very artistic, but then the kids all got in a big arguement and 
I had to leave the computer and return to real life.  But then I thought 
about it for a while, and this is what I thought (for what its worth) 
Letterboxing is just like anything else, people are drawn to it for all sorts of 
reasons.  And letterboxers all have different strengths. Just like 
everyone's mothers used to say, "the world would be a pretty boring place if 
everyone were just the same".  I think anyone who takes the time to carve a 
stamp and hide a box deserves encouragement.  Some of the first stamps we 
put out there were pretty primitave, but if I had waited until I was a great 
carver I'd still be waiting to place a box.  It just seems to me that we 
are Texans, not New Yorkers (sorry miss moon!) and should conduct ourselves as 
such.  Now I have to go break up another kid fight:) -Mother of

<br/>
Since I teach art--including rubber stamp carving--I have a few quotes<br/>
that you may enjoy:<br/>
<br/>
"Do not let what you cannot do interfere with what you can do." -- John Wooden<br/>
<br/>
"You cannot afford to wait for perfect conditions. Goal setting is<br/>
often a matter of balancing timing against available resources.<br/>
Opportunities are easily lost while waiting for perfect conditions."<br/>
-- Gary Ryan Blair<br/>
<br/>
"If you wait for the perfect moment when all is safe and assured, it<br/>
may never arrive. Mountains will not be climbed, races won, or lasting<br/>
happiness achieved." --  Maurice Chevalier<br/>
<br/>
"Too many of us wait to do the perfect thing, with the result we do<br/>
nothing." -- William Feather Magazine<br/>
<br/>
"We are always getting ready to live but never living."  -- Ralph Waldo Emerson<br/>
<br/>
"Do what you can, with what you have, where you are." -- Theodore Roosevelt<br/>
<br/>
"It is the greatest of all mistakes to do nothing because you can only<br/>
do little - do what you can." -- Sydney Smith<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
