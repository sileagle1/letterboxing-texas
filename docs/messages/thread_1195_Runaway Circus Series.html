                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last Thursday I went out to find the Runaway Circus series.  Found <br>
all in the series but 1st stamp "Zuberi" eluded me. - I'm not going <br>
to say that its missing, as this is my first time boxing in the wilds <br>
an I certainly am not the best at my lefts and rights.  I found the <br>
directions to be "spot on" if I took bigger than normal for me steps, <br>
but I'm short.<br>
 <br>
Very well placed and described.  Did I say I was short, but I got "Li <br>
Mei". I was warned it was 7 feet off the ground so I brought a reach <br>
tool.<br>
 <br>
"Chima the Giraffe" had a small juvinile snake located near it.  <br>
Unknown variety as it slithered away rather quickly and I was using <br>
my prod to disturb the trail before me.<br>
 <br>
As I was stamping in at Circus wagon City of  Houston worker came by <br>
to tell me he was getting ready to lock up, and that the hours for <br>
the park were from dawn to dusk.  Even though the sun was still about <br>
1 1/2 hours from setting. I asked for three minutes and he was <br>
agreeable to that he drove to the entrance to wait for my exit.  <br>
Circus wagon was re-hid and I was on my way.<br>
 <br>
You will need more than the deepwoods variety of OFF repelant to go <br>
after this series.  After about 20 minutes I no longer noticed the <br>
mosquitos, although they still were biting.   <br>
<br>
Lots of large orb weaving spiders along the trail - be watchful for <br>
webs!<br>
<br>
Had Ivy Block on so I didn't contract P.I. it was everywhere but I <br>
also covered up.  Who knew Mosquitoes have no problem biting knees <br>
through denim?<br>
<br>
Thanks Birds of a feather family for the wonderful series of fun and <br>
beautiful stamps! <br>
<br>
Now that I've had a taste of wilderness boxes maybe I'll be hitting <br>
the wild trails more often.<br>
