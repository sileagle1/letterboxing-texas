<br/>
Glad y'all had a good time in my town yesterday.  As Lois mentioned, I was<br/>
out and about too, and it felt great for a change!  We just haven't been<br/>
able to do much boxing in a couple of months, so what more could we ask that<br/>
the first day we had available and healthy also proved to be a nice day???<br/>

Monarch B, unfortunately, Cherokee wasn't one of the counties on the list!<br/>
BUT - you being in the Dallas area, you aren't too far from the counties<br/>
that WERE on the list, so you have until Thursday to qualify for it.<br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, if anyone who planted a box during the month of May in the<br/>
counties listed on the following website would email me privately with the<br/>
name of their box and their mailing address at barefootlucy at gmail dot<br/>
com, I'll send them an imprint of the stamp.  It's quite clever, if I DO say<br/>
so myself!<br/>

<br/>
I'm finally going to make it out tomorrow myself to plant some boxes in<br/>
Fannin, Delta, and Hopkins Counties, if all goes well.  Between health<br/>
problems in my family and winding up scouts, May has proven to be a very<br/>
difficult month for us, but I think things are settling down a bit.  I was<br/>
beginning to think I wasn't going to qualify for my own stamp, so I'm just<br/>
really hoping against hope I can get done tomorrow what I want to get done!<br/>
<br/>
We did indeed hit the road early yesterday and started finishing up the May<br/>
series and began the April series.  We also picked up a few other boxes we<br/>
hadn't yet gotten.  We took my good friend, She Who Reads (remember her?<br/>
She is also known to us as She Who Volunteers Me For Everything), and her<br/>
son who should be called Frog Child because of his ability to climb and<br/>
stick to ANYTHING - which came in handy on a few occasions yesterday.  She<br/>
was supposed to work yesterday but got cancelled (she's a PRN nurse), so she<br/>
called me bored.  She wanted me to come over and help her with Day Camp<br/>
stuff, but instead Lightning and I went and kidnapped them to go find boxes<br/>
with us.<br/>
<br/>
Before kidnapping SWR and FC, Lightning and I started out at The Castle on<br/>
the Lake for one of the May series and kicked it for a little while there<br/>
while we tried to coordinate with some other friends who had been asking to<br/>
go boxing with us.  We thought we had things put together, so we left that<br/>
box and stopped nearby for one at the boat ramp on the lake (I had long ago<br/>
forgotten about that boat ramp, although we used to skinny dip there when I<br/>
was in early college).  We took off to try to meet the friends we had been<br/>
coordinating with, but somehow missed signals with them so we headed to Joe<br/>
Smith Plant Farm for one of the May Series boxes.  Joe Smith, and his wife<br/>
Bettie Lou, have been in the greenhouse business for many, many years and<br/>
were friendly competitors with my parents when my family was in the same<br/>
business in the same town.  They are good folks and I was looking forward to<br/>
seeing Bettie Lou, but alas, she wasn't there.  Her staff did a great job of<br/>
making us feel glad we stopped by and I bought Lightning a cactus plant for<br/>
his room.  In lurking about that area trying to catch our friends, we<br/>
stumbled across the Mud Park and stopped there and got that box too.  A<br/>
phone call from Fearless Fox indicated that our friends had shown up in<br/>
town, so we hightailed it back in to Jacksonville to try to catch them.  It<br/>
was then that SWR called and complained about being bored and needing help,<br/>
so Lightning and I went and kidnapped them.<br/>

 Grove and went to Country Charm Candles to get the May box there.  NOW - it isn't wise to take two boys, one of whom sticks to things, into a fru-fru store.  SWR and I quickly realized the error of our logic, so by way of apologizing to the owner, I bought three candles before I quickly asked for the box.  He was very gracious, even to the two boys, and off we went. So the count at that point was 5 boxes, 1 cactus, and 3 candles.  And it wasn't even lunchtime yet!  We went on and found the box at The Woods and thankfully didn't have to buy a round of golf or anything there.  That was the first point where Frog Child came in handy - the corner there was very messy and we decided to clean it up before we put the box away.  He was able to maneuver up and down the embankment to carry trash around - until we realized we had not a single thing to put it in, so we left it in a neat pile on the side of the road and went and picked it up
 this morning.  </div> <div> </div> <div>We then ventured out to Troup to find Blue Butterfly's box there.  I had assigned SWR navigation duties, so she kept reading the clues and we kept trying to figure out how to get there from where we were - we weren't approaching from the same direction as BB's clues.  As we pulled in to Troup, I suddenly realized that I knew EXACTLY where it was because there was a geocache in the same place that I had tried and tried to find, and never could (although everyone who came before and after me commented how EASY it was!).  We easily made it there and the box was very findable - and it was a very nice stamp of a tiger!  Lightning and I stamped it into our books and I stamped it onto Frog Child's hand.  His mother didn't care to have her hand stamped though.  Blue Butterfly mentions a Mexican restaurant in Troup, La Hacienda, and I have to second her opinion - it is very good - my family eats there
 every time we get close to Troup.  We ate lunch there and it was, as always, excellent. </div> <div><br/>We planned to make a run cross-country over to Rusk and stop off in New Summerfield and Sacul to get boxes on our way to Rusk.  We went looking for TaterTexas' box at Myrtle Springs Cemetery in NS, but I later realized it was the one that has been missing for quite a long time.  I oughta make better notes!  It was a cool cemetery anyway and SWR learned things about cemeteries that she didn't know (she doesn't know much about them, so it wasn't hard to impress her with our vast knowledge of burial grounds - HA!).  </div> <div> </div> <div>We drove from there on to Sacul for another of TaterTexas' Winnie the Pooh series.  We got to the cemetery just as storm clouds were banking up in one sky and the wind was kicking up a bit.  Since I have a fan out on my car which means we had to ride with the windows down all day, the light
 breeze felt really good and we lingered at the cemetery.  For one thing, they had a huge chart of where all the graves were and SWR and I got caught up reading that while Lightning and Frog Child investigated the cemetery.  I kept glimpsing beyond the board and seeing Frog Child creeping up and down trees.  Odd child he is!  We finally decided we should quit reading and go looking (especially since the reading was getting us nowhere) and the boys had found the general vicinity long before we got to it.  They swore the box was gone at first, but then said we were on the wrong side of the fence.  SWR read the clues again and we disagreed with them and went to look for ourselves.  Sure enough, the corner where the box was to be had been very nicely cleaned up and raked away.  The box had been discovered and tossed over the fence with the rest of the debris and it was laying there very nicely on top of the leaf and debris piles, and
 written plainly across the top were the words "This is not trash".  I always find irony amusing.  We put Frog Child over the fence to retrieve the box and then he found his own way back to our side.  By then the rain was coming down really well, so we found shelter under a tree and worked to protect the logbooks as we stamped in.  We finished with my logbook first and placed it on a tombstone and Lightning set the marker box down on top of it.  The boys took off for the car while SWR and I were figuring out how to return it to the correct place, cover it, and keep it inconspicuous too.  We hightailed it to the car after we finished too and decided, based on the look of the skies, that it was! time to head on home.  We dropped SWR and Frog Child off and went home ourselves and I told Lightning to bring in the logbooks while I cleaned the trash out of the car.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Well - that's when things went not quite
 right.  Turns out - we had all left my logbook and the markers in the cemetery.  We both knew exactly where they were, and we called SWR and FC to see if they had by chance picked them up, but no luck there.  My logbook was sitting under my markers on the tombstone under the tree in pouring down rain.  We knew the spot was safe for a bit, but the winds had been high and we weren't sure my logbook wouldn't have blown off or been subject to driving rains, so we had no choice but to drive the half hour back out to the cemetery. </div> <div> </div> <div>Now Sacul is wayyyy out down Highway 204, halfway between Jacksonville and Nacogdoches in no-cell-phone-<wbr/>signal land.  It's wayyyy out there.  Sacul-lites live in the bona fide boonies.  The rain had thankfully let up, but we still had the windows down and something blew into my eye and irritated my contact lens.  I squinted to clear it and in that brief time I ran off the
 shoulderless road.  When I re-opened my eyes, I could see that we were headed down the embankment at a steep angle on slick grass and toward a culvert which ran under the road just ahead.  If we hit the culvert, we would almost certainly nose in and flip end over end.  I corrected toward the road, and just as my tire caught traction on the road, it jerked us across the road and into the path of an oncoming dump truck or log truck or something really big.  I tried to pull us back over to our side and tried to point us off the road again because it was a milder slope than previously and we were past the culvert at that point so we could have run off and hit something with a milder impact, when we began to spin.  We spun at least twice rapidly and once slowly and stopped finally with our rear end in the other lane.  Thankfully, thankfully - that truck driver saw immediately what was happening and began correcting and finally stopped.  When
 we stopped, the truck driver and I were looking directly into each other's eyes, both terrified.  I collected myself and continued on down the road and he did the same, but I wish I had stopped to thank him because if it hadn't been for his quick reaction, we would have certainly collided and it wouldn't have been good for Lightning and me.  We were less than a mile from the cemetery (which struck me with yet another bit of irony when I realized how glad I was we drove ourselves to the cemetery, instead of the alternative) so we went and retrieved my book.  We both shook all the way to the back of the cem! etery an d back to the car and Lightning wouldn't let go of my hand. </div> <div> </div> <div>It was all in all a very nice day, with a sobering end.  It reminded me that in the grand scheme of things, that logbook was just not that important, and certainly not important enough for me to get upset with Lightning for forgetting.  It
 also reminded me how important it is to drive responsibly so that I can continue to enjoy time with family and friends and contribute to their lives as they contribute to mine.  I can't tell you how much time I spend on the road driving complacently, and yet yesterday I was relatively alert because of the weather conditions and the road.  How much worse could it have been if I hadn't been? </div> <div> </div> <div>Anyway, I didn't tell y'all this to bum you out, but I consider y'all to be my friends and I sure hope you will be careful out there, and buckle up, because a good day boxing doesn't need to be followed by such trouble! </div> <div> </div> <div>Lucy</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 5/27/07, <b>Carolyn Ramirez</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:danielcgarcia@sbcglobal.net">danielcgarcia@<wbr/>sbcglobal.<wbr/>net</a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div>You are not kidding about there being so many boxes in that area!

So glad you and Lightening are OK and that you got your logbook back also. We all do need a little wake up call now and then to put some of our priorities right. But I would have driven back out there for my logbook too...so many memories attached to something like that and you would really hate to lose it. Glad you are safe.<br/>

Monarch B, unfortunately, Cherokee wasn't one of the counties on the list!  BUT - you being in the Dallas area, you aren't too far from the counties that WERE on the list, so you have until Thursday to qualify for it. <br/>
<br/>
Which reminds me, if anyone who planted a box during the month of May in the counties listed on the following website would email me privately with the name of their box and their mailing address at barefootlucy at gmail dot com, I'll send them an imprint of the stamp.  It's quite clever, if I DO say so myself! <br/>

I'm finally going to make it out tomorrow myself to plant some boxes in Fannin, Delta, and Hopkins Counties, if all goes well.  Between health problems in my family and winding up scouts, May has proven to be a very difficult month for us, but I think things are settling down a bit.  I was beginning to think I wasn't going to qualify for my own stamp, so I'm just really hoping against hope I can get done tomorrow what I want to get done! <br/>
<br/>
We did indeed hit the road early yesterday and started finishing up the May series and began the April series.  We also picked up a few other boxes we hadn't yet gotten.  We took my good friend, She Who Reads (remember her?  She is also known to us as She Who Volunteers Me For Everything), and her son who should be called Frog Child because of his ability to climb and stick to ANYTHING - which came in handy on a few occasions yesterday.  She was supposed to work yesterday but got cancelled (she's a PRN nurse), so she called me bored.  She wanted me to come over and help her with Day Camp stuff, but instead Lightning and I went and kidnapped them to go find boxes with us.  <br/>
<br/>
Before kidnapping SWR and FC, Lightning and I started out at The Castle on the Lake for one of the May series and kicked it for a little while there while we tried to coordinate with some other friends who had been asking to go boxing with us.  We thought we had things put together, so we left that box and stopped nearby for one at the boat ramp on the lake (I had long ago forgotten about that boat ramp, although we used to skinny dip there when I was in early college).  We took off to try to meet the friends we had been coordinating with, but somehow missed signals with them so we headed to Joe Smith Plant Farm for one of the May Series boxes.  Joe Smith, and his wife Bettie Lou, have been in the greenhouse business for many, many years and were friendly competitors with my parents when my family was in the same business in the same town.  They are good folks and I was looking forward to seeing Bettie Lou, but alas, she wasn't there.  Her staff did a great job of making us feel glad we stopped by and I bought Lightning a cactus plant for his room.  In lurking about that area trying to catch our friends, we stumbled across the Mud Park and stopped there and got that box too.  A phone call from Fearless Fox indicated that our friends had shown up in town, so we hightailed it back in to Jacksonville to try to catch them.  It was then that SWR called and complained about being bored and needing help, so Lightning and I went and kidnapped them.  <br/>

back also. We all do need a little wake up call now and then to put <br/>
some of our priorities right. But I would have driven back out there <br/>
for my logbook too...so many memories attached to something like that <br/>

them.  It was then that SWR called and complained about being bored <br/>
and needing help, so Lightning and I went and kidnapped them.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; From there we ventured back out to Afton Grove and went to Country <br/>
Charm Candles to get the May box there.  NOW - it isn't wise to take <br/>
two boys, one of whom sticks to things, into a fru-fru store.  SWR <br/>
and I quickly realized the error of our logic, so by way of <br/>
apologizing to the owner, I bought three candles before I quickly <br/>
asked for the box.  He was very gracious, even to the two boys, and <br/>
off we went. So the count at that point was 5 boxes, 1 cactus, and 3 <br/>
candles.  And it wasn't even lunchtime yet!  We went on and found the <br/>
box at The Woods and thankfully didn't have to buy a round of golf or <br/>
anything there.  That was the first point where Frog Child came in <br/>
handy - the corner there was very messy and we decided to clean it up <br/>
before we put the box away.  He was able to maneuver up and down the <br/>
embankment to carry trash around - until we realized we had not a <br/>
single thing to put it in, so we left it in a neat pile on the side <br/>
of the road and went and picked it up this morning.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We then ventured out to Troup to find Blue Butterfly's box there.  <br/>
I had assigned SWR navigation duties, so she kept reading the clues <br/>
and we kept trying to figure out how to get there from where we were -<br/>
 we weren't approaching from the same direction as BB's clues.  As we <br/>
pulled in to Troup, I suddenly realized that I knew EXACTLY where it <br/>
was because there was a geocache in the same place that I had tried <br/>
and tried to find, and never could (although everyone who came before <br/>
and after me commented how EASY it was!).  We easily made it there <br/>
and the box was very findable - and it was a very nice stamp of a <br/>
tiger!  Lightning and I stamped it into our books and I stamped it <br/>
onto Frog Child's hand.  His mother didn't care to have her hand <br/>
stamped though.  Blue Butterfly mentions a Mexican restaurant in <br/>
Troup, La Hacienda, and I have to second her opinion - it is very <br/>
good - my family eats there every time we get close to Troup.  We ate <br/>
lunch there and it was, as always, excellent. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We planned to make a run cross-country over to Rusk and stop off in <br/>
New Summerfield and Sacul to get boxes on our way to Rusk.  We went <br/>
looking for TaterTexas' box at Myrtle Springs Cemetery in NS, but I <br/>
later realized it was the one that has been missing for quite a long <br/>
time.  I oughta make better notes!  It was a cool cemetery anyway and <br/>
SWR learned things about cemeteries that she didn't know (she doesn't <br/>
know much about them, so it wasn't hard to impress her with our vast <br/>
knowledge of burial grounds - HA!).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We drove from there on to Sacul for another of TaterTexas' Winnie <br/>
the Pooh series.  We got to the cemetery just as storm clouds were <br/>
banking up in one sky and the wind was kicking up a bit.  Since I <br/>
have a fan out on my car which means we had to ride with the windows <br/>
down all day, the light breeze felt really good and we lingered at <br/>
the cemetery.  For one thing, they had a huge chart of where all the <br/>
graves were and SWR and I got caught up reading that while Lightning <br/>
and Frog Child investigated the cemetery.  I kept glimpsing beyond <br/>
the board and seeing Frog Child creeping up and down trees.  Odd <br/>
child he is!  We finally decided we should quit reading and go <br/>
looking (especially since the reading was getting us nowhere) and the <br/>
boys had found the general vicinity long before we got to it.  They <br/>
swore the box was gone at first, but then said we were on the wrong <br/>
side of the fence.  SWR read the clues again and we disagreed with <br/>
them and went to look for ourselves.  Sure enough, the corner where <br/>
the box was to be had been very nicely cleaned up and raked away.  <br/>
The box had been discovered and tossed over the fence with the rest <br/>
of the debris and it was laying there very nicely on top of the leaf <br/>
and debris piles, and written plainly across the top were the <br/>
words "This is not trash".  I always find irony amusing.  We put Frog <br/>
Child over the fence to retrieve the box and then he found his own <br/>
way back to our side.  By then the rain was coming down really well, <br/>
so we found shelter under a tree and worked to protect the logbooks <br/>
as we stamped in.  We finished with my logbook first and placed it on <br/>
a tombstone and Lightning set the marker box down on top of it.  The <br/>
boys took off for the car while SWR and I were figuring out how to <br/>
return it to the correct place, cover it, and keep it inconspicuous <br/>
too.  We hightailed it to the car after we finished too and decided, <br/>
based on the look of the skies, that it was! time to head on home.  <br/>
We dropped SWR and Frog Child off and went home ourselves and I told <br/>
Lightning to bring in the logbooks while I cleaned the trash out of <br/>
the car.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Well - that's when things went not quite right.  Turns out - we had <br/>
all left my logbook and the markers in the cemetery.  We both knew <br/>
exactly where they were, and we called SWR and FC to see if they had <br/>
by chance picked them up, but no luck there.  My logbook was sitting <br/>
under my markers on the tombstone under the tree in pouring down <br/>
rain.  We knew the spot was safe for a bit, but the winds had been <br/>
high and we weren't sure my logbook wouldn't have blown off or been <br/>
subject to driving rains, so we had no choice but to drive the half <br/>
hour back out to the cemetery. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Now Sacul is wayyyy out down Highway 204, halfway between <br/>
Jacksonville and Nacogdoches in no-cell-phone-signal land.  It's <br/>
wayyyy out there.  Sacul-lites live in the bona fide boonies.  The <br/>
rain had thankfully let up, but we still had the windows down and <br/>
something blew into my eye and irritated my contact lens.  I squinted <br/>
to clear it and in that brief time I ran off the shoulderless road.  <br/>
When I re-opened my eyes, I could see that we were headed down the <br/>
embankment at a steep angle on slick grass and toward a culvert which <br/>
ran under the road just ahead.  If we hit the culvert, we would <br/>
almost certainly nose in and flip end over end.  I corrected toward <br/>
the road, and just as my tire caught traction on the road, it jerked <br/>
us across the road and into the path of an oncoming dump truck or log <br/>
truck or something really big.  I tried to pull us back over to our <br/>
side and tried to point us off the road again because it was a milder <br/>
slope than previously and we were past the culvert at that point so <br/>
we could have run off and hit something with a milder impact, when we <br/>
began to spin.  We spun at least twice rapidly and once slowly and <br/>
stopped finally with our rear end in the other lane.  Thankfully, <br/>
thankfully - that truck driver saw immediately what was happening and <br/>
began correcting and finally stopped.  When we stopped, the truck <br/>
driver and I were looking directly into each other's eyes, both <br/>
terrified.  I collected myself and continued on down the road and he <br/>
did the same, but I wish I had stopped to thank him because if it <br/>
hadn't been for his quick reaction, we would have certainly collided <br/>
and it wouldn't have been good for Lightning and me.  We were less <br/>
than a mile from the cemetery (which struck me with yet another bit <br/>
of irony when I realized how glad I was we drove ourselves to the <br/>
cemetery, instead of the alternative) so we went and retrieved my <br/>
book.  We both shook all the way to the back of the cem! etery an d <br/>
back to the car and Lightning wouldn't let go of my hand. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was all in all a very nice day, with a sobering end.  It <br/>
reminded me that in the grand scheme of things, that logbook was just <br/>
not that important, and certainly not important enough for me to get <br/>
upset with Lightning for forgetting.  It also reminded me how <br/>
important it is to drive responsibly so that I can continue to enjoy <br/>
time with family and friends and contribute to their lives as they <br/>
contribute to mine.  I can't tell you how much time I spend on the <br/>
road driving complacently, and yet yesterday I was relatively alert <br/>
because of the weather conditions and the road.  How much worse could <br/>
it have been if I hadn't been? <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, I didn't tell y'all this to bum you out, but I consider <br/>
y'all to be my friends and I sure hope you will be careful out there, <br/>
and buckle up, because a good day boxing doesn't need to be followed <br/>
by such trouble! <br/>

16th &amp; 17th and spent the night and boxed all the way down there and <br/>
I do believe we could have stayed at least another week and still not <br/>
