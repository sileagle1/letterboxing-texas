Hey all,<br/>
I just checked on the Mondrian Series and found #3 missing and I <br/>
also had to pull #5 for maintenance as the logbook was soaked. (that <br/>
will teach me to use cheap microbox containers instead of the <br/>
Nalgene bottle of the same size.  My Chicago box in a Nalgene didn't <br/>
even have the logbook in a bag when I checked on it and it was bone <br/>
dry.-And near a Water Garden to boot!)  I'll keep you posted when I <br/>
get them replaced.<br/>
<br/>
Also-note to Angi from San Antonio-you accidentally left your <br/>
personal stamp in one of my boxes.  Pleas email me offlist and tell <br/>
me if you want me to send it back to you or place it in a box here.<br/>
