<div>I feel as if I need to 
take the time to sing the praises of a delightful new Houston Letterbox; 
Sandibox's "Letterboxing Fortune Cookie".  Although it was HOT this 
morning, it was one of those memorable boxes because of the company on the walk 
(dewberry and her little one), the wildlife (lots of deer, birds, and even a 
snake) a fun clue, a fun stamp, and a clever hide.  I have had fun at every 
box I have ever found, but some stand out in my mind as really special days, and 
this is going to be one of those boxes.  Can't wait to see more of her 
boxes popping up around Houston (especially West Houston, hint, hint)  
Great Job, Sandibox!  MO5</div></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes, it's true.  Mother of Five and I, along with the singing<br/>
letterboxing baby and the bronchial boy had quite a fun outing today,<br/>
thanks to the handiwork of Sandibox.  Am hoping that we will be<br/>
blessed with good letterboxing fortune as a result.<br/>
<br/>
Am also hoping that the huge lightning storm we just had has<br/>
significantly cooled off Houston.  It was beyond ridiculous for it to<br/>
be almost 90 degrees in mid-November, with swarming mosquitos and all.<br/>
<br/>
However, the company, the destination and the wildlife viewing<br/>
couldn't be beat.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks Sandibox!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh gee, you're making me blush!  I'm glad you enjoyed the box, because <br/>
I really had fun putting it all together.  But truthfully, the praise <br/>
should be directed to all of you who have been out there faithfully <br/>
planting boxes and posting to this board all along.  I've learned so <br/>
much about the type of boxes I enjoy and the way to play the game.  <br/>
It's just a case of monkey see, monkey do.  Hmmm... maybe a box in <br/>
that thought!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for all the kind words,<br/>
