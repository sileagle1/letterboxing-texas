hosting a most excellent gathering in Plano, TX over the weekend. I<br>
had a lot of fun and you did a really great job with it. The food and<br>
punch were excellent, the boxes were clued properly (yay!)and the<br>
stamps were wonderful. You went out of your way to make me feel<br>
welcome and I really did. I had a wonderful time and can't wait for<br>
the next one! Thank you!<br>
