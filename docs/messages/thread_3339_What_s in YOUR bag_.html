                    <html><body><div>This question comes up every now and then on letterboxing lists.  What's in your letterboxing bag right now???</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I carry a backpack with me and it weighs around twelve pounds.  I CAN go light if I have to, but I like to keep all my letterboxing stuff together, so I just go ahead and carry it all rather than trying to unpack and repack every time I change my mind about what goes with me.  Most of the time it's no big thing to carry.  What always amazes me is what I manage to collect and never get rid of along the way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So - what's in YOUR bag?  Tell us EVERYTHING!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's mine:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Big pouch:</div>
<div>1-14. ink pads of various colors (no duplicates - THAT would be silly!)</div>
<div>15.   An expired drivers' license - for ID.</div>
<div>16.   $5 - in case I run across a store in the woods I suppose (why DO I carry $5?)</div>
<div>17.   "In case of emergency" phone numbers</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Middle Pouch:</div>
<div>1. Gallon sized baggie full of baggies of all sorts of sizes</div>
<div>2. Gallon sized baggie of carving stuff-rubber, exacto knives, 2 sets of gouges, charcoal pencils, sharpener, pink pearl erasers.  I guess I envision myself plopping down on the side of the trail and carving out a quick stamp???</div>
<div>3. Two very small - too small - containers.  Out they go!</div>
<div>4. My logbook</div>
<div>5. Lightning's logbook</div>
<div>6. Lock'n'lock box with markers (Marvy, if you care), Fearless Fox's personal stamp, Lightning's personal stamp, my personal stamp.  My three personal travelers (why do I carry a retired traveler around?  I don't know).  An odd unknown stamp - where did I get that?  Now that worries me a little - where did THAT come from?  Looks like - a bear?  about 1.5 x 1.5, hardly been inked. Anybody missing a stamp?  I might have found it.  Eesh...</div>
<div>7. Several old clues (G'bye)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Top pouch:</div>
<div>1.  Three disposable rain ponchos (used to be four, but I used one recently).</div>
<div>2.  Headlamp</div>
<div>3.  Gloves - these and my logbook are the two things I will drive miles to get back if I lose them.  The gloves have a stain on one finger which reminds me to always be patient.  The stain is a bloodstain I got at a box location.  When I saw that I was going to have to do a little foraging, I sent Lightning back to the car for my gloves, but I got tired of waiting and started poking around.  Almost immediately I got stabbed by something and my finger bled profusely.  I finally got it stopped, put my hands in my gloves, and got the box.  After stamping in, I noticed I had bled through the leather glove, leaving a large red (now dark brown) stain.  Every time I look at it I remind myself that patience IS a virtue and shortcutting isn't a good idea.</div>

<br/>1.  pencil box with stamps, 2 ink pads, logbook, pen, and compass inside.<br/>2.  phone<br/>3.  camera<br/>4.  pepper foam!<br/>5.  water bottle(s)<br/>6.  old folded-up clues<br/>7.  wallet with ID, keys, emergency info, etc. inside<br/>
<br/>When we're on our way out, I add some more to the stash:<br/>8.  clues<br/>9.  snacks/picnic<br/>10.  mapquest directions<br/><br/>And permanently ensconced in my car (much to my husband's delight, I'm sure) are:<br/>
- 2 different yet huge Texas mapbooks<br/>- binder full of letterbox clues<br/>- an extra logbook and some baggies<br/><br/>I think I'll be adding some band-aids and gloves to my bag at some point... seems like a good idea.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've been meaning to clean out my backpack for a while, so now seems <br>
as good a time as any.  Here goes:<br>
<br>
BIG POUCH<br>
<br>
**my logbook<br>
<br>
**SoccerChik's logbook<br>
<br>
**clues for letterboxes in Myrtle Beach, SC.  No time during our <br>
business trip to find them.  Darn company meeting didn't even allow <br>
an hour break to find one letterbox.  I'd have been happy to find <br>
one.  Just one!  Oh well...into the trash.<br>
<br>
**pencil pouch with 37 marvy markers (3 sets of 12, plus one I must <br>
have picked up from someone else during an exchange -- sorry!  If <br>
you're missing a plum colored marker let me know, I think I have it.)<br>
<br>
**large ziplock containing pinwheel stamp pad in primary colors, <br>
black stamp pad, brown stamp pad, 2 versions of my sig stamp, <br>
SoccerChik's sig stamp<br>
<br>
**empty grocery sack for picking up trash along the trail<br>
<br>
**medium ziplock containing various size ziplocks, napkins (for <br>
cleaning stamps or for umm... calls of nature), spare logbook (for <br>
replacing full logbooks in boxes)<br>
<br>
**medium ziplock with hand sanitizer, hello kitty bandaids, benadryl, <br>
and ponytail holders.<br>
<br>
**one glove (I'm not sticking both hands into a dark hole!)<br>
<br>
**small ziplock with LbTX and AQ patches (to share/exchange with new <br>
LB friends)<br>
<br>
**State Parks Pass - this needs to go back into the car<br>
<br>
**grass and twigs (emptying this out now)<br>
<br>
FRONT POCKET #1<br>
**Bug spray<br>
**Spare rechargeable battery for camera (so THAT'S where it went!)<br>
<br>
FRONT POCKET #2<br>
**Pepper spray<br>
**Lanyard with compass, whistle, and small flashlight<br>
**Piece of bubble gum (ug! not sure how long that's been in there)<br>
<br>
MESH POCKET<br>
**Empty water bottle (into the trash)<br>
<br>
When heading out the door, I'll usually add clues, camera, fresh <br>
water bottle, snacks, keys and cell phone.<br>
<br>
This was fun.  Now to clean my house!<br>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>
</p><div>This question comes up every now and then on letterboxing lists.  What's in your letterboxing bag right now???</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I carry a backpack with me and it weighs around twelve pounds.  I CAN go light if I have to, but I like to keep all my letterboxing stuff together, so I just go ahead and carry it all rather than trying to unpack and repack every time I change my mind about what goes with me.  Most of the time it's no big thing to carry.  What always amazes me is what I manage to collect and never get rid of along the way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So - what's in YOUR bag?  Tell us EVERYTHING!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's mine:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Big pouch:</div>
<div>1-14. ink pads of various colors (no duplicates - THAT would be silly!)</div>
<div>15.   An expired drivers' license - for ID.</div>
<div>16.   $5 - in case I run across a store in the woods I suppose (why DO I carry $5?)</div>
<div>17.   "In case of emergency" phone numbers</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Middle Pouch:</div>
<div>1. Gallon sized baggie full of baggies of all sorts of sizes</div>
<div>2. Gallon sized baggie of carving stuff-rubber, exacto knives, 2 sets of gouges, charcoal pencils, sharpener, pink pearl erasers.  I guess I envision myself plopping down on the side of the trail and carving out a quick stamp???</div>
<div>3. Two very small - too small - containers.  Out they go!</div>
<div>4. My logbook</div>
<div>5. Lightning's logbook</div>
<div>6. Lock'n'lock box with markers (Marvy, if you care), Fearless Fox's personal stamp, Lightning's personal stamp, my personal stamp.  My three personal travelers (why do I carry a retired traveler around?  I don't know).  An odd unknown stamp - where did I get that?  Now that worries me a little - where did THAT come from?  Looks like - a bear?  about 1.5 x 1.5, hardly been inked. Anybody missing a stamp?  I might have found it.  Eesh...</div>
<div>7. Several old clues (G'bye)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Top pouch:</div>
<div>1.  Three disposable rain ponchos (used to be four, but I used one recently).</div>
<div>2.  Headlamp</div>
<div>3.  Gloves - these and my logbook are the two things I will drive miles to get back if I lose them.  The gloves have a stain on one finger which reminds me to always be patient.  The stain is a bloodstain I got at a box location.  When I saw that I was going to have to do a little foraging, I sent Lightning back to the car for my gloves, but I got tired of waiting and started poking around.  Almost immediately I got stabbed by something and my finger bled profusely.  I finally got it stopped, put my hands in my gloves, and got the box.  After stamping in, I noticed I had bled through the leather glove, leaving a large red (now dark brown) stain.  Every time I look at it I remind myself that patience IS a virtue and shortcutting isn't a good idea.</div>
<div>4.  My GPSr</div>
<div>5.  Leatherman</div>
<div>6.  Hitchhiker</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Outside:</div>
<div>Left Strap - compass</div>
<div>Right Strap - whistle</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mesh pouches:</div>
<div>1. Bandaids</div>
<div>2. Liquid bandaid</div>
<div>3. Super glue (hardened up - hmmmm - useful)  Out with this...</div>
<div>4. 6 AA batteries.  I wonder which are good and which aren't...</div>
<div>5. 50 cents</div>
<div>6. unintelligle scraps of paper - I'm sure the meant something at some time.  Time to toss...</div>

*****************************************************<br>
<br>
I usually carry my stamp, logbook, pen and clues.  I do have a <br>
toolbox I keep in the car with extra supplies.  Since I always have a <br>
stroller and diaper bag with me, those things get tossed into it.  <br>
I've been meaning to buy a backpack, but they are hard to find this <br>
time of year.  I hate it when I find a box and it needs a little TLC <br>
and someone has to run back to the car to get the supplies.<br>
<br>
There has been alot of great information.  I am always amused by what <br>
I read and its good to know that there are others out there like me.<br>
<br>
Now...I'm off to buy a backpack.  My goal is to have one for the TALE.<br>

<p>That's a really good idea to carry the rock, and I have been meaning to get me a rock since reading about it a couple months ago - probably when you mentioned it.  SO - what do I kick out of my bag in the interest of THE ROCK?  I have room to just add it in I suppose, but I would think the rock should be heavy if considered at all...hmmm.  Fearless Fox rolls his eyes enough at my bag sometimes.  I wonder what he will think when he realizes I'm going to be transporting rocks now.  I suppose I can tell him it's the rocker coming out in me...<br/><br/>

<div><font size="2">I think I have much of the same stuff in my backpack as you all have mentioned, but I've seen some good things on each of these lists that I don't carry and will probably add to mine now! I'd say the only thing I often carry that I haven't seen on most (intelligent) people's lists is a rock! I am insistant upon hiding my boxes under a substantial rock to keep them from floating/blowing away during storms. Rocks have been know to save some of my boxes from Mother Nature's grabby fingers. Usually, I am able to find or pick up a nice rock close to where I hide the box, but if I know the area isn't "rock rich", I've been known to carry one in my backpack for long distances when necessary. (That's why I've been known to be a little gripey when I find the rock hasn't been replaced on one of my boxes.)</font></div>

<div></div>
<div class="Wj3C7c">
<div>This question comes up every now and then on letterboxing lists.  What's in your letterboxing bag right now???</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I carry a backpack with me and it weighs around twelve pounds.  I CAN go light if I have to, but I like to keep all my letterboxing stuff together, so I just go ahead and carry it all rather than trying to unpack and repack every time I change my mind about what goes with me.  Most of the time it's no big thing to carry.  What always amazes me is what I manage to collect and never get rid of along the way.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So - what's in YOUR bag?  Tell us EVERYTHING!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Here's mine:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Big pouch:</div>
<div>1-14. ink pads of various colors (no duplicates - THAT would be silly!)</div>
<div>15.   An expired drivers' license - for ID.</div>
<div>16.   $5 - in case I run across a store in the woods I suppose (why DO I carry $5?)</div>
<div>17.   "In case of emergency" phone numbers</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Middle Pouch:</div>
<div>1. Gallon sized baggie full of baggies of all sorts of sizes</div>
<div>2. Gallon sized baggie of carving stuff-rubber, exacto knives, 2 sets of gouges, charcoal pencils, sharpener, pink pearl erasers.  I guess I envision myself plopping down on the side of the trail and carving out a quick stamp???</div>
<div>3. Two very small - too small - containers.  Out they go!</div>
<div>4. My logbook</div>
<div>5. Lightning's logbook</div>
<div>6. Lock'n'lock box with markers (Marvy, if you care), Fearless Fox's personal stamp, Lightning's personal stamp, my personal stamp.  My three personal travelers (why do I carry a retired traveler around?  I don't know).  An odd unknown stamp - where did I get that?  Now that worries me a little - where did THAT come from?  Looks like - a bear?  about 1.5 x 1.5, hardly been inked. Anybody missing a stamp?  I might have found it.  Eesh...</div>
<div>7. Several old clues (G'bye)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Top pouch:</div>
<div>1.  Three disposable rain ponchos (used to be four, but I used one recently).</div>
<div>2.  Headlamp</div>
<div>3.  Gloves - these and my logbook are the two things I will drive miles to get back if I lose them.  The gloves have a stain on one finger which reminds me to always be patient.  The stain is a bloodstain I got at a box location.  When I saw that I was going to have to do a little foraging, I sent Lightning back to the car for my gloves, but I got tired of waiting and started poking around.  Almost immediately I got stabbed by something and my finger bled profusely.  I finally got it stopped, put my hands in my gloves, and got the box.  After stamping in, I noticed I had bled through the leather glove, leaving a large red (now dark brown) stain.  Every time I look at it I remind myself that patience IS a virtue and shortcutting isn't a good idea.</div>
<div>4.  My GPSr</div>
<div>5.  Leatherman</div>
<div>6.  Hitchhiker</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Outside:</div>
<div>Left Strap - compass</div>
<div>Right Strap - whistle</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Mesh pouches:</div>
<div>1. Bandaids</div>
<div>2. Liquid bandaid</div>
<div>3. Super glue (hardened up - hmmmm - useful)  Out with this...</div>
<div>4. 6 AA batteries.  I wonder which are good and which aren't...</div>
<div>5. 50 cents</div>
<div>6. unintelligle scraps of paper - I'm sure the meant something at some time.  Time to toss...</div>
<div>7. large acorn I found in Oklahoma a couple years ago.  Now I should put this in my nature collection, but at this point it has traveled with me for a long time.  I'm gonna have to think about what to do with it!</div>
<div>8. a piece of moss I found on the trail recently.  Nature collection - here it comes.</div></div></div>
<div>
<div>
<div></div>
<div class="Wj3C7c">9. various pieces of trail trash...right in the trash can - two points!<br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/></div></div>

I just realized that my Park Pass will expire on the 29th.  I bought <br>
it at last year's TALE event.  Ahh the memories!<br>
<br>
So sorry to hear about your friend getting banged up.  But glad YOU <br>
are okay!  Gotta love those Jeeps... almost indestructible!<br>
<br>
Can you tell I REALL don't want to do this housework.  Sigh.<br>

> From Puddle Splasher: yes, Yes and YES! Love your philosophy to <br>
keep one hand uninjured (obviously so you can still stamp into the <br>
logbook while the other hand swells to unimaginable proportions); I <br>
need to put my LbTx patches back into my backpack instead of leaving <br>
them safely on my worktable; AND... the State Parks Pass thing: mine <br>
is on my dining room table with my other valuables from my Jeep right <br>
now. I got rear-ended (big time) by a huge Dodge Ram pick-up last <br>
week in Dallas, and my jeep is going to the doctor Monday morning. <br>
Funny thing - the big ol' pickup had to be towed in and is in really <br>
bad shape- my jeep was drivable. I took my jeep to the same body shop <br>
where they are working on the pickup and the manager was in shock. He <br>
said, having seen the pickup, he couldn't imagine how bad the car he <br>
ran into must be (me!). In fact, he said, now that he has both pieces <br>
to the puzzle, he will have a better understanding of what he needs <br>
to check on the jeep that may not have been otherwise obvious. <br>
Luckily, this shop has a certified Jeep specialist, so hopefully <br>
he'll give my "friend" the TLC it deserves. THEN... I must remember <br>
to put my park pass back into the Jeep before heading for Bastrop!<br>

<div> </div>
<div>Let me warn you about buying a backpack - it's one of those things you'll never be completely happy with.  Once you shop for one, you'll keep shopping long after you've gotten the first one.  My backpack is about three years old - comfortable and familiar at this point, and yet I can't go to Gander Mountain without looking for a new one.  I've seen a couple fishing bags I'm considering, but so far I've resisted.  Some things I really like about mine - a loop for my keys inside one of the zip pockets and padded straps.  Outside pockets that strap tight against the bag (i.e. not loose so stuff can fall out easily).  Three decent sized pockets - not too big so things fall all the way to the bottom, but big enough to carry big things - like rocks.<br/>

<p>Adding the weight of the rock(s) to your backpack will give you good <br/>practice when you go backpacking. If I remember correctly, your pack <br/>was heavier than you expected. :)<br/><br/>*****************************************************<br/>
<br/>I usually carry my stamp, logbook, pen and clues. I do have a <br/>toolbox I keep in the car with extra supplies. Since I always have a <br/>stroller and diaper bag with me, those things get tossed into it. <br/>I've been meaning to buy a backpack, but they are hard to find this <br/>
time of year. I hate it when I find a box and it needs a little TLC <br/>and someone has to run back to the car to get the supplies.<br/><br/>There has been alot of great information. I am always amused by what <br/>I read and its good to know that there are others out there like me.<br/>
<br/>Now...I'm off to buy a backpack. My goal is to have one for the TALE.

I know the<br/>&gt; &gt; area isn't "rock rich", I've been known to carry one in my <br/>backpack for long<br/>&gt; &gt; distances when necessary. (That's why I've been known to be a <br/>little gripey<br/>

&gt; &gt; *Subject:* [letterboxingtexas] What's in YOUR bag?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; This question comes up every now and then on letterboxing <br/>lists.<br/>&gt; &gt; What's in your letterboxing bag right now???<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I carry a backpack with me and it weighs around twelve pounds. I <br/>CAN go<br/>&gt; &gt; light if I have to, but I like to keep all my letterboxing stuff <br/>together,<br/>&gt; &gt; so I just go ahead and carry it all rather than trying to unpack <br/>
and repack<br/>&gt; &gt; every time I change my mind about what goes with me. Most of the <br/>time it's<br/>&gt; &gt; no big thing to carry. What always amazes me is what I manage to <br/>collect<br/>&gt; &gt; and never get rid of along the way.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; So - what's in YOUR bag? Tell us EVERYTHING!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Here's mine:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Big pouch:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1-14. ink pads of various colors (no duplicates - THAT would be <br/>
silly!)<br/>&gt; &gt; 15. An expired drivers' license - for ID.<br/>&gt; &gt; 16. $5 - in case I run across a store in the woods I suppose <br/>(why DO I<br/>&gt; &gt; carry $5?)<br/>&gt; &gt; 17. "In case of emergency" phone numbers<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Middle Pouch:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. Gallon sized baggie full of baggies of all sorts of sizes<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. Gallon sized baggie of carving stuff-rubber, exacto knives, 2 <br/>sets of<br/>&gt; &gt; gouges, charcoal pencils, sharpener, pink pearl erasers. I guess <br/>
I envision<br/>&gt; &gt; myself plopping down on the side of the trail and carving out a <br/>quick<br/>&gt; &gt; stamp???<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. Two very small - too small - containers. Out they go!<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. My logbook<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. Lightning's logbook<br/>
&gt; &gt; 6. Lock'n'lock box with markers (Marvy, if you care), Fearless <br/>Fox's<br/>&gt; &gt; personal stamp, Lightning's personal stamp, my personal stamp. <br/>My three<br/>&gt; &gt; personal travelers (why do I carry a retired traveler around? I <br/>
don't<br/>&gt; &gt; know). An odd unknown stamp - where did I get that? Now that <br/>worries me a<br/>&gt; &gt; little - where did THAT come from? Looks like - a bear? about <br/>1.5 x 1.5,<br/>&gt; &gt; hardly been inked. Anybody missing a stamp? I might have found <br/>
it. Eesh...<br/>&gt; &gt; 7. Several old clues (G'bye)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Top pouch:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. Three disposable rain ponchos (used to be four, but I used one<br/>&gt; &gt; recently).<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. Headlamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; 3. Gloves - these and my logbook are the two things I will drive <br/>miles to<br/>&gt; &gt; get back if I lose them. The gloves have a stain on one finger <br/>which<br/>&gt; &gt; reminds me to always be patient. The stain is a bloodstain I got <br/>
at a box<br/>&gt; &gt; location. When I saw that I was going to have to do a little <br/>foraging, I<br/>&gt; &gt; sent Lightning back to the car for my gloves, but I got tired of <br/>waiting and<br/>&gt; &gt; started poking around. Almost immediately I got stabbed by <br/>
something and my<br/>&gt; &gt; finger bled profusely. I finally got it stopped, put my hands in <br/>my gloves,<br/>&gt; &gt; and got the box. After stamping in, I noticed I had bled through <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; leather glove, leaving a large red (now dark brown) stain. Every <br/>
time I<br/>&gt; &gt; look at it I remind myself that patience IS a virtue and <br/>shortcutting isn't<br/>&gt; &gt; a good idea.<br/>&gt; &gt; 4. My GPSr<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. Leatherman<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. Hitchhiker<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Outside:<br/>&gt; &gt; Left Strap - compass<br/>&gt; &gt; Right Strap - whistle<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Mesh pouches:<br/>&gt; &gt; 1. Bandaids<br/>&gt; &gt; 2. Liquid bandaid<br/>&gt; &gt; 3. Super glue (hardened up - hmmmm - useful) Out with this...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 4. 6 AA batteries. I wonder which are good and which aren't...<br/>&gt; &gt; 5. 50 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; 6. unintelligle scraps of paper - I'm sure the meant something at <br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt; time. Time to toss...<br/>
&gt; &gt; 7. large acorn I found in Oklahoma a couple years ago. Now I <br/>should put<br/>&gt; &gt; this in my nature collection, but at this point it has traveled <br/>with me for<br/>&gt; &gt; a long time. I'm gonna have to think about what to do with it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; 8. a piece of moss I found on the trail recently. Nature <br/>collection -<br/>&gt; &gt; here it comes.<br/>&gt; &gt; 9. various pieces of trail trash...right in the trash can - two <br/>points!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --<br/>

<p>When refering to "Your bag", do you carry a Day Pack or a back pack <br/>similar to what students carry. I am looking at the student style.

<div class="Wj3C7c">&gt; Good point about the weight - and actually, that's one reason I go <br/>ahead and<br/>&gt; carry the whole pack, so I'm better able to carry more when <br/>needed. Still<br/>&gt; though, that backpack when we went overnighting wound up being <br/>
TWICE what I<br/>&gt; normally carry!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Let me warn you about buying a backpack - it's one of those things <br/>you'll<br/>&gt; never be completely happy with. Once you shop for one, you'll keep <br/>
shopping<br/>&gt; long after you've gotten the first one. My backpack is about three <br/>years<br/>&gt; old - comfortable and familiar at this point, and yet I can't go to <br/>Gander<br/>&gt; Mountain without looking for a new one. I've seen a couple fishing <br/>
bags I'm<br/>&gt; considering, but so far I've resisted. Some things I really like <br/>about mine<br/>&gt; - a loop for my keys inside one of the zip pockets and padded <br/>straps.<br/>&gt; Outside pockets that strap tight against the bag (i.e. not loose so <br/>
stuff<br/>&gt; can fall out easily). Three decent sized pockets - not too big so <br/>things<br/>&gt; fall all the way to the bottom, but big enough to carry big things -<br/>like<br/>&gt; rocks.<br/>&gt; <br/></div></div>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every time I change my mind about what goes with me. Most of <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; time it's<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no big thing to carry. What always amazes me is what I manage <br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; collect<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and never get rid of along the way.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So - what's in YOUR bag? Tell us EVERYTHING!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Here's mine:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Big pouch:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1-14. ink pads of various colors (no duplicates - THAT would <br/>be<br/>&gt; &gt; silly!)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 15. An expired drivers' license - for ID.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 16. $5 - in case I run across a store in the woods I suppose<br/>
&gt; &gt; (why DO I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carry $5?)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 17. "In case of emergency" phone numbers<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Middle Pouch:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Gallon sized baggie full of baggies of all sorts of sizes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Gallon sized baggie of carving stuff-rubber, exacto <br/>knives, 2<br/>&gt; &gt; sets of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gouges, charcoal pencils, sharpener, pink pearl erasers. I <br/>guess<br/>&gt; &gt; I envision<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself plopping down on the side of the trail and carving out <br/>a<br/>&gt; &gt; quick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamp???<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Two very small - too small - containers. Out they go!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. My logbook<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Lightning's logbook<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. Lock'n'lock box with markers (Marvy, if you care), Fearless<br/>&gt; &gt; Fox's<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personal stamp, Lightning's personal stamp, my personal stamp.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My three<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personal travelers (why do I carry a retired traveler around? <br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; don't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know). An odd unknown stamp - where did I get that? Now that<br/>&gt; &gt; worries me a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little - where did THAT come from? Looks like - a bear? about<br/>&gt; &gt; 1.5 x 1.5,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hardly been inked. Anybody missing a stamp? I might have found<br/>&gt; &gt; it. Eesh...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Several old clues (G'bye)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Top pouch:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Three disposable rain ponchos (used to be four, but I used <br/>one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recently).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Headlamp<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Gloves - these and my logbook are the two things I will <br/>
drive<br/>&gt; &gt; miles to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get back if I lose them. The gloves have a stain on one finger<br/>&gt; &gt; which<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reminds me to always be patient. The stain is a bloodstain I <br/>
got<br/>&gt; &gt; at a box<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; location. When I saw that I was going to have to do a little<br/>&gt; &gt; foraging, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sent Lightning back to the car for my gloves, but I got tired <br/>
of<br/>&gt; &gt; waiting and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started poking around. Almost immediately I got stabbed by<br/>&gt; &gt; something and my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finger bled profusely. I finally got it stopped, put my hands <br/>
in<br/>&gt; &gt; my gloves,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and got the box. After stamping in, I noticed I had bled <br/>through<br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leather glove, leaving a large red (now dark brown) stain. <br/>
Every<br/>&gt; &gt; time I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look at it I remind myself that patience IS a virtue and<br/>&gt; &gt; shortcutting isn't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a good idea.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. My GPSr<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. Leatherman<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Bandaids<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Liquid bandaid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Super glue (hardened up - hmmmm - useful) Out with this...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. 6 AA batteries. I wonder which are good and which aren't...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. 50 cents<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. unintelligle scraps of paper - I'm sure the meant <br/>something at<br/>&gt; &gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time. Time to toss...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. large acorn I found in Oklahoma a couple years ago. Now I<br/>
&gt; &gt; should put<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this in my nature collection, but at this point it has <br/>traveled<br/>&gt; &gt; with me for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a long time. I'm gonna have to think about what to do with it!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8. a piece of moss I found on the trail recently. Nature<br/>&gt; &gt; collection -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; here it comes.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9. various pieces of trail trash...right in the trash can - <br/>
