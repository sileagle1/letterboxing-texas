letterboxing fun this Sunday!<br>
<br>
My newest letterboxing cohort "Crazy Daisy" and I went letterboxing <br>
this weekend!  First we went to check out Xi-Ca-Yo in Nac which alas <br>
was TOO thrilling for either one of us, as it included wading <br>
through waist high water mocassin infested waters!  We only saw two <br>
of the snakes, but that was two too many!  We have decided to come <br>
back in the winter when hopefully the water will be down more and <br>
the snakes are in hibernation.<br>
<br>
This was her first time letterboxing, so we had quite an eventful <br>
day, we searched for six different boxes--not including Xi-Ca-<br>
Yo...AND she found not one but THREE hitchikers!  Alas, one was a <br>
hitchhiker I had placed, and another one that my other cohort <br>
Bangwell Putt had hidden.  But the third one was the August Hello <br>
Kitty by Smart Cookie.<br>
<br>
So!  Not only was she overly jumpy after the snake experiences, but <br>
then she was tired from all the hitchhikers.  Quote:  "Boy this is a <br>
lot of work!"  She was tired, exhausted from our romp, BUT!  she <br>
still thinks it is a fun idea and her husband is even thinking of <br>
joining the fun!<br>
<br>
Love you all!<br>
<br>
Josephine<br>
