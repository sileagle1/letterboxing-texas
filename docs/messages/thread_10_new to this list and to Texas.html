<br/>
Our family letterboxing name is the "happyhomeschoolers". We just <br/>
moved to north Houston in December. We have been boxing since March <br/>
of last year.  A dear friend in Virginia introduced us to the hobby <br/>
and we have enjoyed it ever since! Our PFX count is P3F40X34E1.<br/>
I like to keep track of those things for fun.  We've been to one <br/>
event back in VA and it was a blast. So I really hope we can attend <br/>
the 1st Texas event.<br/>
<br/>
Among many things,what I enjoy most about letterboxing is going to <br/>
places that I never new exsisted. <br/>
<br/>
We haven't been 'boxing in Texas yet (still going thru all those <br/>
moving boxes), but I'm getting the itch to go hiking again!<br/>
<br/>
Looking forward to meeting some you on the trails!<br/>
<br/>
