three EXCELLENT hitchhikers waiting for rides.  These hitchhikers <br/>
boast excellent carving, a creative logbook, humor, first finder <br/>
prize, and wide travels...some are examples of all of the above. If <br/>
you are down this way, I hope you will give them a lift. <br/>
<br/>
And don't overlook the Beehive Hostel stamp and logbook. It is the <br/>
smallest resident and is buried (no pun intended!) in the bottom <br/>
of 'dorm #1'.<br/>

&gt; Leave at least one hitcher awaiting more takers.<br/>
&gt; Take or leave; help them travel well. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, please excuse the awful rhyme. LOL!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You can exchange hitchhikers, take one without an exchange or only <br/>
&gt; drop some off here, as you think best advances any hitchhikers <br/>
along <br/>
&gt; their way. Any exchanges made don't have to be even exchanges, <br/>
such <br/>
&gt; as if you are leaving for a long letterboxing excursion and want <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; place quite a few hitchhikers along the way. Just be sure to <br/>
always <br/>
&gt; leave at least one hitchhiker in residence at all times. I am <br/>
going <br/>
&gt; to try to keep the boxes stocked with several hitchhikers at all <br/>
&gt; times.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This hostel does have it's own box stamp in one of the boxes, and <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; is a 'three parter' of sorts, that can add to the total stamped <br/>
&gt; image if you come to visit more than once. <br/>
