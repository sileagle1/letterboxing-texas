                    <html><body><div>Yesterday I put out a new scout series and changed up my old one a bit on paper only.  The old one will be Cub Scout Series and the new one is Girl Scout Series.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also changed up the clue link so that I could use the intro material for both series and then the clues for each branches off from there.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you got the link for my Scout Series clues before yesterday, that link won't work any more.  If you still need it, email me off-list and I'll send it to you.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Please note that on this box particularly, if I give the clues to you, I give them to YOU, so please don't pass them along.  I want to know who has the clues since this series is geared toward children.<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy
