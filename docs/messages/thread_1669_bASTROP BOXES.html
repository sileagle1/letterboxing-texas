                    <div class="plaintext-content">I haven't been back to Bastrop since the first<br/>
gathering two years ago, but I can tell you it is<br/>
great place to box.  There are some really good boxes<br/>
there.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't forget that Buescher State Park is also there. <br/>
One of the first letterboxes in Texas is in Buescher -<br/>
Eoghan's Lost Pines.  I think you'll have to see if<br/>
someone has clues for it because I see the link on it<br/>
is dead.  It's one of those stamps you need to get if<br/>
at all possible because of its historical value, not<br/>
to mention it's a fun box to find.<br/>
<br/>
We had been in letterboxing for about six months when<br/>
we went to the Bastrop gathering, AND our area was<br/>
sparsely populated and only had boxes because of<br/>
Silver Eagle and Baby Bear.  When we went to Bastrop,<br/>
we were overwhelmed by the people AND by how many<br/>
boxes there were to find!  Funny that my county -<br/>
Cherokee - WITHOUT a state park now has more boxes<br/>
than Bastrop County!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I know you'll enjoy Bastrop!  <br/>

If anyone has not been to Bastrop Park you are missing a treat. The <br/>

That is a favorite of my family's, and the first of<br/>
Lightning's several letterboxing misadventures<br/>
happened while hunting that box.  Without giving too<br/>
much away, he was crossing the stream there at the<br/>
waterfall and slipped and went over.  It isn't a huge<br/>
waterfall, but he was a little guy - 8 years old and<br/>
short for his age.  He was hanging on by his fingers<br/>
and Fearless Fox and I (we were on opposite sides of<br/>
the stream) quickly assessed which of us was closer<br/>
and in better position to grab him.  FF wound up<br/>
grabbing him and pulling him up and I hauled him over<br/>
to the path side of the stream.  It is rarely boring<br/>
to go letterboxing with him!<br/>
<br/>
As for These Boots, that one was placed at the Bastrop<br/>
gathering and we never could find it.  Lots of other<br/>
folks did - not us.  Hope it's still around too<br/>
because I want to someday go back and prove I can find<br/>
it - this time.  Doesn't sound promising though...<br/>
