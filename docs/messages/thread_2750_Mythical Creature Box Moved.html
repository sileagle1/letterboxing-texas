<div>If you are planning to 
look for the second part of the Mythical Creatures series, please take note of 
the change in clues.  I had to move the fifth box for a bit.  I was 
walking on Sunday and decided to just take a quick peek at the boxes, when to my 
surprise a mama bird flew out at me and scared me half to death.  I checked 
on the box (which is hidden in the crook of a multi trunked tree) and saw not 
only the box, but a nest filled with eggs (I'm pretty sure it was a nuthatch) 
DIRECTLY below the box.  So I decided to move it for a bit, I don't want 
anything to happen to those little eggs.  Thanks to dewberry who came along 
while I moved the box just in case I was attacked by mama bird (I wasn't).  
Oh, and guess how many eggs she had?  Yep, 5.  Guess I won't be the 
only "Mother of Five" for much longer!  MO5</div></body></html>

<div>Isn't that just the coolest thing - 5 little eggs in a 
nest!  Of course, it had to be 5 eggs, since you were the one who put the 
box there, Mo5!  Maybe you should create a new letterbox to honor this, 
just in time for Mother's Day, too.  Much better to discover a nuthatch 
nest near the box than a snake!  </div>
