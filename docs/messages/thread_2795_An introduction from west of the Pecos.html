 My name is Warm Front and I live in Alpine, TX where I attend Sul Ross <br/>
State University as a mathematics major. I'm what is known as a "non-<br/>
traditional" student, which is a polite way of saying that I'm a 35 <br/>
year old college freshman ;) I moved here in late December of last year <br/>
(from Houston), and discovered letterboxing a month later while reading <br/>
about an upcoming novel from an action writer that I enjoy (Novel: <br/>
Scavenger, Author: David Morrell &lt;--- most famous for creating the <br/>
character Rambo).<br/>
I was hooked after 10 seconds, and it only took that long to get my g/f <br/>
(Cold Front) hooked as well, but there aren't many boxes out here, so <br/>
we waited a couple weeks and planned. Our first box, was in Valentine, <br/>
TX on Valentines Day, and we've been going strong ever since. <br/>
<br/>
I guess that's plenty for an introduction.<br/>

<div><br/>My husband was a non-traditional student too!  My impolite term for him was Obnoxious Old Dude.  You know the guy (ARE the guy?)?  The one who says "Hey Professor, didn't you say we were going to have a test today?"  Or "But wait, I know class is over, but aren't you going to give us some homework?"  Or "Why yes, I DID read the chapter and I am FULLY prepared to discuss the theory of randomness."  The one who can chat with the teacher about real life because he has LIVED real life.  The one who scolds the kiddies for skipping class?  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh yes.  I was a traditional student when I was in college (as traditional as one can be when one squeezes a four year degree into seven years).  I used to cringe when I saw the Obnoxious Old Dude walk in.  But alas, he always sat near me and I always wound up thinking he was pretty cool in spite of himself.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My question is - if you are 35 years old, what ever made you think you wanted to be a MATH major???  Are ya nuts??? (Just kidding)</div>

hmmm, why a math major? Well, I was really interested in being a <br/>
Social Studies Teacher, but it's actually an education degree, so if <br/>
teaching doesn't work out, then the degree is basically useless. I <br/>
want to stay in Texas (preferably the Trans-Pecos region) and there <br/>
just isn't a big emphasis on geography, or sociology, etc in most <br/>
Texas schools, so I'd be stuck applying for Civics/Government teacher <br/>
positions, that are traditionally given to people with Poli-Sci <br/>
degrees in good schools, and football coaches in small schools. <br/>
History, has a similar story, the degree is useless without a PhD, <br/>
and 90% of the history teachers in TX have the same first <br/>
name...Coach.<br/>
<br/>
I have no interest in being a coach, and I need my BS to be able to <br/>
earn me a living before it turns into an MS... The dire need right <br/>
now, is for Bi-lingual teachers in elementary schools, and <br/>
math/science teachers in high schools. Sul Ross doesn't have a <br/>
Physics degree plan, which is my preferred science subject, so I <br/>
chose Mathematics, because of demand and if teaching doesn't work <br/>
out, I can always get into demographics (Math meets Geography) which <br/>
is fine with me. <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
uhhh sorry about that, I didn't mean to write so much. <br/>
<br/>
As for my letterbox in Alpine, it's not spectacular or anythng, but <br/>
it's a start. I just planted one near Presidio, and I like that stamp <br/>
much better (planted for PAL day). I've posted it to AQ but it's not <br/>
on LBNA yet(soon, I promise).<br/>

&gt; Hmmmm....  welcome to letterboxing - Texas style.  I am just a ways <br/>
west of<br/>

passing<br/>

&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I too majored in math for about 20 years, with a minor in <br/>
ballistics and<br/>
&gt; explosives.  My math went like 1+1=0.  1 enemy combatant + 1 shot = <br/>
0 enemy<br/>
&gt; combatants.  Worked pretty well - my son carries on where I left <br/>
off.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Now-days - for the last 12 years anyway, it is boring (but safe) <br/>
electronics<br/>
&gt; in a power plant.  3 times the pay for 1/3 the responsibility, and <br/>
I don't<br/>
&gt; need to leap out of aircraft or get shot at to collect.  At least <br/>
not yet.<br/>
&gt; But there is no excitement.....<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Passed thru Alpine last Oct, missed your box but found a few <br/>
others.  You<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks for the welcome y'all. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; hmmm, why a math major? Well, I was really interested in being a <br/>
&gt; Social Studies Teacher, but it's actually an education degree, so <br/>
if <br/>
&gt; teaching doesn't work out, then the degree is basically useless. I <br/>
&gt; want to stay in Texas (preferably the Trans-Pecos region) and there <br/>
&gt; just isn't a big emphasis on geography, or sociology, etc in most <br/>
&gt; Texas schools, so I'd be stuck applying for Civics/Government <br/>
teacher <br/>
&gt; positions, that are traditionally given to people with Poli-Sci <br/>
&gt; degrees in good schools, and football coaches in small schools. <br/>
&gt; History, has a similar story, the degree is useless without a PhD, <br/>
&gt; and 90% of the history teachers in TX have the same first <br/>
&gt; name...Coach.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have no interest in being a coach, and I need my BS to be able to <br/>
&gt; earn me a living before it turns into an MS... The dire need right <br/>
&gt; now, is for Bi-lingual teachers in elementary schools, and <br/>
&gt; math/science teachers in high schools. Sul Ross doesn't have a <br/>
&gt; Physics degree plan, which is my preferred science subject, so I <br/>
&gt; chose Mathematics, because of demand and if teaching doesn't work <br/>
&gt; out, I can always get into demographics (Math meets Geography) <br/>
which <br/>
&gt; is fine with me. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; uhhh sorry about that, I didn't mean to write so much. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As for my letterbox in Alpine, it's not spectacular or anythng, but <br/>
&gt; it's a start. I just planted one near Presidio, and I like that <br/>
stamp <br/>
&gt; much better (planted for PAL day). I've posted it to AQ but it's <br/>
not <br/>
&gt; on LBNA yet(soon, I promise).<br/>

I wish there were a more interesting story to our names. We didn't <br/>
want anything that implied current interests, because we figured from <br/>
the beggining that we'd do this for a long time, so we were aiming <br/>
for trailnames that 1)would age well, 2)were somewhat outdoorsy and 3)<br/>
would identify us as a couple without being too cute or entirely <br/>
dependent on the other (in the unlikely event that we split up, i <br/>
wouldn't want to change my trailname). Having set the criteria, we <br/>
made lists of names, and ultimately she is ALWAYS cold (sweaters even <br/>
during summer in the desert) and I am usually hot (anything above 68 <br/>
degrees, and I think it's time for air conditioning:), so Warm Front <br/>
and Cold Front were born. <br/>

introduction is in order.<br/>
&gt; My name is Warm Front and I live in Alpine, TX where I attend Sul <br/>
Ross <br/>
&gt; State University as a mathematics major. I'm what is known as <br/>
a "non-<br/>
&gt; traditional" student, which is a polite way of saying that I'm a 35 <br/>
&gt; year old college freshman ;) I moved here in late December of last <br/>
year <br/>
&gt; (from Houston), and discovered letterboxing a month later while <br/>
reading <br/>
&gt; about an upcoming novel from an action writer that I enjoy (Novel: <br/>
&gt; Scavenger, Author: David Morrell &lt;--- most famous for creating the <br/>
&gt; character Rambo).<br/>
&gt; I was hooked after 10 seconds, and it only took that long to get my <br/>
g/f <br/>
&gt; (Cold Front) hooked as well, but there aren't many boxes out here, <br/>
so <br/>
&gt; we waited a couple weeks and planned. Our first box, was in <br/>
Valentine, <br/>
&gt; TX on Valentines Day, and we've been going strong ever since. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess that's plenty for an introduction.<br/>

<div>Welcome, Warm Front &amp; Cold Front.  We were out in your territory 
in March and had your Valentine clues in hand but just didn't make it there, but 
we did find a few boxes in that area (Davis Mts., Big Bend, and Marfa) while 
there and left a new one in Marfa, too (Giant).  All of the boxes we found 
were good ones, good stamps, interesting locations (my personal 
major criteria for finding boxes:  good locations), and next trip to 
the far far west Texas area, we'll be sure to look for yours 
too.    What a lovely area you live in - Antelope Heaven!</div>

already by the farsightedess of your researching possibilities connected with 
your choice of math major, but any couple farsighted enough to consider in

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wish there were a more interesting story to our<br/>
&gt; names. We didn't <br/>
&gt; want anything that implied current interests,<br/>
&gt; because we figured from <br/>
&gt; the beggining that we'd do this for a long time, so<br/>
&gt; we were aiming <br/>
&gt; for trailnames that 1)would age well, 2)were<br/>
&gt; somewhat outdoorsy and 3)<br/>
&gt; would identify us as a couple without being too cute<br/>
&gt; or entirely <br/>

&gt; we split up, i <br/>
&gt; wouldn't want to change my trailname). Having set<br/>
&gt; the criteria, we <br/>
&gt; made lists of names, and ultimately she is ALWAYS<br/>
&gt; cold (sweaters even <br/>
&gt; during summer in the desert) and I am usually hot<br/>
&gt; (anything above 68 <br/>
&gt; degrees, and I think it's time for air<br/>
&gt; conditioning:), so Warm Front <br/>
&gt; and Cold Front were born. <br/>

&gt; &gt;           Hi y'all - I just signed up, and it<br/>
&gt; seems and <br/>
&gt; introduction is in order.<br/>
&gt; &gt; My name is Warm Front and I live in Alpine, TX<br/>
&gt; where I attend Sul <br/>
&gt; Ross <br/>
&gt; &gt; State University as a mathematics major. I'm what<br/>
&gt; is known as <br/>
&gt; a "non-<br/>
&gt; &gt; traditional" student, which is a polite way of<br/>
&gt; saying that I'm a 35 <br/>
&gt; &gt; year old college freshman ;) I moved here in late<br/>
&gt; December of last <br/>
&gt; year <br/>
&gt; &gt; (from Houston), and discovered letterboxing a<br/>
&gt; month later while <br/>
&gt; reading <br/>
&gt; &gt; about an upcoming novel from an action writer that<br/>
&gt; I enjoy (Novel: <br/>
&gt; &gt; Scavenger, Author: David Morrell &lt;--- most famous<br/>
&gt; for creating the <br/>
&gt; &gt; character Rambo).<br/>
&gt; &gt; I was hooked after 10 seconds, and it only took<br/>
&gt; that long to get my <br/>
&gt; g/f <br/>
&gt; &gt; (Cold Front) hooked as well, but there aren't many<br/>
&gt; boxes out here, <br/>
&gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; we waited a couple weeks and planned. Our first<br/>
&gt; box, was in <br/>
&gt; Valentine, <br/>
&gt; &gt; TX on Valentines Day, and we've been going strong<br/>
&gt; ever since. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess that's plenty for an introduction.<br/>

Anyhow, Valentine is only 2 towns over form where we live, but that's <br/>
still about 60 miles one way. Things are are pretty spread out in <br/>
west Texas. Hell, we actually don't have ANY boxes within 25 miles of <br/>
here (except the one I just planted one on campus, but it's nothing <br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I used to work with two ladies who hated each other - and one was hot-natured and one was cold-natured.  The thermostat was right by my office door and I used to watch them walk back and forth to the thermostat turning it up and down, and the time between trips would get shorter and shorter as the day wore on and they got madder and madder at each other.  And then they complained they didn't have enough time during the day to do their work, so one always came in early and left on time and the other always came in on time and worked late.  Being much younger then than I am now, I made the naive suggestion that if they would just leave the thermostat alone they might get their work done,  I may as well have doused myself with kerosene, lit the match and handed it to them.
