on three DIFFERENT trails for the past four days in a row lugging and <br>
looking for a great spot for this rather large box... It's pretty <br>
sparce out there right now. I DID scope out a good place last night, <br>
and then some crazy bad weather hit. Instantaiously! So I wasn't able <br>
to actually get the bus there yet... I will be going back out after <br>
this ice storm in a couple of days and plan on posting immediately <br>
after that. <br>
<br>
Thanks for the patience!<br>
