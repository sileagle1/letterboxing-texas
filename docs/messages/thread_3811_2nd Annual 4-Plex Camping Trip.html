<div> </div>
<div>We went there last year, same weekend. This year we were in the mainstream campground, right by the boat dock and some nice clean bathrooms (occupied by, much do my 23 old DD's dismay, 1000s of humongous spiders).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Friday, we checked up on the letterbox that Wermbo planted last year. It was doing just fine. I grabbed the 4-Plex HH that we left in it and plan on sending it on it's way soon. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>On Saturday, we went to find the <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=1616">Possum Kingdom </a>letterbox. This box is so awesome. It did take us a minute to find it though. First a ginormous tan colored snake tried to eat us. But, thanks to the great in-service on snakes, I was not afraid. I knew that ugly creature with the forked tongue was more afraid of us than we were of him. Plus, he was so stupid, it took three rocks to his head to finally get out of our way. Well, he went right and for some reason we did too. After about 5 minutes of searching the rock that he was in, we realized we went the wrong way. Then, we didn't go far enough and realized that the cedar tree we were looking by was not "the cedar tree". Finally, our perseverance paid off, and we found the right spot. I sat on that spot and said that I wasn't going to move for 15 minutes, and I didn't. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I did try to stamp in too soon though. You know how you can tell you are stamping in to soon? Well, let me tell you. When you stamp in and your hand is shaking so bad that your stamp is a blob, that's too soon :) This box deserves blue diamond status in my book.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, after a half bottle of water and some deep breathing, we headed back down the mountain (you can call it a hill if you want, it was a mountain). I had to stop 4 times, 3 times to say, "OMG, look at that view." and once to almost kill myself by falling down the rest of the way. I had that part covered though. I never go first. I always let someone go before me so they can break my fall :) This time, it was my LSS, Gary.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After the find Amie of Wermbo and I of BF set up a carving party with the under 10 set. Michael and Cassie, both 7 carved while Avery, 3 stamped (okay, mostly he colored his hand, which I thought was adorable. Amie, not so much, lol). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sunday, we headed home and stopped at Mineral Wells SP. Amie actually wanted to know if I thought <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=41469">this </a>box would be hard, seriously. I told her to have fun and take great pictures for me, but I would sit that one out this time. So, we went after <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gBoxId=15122">this </a>one instead. As per usual, it took us a minute to find it. I've always believed in the adventure of it. And, we would never had known there was a shooting range down that trail if Wermbo hadn't gone down that particular trail. It was exciting for Carrie to actually find the box. Obviously, there were no spiders nearby.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We scoped out the campground for next trip. It may just be at Mineral Wells.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm now sitting at 99 finds. Maybe by Christmas I will have made an even hundred. If not, that's okay too. You know me, baby steps.</div>

<div>I am so excited to hear that the Possum Kingdom box is still there. I've never looked for it, but it's been on my list for a long time! I have a cousin with a lake house there and she keeps inviting me to come visit her. To hear about those boxes at PK is definitely incentive to run over there. Thanks for the update!</div>

                    <html><body><div>Nice trip Janet!  I'm really envious - After our failed attempt at doing an overnighter on the 4C weekend before last, I feel the need to camp badly.  I think the last time I camped was when I went to scout camp with my son's troop, at the end of June.  Now THAT was a first for me in a long, long time - camping in the hot, hot heat!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We pretty much put our camping gear away during the summer months because the crowds and the heat and the bugs just aren't enjoyable to us, so now that it's cooled off a little, we've been pulling everything out and getting it shaped back up and restocked, and airing everything out.  Kind of like Spring cleaning in reverse...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm so glad to hear Ruby's box is still there and in good condition!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As a matter of opinion, I've decided that choosing your milestone boxes is a lot of fun.  Have you thought about perusing the listings and finding one you WANT to be your 100th, and then go for it?  As it happens, two of Lucy Locket's boxes were my 100th and my 300th - which I thought was pretty cool since she and I share half a name, and since her boxes are always so good anyway!</div>
