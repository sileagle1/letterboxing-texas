I have ran across alot, pertaining to logbooks.<br>
<br>
I have been to several boxes where people are not stamping on the back <br>
of the page.  I know that some paper that logbooks are made of are to <br>
thin to stamp on both sides as it bleeds through.  But there are also <br>
some paper where it is very thick and can easily be stamped on both <br>
sides and allow the logbook to used longer???  I never know if I <br>
should stamp on the first back side that is available or continue on <br>
the next page to stay in date order.<br>
