                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, there are alot of letterboxes in Jacksonville. We went today and <br/>
Barefoot Lucy was just a few steps in front of us all the way. I <br/>
really thought we might beat her or GG finding the June series first <br/>
but no such luck. We could spend a week or two gathering all the boxes <br/>
in Jacksonville. Thought about finding a motel and staying at least 2 <br/>
more days but it is hard on old people to letterbox more than one day <br/>
at a time. I will be so sore tomorrow from finding the Love's lookout <br/>
boxes I won't be able to get out of bed. I might as well be my very <br/>
own bed so we drove home. See you on the trails. Adams Trails<br/>
