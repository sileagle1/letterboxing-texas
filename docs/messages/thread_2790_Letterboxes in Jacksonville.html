Barefoot Lucy was just a few steps in front of us all the way. I <br>
really thought we might beat her or GG finding the June series first <br>
but no such luck. We could spend a week or two gathering all the boxes <br>
in Jacksonville. Thought about finding a motel and staying at least 2 <br>
more days but it is hard on old people to letterbox more than one day <br>
at a time. I will be so sore tomorrow from finding the Love's lookout <br>
boxes I won't be able to get out of bed. I might as well be my very <br>
own bed so we drove home. See you on the trails. Adams Trails<br>
