This is Wisconsin Hiker who mostly lurks on this <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fungus Woman is a long-distance friend of mine and TeamKing.  Her dad<br>
was a great, enthusiastic boxer.  He also loved postal boxes, and was<br>
eager to see the variety of stamps featured in them.  Every now and<br>
again, you would see his stamp in your PLB log, but usually he just<br>
silently played the game.<br>
<br>
He was a member of this list, and although he never posted, he avidly<br>
read every message.  <br>
<br>
If you came to the Texas gathering, he had sent a bingo stamp carved<br>
for the Event.  It was the line drawing of a steam engine.  I sent it<br>
back to him, with the log, and he was thrilled to see everyone who<br>
stamped in.<br>
<br>
Although I never met him, he sounds like a great guy.  I know he has a<br>
terrific daughter, and that's a legacy in and of itself.<br>
