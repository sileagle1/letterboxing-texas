                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fungus Woman is a long-distance friend of mine and TeamKing.  Her dad<br/>
was a great, enthusiastic boxer.  He also loved postal boxes, and was<br/>
eager to see the variety of stamps featured in them.  Every now and<br/>
again, you would see his stamp in your PLB log, but usually he just<br/>
silently played the game.<br/>
<br/>
He was a member of this list, and although he never posted, he avidly<br/>
read every message.  <br/>
<br/>
If you came to the Texas gathering, he had sent a bingo stamp carved<br/>
for the Event.  It was the line drawing of a steam engine.  I sent it<br/>
back to him, with the log, and he was thrilled to see everyone who<br/>
stamped in.<br/>
<br/>
Although I never met him, he sounds like a great guy.  I know he has a<br/>
terrific daughter, and that's a legacy in and of itself.<br/>
