<div>Since you all have been 
discussing the year past and to come in letterboxing, I thought I'd throw in my 
2 cents.  I'll start with 2006 favorites.  Almost every time I go 
letterboxing it is a favorite moment for some reason or another, usually because 
I am out of the house and away from dirty laundry that needs to be washed, or 
clean laundry that needs to be put away.  That being said, there are a few 
boxes that really stand out, and all for different reasons.</div>
<div>-DOROTHY...What a 
feeling to solve that puzzle!  As many of you know, it drove me quite 
mad.</div>
<div>-TEXAS TOUR BUS...I 
think this is the only box I have ever been First Finder on...only problem with 
that is that it is actually better to be last finder on this one!</div>
<div>-HOUSTON LETTERBOXING 
CHALLENGE...this is a spectacular series of boxes with all sorts of different 
clues to solve.  One of the highlights was meeting Dewberry on the trail to 
the first box (she beat me to it!) and then tricking her and beating her to the 
second box.  When we first started it was quite a heated race between db, 
myself, and Runs for Chocolate.  I am sure you can guess which of the three 
"won" the race.  For me the real prize in this series was finding all but 
the last box with all 5 kids in tow.  It took us all summer, and cost me 
about $500 in junk food bribes ("If you all come with me we can stop for Sonic 
to celebrate on the way home...")but my oldest really helped with an impossible 
virtual letterbox, Armadillo girl was checking every night to see where the 
other two racers were on the quest, and we spent many happy hours singing along 
to Johnny Cash in the car on the way to find all the crazy boxes.  When we 
found the final box the 5 year old stamped the stamp about 7 or 8 times in his 
log, because "this was hard!".  Forgive me for sounding a little like a 
MasterCard ad, but win or not, that was priceless.</div>
<div>and 
finally...</div>
<div>-GORDON GROUPER...one 
of those perfect SE boxes that takes you to an amazing place you never would 
have known about without letterboxing.  One of my very favorite summer 
days.  Oh, and if you go find it, there is an extra stamp in the box, an 
"I'm Sorry" stamp I placed after knocking the original box into the lake...but 
that is a story for another day.  I think I'll have to leave my resolutions 
for another post as well, this is much longer than I intended, and there are 
still dinner dishes all over the counter!  MO5</div></body></html>

Hah!  It was that first box that knocked me out of that challenge<br/>
completely--a 6 week miserable bout with poison ivy rash all over my<br/>
neck and head!  I only left the house when necessary.  And then, only<br/>
to somewhere airconditioned!<br/>
