Good day...<br/>
<br/>
My name is Robert (Park Ranger- Resource Specialist) and I am trying to reach <br/>
out to the letterboxing/geocaching communities.  It has been brought to my <br/>
attention that articles have been placed on state property without <br/>
authorization.  According to and in persuance of Section 13.101-13.112 of the <br/>
Texas Parks and Wildlife Code and Chapter 59.134-135 of the Texas Administrative <br/>
Code, ALL geocaching and letterboxing on state property needs to have an <br/>
associated permit submitted to the Superintendent/Manager of that station. The <br/>
permit is free.<br/>
<br/>
I would appreciate your assistance in notifying anyone that has placed an item <br/>
on Bastrop and Buescher State Parks to call or stop by the respective park and <br/>
either complete the free permit form or to pull their item.  <br/>
<br/>
Texas Parks and Wildlife respect the geocaching and letterboxing programs and <br/>
hope that more people will get involved in these activities.  In part, by <br/>
filling out the permits, it allows us to maintain a database to monitor the <br/>
statistics of the geocaching/letter boxing guests here at the parks.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your assistance,<br/>
