Most of the time, listing the city is supposed to be an aid to finding the box.  So, in this particular situation I would probably list the nearest city that would help someone find the box, and then for the sake of being geographically correct, state in the clues somewhere that it was technically in Houston.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, it all depends on how difficult you are making the clues to find the box...<br/>

Thanks!  The City probably does that because that's the water supply <br/>
(Lake Houston) and that thin projection is the aqueduct carrying our <br/>
water.  So, I'd like to ask those in the area. . .since Houston is <br/>
so enormous, is it better whenever possible to list another city as <br/>
a reference point?  Or should we be as accurate as possible?<br/>
<br/>
FYI to everyone, the old Texaco Country Club has been donated to the <br/>
City of Houston and is now part of a new park called Coolgreen.  We <br/>
haven't had a chance to check it out yet, but it has some wooded <br/>
acres being left in a natural state, just across from the large <br/>
Hermann Brown Park.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Krohm, for the map references.  We love maps and atlases <br/>
around here.  Any suggestions are much appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Finally I am highly amused by the theme of I'm Sari; I Tigress.  You <br/>
can probably tell from this post, I'm as guilty of digression as <br/>
anyone else.  I hope others find it as funny as I do.<br/>

&gt; Actually, Dewberry, my map(s) indicates that the city of Houston <br/>
sticks out <br/>
&gt; a thin flagellate-like appendage of city-boundary from the <br/>
vicinity of<br/>
&gt; somewhere around Texaco Country Club, and projects on a vaguely<br/>
&gt; north-northeastern heading, along the east side of the Sheldon <br/>
Reservoir,<br/>
&gt; which then encircles most of Lake Houston, including the two parks <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; mentioned.  So, technically, it appears the closest city is the <br/>
city that<br/>
&gt; the parks are actually in, which is Houston.  Otherwise, the next <br/>
closest<br/>
&gt; village-community-thingy appears to be Magnolia Gardens, and then <br/>
Sheldon.<br/>
