<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I second what Dewberry just said.  
Letterboxing is something you either "get" or you don't, and I would bet that 
those boxers out there who have been patiently planting boxes and finding those 
that were around knew from the start that they were hooked on 
letterboxing.  I have told 2 friends that I really thought would enjoy 
letterboxing about the hobby, and although they have found a smattering of 
boxes, I think they still think that I am a little nuts.  Letterboxing is 
something that needs to grow naturally if you want to encourage people to enjoy 
the hobby for more than a weekend or two.  I also think what dewberry 
said about replying to e mails from finders is important, every time I found a 
box Silver Eagle sent a gracious reply, and when I placed my first box I was 
thrilled when he wrote and told me he had found it. Although I wasn't 
exactly sure what I was doing on that first box, I felt I owed it to SE and Baby 
Bear to try to place one, since we had had such fun finding their boxes.  I 
have learned a lot through this talklist as well, things I would have never 
learned on my own, and again Silver Eagle is the one who told me about it.  
Look how patient Silver Eagle and Baby Bear were, and just look at how their 
patience has paid off!  That's my 2 cents.
