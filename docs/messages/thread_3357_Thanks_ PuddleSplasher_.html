<div>What a nice little event we had today at the Cedar Ridge Nature Preserve, 
about 20+ of us, including lots of kids and one chocolate lab.   The 
weather cooperated and it was a great day to meet, exchange, and do a little 
letterboxing and hiking along the trails.   Thanks, 
PuddleSplasher, for taking charge and carving the really cool event stamp 
(TA-DA!) and for bringing the party balloons and the event poster to be stamped 
by one and all, and for posting this little gathering on AQ Event 
Calendar. It was fun to see a few familiar faces and to meet quite a few 
newer letterboxers in our area and to be able to put faces with some of those 
stamps!   Now I'll be looking for all of you on the trails!</div>
<div>Viewfinder  -- and as our Mom always taught us to say,  "Thanks 
for inviting us.  We had a really nice time."  )Imagine a polite
