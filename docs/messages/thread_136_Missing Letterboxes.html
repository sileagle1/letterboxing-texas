                    <div class="plaintext-content">I recently heard that my Texas Star LB in Dallas<br/>
Fair Park is missing, so I have updated my clue<br/>
page to reflect this.  A friend has volunteered <br/>
to rehide a replacement for me as soon as I can<br/>
recarve it as a micro and get it to them, since<br/>
it will be a long time before I am in that part<br/>
of Texas.<br/>
My Stevie Ray microbox in Austin has also been<br/>
reported missing and I have already recarved a<br/>
replacement, just waiting until I go back to that<br/>
area early this summer.<br/>
My Jr. Texas Ranger letterbox in Waco was reported <br/>
to be missing the stamp &amp; log, so I plan to retire <br/>
that box since it was redundant anyway.  I created it<br/>
to replace my Texas Ranger box when it was mistakenly<br/>
reported missing and ended up placing it as an extra<br/>
box when I found the first box still in tact.  If <br/>
anyone goes to Waco, could you please pick up the<br/>
remains of the Jr. Texas Ranger box (if it really is<br/>
missing the log &amp; stamp) so it is not just a litterbox.<br/>
<br/>
Even though I hate it when my boxes go missing, I<br/>
still like to hear about it so I can update my clues<br/>
and possibly replace them if possible, so thanks for<br/>
all your emails, especially when you find my boxes!<br/>
