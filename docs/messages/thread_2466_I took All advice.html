<div>Kim, I'm curious. Now that you've created one box with a carved stamp and one with a store bought stamp, which one do you like most? I hand carve all my stamps and some of them are just plain pitiful, but it's just so much fun! I'm sure everyone is anxious to find your all of your boxes.</div>
