                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I REALLY REALLY REALLY  want to come to this.  However, I've<br/>
discovered that my middle dd has a softball game in Sugar Land at 9<br/>
that morning, so the earliest we could expect to be there is around<br/>
11:30 or 12:00.  Since I've never actually had the opportunity to<br/>
attend an event, I'm not completely sure how it works.  Would it be<br/>
worth my while to make the drive at that point?  I would just come<br/>
without her as I will my oldest, but she loves letterboxing as much as<br/>
I do while the oldest comes along only "if she's got nothing better to<br/>
do."  I wouldn't want to do that to her.<br/>

Thanks!<br/>
