                    <div class="plaintext-content">About a month ago, my cousin, Wagtime, and I decided that we were<br>
needing to go on one of our letterboxing marathons.  So we set the <br>
date as Saturday, July 7 (7/7/7)  and what a beautiful day it turned <br>
out to be after all the rain that had taken place.  We started out <br>
in Jacksonville at 6:30 am and headed to Uncertain to Caddo State <br>
Park to pick up two Blue Butterfly boxes which was the Caddo Lake <br>
series.  Both boxes were in great condition and no problem in <br>
finding them.  If you have never been to this park, it is<br>
really beautiful, especially around the lake area.  We then headed <br>
to the town of Uncertain, to pick up the `Uncertain" box, which we <br>
found with no problem, except we were met by a big black dog that <br>
alerted his owner to us (we were at the dead end of a road with a <br>
house next door).  The owner came outside on his porch to see what <br>
his dog was barking at and then he proceeded to keep an eye out for <br>
what we were doing.  Finally Wagtime made friends with the dog and <br>
while Wagtime looked in the trunk for some mysterious item, I was <br>
able to sneak the box back to its location.  Upon leaving Uncertain, <br>
we noticed that on the side of the road there was a photo <br>
opportunity by a building with a mural of a smiling frog and an <br>
alligator that said "Where the H*** is Uncertain, Texas?"  So <br>
needless to say we did take a picture.  A little further down the <br>
road was a building that was called Hog Wallow with 2 hog heads and <br>
a motorcycle.  We then proceeded to Jefferson to the public boat <br>
ramp to get Silver Eagle's "Skritz" box and we were quite concerned <br>
about the box because the water was covering the entire parking <br>
lot...however good news, the box was in place and not in danger.  At <br>
the boat ramp there is also a beautiful old train trestle that goes<br>
over the water.  We then proceeded to find "The French Connection" <br>
box which we were able to find...but I won't give any hints for it <br>
since it is a mystery box.  The next box that we looked for was "The <br>
Haunted Letterbox" which is at the most haunted site in Jefferson <br>
(this is also a mystery box, so won't give any clues to that) but we <br>
did find it and it is a wonderful stamp. By the way, Jefferson does <br>
give haunted tours on Friday and Saturday nights at around 8pm, if <br>
you are interested).  Our next stop was at the Daingerfield State <br>
Park.  There are 2 boxes listed here, one is a series that is a 2 <br>
1/2 mile walk that we decided to wait until fall/winter to attempt.  <br>
We did attempt the "Danger" box, but we think we took the wrong <br>
trail so we decided to do some additional research and find<br>
it when we go back for the series.  Our next stop was Omaha to look <br>
for Barefoot Lucy's "Tag" box.  We finally managed to find the <br>
historical marker that it was located at and after diligently <br>
searching around the tree that I was certain it was at, I finally <br>
managed to pull it out of a hole with about 2-3 inches of water in <br>
it...good news, lock n lock boxes are water tight and the contents <br>
were totally dry.  By the way if you go to look for this box,<br>
be sure and watch out for the thorn tree that seems to jump out at <br>
you..I ended up with a nice little sticker in my finger.  We then <br>
headed towards Texarkana.  On the way we saw a couple of people on <br>
horseback and as we got closer to them, we realized that it was <br>
actually a wagon train with 3 covered wagons, with a sign that <br>
read "Texarkana, Texas to Tombstone, Arizona or Bust." So kind of a <br>
neat site.  We made it to Texarkana to find the "Aggie Bridge Troll" <br>
box, however we did not know exactly where the college was located <br>
so we drove around and ended up going into Arkanasas for a little <br>
while before finally stopping and asking for directions.  Once we<br>
made it to the college, finding the box was no problem and it was in <br>
great condition.  Our next town was De Kalb, and picked up <br>
the "Hoss" box by Silver Eagle which is located at the grave of Dan <br>
Blocker who played Hoss for many years.  We then realized that we <br>
were going through a section of Titus county and realized that this <br>
was a virgin county...so a trip through Mt Pleasant was in order to <br>
place a box.  While we were going through this town, we did come <br>
upon a large yellow building with lots of junk around it, <br>
called "The Garage Sale."  We didnt stop, but decided to add that to <br>
our list of places to come back to.  We did manage to place a box in <br>
Mt Pleasant, so Titus is no longer a virgin county.  We then managed <br>
to find the "Seven Gables" box in Mt Vernon which was a really neat <br>
location.  Next we started towards Pittsburg.  On the way, we <br>
noticed the Pilgrim's Pride Distribution Center with a huge bust of <br>
Bo Pilgrim.  We had to stop and actually take a picture.  Down the <br>
road from there we noticed a huge estate with the Pilgrim's Pride <br>
logo on it...not sure if that is where Bo lives...but Bo certainly <br>
knows chicken.  In Pittsburg we managed to find Trail Cat's "Going <br>
on a Mouse Hunt" series at a neat old cemetery.  We then made it to<br>
Gladwater to pick up the "Reel-em-In" Box.  When we got to the <br>
location of the box, we again had to use some stealth to retrieve <br>
the box since there were some close by picnicers who did not seem at <br>
all interested in what we were doing.  The box was totally exposed <br>
but we did manage to stamp in and tried to hide it as best we <br>
could.  We were now approaching 7:15 pm and decided to skip Kilgore <br>
and Longview for now.  We instead made our way to Overton to pick up <br>
Blue Butterfly's "Overton Mustang" box.  When we got to the park, <br>
there were 4 kids playing at the park...no parents.  We made our way <br>
to the bridge and on the side of the bridge was the lid to the<br>
letterbox.  We were both extremely concerned, but I went ahead and<br>
checked the location for where it should have been and the rest of <br>
the box with stamp and log book were right where they should have <br>
been and in perfect condition.  We stamped in and put the lid back <br>
on and rehid.  Next we made it to New London and Wagtime picked up <br>
my "New London Explosion" box.  It was also totally exposed but we <br>
were able to take care of that and the contents were safe and <br>
sound.  While we were there we did notice a log book that was laying <br>
near it.  So if anyone visited this site and is now missing their <br>
log book, please let me know. because I have it.  At this point we <br>
were really losing daylight, but wanted to let Wagtime pick up<br>
Blue Butterfly's "Joe Roughneck,"  however when we got to the <br>
location, it was obvious that someone else had been looking for it, <br>
and the box was no where to be found.<br>

<div>It sounds like you should submit some of your pictures to <a href="http://www.roadsideamerica.com">www.roadsideamerica.com</a>.  Go check out the website and you'll see what I mean!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you recall, when I found the New London box, it was also out in the open on top of the stump and we had rehidden it at that time.  Wonder what gives there???  I just checked AQ and it looks like we WERE the last to find it, so I wonder - were there other finders who might belong to that logbook?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm relieved to know that container worked for my TAG box...I have to say, my heart rose in my throat for a moment!</div>

So we set the <br/>date as Saturday, July 7 (7/7/7) and what a beautiful day it turned <br/>out to be after all the rain that had taken place. We started out <br/>in Jacksonville at 6:30 am and headed to Uncertain to Caddo State <br/>Park to pick up two Blue Butterfly boxes which was the Caddo Lake
 <br/>series. Both boxes were in great condition and no problem in <br/>finding them. If you have never been to this park, it is <br/>really beautiful, especially around the lake area. We then headed <br/>to the town of Uncertain, to pick up the `Uncertain" box, which we <br/>found with no problem, except we were met by a big black dog that <br/>alerted his owner to us (we were at the dead end of a road with a <br/>house next door). The owner came outside on his porch to see what <br/>his dog was barking at and then he proceeded to keep an eye out for <br/>what we were doing. Finally Wagtime made friends with the dog and <br/>while Wagtime looked in the trunk for some mysterious item, I was <br/>able to sneak the box back to its location. Upon leaving Uncertain, <br/>we noticed that on the side of the road there was a photo <br/>opportunity by a building with a mural of a smiling frog and an <br/>alligator that said "Where the H*** is Uncertain, Texas?" So <br/>needless to say we did take
 a picture. A little further down the <br/>road was a building that was called Hog Wallow with 2 hog heads and <br/>a motorcycle. We then proceeded to Jefferson to the public boat <br/>ramp to get Silver Eagle's "Skritz" box and we were quite concerned <br/>about the box because the water was covering the entire parking <br/>lot...however good news, the box was in place and not in danger. At <br/>the boat ramp there is also a beautiful old train trestle that goes<br/>over the water. We then proceeded to find "The French Connection" <br/>box which we were able to find...but I won't give any hints for it <br/>since it is a mystery box. The next box that we looked for was "The <br/>Haunted Letterbox" which is at the most haunted site in Jefferson <br/>(this is also a mystery box, so won't give any clues to that) but we <br/>did find it and it is a wonderful stamp. By the way, Jefferson does <br/>give haunted tours on Friday and Saturday nights at around 8pm, if <br/>you are interested). Our
 next stop was at the Daingerfield State <br/>Park. There are 2 boxes listed here, one is a series that is a 2 <br/>1/2 mile walk that we decided to wait until fall/winter to attempt. <br/>We did attempt the "Danger" box, but we think we took the wrong <br/>trail so we decided to do some additional research and find<br/>it when we go back for the series. Our next stop was Omaha to look <br/>for Barefoot Lucy's "Tag" box. We finally managed to find the <br/>historical marker that it was located at and after diligently <br/>searching around the tree that I was certain it was at, I finally <br/>managed to pull it out of a hole with about 2-3 inches of water in <br/>it...good news, lock n lock boxes are water tight and the contents <br/>were totally dry. By the way if you go to look for this box, <br/>be sure and watch out for the thorn tree that seems to jump out at <br/>you..I ended up with a nice little sticker in my finger. We then <br/>headed towards Texarkana. On the way we saw a
 couple of people on <br/>horseback and as we got closer to them, we realized that it was <br/>actually a wagon train with 3 covered wagons, with a sign that <br/>read "Texarkana, Texas to Tombstone, Arizona or Bust." So kind of a <br/>neat site. We made it to Texarkana to find the "Aggie Bridge Troll" <br/>box, however we did not know exactly where the college was located <br/>so we drove around and ended up going into Arkanasas for a little <br/>while before finally stopping and asking for directions. Once we<br/>made it to the college, finding the box was no problem and it was in <br/>great condition. Our next town was De Kalb, and picked up <br/>the "Hoss" box by Silver Eagle which is located at the grave of Dan <br/>Blocker who played Hoss for many years. We then realized that we <br/>were going through a section of Titus county and realized that this <br/>was a virgin county...so a trip through Mt Pleasant was in order to <br/>place a box. While we were going through this town, we
 did come <br/>upon a large yellow building with lots of junk around it, <br/>called "The Garage Sale." We didnt stop, but decided to add that to <br/>our list of places to come back to. We did manage to place a box in <br/>Mt Pleasant, so Titus is no longer a virgin county. We then managed <br/>to find the "Seven Gables" box in Mt Vernon which was a really neat <br/>location. Next we started towards Pittsburg. On the way, we <br/>noticed the Pilgrim's Pride Distribution Center with a huge bust of <br/>Bo Pilgrim. We had to stop and actually take a picture. Down the <br/>road from there we noticed a huge estate with the Pilgrim's Pride <br/>logo on it...not sure if that is where Bo lives...but Bo certainly <br/>knows chicken. In Pittsburg we managed to find Trail Cat's "Going <br/>on a Mouse Hunt" series at a neat old cemetery. We then made it to <br/>Gladwater to pick up the "Reel-em-In" Box. When we got to the <br/>location of the box, we again had to use some stealth to retrieve
 <br/>the box since there were some close by picnicers who did not seem at <br/>all interested in what we were doing. The box was totally exposed <br/>but we did manage to stamp in and tried to hide it as best we <br/>could. We were now approaching 7:15 pm and decided to skip Kilgore <br/>and Longview for now. We instead made our way to Overton to pick up <br/>Blue Butterfly's "Overton Mustang" box. When we got to the park, <br/>there were 4 kids playing at the park...no parents. We made our way <br/>to the bridge and on the side of the bridge was the lid to the <br/>letterbox. We were both extremely concerned, but I went ahead and<br/>checked the location for where it should have been and the rest of <br/>the box with stamp and log book were right where they should have <br/>been and in perfect condition. We stamped in and put the lid back <br/>on and rehid. Next we made it to New London and Wagtime picked up <br/>my "New London Explosion" box. It was also totally exposed but we
 <br/>were able to take care of that and the contents were safe and <br/>sound. While we were there we did notice a log book that was laying <br/>near it. So if anyone visited this site and is now missing their <br/>log book, please let me know. because I have it. At this point we <br/>were really losing daylight, but wanted to let Wagtime pick up<br/>Blue Butterfly's "Joe Roughneck," however when we got to the <br/>location, it was obvious that someone else had been looking for it, <br/>and the box was no where to be found.<br/><br/>Boxes planted: 1 by JB Kokopelli<br/>Boxes found: 13 by JB Kokopelli<br/>15 by Wag Time (+ found 1 HH) <br/>Hours on road: approximately 15<br/>Miles traveled: 505<br/>Total Trip....PRICELESS<br/><br/></div></div><span style="COLOR: white" width="1"></span></div></div></div></blockquote></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"   <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/><p>
