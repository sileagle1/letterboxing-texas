Clues updated via comment, as Tejas Angel has not logged into AQ since 2009.<br/>
<br/>
LB Capital  missing<br/>
<br/>
Here There Be Dragons  here there be a new clearing, devoid of both fallen logs and most standing trees.  Rejoice, fair maiden and enjoy the wildflowers in the clear-cut.<br/>
<br/>
Royal Historian of Oz  alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
I'm Melting!!  and buried alive<br/>
<br/>
Cannon Card, Risk series  missing<br/>
<br/>
Grab a Cub  missing<br/>
<br/>
Flat Danley Goes to Texas  wet.  Very wet.  Mopped up, wedged between tall swag &amp; sapling, covered by vines * judiciously placed bark back at its original location in the Camp Logan/Pendleton ruins, according to the current clue.  It was in the wrong location.<br/>
<br/>
Baxley's Letterboxing Weekend  missing<br/>
<br/>
Oz: Winkies retreat  alive and well<br/>
<br/>
Tossing Around the Pigskin  alive &amp; well<br/>
<br/>
So Long, Houston. . .  sopping stamps, although the temp logbook I supplied when I first found it is dry, if a little mildewed.  All stamps dried and rebagged into a single baggie, due to container size constraints, and placed in new container. (Old container too big for current location.)  New location is behind stump, but otherwise matches clues.<br/>
<br/>
Oz: Winkie Retreat  alive &amp; well, right where it should be<br/>

&gt; Here is the list of boxes checked Saturday and their status (with some help<br/>
&gt; from Wry Me).  If we moved a box I'll send the new directions to the owners<br/>
&gt; shortly.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Red/Blue/Purple trail area<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Kayak Girl (NLW) - found with box open and full of water -- no stamp in<br/>
&gt; sight so the box was removed<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nada Clue (Boots Tex) - fabulous as ever and we loved the new location!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NFL Series - Houston Texans (Gators88) - No box found, trees around it cut<br/>
&gt; down.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cola Wars series (Wills World) - Choice B&amp;C are there (maybe wet?), The home<br/>
&gt; for Choice A is destroyed but MB found it in a bush by accident.  The box<br/>
&gt; was damaged.  Planted in new location with a new box and logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cola Wars: Choice D (Open Space) - Ok<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Rain Deer (Gators88) - Location has been cleared, box lost<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bones (LSQ) - Found the location with brick but the box is missing<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Risk: Horseman Card - Found box, current location was at a dead tree near a<br/>
&gt; cleared area so we decided to move it to a live tree.  Plastic jar is bent<br/>
&gt; but dry.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Patchwork Girl of Oz (LSQ)-- was buried in and amongst an acre of debris<br/>
&gt; from the recent tree removals. The lid was creased, the box cracked, the<br/>
&gt; logbook soaked and slimy and felt sopping. The stamp, however, is wonderful.<br/>
&gt; You would never believe where this box was found, with barely a corner<br/>
&gt; poking out of the broken limbs, in a clearing with no landmarks from the<br/>
&gt; clues visible. Still singing a victory dance. MB is rehabilitating the<br/>
&gt; logbook.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Cowardly lion of Oz (Boots Tex) - Alive and well<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Jabberwocky (Open Space/Dreamwalker) - OK<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Writing's on the wall (dewberry)- Found the writing but not the wall<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Green Trail <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oz: The Gatekeeper (dewberry) - missing, stump is mostly gone and area<br/>
&gt; behind it is completely cleared out<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The games closet - Mousetrap - stamp missing although it's hiding spot<br/>
&gt; looked undisturbed<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Washington State Flower (TeamKing) - alive and well (location for this on<br/>
&gt; the map needs to be updated)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Bingo and Bingo piece (Baby Bear) - we couldn't find Bingo, but it could be<br/>
&gt; under a fallen tree or lots of debris along the log.  A shovel would help.<br/>
&gt; Bingo Piece is there but the clues don't make much sense anymore (and the<br/>
&gt; tree is dead - just the trunk is left)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MOM (AstroD) - Alive and damp.  We cleaned it up and donated a new bag.<br/>
&gt; It's stump is slowly meeting it's demise and overgrowth is partially hiding<br/>
&gt; the stump.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Irish Blessing - boxes are long gone <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Season's Greetings (dewberry) - replanted in it's original location<br/>
&gt; (although we are concerned that the spot gets too much attention). Dewberry<br/>
&gt; plans to update clues on AQ.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Blue Marlin 06 - missing, probably washed away by Ike (based on comments I<br/>
&gt; received about that area)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Toadally Hoppy - couldn't find landmarks, but we didn't check out the bottom<br/>
&gt; loop of the green trail, so there is still hope<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Puzzle Mystery boxes (not on the main list I shared Saturday)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Puzzle Queen - Alive and well<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; GG's box - I couldn't find the landmarks, but I think I started at the wrong<br/>
&gt; place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Surrender Dorothy - I checked this one last week.  It's alive and well but<br/>
&gt; in a slightly different spot (dewberry knows where it is J).  It's original<br/>
&gt; hiding place is destroyed.  One tab on the L&amp;L is broken.  <br/>

&gt;   <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'd like to thank everyone who came out and braved the weather and mud<br/>
&gt; yesterday.  I couldn't do much about the mud, but the weather certainly<br/>
&gt; cooperated!  We had a great time, made new friends and saved some boxes<br/>
&gt; which lost their homes.  Several had to be repaired and moved to new homes,<br/>
&gt; and sadly there were some classics we couldn't find.  I suspect we checked<br/>
&gt; on less than half of the boxes so there is still a lot of work to do.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've posted the highlights of the day on my blog:<br/>
&gt; http://anopenspacelife.blogspot.com/2013/05/memorial-park-maintenance.html,<br/>
&gt; and uploaded the pictures on the event page on AQ.  I'll be posting a<br/>
&gt; detailed report of all the boxes we checked later today and correcting the<br/>
&gt; map for general use.  Thanks again for all your help. <br/>
