<br>
LB Capital  missing<br>
<br>

<br>
I'm Melting!!  and buried alive<br>
<br>
Cannon Card, Risk series  missing<br>
<br>

<br>
Flat Danley Goes to Texas  wet.  Very wet.  Mopped up, wedged between tall swag & sapling, covered by vines * judiciously placed bark back at its original location in the Camp Logan/Pendleton ruins, according to the current clue.  It was in the wrong location.<br>
<br>
Baxley's Letterboxing Weekend  missing<br>
<br>
Oz: Winkies retreat  alive and well<br>
<br>

So Long, Houston. . .  sopping stamps, although the temp logbook I supplied when I first found it is dry, if a little mildewed.  All stamps dried and rebagged into a single baggie, due to container size constraints, and placed in new container. (Old container too big for current location.)  New location is behind stump, but otherwise matches clues.<br>
<br>
Oz: Winkie Retreat  alive & well, right where it should be<br>
