today. The big surprise at Polar Bear was that, as<br/>
quickly as I got there after getting the clues, I was<br/>
not the First Finder: that honor goes to<br/>
Graham/Hoopster. They could not have been very far<br/>
ahead of me, because the ink on the stamp had not<br/>
dried yet! I must have missed them by only a few<br/>
minutes. Very exciting, especially since TeamKing and<br/>
I missed each other by only a few minutes yesterday at<br/>
"Travel the Orient".<br/>
