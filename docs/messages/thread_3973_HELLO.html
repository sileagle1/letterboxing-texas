                    <div class="plaintext-content"> Hello all. We are new to the site. I 1st heard about letterboxing a <br>
few years ago, right before we moved to TX from AZ. I lost the article <br>
& could not remember what it was called, until recently one of my <br>
search guesses brought me to it.<br>
 I searched through the LB North America & Atlasquest websites & found <br>
a few in our area.  We live in Lake Jackson, S. of Houston. I know my <br>
husband & I with our 4 daughters are going to have a great time looking <br>
for the boxes. They love having scaventure hunts on Easter & their <br>
birthdays. <br>
 Does anyone know of any boxes around here that I might not have found <br>
on the web site? We're also making a trip to the Brazos Bend Sate Park <br>
in May for a family reunion, we hope to fid some of the many boxes <br>
there. We also make a trip to AZ every summer to vist family. I found <br>
several around Mesa & Apache Jct. <br>
 Hopefully we can gather some good hunting tips from here & plant a<br>
few boxes of our own. I'm sure my girls will enjoy these adventures for <br>
years to come.<br>
<br>
Thanks everyone, <br>
   The Taylors<br>
