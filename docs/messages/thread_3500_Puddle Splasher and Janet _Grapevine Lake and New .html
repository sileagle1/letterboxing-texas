If you want to pull them while you're there planting, totally<br/>

Janet: We went pic-a-nic-ing last weekend so I think we could totally<br/>
get a couple of boxes out there. I'll have to check my log with<br/>
updates off the site if we went. However, there is never any harm in<br/>
trying anyway. The water is still pretty high, you interpreted correctly.<br/>
 For me, spring is here when the wildflowers are showing. ;)<br/>

Take care you guys!<br/>

<div>I'm leaving them for a couple more weeks so they'll be there just in case you want to find them. (I'm in no hurry.) I didn't get the others planted today, but will within the next couple of days. I got almost over to the nature center and the clouds were beginning to look a little dark, so I decided to meet my daughter for lunch instead! I'm easily distracted.</div>
