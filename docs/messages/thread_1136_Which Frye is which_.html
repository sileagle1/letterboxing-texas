<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think we need to make a letterboxing family tree 
or something...maybe it is the lack of sleep, or too many kids home on summer 
vacation :) but I can't keep the two Frye families straight.  Which is 
which? -Mother of five</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">PS to Lucy...I hope your daughter's foot will heal 
swiftly...all the comments about kids "leaving the nest" makes me want to go 
give all mine an extra good night kiss!  What an interesting future she has 
in front of her!  The way my back feels after grocery shopping with my 
little circus makes me want to give her a call!</font></div></body></html>
