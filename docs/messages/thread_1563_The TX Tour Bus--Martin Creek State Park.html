<div>Oh! I'm sorry! I feel your pain! I really wanted to get it when it was in Cleburne - closer to home for me, but Lucy Lockett and Blue Butterfly beat me to it. I became determined to not miss it again. When I saw the announcement last night, I went to the gas station and filled up my Jeep, set my alarm clock for 3:00 A.M., and was on the road by 3:30. It's amazing how easy it is to drive through Dallas at that hour! The only hard part was road boredom on I-20 since it was dark and I couldn't enjoy the scenery. When I got to the park, the sun was just coming up and the attendant wasn't there yet, so I filled out the paperwork and left my fee in the "after hours" box. When I got to the campsite, I found that it was occupied so I had to "nonchalantly" pass through their camp - leaves crunching under my feet - oh yes, just out for an early stroll in the woods at the break of dawn. Nothing suspicious about that. But if it's any consolation, just remember, the longer it takes for you to get it, the more stamps there will be!</div>
<div>Of course, while in the neighborhood, I found your "The Only Ringtail I've Ever Seen" box. It was fantastic. I loved the stamp and the hike was gorgeous. I imagine it is really beautiful there in the Spring. I also found Blue Butterfly's Harmony Hills which was so interesting. Can't wait to come back to the area and find MORE!</div>

I'm sorry! I feel your pain! I really wanted to<br/>&gt; get it when it was in Cleburne - closer to home for<br/>&gt; me, but Lucy Lockett and Blue Butterfly beat me to<br/>&gt; it. I became determined to not miss it again. When I<br/>&gt; saw the announcement last night, I went to the gas<br/>&gt; station and filled up my Jeep, set my alarm clock<br/>&gt; for 3:00 A.M., and was on the road by 3:30. It's<br/>&gt; amazing how easy it is to drive through Dallas at<br/>&gt; that hour! The only hard part was road boredom on<br/>&gt; I-20 since it was dark and I couldn't enjoy the<br/>&gt; scenery. When I got to the park, the sun was just<br/>&gt; coming up and the attendant wasn't there yet, so I<br/>&gt; filled out the paperwork and left my fee in the<br/>&gt; "after hours" box. When I got to the campsite, I<br/>&gt; found that it was occupied so I had to<br/>&gt; "nonchalantly" pass through their camp - leaves<br/>&gt; crunching under my feet - oh yes, just out for an<br/>&gt; early stroll in the woods at the break of dawn.<br/>&gt; Nothing suspicious about that. But if it's any<br/>&gt; consolation, just remember, the longer it takes for<br/>&gt; you to get it, the more stamps there will be!<br/>&gt; Of course, while in the neighborhood, I found your<br/>&gt; "The Only Ringtail I've Ever Seen" box. It was<br/>&gt; fantastic. I loved the stamp and the hike was<br/>&gt; gorgeous. I imagine it is really beautiful there in<br/>&gt; the Spring. I also found Blue Butterfly's Harmony<br/>&gt; Hills which was so interesting.

<div>Thanks! You're right, it's worth every minute of the drive! However I am about ready to fall into bed and it's only 7:15! It was great hiking around those gorgeous woods so early in the morning. The birdsongs were reward enough, but I'm glad I have to opportunity "experience the bus"!</div>

<div>Funny you ask... when I circled around their campsite to get to the trail, there was no sign of life, but when I came back down the trail, there was a gentleman walking around the site - probably wondering what I was up to, but I steered clear of him and went past a few more campsites before returning to the road. It's kind of difficult to be discreet when you're carrying such a large box under your arm, but at least it wasn't one that needed to be rehidden down that same trail.</div>
