                    <div class="plaintext-content">LSQ and I decided to go over to Huntsville State Park this morning to check on a couple of boxes that have been reported missing, then continued on up I-45 to Fort Boggy State Park, near Centerville.  We had never been to this park because it has always been closed on weekdays, which is normally when we are traveling up that way.  However, they are now open from Wednesday through Sunday, so we decided to check it out.  There were a couple of letterboxes listed for the park: Silver Eagle's Bog Bandit and Baby Bear's Boggy Creek Monster, and we had been wanting to find them for a long time.  The problem is that they were both last "attempted" over two years ago, and never found since.  We printed out the clues anyway, just in case.  We had no problem finding either one of the boxes, following the clues exactly.  We should all be careful of reporting a box as "attempted" unless we are absolutely sure that we were looking in the right place.  This is a lovely little park, by the way, with a small, scenic lake and nice trails.  It's a fairly new park.  There are some tent pad camping areas along the trails, but they aren't open for overnight camping at this time.  Entrance to the park is free, at least for right now.  We also placed two new letterboxes while we were there.  Check it out sometime.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks again for the update, and care for my box in this park.  I agree with Boots, this is a nice little park that is getting very little attention.  It has been on the park list for years, but only just opened a few years ago.   Nice place to stop on a drive between Dallas and Houston!!!   <br>
