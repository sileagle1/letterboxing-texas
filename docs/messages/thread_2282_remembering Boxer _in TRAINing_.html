<br/>
I just saw this message Ryan posted on my Dad's tribute page on AQ:<br/>
<br/>
"I never had the pleasure of meeting Boxer in TRAINing, but I loved <br/>
reading about the stories everyone who has met him had to tell. <br/>
Funguswoman asked that contributes be sent to AQ in his memory--a <br/>
rather unexpected and touching request--and I wanted to save it for <br/>
something useful for the continued development of this site. I <br/>
scratched my head quite a bit wondering what worthy purpose I could <br/>
put the donations towards, and finally decided to upgrade my decade-<br/>
old version of Paint Shop Pro 5 to the recently released Paint Shop <br/>
Pro 11. Next time you see a new theme on Atlas Quest, or new photos <br/>
used in a tutorial or on a blog--remember Boxer in TRAINing. The <br/>
contributions in his memory helped make them possible. Thanks to <br/>
all, and especially to Boxer and Funguswoman."<br/>
<br/>
Pretty cool, eh?  <br/>
<br/>
I placed the first of a series of three letterboxes in memory of him <br/>
today in Illinois (clues coming shortly).  A second box is being <br/>
sent to WI Hiker and Martini Man for hiding in Wisconsin (much to <br/>
Michigan's dismay, no doubt, since the two states are currently <br/>
holding a contest of sorts to see which can place a letterbox in <br/>
every county first!) and a third is being sent to my cousins ZEPE <br/>
here in Austin, since WI and TX were two places he rather <br/>
extensively hunted down boxes.<br/>

and fireworks that's because of your dad, cool. I don't know what that <br/>

The theme for Atlasquest right now is for Guy Fawkes Day.  It's a <br/>
British holiday where they celebrate the capture of Guy Fawkes, a <br/>
Catholic who attempted to blow up Parliament.<br/>
<br/>
Here is a link to a wikipedia article about him and The Gunpowder <br/>
Plot.  Enjoy!<br/>
