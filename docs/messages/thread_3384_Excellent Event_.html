                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think I enjoy these events more each time I attend one. I still <br>
have the same problem: too much going on, but too little time! There <br>
were so many cool people there, and I missed getting to do exchanges <br>
with everybody, so next time! Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, what can I <br>
say? You're the "hosts superior" (sounds celestial, doesn't it?). The <br>
event was absolutely great and the campfire was so much fun. I wish <br>
everyone had been there. Reliving old stories and hearing new ones <br>
was fantastic. Okay, for those of you who thought that Dewberry, <br>
Mother of 5 and I cheated at the match game, I wanted to confess, BUT <br>
I gave the bottle of "Cranberry Mead" back to Silver Eagle, and we <br>
used it at the campfire to toast the demise of Gryzzled Gryphon's <br>
cranberry cruiser, may it rest in peace. That combined with some <br>
potent "chocolate cake" shots provided by SandiBox and some <br>
incredible cobbler made by Fearless Fox and Lightning just topped off <br>
the event. I'm happy that Chrispy's little letterboxer-to-be, didn't <br>
decide to make an appearance at the event, although I am anxious to <br>
meet him/her. Oh, and Mother of Five, I didn't really consider us to <br>
be LOST on that trail, we only misplaced the original trail for <br>
awhile. How do we do that? (And you promised not to tell anyone!) <br>
Dewberry, I was so excited that you came!  It was fun having <br>
that "stealthy" group of eight moving down the trail in mass, lead by <br>
Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket with SandiBox in the back reading the <br>
clues and shouting them up to those in front, sending SoccerChic into <br>
the sticks and briars to retrieve the boxes, and then sitting in a <br>
huge circle in the middle of the trail stamping in! Luckily, we owned <br>
the trails Saturday and the only other people we passed were <br>
letterboxers! Obviously, I didn't have time to find all the wonderful <br>
boxes hidden during the event, but Viewfinder and I are already <br>
planning our trip back to Bastrop at the end of the month (hereby <br>
known as the "Top-Down Excellent Adventure 2008") to find every last <br>
one of them! I appreciate everyone who came and participated and <br>
especially send a shout-out to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for all the <br>
planning. It was great.<br>
     Also, I've heard a rumor that the Texas Tour Bus Two is on the <br>
move and may be available again pretty soon! All I can say is, <br>
Barefoot Lucy, you'd better sleep in your tennis shoes and have a <br>
full tank in your car at all times! <br>
