<div>I just posted clues to 
a new box, "The Puzzle Queen", on LBNA and AQ.  This box is placed with 
much admiration for our own puzzle queen, dewberry.  She said that the 
first one to solve it will win the solution to the next evil puzzle she had 
planned for us (no, she didn't really say that, but it would be a great first 
finders prize, don't you think?)  Thanks to dewberry for hosting the clues 
on her blog, and for all the hours I have spent cursing her very existence while 
struggling with her puzzles.  Enjoy!  MO5</div></body></html>
