&gt;<br/>
&gt;Thanks to Joy and Michelle and Dewberry and<br/>
&gt;CelticLions for speaking up so quickly about wanting<br/>
&gt;to help with my idea!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I've been thinking about it today and I'm going to go<br/>
&gt;ahead and start working on organizing a planting event<br/>
&gt;(hate to call it a gathering because it isn't exactly<br/>
&gt;like a regular gathering, more of a working gathering)<br/>
&gt;in the Johnson-Ellis-Navarro (JEN) area this fall.  If<br/>
&gt;you've looked at the map, you see that these three<br/>
&gt;counties are all together, just south of Dallas/Fort<br/>
&gt;Worth and a little toward East Texas, and yet they<br/>
&gt;have not a single box! I had first noticed this when<br/>
&gt;my sis-in-law who lives near Corsicana expressed<br/>
&gt;interest in boxing, but there were no boxes I could<br/>
&gt;refer her to!<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Here's the concept again: boxers converge on a<br/>
&gt;specific area to seed it with boxes for the<br/>
&gt;eventuality that someone in that area will be<br/>
&gt;interested.  We take the time in the morning to do it,<br/>
&gt;then we get together for a potluck lunch and exchanges<br/>
&gt;and all that stuff that goes with letterboxing, then<br/>
&gt;we head out to find each other's boxes before heading<br/>
&gt;home.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I'm looking toward October.  Does anyone who thinks<br/>
&gt;they may want to participate have a preference or a<br/>
&gt;specific date preference?  At this moment, I am wide<br/>
&gt;open date-wise, but I know that in the next month or<br/>
&gt;so virtually every weekend will fill up with scout<br/>
&gt;stuff, so I need to put a date on the calendar soon.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;I thought I would also try to start doing some<br/>
&gt;research for parks and trails and sites of interest in<br/>
&gt;the counties.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;Other thoughts about making this work?<br/>
