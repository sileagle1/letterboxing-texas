I have to be honest and tell you that my "retirement" was not totally <br/>
my idea since my job was outsourced and I chose to retire earlier <br/>
than I wanted to instead of finding another job.  Since my wife still <br/>
works for a few more years and the kids are still young, I'm more <br/>
like a Mr. Mom than a true retiree.  But it is still nice to not have <br/>
to deal with all the hassels of work and especially nice to no longer <br/>
be oncall 24x7.<br/>
