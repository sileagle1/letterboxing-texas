                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're going over the long weekend to Kerrville &amp; Burnet (Inks Lake)<br/>
and places in between and around there--we're leaving the planning<br/>
kind of loose on this one.  Depends on the weather and what kind of<br/>
mood the gang is in.  We're definitely going to watch the bat<br/>
emergence at Old Tunnel WMA.  <br/>
<br/>
We hope to find quite a few boxes and plant some as well. I have about<br/>
4-5 ready to plant, we'll just see how long the kids last.<br/>
<br/>
If there's a particular box in the general area that someone knows for<br/>
sure is missing, but the clues haven't been updated, would you let me<br/>
know?   We're also happy to check on "maybe missing" boxes for people.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy Fourth!<br/>
