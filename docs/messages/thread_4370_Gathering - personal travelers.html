If you look at the gathering listing, you will see a little suitcase that says "Personal Travelers". These are stamps that some boxers carry with them that have special clues (or not). It's a great way to walk up to someone and start a conversation! HOWEVER, if you want to pursue collecting personal traveler (PT) images, you probably need to look at them ahead of time - like, on a snowy, sleety, wet and yukky weekend that doesn't recommend itself to letterboxing? Ummmm....like, today?<br/>
<br/>Many clues for PT's can't be solved on the spot (although some can), so if you do a little research ahead of time, you'll be a lot more successful. Also, many PT owners (but not all) are glad to help you in advance if you think you've figured it out. They might not give you the answer, but they might redirect you if you need it. <br clear="all"/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just a couple of tips for new boxers:  if you're planning to find boxes, check the mystery boxes just in case.  Also, you should check at the last minute before leaving for the event in case someone has shown up early, placed new boxes and posted the clues.  We'll bring our copy machine again so you'll be able to copy the clues for the boxes you place in the park.  Also, Palmetto State Park has been rumored to be haunted, so watch out for ghosts (and clowns).<br>
