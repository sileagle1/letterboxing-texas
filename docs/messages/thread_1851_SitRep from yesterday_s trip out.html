                    <html><body><div>Lightning and I got up bright and early and got my sister-in-law Texas Flutterby yesterday and we all hit the trail with full intentions of hitting the federal areas down in Polk and San Jacinto counties.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had to pick her up at our in-law's house, and they live out in the boonies.  JB kokopelli's Scarlet and Rhett was right on the way between the in-law's and Highway 69.  It seemed foolish to pass that one by in our hurry to get on down to Coldspring, and since I hadn't yet actually found any of jbk's boxes, we were intrigued.  As I expected, we were FF's, so Lightning and I let TX-Flutterby stamp in first to have the official title.  Turns out - it is in the same cemetery as a GC I tried desperately to find for over an hour, and all I had to show for it was my FIRST case of PI for the season (if anyone besides me is counting - I'm now on my THIRD bout of PI!).  Very cool cemetery though - it has some amazing old headstones and yet is still a working church cemetery.  This little country church obviously loves their property - it is well tended and looks to be used by young and old alike.  And I've now visited there four times and three of those times, I had to dodge other visitors.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>We made our way on down to Lufkin, stopping long enough to get something to drink and check out the Forestry Museum, mainly to see if they have the forest maps for sale - they don't.  I could tell Flutterby wanted to go ahead and snag the boxes along the Urban Wildscape Trail, but heartless me told her we had to go!  It was raining anyway...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the time we got to Diboll, I was feeling guilty for not going ahead and getting the Wildscape boxes in Lufkin for her, so we stopped and let her get the Crawlin Down 59 box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We made our way on down to Livingston then and got the one at the Scout Hut there, Treasure, by ashby.  There were well over a dozen squirrels around there and they ignored us while we stamped in.  I'm just hoping they weren't muggle squirrels that went and unearthed that box after we left... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were still running early so we went on to Lake Livingston State Park and started working on those there for her benefit (I had found several of them when I visited in March).  I just love the boardwalk trail through that park.  It had apparently rained quite a lot before we got there (it was still raining sporadically while we were there).  There was a lot of water standing around the boardwalk.  We decided we would go ahead and try to find BabyBear's Gone Fishin' box since Will's World had reported finding it after it had been reported missing.  Now of course we knew better than to stick our bare hands behind that step - at first.  We slogged around with a stick, then with our hands after we either scared anything hiding away or made it mad.  We couldn't find the box anywhere, but we did have a little company!  Not 8 feet from us was a water moccasin moving through the water.  We decided that IF that box was there, we were content to let him enjoy it by himself!  We went on and visited the Duck Pond, where we were treated to more snake sightings.  There were two more water moccasins in the water, and one started swimming toward us.  Flutterby grabbed Lightning's stick and slapped the water, thinking it would scare the snake away, but he came on toward us anyway (now really - we were up on the pier and he was in the water, but he did seem a little intent on getting to know us better!).  She slapped the water again and yet he still came on.  When he got within stick's reach, he reared his head up about six inches out of the water and looked her squarely in the eye - I swear he did!  She smacked him directly this time, striking him in the head and he disappeared.  We decided it was time for us to move on too, in case he was gathering his snake army (I guess they wouldn't have foot soldiers, would they?) to come and meet us.  Now bear in mind, I am not particularly afraid of snakes (I respect 'em, mind you, but I can live in peace and harmony with them as long as the poisonous ones stay out of my yard), but that was a freaky experience.  I had a momentary visioin of that snake wrapping around the stick and her slinging him back high over our heads - UGH!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We went on to find The Jig, which was still playing host to Chillin' At Tonkawa.  We picked up Tonkawa at Frye Team's request, so it is no longer there as of yesterday. We also got Silver Eagle's Livingston Largemouth, Lucy Locket's Hank Hill, and Baby Bear's Udder Madness.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were able to find all the boxes in LLSP - except one.  The trail that is home to State Mammal by Quetzel was being deluged by under sixers.  My goodness!  I have no idea what the appeal was on that trail, but there were more rugrats on that trail than I think I've ever seen in total in state parks.  Weird.  We didn't even try it because we were a little intimidated at the thought of being so overwhelmingly outnumbered by munchkins, and I was wearing shorts and didn't feel my ankles were properly protected anyway.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short after LLSP - I had had a headache all morning, and it eventually became a migraine.  We wound up having to head on home, but ironically we had to stop in Lufkin for a bit so I could get a reprieve from the motion of the car.  Wound up Lightning and Flutterby went and got the boxes on the Wildscape Trail.  Next time?  I'll let her get 'em when she wants to - it wasn't worth the headache in the end!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In the end, Flutterby came away with something like 13 finds.  I found a few I hadn't yet gotten, we released one HH, retrieved a box for Frye Team, and rescued a box that was soaked.  I sent Flutterby home with a HH and a box I had made but hadn't gotten around to planting, so look for something new in the Navarro County area.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We are hoping to resume our trip in the near future, hopefully spending the weekend camping down that direction somewhere so we can really go to work!</div>

<div>It's kind of funny how that affects your mindset too - I held out on finding Big Bass Bonanza for months.  It was right in my town and was somewhere I go pretty often during the summer, and yet I just never quite got around to claiming it - I wanted to have one box I could go and get if I just had such a strong yen to go boxing and couldn't get to any other box.

Now you're just teasing me.  I looked for you all weekend long.  Do <br>
you know how close Lake Livingston State Park is to Coldspring :-)?  <br>
I can tell you a shortcut.  Seriously, I am sorry about your <br>
headache and I understand the motion sickness.  I also want to <br>
apologize for my son, Will's World, who checked the "Gone Fishin'" <br>
box as a find.  I just talked to him and he honestly just checked <br>
the wrong box.  I think it is truly missing.  At least you had other <br>
boxes to find.  I cautioned him to be very careful to click on the <br>
right box when claiming a find.  After the rain and the tornado, our <br>
weather in Coldspring was spectacular.  Come on down sometime.  <br>
There are now four boxes at Double Lake, and soon will be five.<br>

                    <html><body><div>No apologies needed on the box checked - I guess I had forgotten he is your son though - I was trying to figure out who on earth Will's World is!  Still though - no trip is ever wasted if we get to visit somewhere nice like Lake Livingston!  And as you said, we had other boxes to find...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had emphasized to my sis-in-law that we really had to make Coldspring at the very least.  After my headache hit, I relinquished driving to her and I think she seriously considered going on down there because I had insisted that we had to make it there...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And I would like that shortcut, if you please!  I studied the map and thought there HAD to be one - it made no sense to have to go through Shepherd to get to Coldspring unless there was something blocking the way, and I sure couldn't see that there was anything!

<div style="DIRECTION: ltr">Lucy, Lucy,<br/><br/>Now you're just teasing me.  I looked for you all weekend long.  Do <br/>you know how close Lake Livingston State Park is to Coldspring :-)?  <br/>I can tell you a shortcut.  Seriously, I am sorry about your 
<br/>headache and I understand the motion sickness.  I also want to <br/>apologize for my son, Will's World, who checked the "Gone Fishin'" <br/>box as a find.  I just talked to him and he honestly just checked <br/>
the wrong box.  I think it is truly missing.  At least you had other <br/>boxes to find.  I cautioned him to be very careful to click on the <br/>right box when claiming a find.  After the rain and the tornado, our <br/>weather in Coldspring was spectacular.  Come on down sometime.  
<br/>There are now four boxes at Double Lake, and soon will be five.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">

<br/>of hitting<br/>&gt; the federal areas down in Polk and San Jacinto counties.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I had to pick her up at our in-law's house, and they live out in <br/>the<br/>&gt; boonies.  JB kokopelli's Scarlet and Rhett was right on the way 
<br/>between the<br/>&gt; in-law's and Highway 69.  It seemed foolish to pass that one by in <br/>our hurry<br/>&gt; to get on down to Coldspring, and since I hadn't yet actually <br/>found any<br/>&gt; of jbk's boxes, we were intrigued.  As I expected, we were FF's, so
<br/>&gt; Lightning and I let TX-Flutterby stamp in first to have the <br/>official title.<br/>&gt; Turns out - it is in the same cemetery as a GC I tried desperately <br/>to find<br/>&gt; for over an hour, and all I had to show for it was my FIRST case 
<br/>of PI for<br/>&gt; the season (if anyone besides me is counting - I'm now on my THIRD <br/>bout of<br/>&gt; PI!).  Very cool cemetery though - it has some amazing old <br/>headstones and<br/>&gt; yet is still a working church cemetery.  This little country church
<br/>&gt; obviously loves their property - it is well tended and looks to be <br/>used by<br/>&gt; young and old alike.  And I've now visited there four times and <br/>three of<br/>&gt; those times, I had to dodge other visitors.
<br/>&gt; We made our way on down to Lufkin, stopping long enough to get <br/>something to<br/>&gt; drink and check out the Forestry Museum, mainly to see if they <br/>have the<br/>&gt; forest maps for sale - they don't.  I could tell Flutterby wanted 
<br/>to go<br/>&gt; ahead and snag the boxes along the Urban Wildscape Trail, but <br/>heartless me<br/>&gt; told her we had to go!  It was raining anyway...<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; By the time we got to Diboll, I was feeling guilty for not going 
<br/>ahead and<br/>&gt; getting the Wildscape boxes in Lufkin for her, so we stopped and <br/>let her get<br/>&gt; the Crawlin Down 59 box.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We made our way on down to Livingston then and got the one at the <br/>
Scout Hut<br/>&gt; there, Treasure, by ashby.  There were well over a dozen squirrels <br/>around<br/>&gt; there and they ignored us while we stamped in.  I'm just hoping <br/>they weren't<br/>&gt; muggle squirrels that went and unearthed that box after we left...
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We were still running early so we went on to Lake Livingston State <br/>Park and<br/>&gt; started working on those there for her benefit (I had found <br/>several of them<br/>&gt; when I visited in March).  I just love the boardwalk trail through 
<br/>that<br/>&gt; park.  It had apparently rained quite a lot before we got there <br/>(it was<br/>&gt; still raining sporadically while we were there).  There was a lot <br/>of water<br/>&gt; standing around the boardwalk.  We decided we would go ahead and 
<br/>try to find<br/>&gt; BabyBear's Gone Fishin' box since Will's World had reported <br/>finding it after<br/>&gt; it had been reported missing.  Now of course we knew better than <br/>to stick<br/>&gt; our bare hands behind that step - at first.  We slogged around 
<br/>with a stick,<br/>&gt; then with our hands after we either scared anything hiding away or <br/>made it<br/>&gt; mad.  We couldn't find the box anywhere, but we did have a little <br/>company!<br/>&gt; Not 8 feet from us was a water moccasin moving through the water.  
<br/>We<br/>&gt; decided that IF that box was there, we were content to let him <br/>enjoy it by<br/>&gt; himself!  We went on and visited the Duck Pond, where we were <br/>treated to<br/>&gt; more snake sightings.  There were two more water moccasins in the 
<br/>water, and<br/>&gt; one started swimming toward us.  Flutterby grabbed Lightning's <br/>stick and<br/>&gt; slapped the water, thinking it would scare the snake away, but he <br/>came on<br/>&gt; toward us anyway (now really - we were up on the pier and he was 
<br/>in the<br/>&gt; water, but he did seem a little intent on getting to know us <br/>better!).  She<br/>&gt; slapped the water again and yet he still came on.  When he got <br/>within<br/>&gt; stick's reach, he reared his head up about six inches out of the 
<br/>water and<br/>&gt; looked her squarely in the eye - I swear he did!  She smacked him <br/>directly<br/>&gt; this time, striking him in the head and he disappeared.  We <br/>decided it was<br/>&gt; time for us to move on too, in case he was gathering his snake 
<br/>army (I guess<br/>&gt; they wouldn't have foot soldiers, would they?) to come and meet <br/>us.  Now<br/>&gt; bear in mind, I am not particularly afraid of snakes (I <br/>respect 'em, mind<br/>&gt; you, but I can live in peace and harmony with them as long as the 
<br/>poisonous<br/>&gt; ones stay out of my yard), but that was a freaky experience.  I <br/>had a<br/>&gt; momentary visioin of that snake wrapping around the stick and her <br/>slinging<br/>&gt; him back high over our heads - UGH!
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We went on to find The Jig, which was still playing host to <br/>Chillin' At<br/>&gt; Tonkawa.  We picked up Tonkawa at Frye Team's request, so it is no <br/>longer<br/>&gt; there as of yesterday. We also got Silver Eagle's Livingston 
<br/>Largemouth,<br/>&gt; Lucy Locket's Hank Hill, and Baby Bear's Udder Madness.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We were able to find all the boxes in LLSP - except one.  The <br/>trail that is<br/>&gt; home to State Mammal by Quetzel was being deluged by under 
<br/>sixers.  My<br/>&gt; goodness!  I have no idea what the appeal was on that trail, but <br/>there were<br/>&gt; more rugrats on that trail than I think I've ever seen in total in <br/>state<br/>&gt; parks.  Weird.  We didn't even try it because we were a little 
<br/>intimidated<br/>&gt; at the thought of being so overwhelmingly outnumbered by <br/>munchkins, and I<br/>&gt; was wearing shorts and didn't feel my ankles were properly <br/>protected anyway.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short after LLSP - I had had 
<br/>a<br/>&gt; headache all morning, and it eventually became a migraine.  We <br/>wound up<br/>&gt; having to head on home, but ironically we had to stop in Lufkin <br/>for a bit so<br/>&gt; I could get a reprieve from the motion of the car.  Wound up 
<br/>Lightning and<br/>&gt; Flutterby went and got the boxes on the Wildscape Trail.  Next <br/>time?  I'll<br/>&gt; let her get 'em when she wants to - it wasn't worth the headache <br/>in the end!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In the end, Flutterby came away with something like 13 finds.  I 
<br/>found a few<br/>&gt; I hadn't yet gotten, we released one HH, retrieved a box for Frye <br/>Team, and<br/>&gt; rescued a box that was soaked.  I sent Flutterby home with a HH <br/>and a box I<br/>&gt; had made but hadn't gotten around to planting, so look for 
<br/>something new in<br/>&gt; the Navarro County area.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; We are hoping to resume our trip in the near future, hopefully <br/>spending the<br/>&gt; weekend camping down that direction somewhere so we can really go 
<br/>to work!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --<br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt;<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></span></div>

<div></div>When you come out of the State Park, turn right, then right again 
  on <br/>FM 1988 (left would take you back to Livingston), then right again 
  <br/>on FM 3278.  This takes you across the Trinity River right in front 
  <br/>of the dam. FM 3278 deadends into FM 222 at Camilla.  Take another 
  <br/>right.  FM 222 deadends into SH 150.  Turn right again and you 
  will <br/>be in Coldspring.  Just keep turning right!<br/><br/>Boots

  going on down there because I had <br/>insisted<br/>&gt; that we had to make it 
  there...<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; And I would like that shortcut, if you please!  
  I studied the map <br/>and<br/>&gt; thought there HAD to be one - it made no 
  sense to have to go <br/>through<br/>&gt; Shepherd to get to Coldspring unless 
  there was something blocking <br/>the way,<br/>&gt; and I sure couldn't see that

  apologize for my son, Will's World, who checked the "Gone <br/>Fishin'"<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; box as a find.  I just talked to him and he honestly just 
  checked<br/>&gt; &gt; the wrong box.  I think it is truly missing.  
  At least you had <br/>other<br/>&gt; &gt; boxes to find.  I cautioned him 
  to be very careful to click on <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; right box when claiming a 
  find.  After the rain and the tornado, <br/>our<br/>&gt; &gt; weather in 
  Coldspring was spectacular.  Come on down sometime.<br/>&gt; &gt; There 
  are now four boxes at Double Lake, and soon will be five.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;

  I got up bright and early and got my sister-in-<br/>law<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  Texas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Flutterby yesterday and we all hit the trail with full 
  <br/>intentions<br/>&gt; &gt; of hitting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the federal areas 
  down in Polk and San Jacinto counties.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I 
  had to pick her up at our in-law's house, and they live out <br/>in<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; boonies.  JB kokopelli's Scarlet and Rhett was 
  right on the way<br/>&gt; &gt; between the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; in-law's and 
  Highway 69.  It seemed foolish to pass that one <br/>by in<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  our hurry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to get on down to Coldspring, and since I hadn't 
  yet actually<br/>&gt; &gt; found any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of jbk's boxes, we were 
  intrigued.  As I expected, we were <br/>FF's, so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  Lightning and I let TX-Flutterby stamp in first to have the<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  official title.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Turns out - it is in the same cemetery as a 
  GC I tried <br/>desperately<br/>&gt; &gt; to find<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for over an 
  hour, and all I had to show for it was my FIRST <br/>case<br/>&gt; &gt; of PI 
  for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the season (if anyone besides me is counting - I'm now 
  on my <br/>THIRD<br/>&gt; &gt; bout of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; PI!).  Very cool 
  cemetery though - it has some amazing old<br/>&gt; &gt; headstones and<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; yet is still a working church cemetery.  This little country 
  <br/>church<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously loves their property - it is well 
  tended and looks <br/>to be<br/>&gt; &gt; used by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; young and 
  old alike.  And I've now visited there four times and<br/>&gt; &gt; three 
  of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; those times, I had to dodge other visitors.<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; We made our way on down to Lufkin, stopping long enough to get<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; something to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; drink and check out the Forestry Museum, 
  mainly to see if they<br/>&gt; &gt; have the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; forest maps for 
  sale - they don't.  I could tell Flutterby <br/>wanted<br/>&gt; &gt; to 
  go<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ahead and snag the boxes along the Urban Wildscape Trail, 
  but<br/>&gt; &gt; heartless me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; told her we had to go!  
  It was raining anyway...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; By the time we 
  got to Diboll, I was feeling guilty for not <br/>going<br/>&gt; &gt; ahead 
  and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; getting the Wildscape boxes in Lufkin for her, so we 
  stopped <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; let her get<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Crawlin Down 59 
  box.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We made our way on down to Livingston 
  then and got the one at <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; Scout Hut<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  there, Treasure, by ashby.  There were well over a dozen 
  <br/>squirrels<br/>&gt; &gt; around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there and they ignored us 
  while we stamped in.  I'm just hoping<br/>&gt; &gt; they weren't<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; muggle squirrels that went and unearthed that box after we 
  <br/>left...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We were still running early so 
  we went on to Lake Livingston <br/>State<br/>&gt; &gt; Park and<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; started working on those there for her benefit (I had found<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  several of them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; when I visited in March).  I just love 
  the boardwalk trail <br/>through<br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  park.  It had apparently rained quite a lot before we got there<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; (it was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; still raining sporadically while we were 
  there).  There was a <br/>lot<br/>&gt; &gt; of water<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  standing around the boardwalk.  We decided we would go ahead 
  <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; try to find<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; BabyBear's Gone Fishin' box 
  since Will's World had reported<br/>&gt; &gt; finding it after<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; it had been reported missing.  Now of course we knew better 
  <br/>than<br/>&gt; &gt; to stick<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; our bare hands behind that 
  step - at first.  We slogged around<br/>&gt; &gt; with a stick,<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; then with our hands after we either scared anything hiding <br/>away 
  or<br/>&gt; &gt; made it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; mad.  We couldn't find the box 
  anywhere, but we did have a <br/>little<br/>&gt; &gt; company!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  Not 8 feet from us was a water moccasin moving through the <br/>water.<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; We<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; decided that IF that box was there, we were content 
  to let him<br/>&gt; &gt; enjoy it by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; himself!  We went 
  on and visited the Duck Pond, where we were<br/>&gt; &gt; treated to<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; more snake sightings.  There were two more water moccasins in 
  <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; water, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one started swimming toward 
  us.  Flutterby grabbed Lightning's<br/>&gt; &gt; stick and<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; slapped the water, thinking it would scare the snake away, but 
  <br/>he<br/>&gt; &gt; came on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; toward us anyway (now really - 
  we were up on the pier and he <br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; in the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  water, but he did seem a little intent on getting to know us<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  better!).  She<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; slapped the water again and yet he still 
  came on.  When he got<br/>&gt; &gt; within<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; stick's 
  reach, he reared his head up about six inches out of <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  water and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; looked her squarely in the eye - I swear he 
  did!  She smacked <br/>him<br/>&gt; &gt; directly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; this 
  time, striking him in the head and he disappeared.  We<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  decided it was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; time for us to move on too, in case he was 
  gathering his snake<br/>&gt; &gt; army (I guess<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; they wouldn't 
  have foot soldiers, would they?) to come and meet<br/>&gt; &gt; us.  
  Now<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; bear in mind, I am not particularly afraid of snakes 
  (I<br/>&gt; &gt; respect 'em, mind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you, but I can live in 
  peace and harmony with them as long as <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; poisonous<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; &gt; ones stay out of my yard), but that was a freaky experience.  
  I<br/>&gt; &gt; had a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; momentary visioin of that snake 
  wrapping around the stick and <br/>her<br/>&gt; &gt; slinging<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  him back high over our heads - UGH!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We 
  went on to find The Jig, which was still playing host to<br/>&gt; &gt; Chillin' 
  At<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Tonkawa.  We picked up Tonkawa at Frye Team's 
  request, so it <br/>is no<br/>&gt; &gt; longer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; there as of 
  yesterday. We also got Silver Eagle's Livingston<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  Largemouth,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Lucy Locket's Hank Hill, and Baby Bear's Udder 
  Madness.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We were able to find all the 
  boxes in LLSP - except one.  The<br/>&gt; &gt; trail that is<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  &gt; home to State Mammal by Quetzel was being deluged by under<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  sixers.  My<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; goodness!  I have no idea what the 
  appeal was on that trail, <br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; there were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  more rugrats on that trail than I think I've ever seen in <br/>total in<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; state<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; parks.  Weird.  We didn't even try it 
  because we were a little<br/>&gt; &gt; intimidated<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at the 
  thought of being so overwhelmingly outnumbered by<br/>&gt; &gt; munchkins, and 
  I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was wearing shorts and didn't feel my ankles were 
  properly<br/>&gt; &gt; protected anyway.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 
  Unfortunately, we had to cut our trip short after LLSP - I had <br/>had<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; headache all morning, and it eventually became a 
  migraine.  We<br/>&gt; &gt; wound up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; having to head on 
  home, but ironically we had to stop in Lufkin<br/>&gt; &gt; for a bit 
  so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I could get a reprieve from the motion of the car.  
  Wound up<br/>&gt; &gt; Lightning and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Flutterby went and got 
  the boxes on the Wildscape Trail.  Next<br/>&gt; &gt; time?  
  I'll<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; let her get 'em when she wants to - it wasn't worth the 
  <br/>headache<br/>&gt; &gt; in the end!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; In 
  the end, Flutterby came away with something like 13 finds.  <br/>I<br/>&gt; 
  &gt; found a few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I hadn't yet gotten, we released one HH, 
  retrieved a box for <br/>Frye<br/>&gt; &gt; Team, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rescued 
  a box that was soaked.  I sent Flutterby home with a HH<br/>&gt; &gt; and 
  a box I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had made but hadn't gotten around to planting, so 
  look for<br/>&gt; &gt; something new in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the Navarro County 
  area.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We are hoping to resume our trip in 
  the near future, hopefully<br/>&gt; &gt; spending the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; weekend
