longer.<br>
Who made all the chili? I'd appreciate recipes if you<br>
don't mind. Always on the hunt for food. Hm. I should<br>
incorporate that into a box or something. Wooo...<br>
something similar to the tourbus.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which... while at the event, another stamp<br>
was added. The Recover Well - our running gag. Don't<br>
know where it'll be but just wanted to let you all<br>
know that I added my stamp to it yesterday.<br>
<br>
It was great meeting everyone and seeing familiar<br>
faces.<br>
<br>
I can't wait for the next event!!!<br>
<br>
Have fun!!<br>
