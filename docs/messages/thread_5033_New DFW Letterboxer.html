<br/>
I thought that I would pop in and introduce myself.  I just discovered letterboxing about a week ago through a friend's posting of her adventure on Facebook.  I have already dragged my hubby out twice and found 7 boxes.  The first one was especially exciting!  I am totally hooked.  I went right out and bought the carving kit and carved 3 stamps.  Still need LOTS of practice.<br/>
<br/>
We live in Lewisville, just north of Dallas and Fort Worth.  My children are grown and married.  When I first saw my friends post I thought that this was a great activity for families.  But now I think it is even better for just the "grownups".  I keep thinking that to traipse my younger children through all of that bush in the heat would have left us all miserable.  I would definitely have had to choose my adventures more carefully. I am hoping to convince my daughter to join me soon.<br/>
<br/>
Hubby is a work-from-home IT geek and I mostly volunteer and also have an online job that is quite flexible.  Hubby's job has him working every weekend, so I have a lot of free weekend time and would love to get together with other letterboxers in the area.<br/>

Welcome! Welcome! This is indeed great fun, and you meet the nicest, most interesting people. Hubby and I are also post kids, and enjoy boxing together. Grand kids are interested for the first box or two, then off down the trail, anticipating the end so they can get back to the pool. <br/>
Look forward to meeting you. Next time I'm in DFW area am planning day or two boxing. Interested? If you are in Austin area I'd love to show you around.<br/>
You are going to love Tomato Fest, although beware an old guy with a floppy hat.<br/>
See you on the trail<br/>

&gt; Welcome! Welcome! This is indeed great fun, and you meet the nicest, most interesting people. Hubby and I are also post kids, and enjoy boxing together. Grand kids are interested for the first box or two, then off down the trail, anticipating the end so they can get back to the pool. <br/>
&gt; Look forward to meeting you. Next time I'm in DFW area am planning day or two boxing. Interested? If you are in Austin area I'd love to show you around.<br/>
&gt; You are going to love Tomato Fest, although beware an old guy with a floppy hat.<br/>

<br/>
Also, many l'boxers carry any number of Personal Travelers. A PT is an additional stamp that requires the seeker to ask for. Sometimes there is some sort of riddle which must be solved before the holder will reveal his/her traveler. PTs are all listed on AQ at the event site.<br/>
Then there are special event stamps carved by someone. It commemorates the event itself, and is only available at the event. Just ask for it. Also look around for boxes hidden in plain sight.<br/>
<br/>
I'm sure you will have many more questions along the way. There is a l'box list for newbies, but I don't know the address. Anyone else out there to that info? <br/>

Happy 'boxing, Chris. I've done little boxing in SanAntonio and would love to meet you there too. <br/>

&gt; I was actually kinda wondering about the events in general.  One thing I thought of was if we need a unique stamp for exchanges for each event or do we just use our signature stamp?  I don't understand if you only exchange with each person once or at each event-thus needing a separate stamp.<br/>

Other than that, BGJ summed it up nicely!<br/><br/>The Newboxers list is:<br/><br/><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers">groups.yahoo.com/group/newboxers</a><br/><br/>That's a GREAT group to ask general questions, but there are a fair number of issues that are handled differently regionally, so you can ask here, or you can also ask on the DFW list, which I don't remember that addy.<br/>
