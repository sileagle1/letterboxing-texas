I had the same experience. I went out to find a geocache in my immediate area and finally found it. (Those GPS' are not as easy as they seem!) Inside was basically what I'll call - Happy Meal Toys - only not cool new items that you could give to your kids, no, they were unwrapped and obviously used. I can't tell you the disappointment of it all. At least when I get a letterbox, there is something of value that I can 'take away' with me, no matter what the skill level. A treasure.<br>
<br>
It was kinda cool in that I love techy stuff, but I'll definately be keeping letterboxing first and foremost. :)<br>
<br>
It did give me an idea for a box for the gathering though. . .ha ha ha!<br>
