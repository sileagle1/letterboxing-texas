Well - it was a sad weekend.<br>
<br>
One day last week we were out traveling with the in-laws from Germany, my<br>
wife got a call on her cell-phone.  Her best friend - her mentor - the<br>
matriarch of the Riverwood line of Great Danes had just succumbed to cancer<br>
after a 9-year battle.  We were hoping she could hang on till we could get<br>
to Tucson to say our good-bys.  It just didn't work out.  She was 60.<br>
<br>
My wife was crushed.  Our dogs are what they are today because this lady<br>
took my wife aside and showed her why our dogs were losers, and how to breed<br>
winners.<br>
<br>
Then 1 hour later, my wife gets another call.  The dog she sent out with a<br>
professional handler, one that was bred between her and her friend, had won<br>
the show and earned enough points to make it to the National Finals again<br>
this year.  I had to drive for a while, she couldn't. She was certain her<br>
friend influenced that win from above.<br>
<br>
The funeral Friday was hard.  I am not a stranger to death, but it was<br>
usually swift and violent for me.  My wife took it hard.  But Saturday was<br>
even worse.  We met with the surviving husband.  A really great guy.  He<br>
can't keep the dogs.  He has no clue.  So we worked with him for hours.  We<br>
sold the top champion for $5000.  We placed the puppies in good show homes.<br>
It seems he didn't know he is sitting on about $20k in frozen semen.  But we<br>
talked about so much more.  I lost it when he told us how she died in his<br>
arms hugging him tight and telling him she loved him.  I don't know how he<br>
did it.  I think I would rather die quickly in battle.<br>
<br>
Anyway - we got a late start Saturday headed back to El Paso from Tucson.<br>
We decided - what the heck - no kids - no dogs - no hurry.  We cruised all<br>
of SE-Arizona.  Several letterboxes, some Geocaches, visited the Titan<br>
Missile Museum, the Tombstone Courthouse, just stopped when we were tired,<br>
and just enjoyed ourselves.  Took time out to appreciate just being<br>
together.  Some of the letterboxes were neat.<br>
<br>
Anyway - the only letterboxing I get to do is when we are on the road.  So I<br>
got to take every opportunity.<br>
<br>
Next weekend - Albuquerque.  Got to pick up that dog as the handler passes<br>
through.<br>
<br>
Do you think she might win the national this year?  She is a good dog -<br>
champion bred!<br>
<br>
At least I picked up 17 letterboxes in the last two weeks.  None within 100<br>
miles of El Paso.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">mike, i am so sorry to hear about your loss.  it appears that we <br>
have been in similar circumstances.  my best friend for the last 10 <br>
years and my partner in letterboxing (the j in jb kokopelli) passed <br>
away last tuesday and the funeral was friday.  she had been <br>
diagnosed with ovarian cancer this past june.  it has been an <br>
extremely rough week on me.  we had lived in tucson prior to moving <br>
back to texas.  my heart and prayers go out to you and your family<br>
