<div>I just got a nice message from a recent finder of my White Sail letterbox 
(at Lake Grapevine) that they had enjoyed the hike, the view, the box, and that 
someone had even left them some peanut butter crackers in the box as a nice 
surprise!  </div>
<div>OH NO!  </div>
<div>First of all, food in a letterbox is an invitation to animals; the scent 
attracts them and they will destroy the box to get to the food.  But an 
even bigger worry  to me is kids with peanut allergies!  My 
granddaughter is one of these kids, and even a trace contaminant of peanut 
butter left in the box would be enough to send her into anaphylactic 
shock.   Had she been with me on a hike to check that box, it would 
have been very serious (yes, we always carry the Epi pen, but still you have to 
call the paramedics or get to the emergency room immediately.  Kids with 
that allergy can die without immediate medical treatment, and that trail is 
a long way for emergency medical rescue personnel to reach any child with those 
allergies who might be letterboxing with their parents and open that box 
.  </div>
<div>    I'm posting a warning on the clues for that box for 
any letterboxers with peanut allergies, and as soon as possible, I'll replace 
the box with a new container and if necessary, new stamp and logbook too -- if 
the animals don't get to it first, of course. </div>
<div>    PLEASE don't ever leave any food -- especially 
<u>peanuts or peanut butter</u> -- in a letterbox!  </div>
