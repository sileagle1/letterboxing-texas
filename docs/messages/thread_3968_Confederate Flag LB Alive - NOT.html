find <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Probably would not have mattered.  I got an unfriendly note from <br/>
caretaker there that I needed to remove my box from their park (I <br/>
believe it to be missing anyway).   Needless to say this park could <br/>
use visitation, but not by me anymore.   Seems ranger at Lake Whitney <br/>
SP has also taken a tough stance, so I have removed my clues to this <br/>
box's location, and put in place a note for my friends at the the <br/>
park service.   I understand the need to make sure boxes are not put <br/>
in bad areas, but the rules he laid out (Geocaching rules) are <br/>
impossible to comply with. SO, again, another park I will not be <br/>
visiting in the future.    <br/>
