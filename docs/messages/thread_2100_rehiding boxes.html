</p><div>I was just reading my friend's (Sue Sojourner of Orange, CT) Letterboxing 101 (link found on the LBNA site) and I really like what she says about rehiding a letterbox:</div>
<div>Â </div>
<div>After finding a letterbox, rehide it as well as or better than you originally found it. Again, discretion at this time is very important. It is a good idea to cover the box with a handful of dead leaves, anchor the box with a flat rock so that an inquisitive critter can't run off with it, and then put a few more leaves or twigs on top so it looks natural to passers-by. Look at it from different angles before you leave to make sure no plastic is showing. Never leave a letterbox out in plain sight!</div></body></html>
