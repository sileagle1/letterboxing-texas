<br/>
1)Are there any clues on "leterboxingtexas" that are not published <br/>
elswhere?<br/>
2)There is a nifty lookin patch on the home page of the LBNA logo in a <br/>
Texas shape. Can they be puchased, or did I miss the boat?<br/>

Thanks in advance<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Heya Warm Front!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clues on the list...hmmm.  Clues, clues, clues.  Where DID those clues go?  Actually, the answer to your question is a resounding YES followed by a Sorta.  For the last year and a half or so we've had the good fortune of a traveling Texas Tour Bus that was planted originally by TeamKing and has taken a life of its own.  The rules of it were (TK, correct me if I'm wrong): 1) the placer had to post the clues to it on this list, letterboxingtexas. 2) the finder had to post as soon as possible that they had found it, again on this list. 3) the finder had to put a stamp in the box that represented some distinctive Texan. 4) the finder then had to replant the box somewhere in Texas and post the clues on this list.  So you see, every time that bus got rehidden, the clues were posted right here - nowhere else!  And in time, that bus got full and kept traveling, although it ceased to take on new passengers (heck - it was chocked full with some 40+ stamps and heavy!) and another bus took off from the bus station and follows the same rules.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now the sorta - the newer bus is in the Houston area right now with dewberry and it's anyone's guess where she'll turn it loose, and the original bus is out of communication.  Apparently some new folks got it who didn't know how to play and we are hoping that somehow someone can get in touch with them to get them up to speed so we can get it back in play.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Playing with these silly buses has been one of the funnest things I've done as a letterboxer.  It's been hilariously funny to hear the stories folks come up with to go along with the bus, and to see the mad dashes made to retrieve the bus as soon as the clues were posted.  SOME letterboxers have even gone so far as to raid the territory of others to STEAL the bus away (I'll not name names, but her initials are PS).  I know for my part I've put my boss on notice a couple of times that the bus was in the area and I may have to drop and run if it hits the ground anywhere around me.  And when it finally did hit my area and Puddle Splasher couldn't scramble this way quick enough?  I stopped by my house after work long enough to pick up my son, Lightning, and headed off to retrieve the box - in dress and heels, through the woods.  And not to minimize one particularly cool part of the buses - seeing everyone's carving efforts and to see who they come up with to add to the bus.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, if there are other clues buried on this list, your guess is as good as mine, but the bus has had numerous sets of clues posted for it, and hopefully there will be clues for it for many road trips yet to come.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As to the patches, the two folks who have patches are out of contact right now, and even so, they have only a very few, I'm sure.  But for sure, they are really nice patches.  I like to keep them and either give them to new letterboxer kids or put them in boxes expected to be frequented by newbies, but I'm completely out, as are several other folks on the list, and several new folks have asked about them.  I keep thinking I'll get an order together, but then SJZ's car breaks down, or Lightning needs camp money, or...maybe someone else has better $$$ luck than I've had lately and they would front the order.

&gt; &gt; quick enough?  I stopped by my house after work long enough to <br/>
pick <br/>
&gt; up my<br/>
&gt; &gt; son, Lightning, and headed off to retrieve the box - in dress and <br/>
&gt; heels,<br/>
&gt; &gt; through the woods.  And not to minimize one particularly cool <br/>
part <br/>
&gt; of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; buses - seeing everyone's carving efforts and to see who they <br/>
come <br/>
&gt; up with<br/>
&gt; &gt; to add to the bus.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; So anyway, if there are other clues buried on this list, your <br/>
guess <br/>
&gt; is as<br/>
&gt; &gt; good as mine, but the bus has had numerous sets of clues posted <br/>
for <br/>
&gt; it, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; hopefully there will be clues for it for many road trips yet to <br/>
&gt; come.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; As to the patches, the two folks who have patches are out of <br/>
&gt; contact right<br/>
&gt; &gt; now, and even so, they have only a very few, I'm sure.  But for <br/>
&gt; sure, they<br/>
&gt; &gt; are really nice patches.  I like to keep them and either give <br/>
them <br/>
&gt; to new<br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxer kids or put them in boxes expected to be frequented <br/>
by <br/>
&gt; newbies,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but I'm completely out, as are several other folks on the list, <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; several<br/>
&gt; &gt; new folks have asked about them.  I keep thinking I'll get an <br/>
order<br/>
&gt; &gt; together, but then SJZ's car breaks down, or Lightning needs camp <br/>
&gt; money,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or...maybe someone else has better $$$ luck than I've had lately <br/>
&gt; and they<br/>
&gt; &gt; would front the order.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; We in Texas have added our own twists to letterboxing and have <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; &gt; cultural eccentricities in the bigger LB community - something we <br/>
&gt; are very<br/>
&gt; &gt; proud of!<br/>
