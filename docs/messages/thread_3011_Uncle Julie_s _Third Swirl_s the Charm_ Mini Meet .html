                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I'm finally home from Texas, where 102 degrees worth of heat and<br/>
9 other folks make for a great day of letterboxing! I finally got to<br/>
meet Gryzzled Gryphon, Blooming Flowers and her hubby and little one,<br/>
Puddle Splasher, Batty Girl and her hubby, plus I brought along a new<br/>
boxer, Stealth Wookie. We all sat down to margarita swirls and event<br/>
stamps galore while packing away Mexican fare. By the time I had<br/>
nearly finished my swirl, the parking lot was looking kinda swirly,<br/>
too, so I gave the rest to Stealth Wookie's wife and drank water until<br/>
I felt like driving my father's new Infinity was a safe thing to do!<br/>
;-) Blooming Flowers gave me a LbTx patch and pin from Barefoot Lucy<br/>
(not my first, but the first to go on my bag until I can find my LBMA<br/>
patch again) and we all had a ball despite the heat. I even brought<br/>
some noxer friends (since I really only had one day to catch up with<br/>
friends this trip), but everyone was really nice about it...no<br/>
taunting, mental abuse or ritual hazing the way we do with noxers up<br/>
North! ;-)<br/>
<br/>
Afterward Stealth Wookie and I dragged his wife along to do the<br/>
Carrollton boxes of the A League Of Their Own series. What a cool set<br/>
of boxes! Instead of stamping into your logbook, mater et regisfilia<br/>
left a little baseball diamond so that you had to stamp the stamps<br/>
(little ponytailed players) onto it! Had we done the entire set,<br/>
we'dve had the entire field filled; how I wish we'd had the time to go<br/>
to the other cities!<br/>
<br/>
Frankly, aside from my brother's wedding, this one day was the most<br/>
fun I had in the whole 5 day trip! Being without my husband/lifelong<br/>
pal was tough enough (especially at the wedding where I had no one to<br/>
dance with, pout, pout!), but the boxers of Texas really salvaged my<br/>
visit. Thanks again everyone!<br/>

I finally got to<br/>meet Gryzzled Gryphon, Blooming Flowers and her hubby and little one, <br/>Puddle Splasher, Batty Girl and her hubby, plus I brought along a new<br/>boxer, Stealth Wookie. We all sat down to margarita swirls and event<br/>stamps galore while packing away Mexican fare. By the time I had<br/>nearly finished my swirl, the parking lot was looking kinda swirly, <br/>too, so I gave the rest to Stealth Wookie's wife and drank water until<br/>I felt like
 driving my father's new Infinity was a safe thing to do!<br/>;-) Blooming Flowers gave me a LbTx patch and pin from Barefoot Lucy <br/>(not my first, but the first to go on my bag until I can find my LBMA<br/>patch again) and we all had a ball despite the heat. I even brought<br/>some noxer friends (since I really only had one day to catch up with<br/>friends this trip), but everyone was really nice about it...no <br/>taunting, mental abuse or ritual hazing the way we do with noxers up<br/>North! ;-)<br/><br/>Afterward Stealth Wookie and I dragged his wife along to do the<br/>Carrollton boxes of the A League Of Their Own series. What a cool set <br/>of boxes! Instead of stamping into your logbook, mater et regisfilia<br/>left a little baseball diamond so that you had to stamp the stamps<br/>(little ponytailed players) onto it! Had we done the entire set,<br/>we'dve had the entire field filled; how I wish we'd had the time to go <br/>to the other cities!<br/><br/>Frankly, aside from my
 brother's wedding, this one day was the most<br/>fun I had in the whole 5 day trip! Being without my husband/lifelong<br/>pal was tough enough (especially at the wedding where I had no one to <br/>dance with, pout, pout!), but the boxers of Texas really salvaged my<br/>visit.

<div>"Destroy" is a harsh word, Miss Lucy, but I must admit we did not practice LNT (if inky fingerprints on white cloth napkins counts). It might be best if we hold our future gatherings at Chucky Cheese or perhaps Sonny Bryants BBQ (where the ink blends with the bbq sauce on the napkins).</div>
