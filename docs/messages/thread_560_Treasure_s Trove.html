Just wanted to let any boxers know who are trying to solve the <br/>
Treasures Trove book treasure hunt-I met the author Sun. at the <br/>
Dallas Museum of Natural History.  He signed my book and I mentioned <br/>
to him that I heard about his treasure hunt through a letterboxing <br/>
talk list and he had no idea what Letterboxing was.  I hipped him to <br/>
it so who knows?  Maybe someday he'll become a boxer , only instead <br/>
of putting a stamp in it he'll put 1 million worth of jewels in <br/>
one!  LOL<br/>
