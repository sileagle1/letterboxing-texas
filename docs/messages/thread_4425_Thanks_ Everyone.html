The docs let me go home this afternoon and Blue Butterfly is staying with me tonight. My snake bite is healing and things are looking great. <br>

Of course, the nurse was confused by the ink on my fingers and the CA had no idea why there were camo film canisters in my bed. :-)<br>

Yes!  I am still planning on being at the Gusher Gather. I don't want to miss it!<br>
<br>
I am planning on going back to work tomorrow. I had one of the teachers go ahead and tell my students that I got bit while picking up firewood. :-). They all think I'm wierd, anyway, so there's no use in adding fuel to THAT fire. <br>
<br>
Thanks again for all of the well wishes and sweet gestures that were sent to my mom and I. You all are a great bunch of people. <br>

  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; When Bluebutterfly told me you had ink on your 
  fingers at the hospital<br/>&gt; &gt; when they were checking your snake bite, 
  I cracked up laughing. I told her I<br/>&gt; &gt; was happy that you were out 
  of the woods (literally, as well as<br/>&gt; &gt; figuratively) so we could 
  find the humor in the situation, and I think the<br/>&gt; &gt; inky fingers and 
  the cooties in your bed is just that! Take it easy, and<br/>&gt; &gt; make sure 
  you're fully recovered before hopping back on that band podium,<br/>&gt; &gt;

  Thanks, Everyone<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I just 
  wanted to say a quick Thank You to all of the Texas Letterboxers.<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  You all made a tough situation a lot easier. I really appreciate all of 
  the<br/>&gt; &gt; help, visits, well wishes and just the positive feelings we 
  received. I will<br/>&gt; &gt; always be grateful.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; 
  The docs let me go home this afternoon and Blue Butterfly is staying 
  with<br/>&gt; &gt; me tonight. My snake bite is healing and things are looking 
  great.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Of course, the nurse was confused by the ink 
  on my fingers and the CA had<br/>&gt; &gt; no idea why there were camo film 
  canisters in my bed. :-)<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank You , Thank You, 
  Thank You!!!<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Lucy Locket<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;
