The docs let me go home this afternoon and Blue Butterfly is staying with me tonight. My snake bite is healing and things are looking great. <br/>

Of course, the nurse was confused by the ink on my fingers and the CA had no idea why there were camo film canisters in my bed. :-)<br/>

<div>When Bluebutterfly told me you had ink on your fingers at the hospital when they were checking your snake bite, I cracked up laughing. I told her I was happy that you were out of the woods (literally, as well as figuratively) so we could find the humor in the situation, and I think the inky fingers and the cooties in your bed is just that! Take it easy, and make sure you're fully recovered before hopping back on that band podium, Lucy Locket!</div>

Yes!  I am still planning on being at the Gusher Gather. I don't want to miss it!<br/>
<br/>
I am planning on going back to work tomorrow. I had one of the teachers go ahead and tell my students that I got bit while picking up firewood. :-). They all think I'm wierd, anyway, so there's no use in adding fuel to THAT fire. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for all of the well wishes and sweet gestures that were sent to my mom and I. You all are a great bunch of people. <br/>
