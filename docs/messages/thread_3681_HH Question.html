<p><font color="#0000bf">     I have the HH you are looking for, and I sent you an email about it.</font></p>
<p><font color="#0000bf">Blue Butterfly</font></p>
<p><font color="#ff0000">My grandson and his Mother Captain Zach and Berrylushious was out<br/>letterboxing in Athens TX and Zach planted a hitchhiker in one of the<br/>boxes there. I could not make heads or tells out of what they were<br/>saying about it but it seems that they did not know how to do a<br/>hitchhiker so they just did something. What you are describing about<br/>the one you found sounds like something they did. Did you find it in<br/>Athens? I believe they did put an email address in the hh so anyone<br/>who found it could contact them. They asked me to list it on line as<br/>a hh but I did not have enough details to do it so I said they would<br/>have to do it themselves. I don't know if they got around to doing it<br/>yet.
