<p>Wow!!!<span> </span>The Circus has been wonderful!!</p>
<p></p>
<p>That Human Cannonball act was truly amazing!!! <span></span>The Cotton Candy was yummy.<span> </span>TX Cowgirl really enjoyed Flixxy the Dancing Horse.<span> </span>Pocahontas liked the Circus Acrobats and the Circus poster.</p>
<p></p>
<p>But let me tell you we saw a mad elephant!<span> </span>She just had to be contained. <span></span>Then there was this cute little mouse who helped that mad elephants child. <span></span>Who would have thought what act finished the show?<span> </span>We truly saw an elephant fly!!<span> </span></p>
<p></p>
<p>Im sure he will fly to finish off a bit of cotton candy tomorrow as he says farewell to friends.<span> </span>Follow him to enjoy the circus.</p>
