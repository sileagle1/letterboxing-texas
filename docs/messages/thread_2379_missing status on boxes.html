<div>I guess this points out the <br/>risk <br/>&gt; of assuming a box is 
missing, even if it really is missing for a <br/>while.<br/>  Or even 
if it really isn't missing at all, but just eluded the finders who reported it 
missing.. Example:  I recently (about 3 weeks ago) found all for of 
Teamking's boxes in Kleb Woods (one of my favorite series..Possum was here, 
Armadillo was here, etc.)  3 of the 4 boxes had been listed as 
attempted about 2 weeks earlier, but I decided to try anyway, seeing it was a 
chilly day and I wanted to be outside.  I also found Baby Bear's "Speedy" 
box there, which I'm pretty sure had also been reported as missing.  If you 
haven't been to Kleb Woods I highly recommend these boxes.  I also rank 
Mother of Texas up there as one of my favorite boxes of all time...the cemetery 
has some really old headstones, and is a fascinating place to visit (like most 
of SE's boxes).  I am glad to hear the box is back in action, maybe it was 
on a little vacation with BB's Possum box that disappeared and then 
returned.  MO5</div></body></html>
