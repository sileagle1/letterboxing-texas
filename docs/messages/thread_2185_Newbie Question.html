<div> </div>
<div>Some folks have one family stamp and one logbook, others have individual stamps and one logbook, and still others have individual stamps and individual logbooks.  This is one of those things that is purely up to you!  However, here are some things to keep in mind:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) The more stamps you have to stamp, the longer it takes.</div>
<div>2) The more logbooks you have to pull out and stamp, the longer it takes.</div>
<div>3) If you have multiple personal stamps, you need to be mindful of logbook space and try to keep your personal stamps fairly small so as not to take up several logbook pages.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now if you don't mind taking a long time at a box, and your kids are going to be cool with hanging out and doing whatever sorts of things your kids do when they're hanging out in the woods (mine sword fights trees), #1 and #2 aren't really a factor for you.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>#3 becomes important especially as you get to know different boxers and know which ones lives where and whether replacing a logbook is an easy task for them or not, or if you see that the logbook is filling up.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When my family of four started out, we had one logbook and four stamps.  We box in all different configurations, although the most common is my ten year old son and me, so a family stamp wouldn't have been indicative of who logged in.  When my daughter started migrating away from home, I set her up her own logbook since she was likely to box without the rest of us.  My son is a pretty diligent boxer and he's made noises about having his own log, so that's probably what I'll give him for Christmas.  My husband, my LSS, is not very likely to ever box without me, so we will probably always share a log.  If I were starting over, I would do it this way again.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have fun and do it however strikes your fancy.  You can always change up later!</div>

<br>
Well said as always, Lucy!<br>
<br>
Space in my box's logbook is my personal concern.  I can't tell you <br>
how many times I've gone to perform maintenance on one of my few <br>
plants and found three pages of the logbook used by children. <br>
(Ahem...cookie caper series!) <br>
<br>
No offense to anyone here, but I always wonder what the parents are <br>
doing when each of the kids are stamping in on their own pages or <br>
are stamping multiple times in my one book!?!<br>
<br>
My advice is to use a family stamp...or to use very small personal <br>
stamps (1.5" or 1" square) and to SUPERVISE the children while they <br>
are stamping in.<br>
<br>
Personally, my family started off with one personal stamp and an <br>
individual logbook for each family member.  Well...the children <br>
started arguing over who gets to stamp the family stamp into the <br>
box's logbook.  At that point, we went to individual stamps....BUT <br>
(notice the big BUT)...we still never use more than ONE page of a <br>
logbook and most of the time, we use a half page for all THREE of <br>
our personal stamps.  I insist that my children stamp closely <br>
together and lots of times, we only stamp a part of our sig stamps <br>
so that they will not take up too much space in anyone's logbook.<br>
<br>
Everyone does get a turn to stamp the box's stamp into their OWN <br>
individual logbooks.<br>
<br>
Hope everybody realizes that I'm not singling anyone out on this <br>
list.  I've really only seen this happen with boxing families that <br>
I've never seen on ANY list!  (Figures, huh?)<br>
<br>
Just IMHO, Batty B  :-)<br>
