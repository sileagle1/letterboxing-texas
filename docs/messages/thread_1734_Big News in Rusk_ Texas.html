                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in Rusk again this morning setting out a box and<br>
I was an eyewitness to what may well be the biggest<br>
news in Rusk in quite a long time (aside from standard<br>
courthouse type stuff).  <br>
<br>
I had been out planting a box and I realized I was<br>
really hungry so I headed to the Family Dollar to pick<br>
up some trail snacks and a little water.  Don't ask my<br>
why Family Dollar - it's just sort of where I shop in<br>
Rusk.  As I approached, I noticed that there was quite<br>
a lot of traffic going on, especially for a Saturday<br>
morning in Rusk!  As I got nearer, I realized<br>
something big was going on, and suddenly, I knew I was<br>
not going to be able to stop at Family Dollar...<br>
<br>
For those of you who have ever lived in a small town,<br>
you know that nothing gets the locals going like a big<br>
fire.  Well the Family Dollar blazed away this morning<br>
- when I got there at 9:15, it was fully engulfed and<br>
the fire department was there and half the town was<br>
already present and the other half was rushing to the<br>
scene.  I wound up getting a front row seat in the<br>
parking lot of the Brookshire Bros, which thankfully<br>
also sells trail snacks and water.  It's been quite a<br>
long time since I've sat on the hood of my car and<br>
shamelessly watched a building go up in flames!<br>
<br>
So thankfully we're not going to Rusk next weekend to<br>
make news, because it'd be tough to top that fire!<br>

<div>I lived in a small town in New England for four years recently. When they put a stop sign at one of the intersections, they put a large photo of it on the front page of the newspaper with instructions how to use it. Honestly. I saved the clipping for a long time, and whenever I needed cheering up, I would pull it out and look at it - did the trick everytime! I LOVE small towns - I really do!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love small town life too - even though sometimes I<br>
miss San Diego and all there was to do there.  The<br>
beauty of small towns is what drives kids out of town<br>
- at least for awhile:  you can't do anything without<br>
everyone knowing it!  I just returned from a quick<br>
trip to Walmart and I ran into three folks I knew, two<br>
of whom knew SJZ was visiting this weekend, and she<br>
only got into town at 3 a.m. today!<br>
<br>
The fire this morning was such a throw back for me - I<br>
remember about 30 years ago when there was a huge fire<br>
in downtown Jacksonville when the major pharmacy<br>
caught fire and burned to the ground.  Those were<br>
pre-Walmart days and everything centered on downtown,<br>
so losing a building there affected everyone. <br>
Hundreds of people showed up to watch it burn and we<br>
all stayed downtown for hours - well after our<br>
bedtimes.  We were telling Lightning and SJZ not that<br>
long ago how the local radio station used to announce<br>
everything almost on a play-by-play basis.  Every time<br>
a siren went off, everyone would run to their radios<br>
to hear what was going on.  We lived by radio!  And<br>
would you believe - Rusk still has a radio station<br>
that is not that far off of what we grew up on in<br>
Jacksonville?  You listen to the daily trading post<br>
program and catch up on the gossip!<br>
