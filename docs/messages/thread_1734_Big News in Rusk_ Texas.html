                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was in Rusk again this morning setting out a box and<br/>
I was an eyewitness to what may well be the biggest<br/>
news in Rusk in quite a long time (aside from standard<br/>
courthouse type stuff).  <br/>
<br/>
I had been out planting a box and I realized I was<br/>
really hungry so I headed to the Family Dollar to pick<br/>
up some trail snacks and a little water.  Don't ask my<br/>
why Family Dollar - it's just sort of where I shop in<br/>
Rusk.  As I approached, I noticed that there was quite<br/>
a lot of traffic going on, especially for a Saturday<br/>
morning in Rusk!  As I got nearer, I realized<br/>
something big was going on, and suddenly, I knew I was<br/>
not going to be able to stop at Family Dollar...<br/>
<br/>
For those of you who have ever lived in a small town,<br/>
you know that nothing gets the locals going like a big<br/>
fire.  Well the Family Dollar blazed away this morning<br/>
- when I got there at 9:15, it was fully engulfed and<br/>
the fire department was there and half the town was<br/>
already present and the other half was rushing to the<br/>
scene.  I wound up getting a front row seat in the<br/>
parking lot of the Brookshire Bros, which thankfully<br/>
also sells trail snacks and water.  It's been quite a<br/>
long time since I've sat on the hood of my car and<br/>
shamelessly watched a building go up in flames!<br/>
<br/>
So thankfully we're not going to Rusk next weekend to<br/>
make news, because it'd be tough to top that fire!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I love small town life too - even though sometimes I<br/>
miss San Diego and all there was to do there.  The<br/>
beauty of small towns is what drives kids out of town<br/>
- at least for awhile:  you can't do anything without<br/>
everyone knowing it!  I just returned from a quick<br/>
trip to Walmart and I ran into three folks I knew, two<br/>
of whom knew SJZ was visiting this weekend, and she<br/>
only got into town at 3 a.m. today!<br/>
<br/>
The fire this morning was such a throw back for me - I<br/>
remember about 30 years ago when there was a huge fire<br/>
in downtown Jacksonville when the major pharmacy<br/>
caught fire and burned to the ground.  Those were<br/>
pre-Walmart days and everything centered on downtown,<br/>
so losing a building there affected everyone. <br/>
Hundreds of people showed up to watch it burn and we<br/>
all stayed downtown for hours - well after our<br/>
bedtimes.  We were telling Lightning and SJZ not that<br/>
long ago how the local radio station used to announce<br/>
everything almost on a play-by-play basis.  Every time<br/>
a siren went off, everyone would run to their radios<br/>
to hear what was going on.  We lived by radio!  And<br/>
would you believe - Rusk still has a radio station<br/>
that is not that far off of what we grew up on in<br/>
Jacksonville?  You listen to the daily trading post<br/>
program and catch up on the gossip!<br/>
