Artists make small pieces of art (usually flat) about the size of a <br>
playing card. They are usually traded with other ATC'ers. On the back, <br>
there is usually a little bit of info about the artist. <br>
<br>
Common themes are collages, pen drawings, stamps (that's what are LB <br>
info'er does) and a lot of other things. It's endless what you can do. <br>
<br>
Maybe my husband will post a link up to his stuff.<br>
Anyway, it's pretty cool. I WOULD do it but I'm not that great at that <br>
type of art.<br>
<br>
Good question though!<br>

<br>
Yes, ATCs are like art on a trading card.  They're small works of art,<br>
either originals or reproductions, and the format is usually very<br>
small... 3" x 5" or smaller, with most being 2.5" x 3.5" like baseball<br>
cards, Magic cards, and so on.<br>
<br>
I finally fixed my FTP problem and updated my webpage:<br>
http://www.aisling.net/gallery/gallery-cards.htm<br>
<br>
All eight (so far) of my May 2005 ATCs can be printed, full size, from<br>
links on that page, too.  Most of them are 3" x 5" when you print them<br>
(at 150 dpi) because I'm used to swapping that size at RedDog Scot's<br>
swaps.  However, you can adjust the scale so that they'll fit on a<br>
smaller format card as well.<br>
<br>
If I find a LB that's also a geocaching box (with treats in it), I<br>
often leave a few ATCs as small gifts.<br>
<br>
Cheerfully,<br>
Ais<br>
