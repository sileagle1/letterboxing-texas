                    <html><body><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;">I recently
returned from a four day letterboxing trip to North TX where I went to some
parks I have never been to before and some that brought back fond
memories.<span style="">  </span>My first stop was Fairfield
Lake SP, site of the recent Event hosted by Open Space.<span style="">  </span>There are a lot of great boxes there and I
added one for future visitors.<span style="">  </span>Hopefully
they will last longer than my first box placed there in 2004, which was
confiscated by the rangers.<span style="">  </span>In December of
that year, Baby Bear and I visited this park during our second “TX letterbox
seeding” trip and each placed a box.<span style=""> 
</span>However, unlike our first trip where we only placed boxes hoping others
would get hooked, there was a box to be found, too. <span style=""> </span>Earlier that year someone named Barefoot Lucy,
who eventually became a staunch letterboxer in East TX, <span style=""> </span>had placed her first box in that park and was
waiting rather impatiently for somebody to find it, so that was the main reason
for going to that park.<span style="">  </span>When we found
the box we were surprised to see somebody named Gryzzled Gryphon had already
beat us to it.<span style="">  </span>Now back then there was
no “contact the placer” or status indicator on clues, so the only way to know if somebody found your box was if they
emailed you, which we planned to do when we got home.<span style="">  </span>Of course GG never emailed anyone, which is
why he remained an enigma for so long.<span style=""> 
</span>So when I got home I was surprised to see I had an email from Barefoot
Lucy before I had a chance to even tell her she had 3 finders of her box.<span style="">  </span>It turns out she happened to visit the park
the same day to check on her box and saw that we had just stamped in, so she
made her LSS drive all through the park looking for us!<span style="">  </span>She was so excited that she added a sweet
note at the top of her clues that you can read on her archived box called Oh
Deer:<span style="">  </span><a href="http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=8335" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=8335</a><br/></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><br/><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;"></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;">Next I found
a few boxes in cemeteries on my way to Purtis Creek SP, a park I had never been
to and did not have any boxes until now.<span style=""> 
</span>Then it was on to Lake Tawakoni SP to place another box and find a treasured
Governor box by Boots Tex, which was the main reason I went here.<span style="">  </span>I was not disappointed.<span style="">  </span>The next day I found and placed a few boxes
on my way toward Dallas, including one for Stevie Ray Vaughan where he is
buried.<span style="">  </span>Way back in 2003 I had placed a
box dedicated to him near his statue in Austin, but since it eventually went
missing I was very happy to be able to place another one here.<span style="">  </span>Then it was on to Cedar Ridge Preserve to
find some old boxes from longtime letterboxing sisters Puddle Splasher and
Viewfinder.<span style="">  </span>I was very happy to find
both boxes, one from 2006 and the other from 2008, and I left one for them to find
just like in the old days.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;">I ended the
day at Cedar Hill SP where I planned to find several boxes placed there but was
disappointed to find out most of the trails where the boxes are located were
closed due to flooding back in 2015, so I was only able to find 1 box: Life Is
Good Near Dallas by Mosaic Butterfly.<span style="">  </span>I
did find some trails that were open so I placed a box hoping others will
repopulate this nice park.<span style="">  </span>I had not
been here since placing one of my first Dallas boxes, Texas Star, back in 2003,
and I did not recognize it.<span style="">  </span>That trip
was memorable for me because I tried to find the first letterboxes placed in
TX: <span style=""> </span>the Duck Creek boxes placed in
1998.<span style="">  </span>Unfortunately they were already
missing.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;"><br/></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;">The last day
I boxed in several places as I made my way home and finally made it to Berry
Springs Park in Georgetown.<span style="">  </span>Once again
the main draw was boxes by Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter and I found
both.<span style="">  </span>I am embarrassed to admit that I
have had these boxes on my radar since they were placed way back in 2006 and
only now got them.<span style="">  </span>Oh well, better late
than never.<span style="">  </span>I was impressed with the
Georgetown area and have plans to place more boxes there in the near future. <span style=""> </span>Finally, I placed a couple more in Austin, one
of them in a new (for me) place called Balcones Canyonlands Preserve which I
think connects with St. Edwards Park.</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;"><br/></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;">Though it wasn’t as
much fun as my old trips with Baby Bear, it was still great.<span style="">  </span>Thanks to everyone who placed boxes that
tempted me into doing it!</span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;line-height:115%;"><br/></span></p>
