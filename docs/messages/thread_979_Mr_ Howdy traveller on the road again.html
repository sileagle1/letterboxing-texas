will be making a return trip to Brazos Bend for the holiday weekend.  <br/>
We hope to get the remainder of the stamps that we couldn't find during <br/>
the "event".  If you haven't stamped him yet, come and say Hi.  He will <br/>
be alongside our Starcraft camper (we got rid of the pop-up) waiting <br/>
for you with his stamp in his backpack!  Drop by and visit.<br/>
Regards to all.<br/>
Wes and Grace<br/>
