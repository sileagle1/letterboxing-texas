                    <html><body><div>Today I discovered that the trail at Rockledge Park on Lake Grapevine has recently been altered in that a new, presumptively replacement, trail has been built running roughly parallel to the right of the original trail. This means that unless you ignore the signage directing you to the new trail and take the original one (assuming that you know where the old one is), the clues to "Whooping Crane", "The Lost Moose", "White Sails", "Merlin the Mooterious", and "Three Blind Moose" will be of limited value. I have advised the owners of these boxes of the situation and suggest that anyone wishing to visit these should first contact the owner(s) before venturing forth. Unfortunately, there is no need to contact the owner of "Give Meese a Chance" as that box appears to have been a casualty of the recent heavy rains in the Metroplex. It is likely that a new, and possibly improved, box will be planted within the next month or so to serve as a
 replacement.                                                                       Best regards,           Gryzzled Gryphon of Coryell County</div><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?

                    <html><body><p>Thanks for the info GG. I have yet to make it back out there to find the other boxes at Rockledge after our meet on the other side. I was looking forward to finding the Give Meese A Chance box. Hope it can be replaced. I already had some of the others but my little one, PomPom Bear, wasn't along for that trip. So, I thought I would take her back out there so she could find those too. The update is helpful so I will know what to look out for. BTW, any new info on the Texas Tour Bus yet?<br/><br/><b><i>Nick Bottom &lt;gryzzgryph@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:  </p><blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>
