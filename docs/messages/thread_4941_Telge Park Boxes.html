                    <div class="plaintext-content">They just opened that new part about a week ago, so good timing.  The main park is going through some changes.  About half the trees are dead, and now they are starting to fall down, so some boxes may be a little harder to find.  I could see from road (Telge) that they were cutting trees 2 weeks ago, so not sure how far back they are going or have gone.   Anyway, if you have never been to this park you will not belive how big it is (and now even bigger), and remember it has the 2nd most boxes in it of any park in Texas. <br>
<br>
PS - Just back from Lake Tahoe, glad we got snow there last Sunday which made the skiing great.  3 new boxes to be posted for NV and CA!!!<br>
