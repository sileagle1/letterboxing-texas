<p>That really doesnt make much sense including Texas in the Southwest.  I mean, you look at Mike way out in El Paso, and the game is completely different for him than it is for those of us in the eastern part of the state.<span> </span></p>

<p>Does anyone know more about what states are included in that region?<span> </span>I wouldnt want to put it on Silver Eagle to feel responsible for reporting on and assisting areas outside what he knows(unless he wanted to, of course).</p>

<p>I must admit I don't look on AQ that much, so when I saw this post I figured I better see what I might be volunteering for. From what I can tell, he wants someone from each Region as defined by AQ, which does not include TX as its own Region. It looks like someone would have to represent the entire Southwest Region, so not sure I would be best for that. He does say that At Large Regional Voices can volunteer for other countries, and since TX was once a country I guess I could volunteer for that position and let someone else do the Southwest Region. What do you think?<br/>
<br/>I appreciate your kindly support of me for this position, and I would be honored to do it if none of you GOOD writers wants to :)<br/><br/>Silver Eagle

&gt; If Silver Eagle has a mind to do it, I really suggest we get behind him as our regional representative. For years he has kept interesting facts and figures about boxing in Texas.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My .02...<br/>&gt; <br/>
