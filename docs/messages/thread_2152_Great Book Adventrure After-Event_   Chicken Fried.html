                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone for their suggestions for a pre- or post- event<br/>
party for the Great Book Adventure.  Since so many of you are coming<br/>
from out of town and are pressed for time on Friday, we have opted for<br/>
a Saturday night dinner.  Goodson's is a Tomball institution<br/>
particularly known for its chicken fried steak, chicken fried chicken<br/>
and its country vegetables.  After a day of hard boxing, you've earned<br/>
a treat!<br/>
<br/>
This event should give everyone the opportunity to socialize, tell war<br/>
stories and exchange with other boxers that you may have missed at the<br/>
 gathering itself.  We're going to have more than 50 boxes to find<br/>
during the gathering (number is rapidly increasing!).  There will be<br/>
some boxes that will be available Saturday only and some that will be<br/>
available just that weekend.  You will be able to box as much or as<br/>
little as you like during the actual event and socialize as much as<br/>
you like as well.  <br/>
<br/>
We're still working on the day's structure.  If TeamKing and I could<br/>
just get over our respective pneumonia and bronchitis, we might be<br/>
able to get out there and do a site plan!  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, it would really help us if you would rsvp if you plan to come<br/>
to chicken-fried chatter.  Goodson's doesn't take reservations, but<br/>
they'll save us a space (we're very unclear on the difference) if we<br/>
tell them how many are coming.<br/>

Thanks to Mother of Five for helping coordinate the after-party!<br/>
