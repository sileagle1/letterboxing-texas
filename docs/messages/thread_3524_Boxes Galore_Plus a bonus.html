<div> </div>
<div>As the "other" letterboxer who will be at that event, don't worry about logging on my account.  I log my finds online because I know other folks like to be able to look online for who has found their boxes, but as far as my own records go, I keep my counts manually in my logbook.   My F counts on both LBNA and AQ are wayyyy off.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As far as not being able to count it later as a find, you are right - both the clues AND the stamp have to be different or it can't be counted as a find but once.  But again, don't worry about that on my account.  But that does make me think - that's the same situation as it was last year for all those boxes y'all found at DNL - I planted them temporarily at camp and then have been replanting them in the wild since then.  I think another option would be to plant them with an original date of DNL 07, then note in the clues that they were replanted in the wild after that date, so that anyone (y'all) who found those boxes at the event can log that date and by reading the clues you could tell that anyone who found them after that date found them in the newer location.  The same solution would work for your boxes, if you choose to move them.  Just a thought...</div>
