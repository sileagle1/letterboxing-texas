<p>I agree with you, BL.  I think the Texas Tour Bus 2 should be retired.  The last time I saw the box was over a year ago and I thought it was too full then.  Your idea about making it an event box makes a lot of sense to me.  That way, everyone will be able to see it and "stamp in" if they like.  I don't know about adding additional stamps at this point, even if you got a bigger box. That would only make it more difficult to haul around to the events.  I say we do it.  That will leave only the Texas Traveling Circus out there, and I have to say again that it's worth finding and I'd like to see it moving along a little faster so more people can appreciate it.  <br/>

&gt; Well - I have the Texas Tour Bus 2.  I tried to stir up some interest when<br/>
&gt; we took it with us camping in Pittsburg over Thanksgiving, but aside from<br/>
&gt; one boxer who thought she had the location figured out (apparently there is<br/>
&gt; also somewhere around Lockhart famous for sausage and chicken-I'm still<br/>
&gt; really sorry I sent you on a wild goose chase), we didn't see much<br/>
&gt; interest.  I was really bummed too, because it was hidden practically in our<br/>
&gt; camp, so when someone found it we were gonna have an impromptu gathering<br/>
&gt; with some great food on the grill and a dutch oven cobbler.  In the earlier<br/>
&gt; days of the Tour Bus, that gathering could have potentially involved 20<br/>
&gt; people, all vying for the bus! Anyway, I felt very uncomfortable about<br/>
&gt; leaving it in a state park, so we brought it home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I plan to take it to the gathering and steal a table for it to be set up on,<br/>
&gt; so that folks can stamp it if they so decide.  I realize that isn't<br/>
&gt; necessarily in keeping with the intent of the box, but I'd be willing to<br/>
&gt; hide it at the end of the day and post it to the group for anyone who wants<br/>
&gt; to to find it.  However...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think we need to retire it for a couple of reasons.  First of all, it is<br/>
&gt; chock full and about to explode.  Since it is so full, no one can contribute<br/>
&gt; to it, and that is really part of the fun of these traveling boxes.<br/>
&gt; Secondly, if we retire it, perhaps the Circus will get more play.  Thirdly,<br/>
&gt; it is now a letterboxing treasure - something that would be a true loss to<br/>
&gt; our circle if anything happened to it, like as in the first Tour Bus.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I suggest that if we retire it, it be moved to a slightly larger container<br/>
&gt; and become an event box.  With the extra room, folks could contribute to it<br/>
&gt; as they see fit.  I think we could also consider mailing it around to folks<br/>
&gt; who are too far off the beaten trail to have seen it.  Make no mistake - I<br/>
&gt; am NOT recommending turning it into a postal box.  I'm recommending that we<br/>
&gt; consider the few folks that live in areas where it has never been, and who<br/>
&gt; would really have to make a big stretch to ever go to a gathering where it<br/>
&gt; might be, and give them an opportunity to have it for a bit..FYI, it weighs<br/>
&gt; in at 10 pounds now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So - if anyone has thoughts or opinions about what I've said about TTB2,<br/>
&gt; speak up!<br/>

<br/>The whole Lockhart thing was actually really funny - I spent all of Thanksgiving weekend trying to convince one relative or another to make the 3 hour round trip with me, and none of them would. The whole town boasts that they have the best barbecue in Texas, with three different Q restaurants making top ten in TX lists. I finally convinced my hubby that if he would just take a different route home so we could stop there, then he wouldn't have to stop at the 8 boxes that are on our normal route that he
 had promised to let me find on that trip. We had a fun time trying to sneak onto the golf course (which, in hindsight, hubby was right, the box would have <span>never</span> been on a golf course!) and getting in trouble with park rangers, who bought the story that I was just wanting to check out the course for my uncle, an avid golfer. Now, whenever I ask family to go boxing with me, they always ask if they're going to end up on a golf course in Lockhart. Good times, good times. :-)<br/>
