<div>I will definitely get some of my boxes hidden before you come this way so you'll have plenty of choices! Will you be here for our planned exchange at La Madelines in Grapevine?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My plan now is to make the rounds and check on which of my boxes may need replacing, retiring or repairing after the latest floods. There are only a few that I suspect have washed away (perhaps Waxahachie and Irving/Campion Trail), but with Lake Grapevine now over SEVENTEEN feet above flood level, those definitely need to be checked on too. Since I've found all the ones hidden there, I may just plan to spend a day  hiking out there, checking on all of them so I can let the owners know about their condition (in case they are from out of the area). It will probably be another week or so before I actually do that however, because rain is still in the forecast for the next seven days and the forecasters are saying there is nothing in the atmosphere that indicates there will be any changes in the rain pattern for the next two weeks. Very interesting.</div>

<br/>
My "Dr. Barr's Table" letterbox in Lakeway I know for a fact is 25 <br/>
feet under water right now.  However, I had expected it to be 25 feet <br/>
under water every now and then, so it is chained down and hopefully <br/>
watertight.  A geocacher in the area is going to check on it for me <br/>
when the level of Lake Travis gets back down around 670 or so.<br/>
<br/>
He got really lucky with his nearby geocache.  I had warned him that <br/>
it gets deep here, but I guess he decided not to do anything about <br/>
it.  When he heard the lake level was rising (the level in Lake <br/>
Travis has been known to rise 20 feet in 12 hours, amazing for a lake <br/>
that's that big) he dashed out there and found he couldn't get <br/>
anywhere near it, the GZ was already under many feet of water.  Then <br/>
he spotted his ammo can floating near shore and managed to retrieve <br/>
it.  Being an ammo can, it was watertight and everything inside was <br/>
dry.<br/>
<br/>
Last time I was out there, last September, it was so dry that the <br/>
nearby arm of Lake Travis was nothing but a rivulet among the dried <br/>
mud.  All the floating boat docks were sitting on the rocks.<br/>

<div>Unless your planning on doing a little scuba diving, I know you won't find mine.  It is almost definitely gone because it was planted what I thought was a safe distance from the water.
