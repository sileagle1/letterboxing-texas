<br>
My "Dr. Barr's Table" letterbox in Lakeway I know for a fact is 25 <br>
feet under water right now.  However, I had expected it to be 25 feet <br>
under water every now and then, so it is chained down and hopefully <br>
watertight.  A geocacher in the area is going to check on it for me <br>
when the level of Lake Travis gets back down around 670 or so.<br>
<br>
He got really lucky with his nearby geocache.  I had warned him that <br>
it gets deep here, but I guess he decided not to do anything about <br>
it.  When he heard the lake level was rising (the level in Lake <br>
Travis has been known to rise 20 feet in 12 hours, amazing for a lake <br>
that's that big) he dashed out there and found he couldn't get <br>
anywhere near it, the GZ was already under many feet of water.  Then <br>
he spotted his ammo can floating near shore and managed to retrieve <br>
it.  Being an ammo can, it was watertight and everything inside was <br>
dry.<br>
<br>
Last time I was out there, last September, it was so dry that the <br>
nearby arm of Lake Travis was nothing but a rivulet among the dried <br>
mud.  All the floating boat docks were sitting on the rocks.<br>
