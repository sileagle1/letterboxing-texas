of us like to go boxing with our 4-legged companions, whether for company, 
safety, or exercise.  I ran across an article recently about heat 
exhaustion and heat stroke in dogs and wanted to share the 
information with you all.  </font></span></div>

<div><span class="671102718-13072008"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">Heat 
illness is not uncommon, since dogs do not have an efficient method of handling 
heat stress; they don't sweat, and they never seem to figure out that they 
shouldn't get too excited or work hard in the heat either.  Heat stroke is 
most common in large breeds, and in dogs with short noses.  You know how 
quickly the heat can sneak up on you, but it can happen even faster for your 
dog.</font></span></div>

hyperventilation, increased salivation followed by dry gums, weakness, confusion 
or inattention, vomiting or diarrhea.  As the condition progresses 
toward heat stroke, symptoms include weakness, loss of balance, excessive 
panting, roaring breathing sounds, decrease in mental awareness, pale or 
gray gums, shallow breathing, slowed or absent breathing, vomiting and 
diarrhea that may be bloody, collapse, seizures or coma. Death from heat 
stroke can occur pretty quickly.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="671102718-13072008"><font color="#0000ff" face="Arial" size="2">If the 
dog begins showing signs of distress from the heat, it is best to cool him/her 
immediately with cool (not really cold) water (as in pour it over the 
dog).  Ice packs can be applied to the "armpits" or neck for heat 
exhaustion, but may be too intense for heat stroke.  Blowing air over the 
dog with a fan as you cool him off with water can also be helpful.  Most 
dogs will not drink water during heat stroke, so offer it but don't waste 
time trying to talk him into drinking. As soon as the dog seems more 
comfortable, get to a veterinarian, since delayed complications can occur 
and the dog needs to be monitored closely.</font></span></div>
