Just a few notes - as I see it.....<br>
<br>
Geocaching promotes a program called<br>
<br>
CACHE IN - TRASH OUT.  <br>
<br>
Or CITO.<br>
<br>
Like any group of people - some are fanatical about it, some practice it in<br>
moderation, and some ignore it.  But the program is somewhat visible, and<br>
many parks know about it.  It seems to help get caches approved - knowing<br>
that the cache owner and visitors practice CITO.<br>
<br>
Here is something else for you-all to consider.<br>
<br>
http://www.petcarecentral.com/kj-00580.html<br>
<br>
This little item comes in several colors.  If you fold carefully and pack it<br>
tight, it will hold more than 30 Wal-Mart shopping bags.  It is made to<br>
strap to your dog leash for scooping after your dog.  I have one of these<br>
little carriers strapped to each of my packs.  So whenever I am out, I have<br>
a ready supply of trash bags at hand.<br>
<br>
I don't like blue Wal-Mart bags, so I found a store using tan bags and I<br>
begged them for some.  When the manager heard what I wanted them for, he<br>
donated a box of 1000 bags.  <br>
<br>
The rangers really appreciate seeing me come in from a hike hauling a bag of<br>
trash.  Every now and then I find a big pile of trash - too much to haul.  I<br>
bag it all, then mark the coordinates and send the rangers out to pick it<br>
up.  They appreciate the effort.<br>

******I think that's one of the beauties AND pitfalls<br>
of geocaching - it's organized enough to have a high<br>
visibility program like CITO.  On the other hand, I<br>
have to wonder whether the degree of organization<br>
geocaching practices has generated the attention that<br>
has created more regulation, or has the organization<br>
been borne of the regulation?  <br>
<br>
I have a sense that we aren't far from getting some<br>
unwanted exposure.  I hope I'm wrong, because I enjoy<br>
participating responsibly in a hobby that doesn't have<br>
a lot of red tape.  I don't think it would be a bad<br>
thing for us to be seen carrying out bags of trash for<br>
the eventual moment when "they" realize what we're<br>
doing and start asking questions - then they'll know<br>
us to be eco-friendly already.<br>
