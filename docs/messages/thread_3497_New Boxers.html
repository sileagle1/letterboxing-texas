                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to let you guys know that I am successful in recruiting<br>
a few people into boxing - two here in the state, both of which are in<br>
the DFW area.<br>
<br>
Go Me!!<br>
<br>
I documented a day in my life in photographs in which I went boxing<br>
and posted it onto a livejournal community and a LOT of people were<br>
intrigued and several even started boxing the next day!<br>
<br>
One of my new friends is going to be boxing with me on the 26th. Not<br>
entirely sure where exactly we'll go. Likely only to Arbor Hills as it<br>
seems pretty easy - I don't want to scare her with the Moose series at<br>
Grapevine since it's quite the hike! <br>
<br>
If anyone would like to uh, bump into us out there... ;)<br>
<br>
The other little lady is pretty much setting herself up on her own. <br>
<br>
I hope they both make it to this list. <br>
<br>
See you guys around!<br>

I was going to pick up the "Good Luck" and "Hoppin Down the Bunny Trail" boxes, but if you'd like, I can leave them until after your adventure with your new boxing friend on the 26th. Just let me know. I will go ahead the plant the new ones though. </font></div>
