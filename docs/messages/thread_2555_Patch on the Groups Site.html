The BusyBeesFamily is planning on attending the gathering in March and I can bring them with us...or if you need them sooner, you can mail me a check or PayPal me and I can mail them to you. <br>

Let me get back to everyone about the price first, though.  <br>

PS I'd like to do the maroon bluebonnet that was developed at Texas A&M, if no one has any objections. Silver Eagle's Bluebonnet box is very special to us since that is the first box we found and I'd like to pay a little tribute to him.<br>
