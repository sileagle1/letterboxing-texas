<div>Reminds me of a time when SJZ was refereeing a little girls' soccer game and a player fell into a pile of fire ants (a few years ago, ants were so bad here that we could clear a field before a game and mounds would pop up during the game!).  SJZ was the closest person to her and she yanked the girl up off the ground and started slapping at the ants.  One of the things they drill into you in referee classes is "don't touch the players".  The reasoning being that any action can be misconstrued, especially by mamas and daddies and especially in the middle of a game when everyone is under a little stress.  I was well away from the action and was pretty shocked to see my kid yank a 6 year old up by the arm and start whacking on her, but you should've seen the coaches' jaws drop watching the referee smacking the kid and the parents were all a little freaked to say the least.  Finally the little girl's coach heard SJZ hollering "COACH" the whole time, calling him onto the field.  SJZ went from being a "referee gone postal" to a "hero of the day" in a couple short minutes, thank goodness.  Even despite SJZ's quick action, the little girl got quite a few bites and ultimately wound up going to the hospital for a mild allergic reaction.
