I have been toying with an idea to keep some hidden until my demise, <br>
just haven't worked out how I can post the clues from "the other <br>
side".  It would be great if I could come back as a letterboxing <br>
angel, kind of like Clarence in It's A Wonderful Life.  Every time <br>
you hear a bell a new box is planted!  Of course this makes the huge <br>
assumption I end up north instead of south :)<br>
<br>
As to placing a blueberry letterbox, I thought about it for several <br>
years but there is no public place near there.  I was going to ask <br>
the owners if I could leave one with them, but they are always so <br>
busy during picking season I did not think they would want to be <br>
bothered.  Plus the box would only be available for a few months.  <br>
Still, I might do it anyway.<br>
<br>
BTW, I cracked up at the vision of everyone following me around like <br>
the Sprint commercial and ducking behind trees whenever I turned <br>
around.  Then I laughed even harder when I replaced me with Gryzzled <br>
Gryphon!  Can you just see him trying to be his usual quiet, stealthy <br>
self with all of us stampeding behind him?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks a bunch for those boxes, WE really wouldn't have much to hunt <br>
without your planting prowess. I don't know if you guys are aware (or <br>
care) but there are coverage area maps available on the websites of <br>
these wireless companies and on Verizons site (they're the ones with <br>
the commercials y'all have been joking about) there is a huge area <br>
out where I live with no coverage BUT there 3 listed Silver Eagle <br>
boxes in that area... so, Silver Eagle has BETTER coverage than "The <br>
Network".<br>
<br>
<br>
Where I live, Brewster County (6,193 sqare miles) and the 4 adjacent <br>
counties to Brewster County:<br>
Pecos County (4,765 sqare miles)<br>
Jeff Davis County (2,265 sqare miles)<br>
Presidio County (3,856 sqare miles)<br>
Terrell County (2,358 sqare miles) <br>
<br>
have a combined land area of 19,437 sqare miles.<br>
<br>
Slightly larger than the size of the combined area of Vermont (9,620 <br>
square miles) and New Hampshire (9,359 square miles) combined (18,979 <br>
sqare miles).[all land mass info from Wikipedia).<br>
<br>
Within this area of West Texas there are (using both LBNA and AQ as <br>
sources) a total of 11 letterboxes for me to hunt (there are also 2 <br>
of my own, bringing the grand total to 13). 3 of these boxes are <br>
Silver Eagles, so he's provided 27.3% of my local hunting <br>
opportunities. So, thanks again. (to be fair, El Lobo has 3 boxes in <br>
the same space I mentioned).<br>

<div>You do realize, don't you, that most counties in Vermont and New Hampshire 
have more letterboxes than all of the area you described has in total?  But 
there are more letterboxers there, too.  If you plant them, eventually . . 
. they will come.  Sometime.  I have a couple of letterboxes planted 
in far away places that have only been visited once, to my knowledge.  
Sometimes you just put one in a place because you want to plant one there, and 
know that if it survives long enough, someone else will want to find it there, 
too.  </div>
<div>    When I first discovered letterboxing (in New 
England), I was surprised to discover on my return to Texas that there were 
actually about 8-10 letterboxes scattered around the DFW area, and I immediately 
set out to find them all.  Didn't take long, either, and each was a real 
jewel, an interesting location, an original and thoughtfully-executed stamp, 
good clues or puzzles that were fun and a little bit challenging, and just a 
total great experience.   There were only about two local 
letterboxers, too, who were reponsible for all those boxes and who kept planting 
new ones, and then I added mine to the local mix, and there were others who 
appeared, and now we have quite a few DFW metroboxers and dozens and dozens of 
boxes - more than I can keep up with!  And visitors to the area find them 
and sometimes plant more, so it's really a sport/game/activity that feeds 
itself, once you plant a few good ones . . . and they will come!</div>

  I hear you though. I plan to put a dozen or so boxes out this way <br>

too, but she works 2 jobs, and has a super crappy computer, so she's <br>
too busy to craft the boxes she'd like, and doesn't have the patience <br>
for all the internet stuff (clues, logging, updates, message boards <br>
and such, so I do that stuff (when I should be studying:) In fact she <br>
planted a box in Roswell last month, but she's been too busy to write <br>
up the clues, and post the plant (I'd offer to help but it's her <br>
first plant, and I know she wants to do all that herself. <br>
