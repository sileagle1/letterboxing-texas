You are so right.  It was excellent today.  I just love living in <br/>
Texas.  So many people are still getting snow.  What a bummer.  <br/>
Anyway it was truly an awesome day and was very rewarding as far as <br/>
letterbox finds go.  My 3 year old son, calls this stamping, and just <br/>
loves to find the letterboxes.  I usually locate the box while he is <br/>
exploring everything that 3 yr olds do and then I will say come look <br/>
over here, pick that rock up or something like that.  He really <br/>
thinks this is cool and invites everyone we see to go stamping with <br/>
us.  This is such a wonderful hobby for children.  I got a great <br/>
workout walking the 6 mile trail and he found a great treasure.<br/>
