                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was thinking recently about some of the good boxes I've found over <br>
the years, and the question came up, how far out of the way would you <br>
travel to find a good box or a box hidden by someone who has a <br>
reputation of hiding good boxes. I was recommending a couple of boxes <br>
by Boots Tx and LSQ to a friend, and it occurred to me, that I would <br>
drive a good distance to find their boxes. Their boxes always seem to <br>
be interesting and often relevent to where they've been placed. I love <br>
the fact that the box they hid in Farmersville, TX, was in the church <br>
cemetery where his grandfather is buried. In fact, his grandfather was <br>
the founder of that little church and the story is interesting and <br>
historical. The day I found it, the wildflowers along the county roads <br>
driving to the church were amazing, and when I went back a couple of <br>
months later with Viewfinder, the huge pecan trees in the cemetery were <br>
laden with pecans. I made a pecan tort for our family Christmas <br>
gathering with the pecans I picked that day while Viewfinder was <br>
stamping. What could be better? A beautiful spot, two great letterboxes <br>
and stamps, a little history of the area and pecans!<br>
<br>
So my question, how far out of the way would you travel (or have you <br>
traveled) for a good box?<br>

<div> </div>
<div>Because of time constraints, I rarely get to venture far out of my home turf, so I guess I just can't quite fathom how far I would go.  But let's just say I am traveling to somewhere and there were two boxes along the way - one is right on the highway and the other one is, say, 15 or 20 miles off the highway by someone reputed to place outstanding boxes - lovely carvings, well-constructed boxes, known for their great hiding places, good clue-writing, and an experience to be had along the way.  My timeframe is such that I can get the close one and be 30 minutes early to my destination or go for the far one and be 30 minutes late, I'd very likely go for the far one and hope I could make up a little of the time on the road so I would only be 15 minutes late...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I probably wouldn't be the type who would go from Houston to Dallas via Austin though or leave the city to go out to, say, East Texas to grab a box that rightfully was someone else's to find first.</div>

Question!<br/></font><br/></div><div class="Ih2E3d">
<div></div>
<div>
<p>I was thinking recently about some of the good boxes I've found over <br/>the 
years, and the question came up, how far out of the way would you <br/>travel to 
find a good box or a box hidden by someone who has a <br/>reputation of hiding 
good boxes. I was recommending a couple of boxes <br/>by Boots Tx and LSQ to a 
friend, and it occurred to me, that I would <br/>drive a good distance to find 
their boxes. Their boxes always seem to <br/>be interesting and often relevent to 
where they've been placed. I love <br/>the fact that the box they hid in 
Farmersville, TX, was in the church <br/>cemetery where his grandfather is 
buried. In fact, his grandfather was <br/>the founder of that little church and 
the story is interesting and <br/>historical. The day I found it, the wildflowers 
along the county roads <br/>driving to the church were amazing, and when I went 
back a couple of <br/>months later with Viewfinder, the huge pecan trees in the 
cemetery were <br/>laden with pecans. I made a pecan tort for our family 
Christmas <br/>gathering with the pecans I picked that day while Viewfinder was 
<br/>stamping. What could be better? A beautiful spot, two great letterboxes 
<br/>and stamps, a little history of the area and pecans!<br/><br/>So my question, 
how far out of the way would you travel (or have you <br/>traveled) for a good 
box?<br/><br/></p></div>
