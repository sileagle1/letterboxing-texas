                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm a real fan of Lock n Lock boxes (although I'm not the president of their fan club). I use them for all my LBs, but I do use good zip locks inside. I realize that it can be difficult to make sure the bags are tucked back inside and are not sticking out and breaking the seal on the actual box, but if you take the time to do this properly, those boxes and bags are wonderful. My Artist Series 2 boxes were actually UNDER water for a couple of months during the 2007 flood. I have a habit of putting a fairly substantial rock on top of my boxes whenever possible to keep them safe from critters, floods, wind... whatever. After the flood subsided and the trail was reopened where this series was, the boxes were found just where they had been hidden, anchored by their rocks, but covered with mud!Only one box had leaked and had water inside, but due to the last finder before the flood having taken the time to reseal the baggies, the logbook and stamp were in perfect condition! I just had to clean a little mud off the boxes and they were good to go (or hopefully... stay). I generally like the sandwich size box and have found them at Target.<br>

 <br>
It is a matter of coincidence that I have been investigating this phenomenon. Although the scientific studies show that the Lock 'n Lock brand food storage containers are far superior to the other brands, moisture does permeate in some boxes. In my travels I have seen Lock 'n Lock's that are floating in water with perfectly dry contents. I have seen others on dry land with an inch or more of water in the container. I have also seen logbooks saved more than once in Lock 'n Locks that are enclosed in heavier baggies, such as the ziploc brand. <br>
 <br>
The only logical conclusion is that some Lock 'n Locks are defective. I would also say that some letterboxers may be defective if they can not tuck the ziploc's inside the container. <br>
 <br>
Sincerely, <br>
 <br>
Investigator Francis Bacon<br>

One of the Murder at the Arboretum boxes a while back was full of water (it was a Lock 'n Lock box and all the tabs were locked), but because the bags were sealed, all the contents were dry.  I have no idea how the water got in (it is a mystery box), but I was glad the bags were there.  Maybe Investigator Bacon should investigate this.<br>

You could be right, I'm not saying you aren't. However, if water is in the picture, I would aim more for that Puddle Splasher. <br>

Unfortunately the pig industry is getting a bum rap. Not one pig in the world has been confirmed with what is dubbed as "swine flu". <br>
 <br>
Spectrophobia, on the other hand, is of growing concern due to the malignant nature of the object of the phobia.<br>
 <br>
I'm not accusing anyone in particular, just stating the facts. <br>
