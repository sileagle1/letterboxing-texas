Well, there isn't a red underline so I must have.<br/><br/>The other night at work, I was super bored, so I was reading about LTC's and somehow ran into posting etiquette. I red the drill sargent's version. It was pretty funny. <br/><br/>But, I realize now that I break almost every rule there is, besides cross posting. I probably don't break that one, due to the fact that I'm a lazy poster. <br/><br/>The problem I have most is editing. I don't know how to quote a line or two. I can do it on AQ, but I can't figure out how to do it on Yahoo. I use the single post method. If someone writes a post, I get it one by one. Is that my problem? <br/><br/>I know that you posted recently on how to quote, and I try it, but it wants to highlight the whole email. What am I doing wrong.<br/><br/>Also, I'll try to limit my posts to a few a day. That's going to be hard though. Especially on a slow night at work.<br/><br/>Also, I'll try not to be funny, that always gets me
 into trouble. People tend to take my sense of humor seriously. And, I never want to hurt someone's feelings or cause them to run away thinking we are mean. <br/><br/>If y'all have any suggestions, please feel free to send them my way.

Hey, Janet,<br/>
I'm trying it now to see what happens. I clicked o reply, set cursor <br/>
at top and hit enter a few times to give space between my new area to <br/>
write and the previous msg. Then I highlighted whatever I wanted gone <br/>
and hit delete. Seemed to work okay.<br/>
So where is this etiquette article? I've got a little time before the <br/>
Closing Ceremony begins. And then maybe, with the Olympics over, I <br/>
can get back to carving...<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Well - let's just talk a bit about etiquette - I think it's a good idea we do, and not just posting etiquette but internet community etiquette as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>First of all, as to editing posts, the best I can tell you is this:  Go to the beginning of the portion of text you want to copy and hold down your shift key.  With your shift key held down, use your arrow keys to highlight to the end of the text you want to copy.  It should appears as white letters in a black box.  Once you have it all highlighted, put your mouse arrow over the highlighted text, right click, and select copy.  Then select reply, and it will show you something like this:<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Hit enter after the line above, then right click your mouse and hit paste, and the text you want to refer to should show up.  After that highlight in the same manner all the text you want to get rid of and hit delete.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>To make your post look really nifty, leave the quoted text at the top and beneath it make some sort of separator - I like to use bunches of *'s (see above).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Then type your response. It DOES take a little work, which isn't cool if you really are a lazy poster, but if you are going to observe any posting etiquette at all, observe this one.  Folks will love you for it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - as to the rest of your comments.  This list is far more casual than most.  On any other list, it probably really is a good idea to limit the number of posts.  I can't speak for anyone else, but as for me - I really don't care.  I would rather wake up in the morning and see 10 posts from you than to sit around and wonder what you wanted to say that you didn't feel free to say because you felt you had hit your quota.  And your sense of humor?  Maybe some folks take it wrong - that happens quite often with mine too - but don't sweat it.  Those of us who have known you awhile know how to take you, and those who are just showing up on board will figure it out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And on to etiquette issues you didn't mention, I personally like the casual atmosphere of this list, so that we can stray off topic without fear of the topic cops.  However, by allowing a lot of swing from the letterboxing topic, we also open the door for topics that may be offensive to some and I think that means we have to self-regulate and be responsive if we step on someone's toes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One thing I think is particularly in violation of good list etiquette is giving the sort of information that would make someone uncomfortable if you were to say it to them in person.  On a few occasions, I've found myself squirming in my chair just by reading posts - and then realized no one else knew I had read it.  Still though, it has made me really uncomfortable reading it, as though I was eavesdropping on someone's personal life.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in all, I love this list because it stays lively and upbeat and even silly most of the time.  I feel I could let Lightning read this list without fear of what he might read - if he were so inclined to read email lists.  I would hope that if anyone has issues with other members of the list or things being discussed, they would be willing to either strike up a dialog with the other person or bring it to your moderators - me, Silver Eagle, or BootsTex.<br/>
