&gt; Now if y'all have very good memories, ya'll remember<br/>
&gt; that I went through Nacogdoches ONCE already back in<br/>
&gt; the summer and got all the boxes that were there.  I<br/>
&gt; was quite proud to be able to say that I had gone to<br/>
&gt; Nacogdoches and conquered the box scene there and<br/>
&gt; there was nothing left to be had for my logbook.  I<br/>
&gt; was especially proud that I had done it in the summer,<br/>
&gt; which is NOT my favorite time of the year!  Well<br/>
&gt; almost immediately, Lucy Locket set out some more<br/>
&gt; boxes and I was forced to let them sit for awhile<br/>
&gt; before I could get to them.  I've now made two trips<br/>
&gt; back in the last month or so, the second one being<br/>
&gt; today and I thought I had cleaned up all those boxes<br/>
&gt; again, but you won't believe what I found when I got<br/>
&gt; home - a very nice email from Lucy telling me she had<br/>
&gt; planted another one JUST TODAY!  Yep.  I had emailed<br/>
&gt; her asking whether any of the four boxes still<br/>
&gt; remaining were suitable to take my<br/>
&gt; just-out-of-the-hospital mom to, and in the course of<br/>
&gt; her reply she casually mentioned that she planned on<br/>
&gt; planting another this weekend, but I just couldn't<br/>
&gt; believe it would be so since it was supposed to be<br/>
&gt; raining!  It was true though, and now, I STILL haven't<br/>
&gt; managed to get ahead of her!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So anyway, I went back to Nac today to visit my sick<br/>
&gt; mom (who wasn't just-out-of-the-hospital after all -<br/>
&gt; they kept her a few more days after some yukky test<br/>
&gt; results), and I dragged my kids out of bed to go with<br/>
&gt; me.  Now bear in mind, I sent my husband off to<br/>
&gt; scoutmaster training at 5 a.m. this morning, but I was<br/>
&gt; generous and had told the kids to be up and ready to<br/>
&gt; leave at 9:30 sharp.  No big deal for Lightning, but<br/>
&gt; SJZ - well - let's just say she doesn't see the<br/>
&gt; daylight version of 9:30 very often.  By 6 a.m. I was<br/>
&gt; all organized and ready to go, and by 7 I was bribing<br/>
&gt; SJZ with a big breakfast if she would get up early and<br/>
&gt; go.  I finally had her out of bed by 8, and we hit the<br/>
&gt; road - still better than 9:30 anyway.  The morning was<br/>
&gt; overcast and gloomy, but I was ready to find those<br/>
&gt; LAST 4 boxes.  I was also planning on trying some<br/>
&gt; geocaching too, so I really wanted plenty of time<br/>
&gt; since I haven't yet been too successful at that!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We entertained ourselves on the hour drive to Nac by<br/>
&gt; trying to dismantle a Magic 8 ball to prove to<br/>
&gt; ourselves how many sides the little answer cubie thing<br/>
&gt; has.  Not a good idea in the car.  Fortunately, we are<br/>
&gt; letterboxers, so we were well equipped with ziplok<br/>
&gt; baggies and we were able to salvage the 8 ball project<br/>
&gt; before it really did a number on the car, and we<br/>
&gt; deferred it until we could address the project with<br/>
&gt; adequate tools (all we had to work with was my<br/>
&gt; all-in-one tool).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We hit the church where Blue Butterfly's Tres Cruces<br/>
&gt; box was and pulled in.  Nice secluded spot, so we<br/>
&gt; figured we would have no prob with muggles.  Well,<br/>
&gt; except the one guy bagging up leaves - lots and lots<br/>
&gt; of leaves.  We roamed the cemetery forever, pretending<br/>
&gt; to be really interested in the headstones (which we<br/>
&gt; really were, now I think about it).  Finally, he moved<br/>
&gt; far enough away for us to go in for the kill (oops, do<br/>
&gt; you call it a kill if it is in a cemetery???).  We<br/>
&gt; pulled out the box and found a lovely stamp, nicely<br/>
&gt; done, and a hitchhiker -Sunshine #2 (I think - I'll<br/>
&gt; doublecheck after I get my bag out of the car).  We<br/>
&gt; took our time stamping in and enjoying the cool<br/>
&gt; morning, and wondering if we really had to huff on our<br/>
&gt; stamps to make them print better since it was so<br/>
&gt; humid, or if the wind was enough to dry the ink so<br/>
&gt; that huffing was even more important than usual. <br/>
&gt; Interesting conversation.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; On we went to find our first geocache of the day and<br/>
&gt; surprised ourselves by being successful!  So far, we<br/>
&gt; haven't been doing very well with the GC'ing, and I've<br/>
&gt; been hitting Mike up for hints.  It was fun to finally<br/>
&gt; find one using real coordinates instead of guesswork -<br/>
&gt; our GPS put us within 3 feet and we could really,<br/>
&gt; truly see where we thought it should be, and sure<br/>
&gt; enough it was!  Inside it was an invitation to an<br/>
&gt; event that happened six months ago.  We didn't see a<br/>
&gt; need to RSVP, so we signed in and on we went....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This time, we stopped at a place where there were two<br/>
&gt; GC's and one LB.  We went ahead and went for one of<br/>
&gt; the GC's first and after much searching and apparent<br/>
&gt; repeated shifts of the earth's magnetic fields (did<br/>
&gt; y'all notice that this morning?), I found myself<br/>
&gt; standing on the side of a very steep hill reaching<br/>
&gt; across to a Y in a tree, bracing myself with one leg<br/>
&gt; around the tree and reaching into the Y with my arm. <br/>
&gt; Suddenly I realized I must be quite a sight, but I did<br/>
&gt; get the cache, so we were 2-0!  It was at that point<br/>
&gt; that I could kind of see the fun of GC'ing.  We took a<br/>
&gt; finger and left a carabiner (this was the part<br/>
&gt; Lightning really liked about gc'ing - aside from<br/>
&gt; watching comfortably from a set of steps while his<br/>
&gt; over-40 overweight mom hung precariously onto a tree,<br/>
&gt; he got to choose the booty we traded for), replaced it<br/>
&gt; and headed on down the Lanana Trail, had a very nice<br/>
&gt; walk - quiet for a change, since the bikers and<br/>
&gt; walkers that are usually on that particular trail were<br/>
&gt; apparently scared indoors by the threatening weather. <br/>
&gt; We came upon another of Lucy Locket's Vivaldi, and we<br/>
&gt; were rewarded with Summer this time - we had<br/>
&gt; previously found Autumn at Lake Striker.  Nice stamp. <br/>
&gt; SJZ and I thought about leaving the finger in the box<br/>
&gt; so we wouldn't get poked with it anymore, but<br/>
&gt; Lightning wouldn't have any part of it and promised to<br/>
&gt; quit poking us, which he did.  Suddenly we realized we<br/>
&gt; had promised my mom we would be there at noon and it<br/>
&gt; was already 12:30, so we high-tailed it out of there<br/>
&gt; and headed to see her, leaving behind the second GC.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We stumbled into Mom's room inky-handed (from the 8<br/>
&gt; ball and the LB's) and scratched up, dampish and<br/>
&gt; generally disheveled, so we finally had to own up to<br/>
&gt; what we had been doing.  She didn't get it.  I sent<br/>
&gt; Lightning out for the logbook so she could SEE for<br/>
&gt; herself, but she STILL didn't get it.  Scratch mom off<br/>
&gt; the possible letterboxer list.  She did, however, fall<br/>
&gt; for a gag with the finger.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We visited for a couple of hours until we had worn her<br/>
&gt; out with tales of our tantalizing life (mmmhmm), then<br/>
&gt; headed off again, this time in the pouring down rain,<br/>
&gt; to the SFA Experimental Forest.  The kids started to<br/>
&gt; mutiny, refusing to hike off down a trail looking for<br/>
&gt; a letterbox in the downpour.  I invited them to stay<br/>
&gt; in the car, but told them I would be going by myself. <br/>
&gt; We compromised and I pulled out the $1 disposable<br/>
&gt; ponchos I keep in my LB backpack and we went happily<br/>
&gt; down the trail.  The trail really isn't that long and<br/>
&gt; it has pretty heavy cover, so although it was raining<br/>
&gt; pretty hard, it wasn't as bad as it might have been. <br/>
&gt; We found Vivaldi's Winter by Lucy Locket and did the<br/>
&gt; poncho shuffle to keep the logbooks dry.  I think this<br/>
&gt; was my favorite of her Vivaldi series.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And finally, as the sun was threatening to set, we<br/>
&gt; made a mad dash out to the Carl Monk Scenic Overlook<br/>
&gt; to find the last in the Vivaldi series - Spring.  We<br/>
&gt; got to this secluded spot and there were three guys<br/>
&gt; goofing around there, throwing something around.  When<br/>
&gt; they saw that we weren't just pulling through, they<br/>
&gt; stopped and started taking pictures of each other. <br/>
&gt; Odd.  These guys were wearing skulls and chains and<br/>
&gt; didn't look like photography buffs.  We just got out<br/>
&gt; and pretended to be stretching and enjoying the view,<br/>
&gt; but all the while working out where the clues would<br/>
&gt; lead us.  Where WAS the final resting spot for the<br/>
&gt; box?  Right by where the guys were goofing around. <br/>
&gt; Then I had a vision that they might've been tossing<br/>
&gt; around the box when we drove up.  Yikes!  We edged<br/>
&gt; closer to them non-chalantly and I guess we made them<br/>
&gt; nervous (I can see how some skull-wearing guys would<br/>
&gt; see us ink-stained vagabonds as a threat), so they<br/>
&gt; jumped in their car and left.  We went happily to the<br/>
&gt; spot where the box was to be and - it WAS indeed<br/>
&gt; there.  It hadn't been made into a makeshift football<br/>
&gt; after all!  It felt good to finish Lucy's little<br/>
&gt; series and in such a place as that beautiful lookout. <br/>
&gt; Our other hunch had been that the skull guys were<br/>
&gt; letterboxers, but that didn't prove out either, since<br/>
&gt; the last to log in was Gryzzled Gryphon and to my<br/>
&gt; knowledge he doesn't wear chains and skulls.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All in all, a very good day.  We waited out the sunset<br/>
&gt; at the lookout (although the lookout doesn't point in<br/>
&gt; the right direction for a good sunset view), then<br/>
&gt; headed on home.  As we passed through Sacul, we<br/>
&gt; noticed that they were having their monthly Bluegrass<br/>
&gt; gathering, and I pleaded with the kids to stay with me<br/>
&gt; for it, but they weren't so inclined and I had already<br/>
&gt; presumed on their good natures all day long.  But I<br/>
&gt; have made a note to myself - "Bluegrass - Sacul - 4th<br/>
&gt; Saturday of the month.  Take a letterbox next month in<br/>
&gt; case I get inspired!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; P.S.  I poke fun at Lucy Locket's habit of planting<br/>
&gt; boxes right after I go through her area, but I'm glad<br/>
&gt; she won't let me get ahead of her.  I guess I need to<br/>
&gt; get a few more planted that she hasn't found and see<br/>
&gt; if I can't get ahead of her that way!  Maybe y'all<br/>
&gt; will be privy to the Battle of the Lucys!<br/>

&gt; &gt; and headed on down the Lanana Trail, had a very<br/>
&gt; nice<br/>
&gt; &gt; walk - quiet for a change, since the bikers and<br/>
&gt; &gt; walkers that are usually on that particular trail<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; apparently scared indoors by the threatening<br/>
&gt; weather. <br/>
&gt; &gt; We came upon another of Lucy Locket's Vivaldi, and<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; were rewarded with Summer this time - we had<br/>
&gt; &gt; previously found Autumn at Lake Striker.  Nice<br/>
&gt; stamp. <br/>
&gt; &gt; SJZ and I thought about leaving the finger in the<br/>
&gt; box<br/>
&gt; &gt; so we wouldn't get poked with it anymore, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lightning wouldn't have any part of it and<br/>
&gt; promised to<br/>
&gt; &gt; quit poking us, which he did.  Suddenly we<br/>
&gt; realized we<br/>
&gt; &gt; had promised my mom we would be there at noon and<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; was already 12:30, so we high-tailed it out of<br/>
&gt; there<br/>
&gt; &gt; and headed to see her, leaving behind the second<br/>
&gt; GC.<br/>

&gt; &gt; We stumbled into Mom's room inky-handed (from the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Now if y'all have very good memories, ya'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I went through Nacogdoches ONCE already back<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the summer and got all the boxes that were there. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was quite proud to be able to say that I had gone<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Nacogdoches and conquered the box scene there and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there was nothing left to be had for my logbook. <br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was especially proud that I had done it in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; summer,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is NOT my favorite time of the year!  Well<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; almost immediately, Lucy Locket set out some more<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes and I was forced to let them sit for awhile<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before I could get to them.  I've now made two<br/>
&gt; &gt; trips<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; back in the last month or so, the second one being<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; today and I thought I had cleaned up all those<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; again, but you won't believe what I found when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; home - a very nice email from Lucy telling me she<br/>
&gt; &gt; had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planted another one JUST TODAY!  Yep.  I had<br/>
&gt; &gt; emailed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her asking whether any of the four boxes still<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; remaining were suitable to take my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just-out-of-the-hospital mom to, and in the course<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; her reply she casually mentioned that she planned<br/>
&gt; &gt; on<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planting another this weekend, but I just couldn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe it would be so since it was supposed to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; raining!  It was true though, and now, I STILL<br/>
&gt; &gt; haven't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; managed to get ahead of her!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, I went back to Nac today to visit my<br/>
&gt; &gt; sick<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mom (who wasn't just-out-of-the-hospital after all<br/>
&gt; &gt; -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they kept her a few more days after some yukky<br/>
&gt; &gt; test<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; results), and I dragged my kids out of bed to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; me.  Now bear in mind, I sent my husband off to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; scoutmaster training at 5 a.m. this morning, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; generous and had told the kids to be up and ready<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; leave at 9:30 sharp.  No big deal for Lightning,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SJZ - well - let's just say she doesn't see the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; daylight version of 9:30 very often.  By 6 a.m. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all organized and ready to go, and by 7 I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; bribing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SJZ with a big breakfast if she would get up early<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; go.  I finally had her out of bed by 8, and we hit<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; road - still better than 9:30 anyway.  The morning<br/>
&gt; &gt; was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; overcast and gloomy, but I was ready to find those<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; LAST 4 boxes.  I was also planning on trying some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching too, so I really wanted plenty of time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; since I haven't yet been too successful at that!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We entertained ourselves on the hour drive to Nac<br/>
&gt; &gt; by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trying to dismantle a Magic 8 ball to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves how many sides the little answer cubie<br/>
&gt; &gt; thing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has.  Not a good idea in the car.  Fortunately, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers, so we were well equipped with ziplok<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; baggies and we were able to salvage the 8 ball<br/>
&gt; &gt; project<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; before it really did a number on the car, and we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; deferred it until we could address the project<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; adequate tools (all we had to work with was my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; all-in-one tool).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We hit the church where Blue Butterfly's Tres<br/>
&gt; &gt; Cruces<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box was and pulled in.  Nice secluded spot, so we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; figured we would have no prob with muggles.  Well,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; except the one guy bagging up leaves - lots and<br/>
&gt; &gt; lots<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of leaves.  We roamed the cemetery forever,<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretending<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to be really interested in the headstones (which<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; really were, now I think about it).  Finally, he<br/>
&gt; &gt; moved<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; far enough away for us to go in for the kill<br/>
&gt; &gt; (oops, do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you call it a kill if it is in a cemetery???).  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled out the box and found a lovely stamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; nicely<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; done, and a hitchhiker -Sunshine #2 (I think -<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'll<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; doublecheck after I get my bag out of the car). <br/>
&gt; &gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; took our time stamping in and enjoying the cool<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; morning, and wondering if we really had to huff on<br/>
&gt; &gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamps to make them print better since it was so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; humid, or if the wind was enough to dry the ink so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that huffing was even more important than usual. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Interesting conversation.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; On we went to find our first geocache of the day<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; surprised ourselves by being successful!  So far,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; haven't been doing very well with the GC'ing, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been hitting Mike up for hints.  It was fun to<br/>
&gt; &gt; finally<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find one using real coordinates instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; guesswork -<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our GPS put us within 3 feet and we could really,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; truly see where we thought it should be, and sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; enough it was!  Inside it was an invitation to an<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; event that happened six months ago.  We didn't see<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to RSVP, so we signed in and on we went....<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This time, we stopped at a place where there were<br/>
&gt; &gt; two<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; GC's and one LB.  We went ahead and went for one<br/>
&gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the GC's first and after much searching and<br/>
&gt; &gt; apparent<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated shifts of the earth's magnetic fields<br/>
&gt; &gt; (did<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; y'all notice that this morning?), I found myself<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; standing on the side of a very steep hill reaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; across to a Y in a tree, bracing myself with one<br/>
&gt; &gt; leg<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around the tree and reaching into the Y with my<br/>
&gt; &gt; arm. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Suddenly I realized I must be quite a sight, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; did<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get the cache, so we were 2-0!  It was at that<br/>
&gt; &gt; point<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I could kind of see the fun of GC'ing.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; took a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; finger and left a carabiner (this was the part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lightning really liked about gc'ing - aside from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; watching comfortably from a set of steps while his<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over-40 overweight mom hung precariously onto a<br/>
&gt; &gt; tree,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; he got to choose the booty we traded for),<br/>
