                    <div class="plaintext-content">I do adult trainings for the San Jacinto Girl Scout council on <br>
letterboxing - training the leaders to train their own girls.  I have <br>
talked to my own troop of 12 2nd graders as well.<br>
We are really trying to get it going at all of our council camps as a <br>
fun activity for troops to do at camp weekends and give them a little <br>
taste of boxing without endangering public boxes.<br>
<br>
I will email you off list the handout I use for the training (or post <br>
it here if anyone else is interested).  <br>
<br>
In the training class, I give an overview of boxing then pull out my <br>
pack to show them what I take with me.  I discuss the "rules" of <br>
boxing and stress the importance of rehiding well, resealing baggies <br>
well, and NOT FILLING UP LOGBOOKS!  I show them examples of boxes <br>
they might find out there and types of containers that work well.   <br>
We discuss types of logbooks and how the girls can make their own <br>
with cardstock and white paper - I show samples of those.  At the <br>
end, we discuss planting boxes, writing clues and carving erasers - I <br>
show examples of carved stamps too.<br>
<br>
As part of their class kit they receive a half sheet of cardstock <br>
folded in half filled with about 6 half sheets of white paper folded <br>
inside of the cover.  Holes are punched on the edge and brads or yarn <br>
used to tie them together.   It's an easy and cheap way for all the <br>
girls to have a logbook.  They also get a film canister with a hole <br>
punched on one end, a pony bead, a piece of yarn, a 2x2" square of <br>
funfoam and a small foam mounting square.  They thread the yarn <br>
through the hold using the bead to keep it in place (making a <br>
necklace out of the canister).  They cut the fun foam into a small <br>
image with kid scissors and attach it to the canister with the <br>
mounting square.   Many of the leaders have gotten quite creative <br>
with their fun foam stamps.  <br>
<br>
When I discussed LBing with my troop, I first got them excited by <br>
showing them my logbook.  We talked about the basics of boxing and <br>
how to follow clues.  We made and decorated their logbooks at one of <br>
our meetings and then found our first box at a GS camp.  They were <br>
HOOKED.  I carved us a troop stamp to for the host logbook and then <br>
each girl got to stamp the host stamp into their own logbook.  The <br>
nice thing about boxing at the GS camp was that not as much stealth <br>
is needed (good thing too since it was quite chaotic!).<br>
<br>
I just kept it very very simple with the girls and will teach them <br>
more as we go along.  With a troop whose leaders are new boxers you <br>
would have to give more info up front.<br>
<br>
I'm sure it's not much different from the boxing you did with your <br>
cub scouts.  You might want to contact the program dept. at the GS <br>
council office and find a liason to get it going (if you haven't <br>
already).  Our council just put a blurb in the council newsletter <br>
magazine and I train the class at most of the big training events.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps you out a little bit.  Getting the scouts started is <br>
where I am spending most of my boxing time lately.  <br>

<div> </div>
<div>I gathered up my old logbooks and got out a bunch of stamps I've carved but not done anything with, and I've gathered up some of every kind of carving material I have.  I also downloaded some fairly simple images of things that are appealing to girls.  I've got some boxes and HH's sitting on my desk that I'll take, and some logbook supplies, I've printed off some clues and I've got a copy of GG's first box clues.  And there are always good stories, thanks to everyone on this list!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I recently met the membership development person for the local GSUSA council and got to know her a bit, so I asked her to connect me with program people who might want letterboxing information.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For reasons I have yet to understand, BSA has opted to get behind geocaching vs letterboxing.  Consequently, councils are seeking grants to buy GPS's.  What happened to teaching map and compass to boys, and isn't letterboxing a better venue for that than geocaching?  Since they are gearing GC'ing toward Boy Scouts, maybe they figure boys should have their basic navigation skills down by the time they cross over from Cub Scouts.  My council has placed some caches on our scout reservation and I'm currently seeking permission to place boxes as well.  So far they have looked at me like I have three eyes!

                    <html><body><div>That's my thought - if you don't learn basic skills you won't really understand what you are doing with a GPS anyway.  Of course, we really drill navigational skills in our pack, but there are several of us who are bent that way.  I guess I might survey leaders at our next Roundtable to see how other packs handle it, and maybe most packs do a good job of teaching navigational skills.  If they do, then I guess it would make sense that Boy Scouts are moving on to GPS, since it would be a step further after learning navigation.

<br/>navigation skills<br/>&gt; down by the time they cross over from Cub Scouts. My council has <br/>placed<br/>&gt; some caches on our scout reservation and I'm currently seeking <br/>permission to<br/>&gt; place boxes as well. So far they have looked at me like I have
