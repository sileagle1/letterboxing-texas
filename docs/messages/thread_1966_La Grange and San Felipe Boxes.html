&gt; We are gonna attempt some of the boxes in La Grange and San <br/>
Felipe.  Do you know if yours are still intact? If not, I guess I'll <br/>
find out for you!!<br/>

forgotten about the posting problems we use to have. It <br/>
&gt; took me 2 1/2 year to finally get my Virgin Island boxes posted, <br/>
&gt; only to have a park ranger make me remove one of them 4 months <br/>
&gt; later! It was a pain to type out your clues in word, then email <br/>
&gt; them in and hope they got posted. Let alone if you needed to make <br/>
&gt; changes or updates. I will hopefully post on monday the details of <br/>
&gt; our first "seeding" letterboxing trip in Texas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Have a great 4th of July!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Recently on one of the lists the suggestion was made that this <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; &gt; really a low-tech game we play and that it used to be played <br/>
&gt; WITHOUT a <br/>
&gt; &gt; website, and implied that the websites have made us soft. I had <br/>
&gt; no <br/>
&gt; &gt; idea you and Baby Bear lived that life, or I should say - I <br/>
never <br/>
&gt; &gt; stopped to realize you must have lived that life!<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; What a challenge it would be to find another letterboxer in <br/>
Texas <br/>
&gt; (let <br/>
&gt; &gt; alone the whole country) in order to find another letterbox. It <br/>
&gt; makes <br/>
&gt; &gt; me think of that Dr. Suess book "Are You My Mother?" I can just <br/>
&gt; see <br/>
&gt; &gt; y'all peering at folks on trails saying "Are YOU a <br/>
&gt; letterboxer???" <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just imagine if the two of you hadn't both become interested in <br/>
&gt; &gt; letterboxing. About the only way this could have ever taken off <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; to have two or more people who wanted to play AND who knew each <br/>
&gt; other <br/>
&gt; &gt; AND who were good at both hiding and finding. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It amazes me yet again how far we've come in a few short years...<br/>
