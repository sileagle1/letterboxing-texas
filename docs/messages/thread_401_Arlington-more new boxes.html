Hey All, <br>
Just posted three new boxes around Lake Arlington area.  If you have <br>
time to do all three I hope you enjoy the picture they make <br>
together!  Each location is only about a five minute drive from the <br>
previous one so they are easily all three done in a limited time.  <br>
The last park is not right on the lake but close.  The only other <br>
lake location was a golf course!  That wouldn't work!:(<br>
thanks for your nice note Ruby!<br>
We were contemplating another camping trip to Possum Kingdom anyway! <br>
Now we have even more incentive!<br>
Look out Connecticut! Texas is a 'nippin' at yore heels!! Yee haw!!<br>
