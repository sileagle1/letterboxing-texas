<div>Do you have any experience with Heathkits, or Heathkit brand?  The only point of reference I have is a AM/FM radio my dad built when I was little.  I only remember laying in the floor and listening to it and it picked up wayyyy distant stations - at least in my opinion!<br clear="all"/>

<div>Although now you mention it, a heath kit would be a very wise thing to have.  Heath bars ARE brain food, right?<br/><br/></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="522542313-09112008">The HEATH company was started in the early 1920s as a kit 
airplane.  The founder Edward Heath was killed in a test-flight about 5 
years later.  (I wonder how many planes sold after that?)  Another 
enterprising individual bought the company and continued selling aircraft and 
accessories until the end of WW-II.  With the availability of surplus WW-II 
military electronics following the war, the company product line moved to 
electronics, and the HEATH-KIT was born.  Many a ham operator built their 
first radio from a HEATH-KIT.  They were made well, they were affordable, 
and they worked.  The ham-radio equipment was an especially good 
deal.  I myself have built a number of their kits in my younger days, and 
still have a few Heath items in the shack here in El Paso.  As electronics 
evolved away from tubes to transistors Heath was still able to compete.  
But the coming of the IC-chip, cheap Japanese electronics, and other market 
forces set the stage where you could no longer build your own or build a kit and 
save money.  In the early 1990s Heath got out of the electronics 
business.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="522542313-09112008">Building a Heathkit required time, patience, and the 
ability to follow directions. Given these, the risk of failure was small. 
Heathkits were absolutely complete except for tools. The instruction books were 
regarded as the best in the kit industry, being models of clarity, beginning 
with basic lessons on soldering technique, and proceeding with explicit directions, illustrated with line 
drawings, and a box to tick as each task was accomplished.</span></div>

my first crystal radio.  Sitting in my upstairs room in Chicago, tweaking

help it some.  Every now and then you could get a really distant station 
from Canada or Mexico.  That was SO COOL!  </span></div>

                    <html><body><div>I LOVE that word - convoluted.  I also like the word ad hoc.  They are nothing alike though!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My interest in ham radios and heathkits have nothing to do with scouts - well sort of it does - but mostly not.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Probably since I was a kid listening to my dad's heathkit radio (and I remember getting Chicago stations with some regularity!), I've thought radio was kind of cool.  I also remember our weirdo neighbor who was a ham operator whose transmissions bled over our TV reception all the time too.  He was a nice guy - just very odd. with the big honking huge antenna in the back yard and on his truck.  And then there was the CB craze, and we got into that for a little while - but who didn't?  (I was Country Sunshine, if you MUST know)  And still - the idea of being able to power up and talk to people all over everywhere without the use of a telephone - so much better than a walkie-talkie!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So move forward to my scout years, and every year scouting has an event called Jamboree on the Air (JOTA).  Ever since I've known about it, I've gone "so my son could participate."  They would set up with one lone radio operator in the middle of the wide open area at the front of Jim Hogg Historic site in Rusk (for those of you who have been there) and a handful of scouts would visit his setup.  One year reception was horrible and we didn't get to talk to a soul, so I sat and talked at length to the operator, long enough that Fearless Fox and Lightning went and hiked for a bit and came back for me.  I can't really tell you WHY ham radio fascinates me - it just does.  And then there is seeing Corazon and Navigator at gatherings, and Navigator will talk anyone's ear off about ham radio or flying (which intrigues me too), and n0kwa too, but he's only been to one gathering.  Anyway, every year I tell myself that ham radio will be my next hobby after I get rid of one of the ones I already have (mainly letterboxing and writing and scouting).  So last year we stepped JOTA up a bit and moved it to the lake and a dedicated area - and we had horrendous turnout, but I got lots of good time with the radio guys that were there.  I mentioned my interest at that time and I gave them my stock answer - that radio is next on my list to do.  They guffawed (another word I like) and said "Just do it.  We can even test you at JOTA".  And I mentioned the same thing to Mike - that I was waiting until I had more time to do it - who did a cyber eye roll I'm sure.  And as this year's JOTA rolled around, the radio guys from last year started hammering me about getting licensed and Mike said "Well - uh - why not?" (basically), so I started studying and was all geared up to take it at JOTA, but they were one examiner short and wayyy too many boys present to make testing practical, so I put it off, and now I'm going to take my test next week in Longview.  So one of these days I'ma gonna talk to Mike on the radio...<br/>
<br/>The problem with my taking on a new hobby is that I can't just sort of do it.  If I'm in, I'm all in.  So - against my better judgment - I'm going in.  I just couldn't stand it anymore.  Fearless Fox has been doing face-to-face eye rolls lately when I mention it (because he knows what that means), but when I reminded him yesterday that I'm busy taking my test next weekend, he said "Well I wish Lightning and I (only he didn't call him Lightning) could take the test."  Go figure...and now he wants to build a radio.  And asks "Can you solder?"  To which I responded "Why certainly.  And even if I couldn't, I could learn, because I can do anything."  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>For the record my NEXT hobby on the list is storytelling - and it really IS going to have to wait its turn.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>My family often carry pretty good two-way radios with us in case we get separated (or if I'm rendezvous'ing with FF and L to pick them up after a weekend hike).  In flatllands they work fairly well, but in mountains like we run into in Arkansas specifically, unless we are calling down a valley or a ridge, they aren't worth a plug nickel - we can't get a signal until we are almost within visual range.  How do mountains affect ham radio?  I'm guessing they are much more reliable, but what exactly would we expect if we move from two-ways to ham? (And now I'm sitting here realizing we would now have to look at buying THREE handhelds instead of one...)<br/>
