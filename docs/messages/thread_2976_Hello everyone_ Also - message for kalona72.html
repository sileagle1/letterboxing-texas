letterboxing. I hope you will forgive me for trying to contact a <br/>
member through this group site. <br/>
<br/>
They emailed me the other day, reporting on my two micro boxes - the <br/>
ones at Marble Falls which go missing, are resurrected, missing <br/>
again, etc. over and over. Also asking for info about the stamps <br/>
since one is apparently missing from the letterbox, now. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, when I replied to the email, it didn't go through, so I am <br/>
leaving the info (below) here, in hopes the person will see it.<br/>

Happy trails,<br/>

Those two microboxes go missing and then are found over and over <br/>
again. I am sorry the stamp was gone this time, though. <br/>
<br/>
The Lost Marbles stamp was 2... or 3? (I think) cat's eye marbles, <br/>
meant to be stamped however many times you wanted in your log book. <br/>
Or maybe it was just one, and I stamped it three times in my book. <br/>
It's been so long, I've forgotten.<br/>
<br/>
Sweet Berry was a strawberry.<br/>
<br/>
I will try to take a photo of them in my log book later and put it <br/>
up on my blog. It may take a day or two. You can check my blog at <br/>
http://www.wanderinglily.blogspot.com <br/>
<br/>
But first, I have to find my log book. I haven't letterboxed in <br/>
ages. <br/>
<br/>
Have fun,<br/>

<div>In April, Viewfinder and I visited the Lost Marbles box and found you had "lost your marbles", ie: the stamp was missing. However we used the bottom of the film canister to stamp our logbooks in multiple colors which made impressions of perfect little marbles, so all was <u>not lost!</u></div>
