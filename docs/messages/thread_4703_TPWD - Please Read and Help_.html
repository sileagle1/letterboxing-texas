                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree with all Boots says.  With that in mind we (actually SE did for me) created a file in the "files" section addressing the rules for placement in Texas parks.  This is meant to be a working document to help keep track of the overall rules and specific rules for parks that have been approached or we know have a problem with letterboxing.   Please review the document (go to "Files" on the left, then pick "TX Park Rules for LB Placement", then pick "lbrules_txpark - 1-18-2011").  As you can see this is just a start based on my limited knowledge.  Those of you that have info on State or city parks(for city parks only give ones that are a problem) please email to me the information and I will add it to the document.   I hope this helps. <br>

> Thanks to all of you who have responded to this post and for your kind words.  It's not that I think my efforts have failed, I have had a lot of success at the park level.  My experience has been that (in the parks where I have permitted boxes) the employees have not been familiar with letterboxing, so they make up their own rules on the fly.  In every case, the rangers and employees have been extremely nice and welcoming. However, no two parks interpret the rules (geocaching rules as they apply to letterboxing) the same.  One may hand me a permit application and say "Place your letterbox anywhere you want, fill out the form, and drop it back at the office as you leave."  The next one may tell me that I have to meet with the park manager, but he's not available, so you need to make an appointment because he's the only one that can approve your application. Still another may say that they'll have to check out the location when they have time and will email you when it is approved. If they do that, I wouldn't leave the box. The main reason that I was taking this as far up the chain as I could was to get some uniformity at the park level, so we would know what to expect when we went to a park to place a box.  I thought the way to do that was to be recognized as separate but equal to geocaching, so we might have some say in the policy writing.  That didn't happen, so there's where the failure lies.  Even after all that, I still think that we can place letterboxes in state parks as long as we just go along with each parks interpretation of the rules.  If you don't agree with what they want you to do, just don't leave your box in that park.  Save it for another park, where the rules may be different.  If you don't want to do that, just be sure your box is well placed, so it isn't likely to be found accidentally.  Hey, it's worked for 10 years.  I've learned one thing from this experience: the Texas Parks and Wildlife Dept. is not interested in spending time and resources hunting down letterboxes.  If one is found accidentally and reported to them, they may email you and give you an opportunity to permit it or come get it.  You can always consider it expendable and just tell them to throw it away.  I guarantee you that they don't have anyone searching LbNA or Atlas Quest looking for your letterbox. It's up to you how you want to play the game. <br>

I don't mind telling you that the response from them has been, although polite, mostly apathetic.  I thought that a recent meeting I had with a park ranger, who had been asked by a state director to meet with me, was going to be productive.  However, it has ended like all the other meetings, with a response which effectively told me that our activity was too small and trivial to warrant the wasting of their time and resources. All I seem to have accomplished is raising their awareness of the sport of letterboxing, and for that, I apologize.  As I told them, letterboxing has been going on in the state parks for 10 years now with no known problems or harm to any cultural or natural resources.  They even acknowledged that fact.  While I'm not advocating that you place boxes in state parks without a permit, I doubt that anyone would notice.  I would say that if you want to letterbox in state parks, you should decide for yourself which way you want to go.  If, in the future, TPWD decides to make a policy for letterboxing, I'll remind them that we tried to work with them and were rebuffed.  As for me, I'll probably still try the permitting process in individual parks occasionally, but I'm giving up on my efforts to educate the powers that be in Austin.<br>
