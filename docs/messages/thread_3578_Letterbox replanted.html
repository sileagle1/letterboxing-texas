                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just replanted a box in the Kaufman Memoral Park. The one there <br>
went missing about a mth ago. We made a new box, logbook, and stamp <br>
and hid it in a different place. We wanted it planted before memoral <br>
day. <br>
<br>
 "Celebrate Our Military Day"<br>
<br>
Here are the new clues:<br>
<br>
This is a park that Kaufman built to commemorate our Military men and <br>
women who died in service of out country. Kaufman is on Hwy 175 about <br>
35 miles from Dallas, TX. When you get to Kaufman, turn south on Hwy <br>
34. After you past Brookshire's grocery store on your left, get into <br>
your left lane. Turn left at the light onto South 1388. On the right <br>
side of the road, across the street from the Kaufman High School is <br>
the Veteran's Memorial Park. After you have read the inscriptions and <br>
meditated on our solders that gave their life for our country, you <br>
will notice a tank sitting behind the memorial park. Go inspect the <br>
tank. Go under the big gun to the far side of the tank. Look to the <br>
top runner of the track. Count to 4. Look between 4th and 5th track <br>
for the box. Look between the enter and outer tract. Hint: #4 track <br>
is cracked.<br>
