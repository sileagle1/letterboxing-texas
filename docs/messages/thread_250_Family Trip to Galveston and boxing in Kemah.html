                    <html><body><div>The Birds of a Feather family spent Friday at Moody Gardens in Galveston.  On the way home, we stopped in Kemah and found the Kemah Stingray microbox.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sherri - We went through about 9pm so most of the dining crowds were inside or gone.  We decided to move from the hiding area to stamp in.  Since it was dark, we went around to the front and sat at the shark bench and stamped in.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I agree it would be hard to retrieve and replace the box during high traffic times.  At the time of night we were there,  it was nice to have multiple people to watch as there are 3 different directions people could come from.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, I was wanting to know if I could get your permission to display this letterbox and your future letterboxes on the Texas Letterboxing Atlas website (<a href="http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi">http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi</a>).  This website plots the general location of letterboxes on a map.  </div>
