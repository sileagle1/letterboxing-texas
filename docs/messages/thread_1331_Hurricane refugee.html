<div>Well, maybe it wasn't a hurricane refugee.  We were out on Saturday when we thought we were going to get some rain--brought umbrellas for the journey.  As you know, we didn't get any rain.  We put in one of the books that we weren't going to let the hurricane stop us from letterboxing!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Glad you got to come up for a short visit, even though it wasn't the best of circumstances.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take care,</div>
