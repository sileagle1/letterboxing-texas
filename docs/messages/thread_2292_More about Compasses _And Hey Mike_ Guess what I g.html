                    <div class="plaintext-content">After our recent discussion about compasses, I was pleased beyond<br/>
words as I was having the same discussion with my mother today and she<br/>
mentioned that she still had my dad's old army compass.<br/>
Unfortunately, the lens is cloudy now, and apparently there is a part<br/>
missing from it (although I can't tell exactly what she was referring<br/>
to when she said that).<br/>
<br/>
This particular compass is - (hmmm...trying to calculate in my head) -<br/>
45 years old or so.  In my hand, it has the feel of a fine piece of<br/>
equipment.  Something meant to last a lifetime, including some certain<br/>
amount of time on a battlefield.  I HAVE to get this compass<br/>
refurbished and begin carrying it.  It's wonderful.  It doesn't have<br/>
the cool features I like about my Silva orienteering compass, but it<br/>
has the feel of quality and reliability and it is elegant in the<br/>
simplicity of its design.  One purpose and one purpose only - to tell<br/>
direction.<br/>
<br/>
In addition to the compass, she gave me his mapreading glasses (or<br/>
whatever they are called - I don't know).  Like magnifying glasses on<br/>
stand, and you would set the stand on the map and look through the<br/>
glasses - I can sure see the benefit of these in reading topo maps.  I<br/>
also got his splendid stopwatch.  Wow.  I'm really glad she never gave<br/>
these things to me when I was younger, because I feel I'm only just<br/>
able to really appreciate the workmanship behind them and the value he<br/>
placed in them during his lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
My dad, whom many of you know I loved dearly and have the utmost<br/>
admiration for (see my Go Jacks! box for more), carried these items<br/>
and used them as daily tools of his trade as he taught mapreading and<br/>
surveying in the Army, and later as a Forester.   I had lost hope that<br/>
I had the type of skills he valued in terms of navigation, yet through<br/>
scouting and letterboxing, I have managed to discover that they<br/>
weren't absent, only well hidden!<br/>
