                    <div class="plaintext-content">Unbelievably, my family had a free day today - well,<br>
my daughter had stuff, but the rest of us were<br>
footloose and fancy-free!  My husband, my son, and I<br>
piled in the car and headed to Fairfield to check the<br>
box we planted there in the Spring.  I knew when I<br>
planted it that I hadn't used a very good box (it was<br>
the only kind I could find in Fairfield), and figured<br>
I had better get it into a better box before the<br>
winter months hit in earnest.<br>
<br>
We hit Fairfield State Park about 2:00 this afternoon<br>
and eased our way to the trail.  We took our time<br>
making our way down the trail - I just love that<br>
particular nature trail - it looks different every<br>
time I walk it!  My normally cautious 8-year-old son<br>
was feeling especially daring today and wanted to try<br>
walking all the fallen trees, especially the ones that<br>
ran across ravines.  He also ventured out to the end<br>
of a point - only to find that it is apparently used<br>
as a community potty by some type of animal - it was<br>
the strangest thing - this little narrow outcropping<br>
was literally covered in dung of some sort (much<br>
bigger than bird dung)!  As he was turning to come<br>
back, he slipped and slid face first halfway down the<br>
12 foot embankment - once he managed to stop himself,<br>
we all had a good laugh and he readily climbed back up<br>
the embankment to retrieve his walking stick and climb<br>
back over to us to get checked out - he was pretty<br>
scraped up and had one pretty good cut, but other than<br>
that, he was mainly dirty.  He thought it was the<br>
weirdest thing how his legs were shaking afterward -<br>
we tried to explain the aftereffects of adrenalin to<br>
him, but he just thought it was strange his legs were<br>
shaking.  He was still game for being daring, for<br>
which I was relieved - I just don't know what to do<br>
with a cautious kiddo!<br>
<br>
We continued on and as we were approaching the visual<br>
landmark for the box, we heard something rooting<br>
around and looked up to see an armadillo - completely<br>
unaware of us and enjoying a feast of some sort in an<br>
old rotten tree.  We crept close to him and yet he<br>
never seemed to realize we were there - we were so<br>
close I could have reached out my walking stick and<br>
tapped his shell (visions of their verrrryyy long<br>
claws helped me practice some self-control).  Finally<br>
he got the idea he had company and moved away<br>
nonchalantly.  We followed him a bit, but got bored<br>
and decided to go for the box.<br>
<br>
We went back to the landmark and immediately<br>
remembered the hiding place.  We went to it, but began<br>
to doubt we were remembering the right place because<br>
it looked as if nothing could be there.  I dug a bit<br>
anyway, and sure enough there it was!  It was very<br>
well hidden!  After opening the box and seeing that<br>
the inkpad had totally puked its guts inside its bag,<br>
I was really worried about the log, but it was in good<br>
condition.  Then came the moment of reckoning - I<br>
opened the book and turned pages until I got past our<br>
stamps, turned one more page to see if anyone had<br>
visited (much accustomed to blank pages), and I found<br>
none other than our elusive Grizzled Gryphon's stamp! <br>
Did we ever figure out who that guy is?  He had<br>
visited it on 7/11 - nice stamp he has.  The next log<br>
entry was the one that totally startled me - having<br>
seen Silver Eagle's and BabyBear's images numerous<br>
times, I only had to glance to know they had been<br>
there - what startled me was the date - TODAY!!!  I<br>
know some of you know that feeling of realizing you<br>
have followed fairly closely behind another boxer - it<br>
must be reflex to suddenly perk up and search your<br>
surroundings for somebody walking away from the<br>
vicinity!  Needless to say, they were nowhere in<br>
sight, but it was so weird to know they were just<br>
hours ahead of us!  Wow!  Having met them at the<br>
gathering last Spring, I made my husband drive through<br>
the camping areas to see if we could spot them so we<br>
could stop and say hi.  Didn't see 'em so maybe<br>
they'll tell us if they were camping there when they<br>
send off their sitrep.  That was so cool though!  <br>
<br>
As to the box, it's tucked away in a better box now,<br>
and I left my personal stamp pad in the box and took<br>
away the old one.  Cleaned the stamp up a bit and<br>
sealed it all up and rehid it.  I was glad to see it<br>
was okay - I had a good time carving that particular<br>
stamp and then planting the box - I would've been<br>
really bummed if it had been damaged!<br>
<br>
Now I'm thinking I really need to check my boxes in<br>
Tyler.  I'm excited to see who all has been to see<br>
them!<br>
<br>
What a nice day it was!<br>
Lucy<br>
