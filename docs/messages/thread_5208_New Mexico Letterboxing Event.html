We'll see if we can swing it - we need to take the dogs somewhere.  why not<br>
a letterboxing event?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We come to Las Cruces once a week for dog training.  You have one of the top<br>
obedience trainers living there.<br>
<br>
We also come to the farmer's market about once a month.  If you have been<br>
there and seen some mighty big dogs, that was us.  We were there last<br>
Saturday, and brought the two 3 month old puppies along for the walk.<br>
<br>
There was also a sanctioned match in Mesilla Park 2 weeks ago, we were there<br>
showing the pups.<br>
<br>
I am so active in so many things, letterboxing has sort of fallen to the<br>
back burner unless we are traveling.  And we have not been traveling much -<br>
we decided to pay off every bill and credit card.... so no dog shows very<br>
far from home for a while now.<br>
<br>
I still shoot competitively in high-power rifle and combat pistol, still do<br>
ham radio, and still try to hike a lot.<br>
<br>
We will be going to Germany in June, landing in Frankfurt on D-Day (kinda<br>
funny) and coming back at the end of June.<br>
<br>
I forwarded your E-mail to the wife - we will see if it fits with her<br>
schedule.  But that is a fine park, and I wouldn't mind a day there.<br>
<br>
Mike.<br>
