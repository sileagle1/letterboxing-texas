                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just wanted to tell Sea Dove and family that their Texas Atlas is a <br>
great tool!  This weekend I was in a small town that didn't have any <br>
boxes. So much for that. But then I thought I would check out the Atlas <br>
and see if there were any in some the surrounding areas and I hit pay <br>
dirt! Wonderful. Would not have known they were there as I wasn't <br>
familiar with the area.  So many small towns in Texas and if they are <br>
outside of your 'stomping ground' you could easy miss some on your way <br>
from one place to another.<br>

Thanks Birds of a Feather!<br>
