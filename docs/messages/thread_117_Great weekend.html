                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems like it was a great weekend for Texas letterboxers!  We went <br>
to Brazos today with the intention of finding the new box and placing <br>
one of our own, however an 8 year old with a severe itchy eye attack <br>
made us cut our visit a little short.  At least it gives me an excuse <br>
for another trip to my favorite park of all time!  We did see an <br>
alligator that had to be about 13 feet long on the path at Elm Lake.  <br>
She was in the middle of the path with her head up...obviously <br>
aggitated over something.  We had first seen her moving from quite a <br>
distance.  Believe it or not we saw a man lead his scout troop right <br>
past her (or him).  The alligator hissed, but thankfully all the <br>
scouts passed by safely.  We watched (at a safe distance)for about 15 <br>
more minutes until it turned and went back into the water.  Very <br>
cool. (Except for the people who act like they are in an amusement <br>
park instead of a state park).  Anyhow, we did place a box in Houston <br>
this weekend, in Hermann Park near the zoo.  I'll try to post the <br>
clues tomorrow.  <br>
