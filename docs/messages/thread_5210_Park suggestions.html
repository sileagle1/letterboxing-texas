                    <div class="plaintext-content">The only park I know of with boxes in SW Louisiana is Sam Houston Jones, which you mentioned.  However, there are several nice parks in TX near you.  Village Creek SP is close to Beaumont and used to have boxes in it, but Rita probably wiped them out.  It is a great place to canoe since the Village Creek Paddling Trail goes through the park and Big Thicket National Preserve, which is also a great place to visit.  I have done the short Sandbar canoe trail with scouts and it was fun and not too difficult.  We used Eastex Canoe Trails for rental and transportation:<br/>

<br/>
A little further away is Martin Dies SP, which also used to have several boxes that were possibly lost to Rita.  It has nice trails and fishing.<br/>
And just a little further north is Boykin Springs Rec Area in Angelina NF.  It is less crowded than State Parks and might still have some boxes.  The Sawmill trail is a good hike.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this time of year might be a little warm and buggy, but give them a try and have fun!<br/>
