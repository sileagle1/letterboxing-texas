*****Plano Balloon Festival was in disarray when we<br>
found it in November.  SJZ/Elmo and I found half the<br>
box and the log, and we searched around the area for<br>
the stamp and the other half of the box.  Knowing rain<br>
was emminent and knowing that raindear, the placer,<br>
was from out-of-state, we took the already damp<br>
logbook with us to dry out and return to raindear. <br>
When I contacted him, he said he had gotten a report<br>
just the week before that the box was in a similar<br>
condition, except that all the pieces were located and<br>
put back together and rehidden.  It was also<br>
interesting that a GC'er had found and signed in to<br>
the box just the day before and it was apparently<br>
intact.  If you searched around, I'm sure you found<br>
the GC in the ammo can in that area - that cache was<br>
at the other end of the same tree the box was in.<br>
<br>
Raindear would, I think, like to replace the box, but<br>
would like to find someone locally to adopt it.  He<br>
asked if I would, but I am more likely to get to the<br>
North Pole than I am to get to Dallar, so I told him I<br>
couldn't do it properly.  Any takers?<br>
