<div> </div>
<div>It was a little past five and I had just left a job interview (keep your fingers crossed) and was heading home.  For some unknown reason, I opted to take the loop instead of going on into town.  I know y'all are shocked to hear that Jacksonville has a loop - well let me assure you - we don't.  It's numbered like a loop.  It's called a loop, but it does NOT loop.  ANYWAY, I took the loop.  I passed by a particular place with a fountain, somewhere that I recently letterboxed and very near where our boy scouts camp when they are camping locally.  Well you know how it is when you are familiar with a place - your head automatically turns toward it, as mine did.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well what do you think I saw, but a Cranberry Cruiser!  I whipped my car around and pulled into this particular place with a fountain with the intent of sneaking up (in dress, heels, and hose) behind the Gryzzled One to see if he would jump and inadvertantly repeat his address or his name or something.  As luck would have it (his good luck and my bad luck), I was also on the phone with my husband, who was getting ready to go camping with the scouts.  He was cursing the fact that his bug spray was in my car, and I debated briefly about telling him to either go without (which, being a good letterboxer, I couldn't really make myself do) or get some more (knowing I would have to give him a $20 for a can of bug spray because he didn't have cash or time to get any).  Being the dedicated wife that I am (y'all tell him so next time you see him), I drove off instead, leaving GG in peace and continued anonymity and taking the infernal bug spray home to Fearless Fox and Lightning.
