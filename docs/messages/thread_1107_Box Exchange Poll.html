                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!<br>
<br>
Just a reminder that the Box Exchange Poll runs through this Friday.  <br>
Currently, Texas Festivals is the leader, but others are gaining in <br>
popularity. Anyone on this list can vote, and if you've already voted <br>
but want to change your vote, you can easily do that by visiting the <br>
poll section.  So if your first choice is a sure-fire loser, you may <br>
switch to your second choice to build momentum for that choice.  Hey, <br>
I've switched my vote 5 times already!<br>
<br>
After the polls close, I will create a database where you may sign up <br>
to create and/or receive a box.  Creators are responsible for the <br>
stamp, the log book and the box to hold it all.  Receivers will be <br>
responsible for planting the box, writing, posting and hosting the <br>
clues and doing any routine maintenance on the box itself.   I will <br>
conduct a slightly geographically-rigged lottery to hook up the <br>
exchangees.<br>
<br>
Remember, this is a good will exchange so that boxers from one part of <br>
the state (or country, as in Miss Moon's case) can see the creations <br>
of letterboxers whose boxes they might not routinely be able to find.  <br>
If you're on this list, but you don't live in Texas, you are still <br>
welcome to participate.  All are welcome--newbies and experienced <br>
carvers alike.  <br>
<br>
Hopefully, everyone will get into the spirit and have lots of fun with <br>
it.  Target mail date is September 15th.<br>
<br>

Honestly, I think every little town in Texas has a<br>
festival.  Surely that won't be a problem!<br>

about the exchange of boxes, so if the Viking Fest floats a carver's <br>

<br>
Some of the wackier ones are in small towns waaaay out, and I'm <br>
personally drawn to the uniquely named ones.  <br>
<br>
Just in your logbook, mention the town and what they celebrate.  <br>
<br>
What does everyone else think?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think that will be much harder to coordinate with that approach.  <br>
Plus, as these are stamps that we are essentially caretaking for <br>
another boxer, they need to be placed relatively near to the <br>
receiver's home for maintenance.  I think I would be more careful <br>
with someone else's box that I was entrusted with than I would be <br>
with one of my own, some of which I have never even checked on.  I <br>
wouldn't necessarily want to get a box for a festival that's near <br>
Houston, but for a community that I don't know very well and don't <br>
really know the hiding spots in.  I'd rather hide the Oldenberg <br>
HammerFest Box or the Muleshoe Mule Days box in good spots in <br>
Houston that I thought would be secure.  Plus, to me, the oddly <br>
named ones are the more entertaining ones!<br>
<br>
Will of course go along with the group, as that's why there's a poll <br>
and it's a group exchange and effort, but those are my thoughts.  <br>

<div>I guess I would prefer to have the stamps hidden near the festival town, but that may prove to be problematic, so maybe we can plant some near the festival towns and some in other places. Maybe we could just all indicate what festival/town we are doing, and then if someone lives nearby, they would get to plant; otherwise it would be up for grabs?</div>

<div>I think that will be much harder to coordinate with that approach.</div>
<div>Plus, as these are stamps that we are essentially caretaking for</div>
<div>another boxer, they need to be placed relatively near to the</div>
<div>receiver's home for maintenance.  I think I would be more careful</div>
<div>with someone else's box that I was entrusted with than I would be</div>
<div>with one of my own, some of which I have never even checked on.  I</div>
<div>wouldn't necessarily want to get a box for a festival that's near</div>
<div>Houston, but for a community that I don't know very well and don't</div>
<div>really know the hiding spots in.  I'd rather hide the Oldenberg</div>
<div>HammerFest Box or the Muleshoe Mule Days box in good spots in</div>
<div>Houston that I thought would be secure.  Plus, to me, the oddly</div>
<div>named ones are the more entertaining ones!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Will of course go along with the group, as that's why there's a poll</div>
<div>and it's a group exchange and effort, but those are my thoughts.</div>

<div>&gt; I guess it depends on how it works out, but ideally I</div>
<div>&gt; think the festival stamp should be somewhere near the</div>
<div>&gt; festival.  But if someone feels strongly about doing a</div>
<div>&gt; particular festival and there isn't a boxer nearby, it</div>
<div>&gt; just needs to go somewhere...</div>

<div>&gt; That's what I think anyway.</div>

<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all!</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just a reminder that the Box Exchange Poll runs</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; through this</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; Friday.</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Currently, Texas Festivals is the leader, but</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; others are gaining</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; in</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; popularity. Anyone on this list can vote, and if</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; you've already</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; voted</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but want to change your vote, you can easily do</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; that by visiting</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; the</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poll section.  So if your first choice is a</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; sure-fire loser, you</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; may</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; switch to your second choice to build momentum</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; for that choice.</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; Hey,</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've switched my vote 5 times already!</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After the polls close, I will create a database</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; where you may</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; sign</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; up</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to create and/or receive a box.  Creators are</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; responsible for</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; the</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stamp, the log book and the box to hold it all.</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; Receivers will</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; be</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsible for planting the box, writing,</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; posting and hosting</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; the</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clues and doing any routine maintenance on the</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; box itself.   I</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; will</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conduct a slightly geographically-rigged lottery</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; to hook up the</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exchangees.</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, this is a good will exchange so that</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; boxers from one</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; part of</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the state (or country, as in Miss Moon's case)</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; can see the</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; creations</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of letterboxers whose boxes they might not</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; routinely be able to</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; find.</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you're on this list, but you don't live in</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; Texas, you are</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; still</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; welcome to participate.  All are</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; welcome--newbies and</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; experienced</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carvers alike.</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hopefully, everyone will get into the spirit and</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; have lots of</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; fun</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; with</div>
<div>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it.  Target mail date is September 15th.</div>
