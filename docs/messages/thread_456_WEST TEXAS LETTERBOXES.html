Does anyone know if the 3 letterboxes listed in the basement for El <br/>
Paso are MIA? <br/>
Will be in El Paso for a week and hoping to get a chance to look for <br/>
them.<br/>

I don't know, but would love to find out.  The ones at Hueco<br/>
Tanks would be the oldest existing Texas letterboxes if still <br/>
alive, just beating out Lost Pines by a few months.  Hueco Tanks <br/>
SP is not in El Paso and would require a drive north, but I hope <br/>
you get to look for them and maybe place a few new ones.  Good<br/>
luck, and be sure to report back what you find.<br/>

Is Duck Creek #2 gone? <br/>
It was one of the original post-Smithsonian boxes, placed in '98.<br/>

None of the original Dallas boxes exist anymore and I can't<br/>
contact the ladies that placed them.  I guess they got tired<br/>
of waiting for others to join the fun and quit.  If you<br/>
were able to find the boxes before they went missing, I would<br/>
love to see the stamp images.  Maybe if you come to the<br/>
Event you can bring them.<br/>
