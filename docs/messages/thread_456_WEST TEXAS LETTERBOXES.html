Does anyone know if the 3 letterboxes listed in the basement for El <br>
Paso are MIA? <br>
Will be in El Paso for a week and hoping to get a chance to look for <br>
them.<br>

I don't know, but would love to find out.  The ones at Hueco<br>
Tanks would be the oldest existing Texas letterboxes if still <br>
alive, just beating out Lost Pines by a few months.  Hueco Tanks <br>
SP is not in El Paso and would require a drive north, but I hope <br>
you get to look for them and maybe place a few new ones.  Good<br>
luck, and be sure to report back what you find.<br>

Is Duck Creek #2 gone? <br>
It was one of the original post-Smithsonian boxes, placed in '98.<br>

None of the original Dallas boxes exist anymore and I can't<br>
contact the ladies that placed them.  I guess they got tired<br>
of waiting for others to join the fun and quit.  If you<br>
were able to find the boxes before they went missing, I would<br>
love to see the stamp images.  Maybe if you come to the<br>
Event you can bring them.<br>
