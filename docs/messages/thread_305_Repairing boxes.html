Lessons learned this weekend:<br/>
Bring more repair/replacement materials! We felt very badly that at the<br/>
end of our trip, we had no new empty box to switch out with one that was<br/>
waterlogged.<br/>
<br/>
How does everyone else in the group handle this? Does everybody carry a<br/>
spare box, or just tape to repair? The waterlogged box we found was<br/>
heavily duct-taped inside the lid &amp; we couldn't find a visible leak. We<br/>
dried everything out as much as possible, discarded the soaking wet<br/>
blank pages of logbook, sealed the visibly-stamped remaining pages into<br/>
a new baggie - and added several blank index cards &amp; a new pen, along<br/>
with box owner's email address for future finders in another new bag.<br/>
<br/>
Any thoughts?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mr. Adams Trails and Mrs. Adams Trails went out to check on and repair our boxes. I am reporting that some are missing and some have been repaired and some I have taken home to repair as they could not be repaired on the trail.<br/>

Blue Daisy has been removed until I carve another stamp. I guess someone like it so much they took it. I am so proud of my carving that they would like it that much. It was no where around.<br/>
<br/>
Lions, Tigers and Frogs was out of place uncovered and the top was loose. Water was inside the box and the log book was not in its plastic bag and soaked beyond repair. Stamp was OK. We changed boxes with a newer lid and a new logbook in a new plastic bag. We put the stamp in its own plastic bag and replaced it in the proper place and recovered well. <br/>
<br/>
Swimming up stream is still there and in good shape. <br/>
<br/>
The Great Outdoors is there and safe now that I put it in a jar. The coon can't chew into it.<br/>
<br/>
An Apple for the teacher is still there and wanting someone to find it please. We did change the box as the other one was damaged by the sun.<br/>
<br/>
The Drifter is OK and so is Zach's box. They are in the same cemetery.<br/>
<br/>
The Eyes of Texas is gone and will not be replaced.<br/>
