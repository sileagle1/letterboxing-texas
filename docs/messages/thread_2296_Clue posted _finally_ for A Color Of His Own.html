on me that those of you who stamped into it weren't able to log your <br/>
find. I am so sorry about that, I just wasn't thinking right.<br/>
<br/>
I planted the box here in my neighborhood at a lovely park called <br/>
Chisolm Park. It's in Hurst right smack in the middle of Dallas and <br/>
Ft. Worth. Feel free to stop by and say hi to my little chameleon. <br/>
It's a great place to fish, feed the ducks and play (they have several <br/>
play structures for the kids). Duck, Duck, Goose is in that park also. <br/>
It was one of my first letterboxes to find (thanks Puddle Splasher).<br/>
<br/>
Have a great week everyone,<br/>
