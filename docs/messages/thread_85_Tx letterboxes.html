Houston to find Hogg Pecans in Varner Hogg SP and Gordon Grouper at <br/>
Sea Center Texas. Both were alive and well. If you havent been to <br/>
Sea Center Texas in Lake Jackson--go see Gordon! He is awesome. We <br/>
also picked up Roarin Roadster HH at Hogg Pecans LB. All in all we <br/>
had a productive letterboxing spring break week. Hope to do some <br/>
more letterboxing this weekend. <br/>
My son has chosen the name Beach Boy, I think there is already a <br/>
Beach Boy in lb so we will call him Tx Beach Boy. He now has a stamp <br/>
and he is anxious to place a box. He is 11. <br/>
<br/>
Ready for the next gathering...<br/>
