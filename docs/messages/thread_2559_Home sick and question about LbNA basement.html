<div>I'm working on something right now and am wondering - why would a box be in the LbNA basement and yet have a fairly recent find?  Box being by an active placer also?  The placer in question is very diligent about maintaining box statuses, so I'm curious what reasons folks would have for this?  I'm going to email the specific placer and I'm sure she'll have a very logical answer, but I'm curious what other scenarios y'all can think of for this situation?
