that rowdy Metroplex bunch :p - don't feel left out on the rush to <br/>
April Fools. . .here's a challenge for you. . .<br/>
<br/>
I will have an event only / traveling box at the gathering called <br/>
'Tribute to England' (in relation to my box series of the same name in <br/>
Houston). This box will NOT just be a stamp. However, I am going to <br/>
make you work to find it and you will be running around the park (okay, <br/>
well, walk, bike, drive. . .whatever). Anyway, I am going to give you <br/>
an option to get out of the runaround bit and go right for the box. All <br/>
you have to do is give me a name. . .here's how it works. . .<br/>
<br/>
I recently tried a cache challenge that sounded pretty cool. Find a <br/>
Titantic survivor - alive or their gravestone/burial place. (my <br/>
grandmother was on the Olympic (Titantic's sister ship) in 1913 so I <br/>
have always had an interest in this)  I assumed the odds of finding <br/>
someone alive were about nil, but I thought there might be a good <br/>
chance someone was buried here - and maybe even in Houston. So, a <br/>
little digging around the internet and YES, I found someone in Houston.<br/>
<br/>
This man was on part of the deck crew on the Titantic. He made it onto <br/>
a boat with 11 others (about half crew and half 1st class passengers - <br/>
he was one of 2 of the deck sea crew and probably was the one who <br/>
handled the boat)  and was picked up by the Carpathia and dropped off <br/>
in NYC. Eventually he made his way to the Houston area where he died in <br/>
a nursing home in 1962 and is buried in an area cemetary.  Who is he?<br/>
<br/>
Note: There may be others in Houston. . .I don't know, I didn't get <br/>
that far. But if you come up with proof of someone else, I'll accept <br/>
it.  I did see the name of a woman who might be here, but didn't <br/>
continue researching it.<br/>
<br/>
Are you up for the challenge? Good luck.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>
