So far I have planted three caches but no one has looked for them yet.  I have looked for twelve caches and so far my luck is 50% in finding a box.  <br>

I'm in Central Texas but I travel a lot to do 10K Volksmarching event.  Looking for letterboxes near my destinations will make it even more fun.<br>
