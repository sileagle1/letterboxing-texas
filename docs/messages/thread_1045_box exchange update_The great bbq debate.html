has special meaning for you and that trumps anyone elses plans.<br>
<br>
 Also, I'm sorry, but Cooper's is way over-rated. I ate there a <br>
couple of years ago.  It's a great experience, but the flavor was a <br>
little bland. Too much quantity, not enough quality.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure what my favorite is so I don't really have a <br>
challenger.  Black's is better than Cooper's.  I ate at Tom's Ribs <br>
recently in San Antonio and it was better by far.  Honestly, my <br>
uncle-in-law beats them all.<br>

just there last week to bury my step-father.  He grew up in San Saba <br>

Texas.  It is beautiful and I would get over my first carve jitters <br>
for that honor.<br>
