<br/>
Oleander Island: Finally! A chance to find a Celtic<br/>
Lions box! What a treat. If you haven't found this one<br/>
yet, you might want to make sure you get to Galveston<br/>
before the next big storm, as this box will probably<br/>
get blown all the way to the Celtic Lions den up in<br/>
DFW if we get a good strong storm. For now, it seems<br/>
happy living where it's hiding.<br/>
<br/>
Sponge Bob Square Pants: I had to ask several guests<br/>
at the gathering I was attending before I found one<br/>
that knew about Sponge Bob. The box was wet, but I<br/>
dried everything out, put the log and stamp in new<br/>
baggies, and added some camo tape to the bottom of the<br/>
box.<br/>
<br/>
Kemp's Ridley: Alive and well. Great hiding place.<br/>
Easy place to stamp in. Really nice stamp!<br/>
<br/>
Sylvester: Yet another awesome stamp by Baby Bear! I<br/>
lived on Galveston Island for several years, and had<br/>
never been to this bird sanctuary!<br/>
<br/>
Celtic Cross: Alive and well. I replaced the logbook,<br/>
so there is plenty of paper for more boxers to sign<br/>
in!<br/>
<br/>
Sea Aggie: Thanks to Celtic Lions, this box is still<br/>
alive. I replaced baggies and box and put in a new<br/>
logbook. It's ready for the next finder!<br/>
<br/>
Cavalla: Totally awesome stamp by Celtic Lions that<br/>
makes my original Cavalla stamp look like something<br/>
old and gray and formless! I counted this as a find,<br/>
even though I originally placed the box -- new box,<br/>
stamp, and pad, not my own doing. The box is under the<br/>
brick by the bush and doing well.<br/>
<br/>
Labyrinth: If you want to see something really neat,<br/>
check out this labyrinth! Not only can you walk the<br/>
labyrinth, but check out the large stones to mark the<br/>
Solstice sun positions. Dewberry is right about the<br/>
brambles, though. Be sure to take a stick to "beat the<br/>
bushes" before you venture off the trail. This is one<br/>
of those boxes where you can see where the box is<br/>
located, but it takes a bit of work to figure out how<br/>
to get it! Oh yeah -- the restrooms are on the back<br/>
side of the shelter, and they were extremely clean for<br/>
public restrooms.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you Celtic Lions, Mother of Five, Gramatrick,<br/>
and Baby Bear for placing these boxes and turning my<br/>
day into a wonderful afternoon of letterboxing!<br/>
