                    <html><body><p>Dat Rusk lady, she seen me and now Ah has to come clean.<br/></p><div class="gmail_quote"><br/>Ah got ta tell da trute - Ah been hidin here on dis heah macheen and seein how yous folks pass dat touah mobile round and Ah made a plan ta slide crost da bohdah and take dat ting for mah self. <br/>
<br/>One dahk neet, Ah gots Junya and wez slipped mah pirogue crost dah bayous and up da Red. Wez took tah da land, and fo monts we wuz jis a bite slow tah get da mobile. Ol' Junya, he took tah wardin' off ta gris gris, but Ah knowed we hadda be faster dan tah Texkans is all.<br/>
<br/>And den - ouah luck turnt and dat buncha crazy Texkans got put tah makin do-do in ta crazy houst. We settled in an we watcht and we wait, anh when dos crazy nuts wus bouts to break out, we take to da mobile and wait fo em to come on, but not afore da Rusk lady's hound nearly et up my leg. We thot we wuz done and jis had tah get back clean to mah pirogue, but cept some crazy Mexcan camn on ta mobile and tried to put us outn, but Junya - he not always such dah cooyon - an he luahed dat ol Mexcan offn da mobile wit da peppahs Ol Junya carry in his pocket. I yells Allons to Junya, an he jumps on da mobile jis as da Mexcan in a pancho grabs holt for dea life. We takes off den, blowin dust all ovah that Rusk lady an her hound. I feel kindly bad fo dat.<br/>
<br/>Off'n we went and afta a piece I turnt da drivin to Junya, but Junya hant never drove befo and was havin ta big time actin as he coult drive - all da time that Mexkan flappin off da back of da mobile and dem crazy riders bounctin ever whichn way. I pointed tahd da Red fo Junya, tol him tah make tahd da pirogue, but jis as I coult smell dah rivah, Junya ramt dah mobile intah some ol fence with a chunk o concrete. All stummerflucted, wez pouahed off da mobile. Even dah crazy ol Mexkan seemt confused tho he cussed us in Spanish lahk we coult unnerstant a word he say. <br/>
<br/>Luck was still wid us tho, an a old codger in a truck stop fo us. He tolt us Logansport wis jus down tah road, but he ony stopt causin we was all up in tah road, not cuz he was hepping. Smellin tah bayou lan of mah home, I herded dah people back in tah mobile tol Junya tah run along behin til we shook off ta Mexkan, but he hops on anyhows. Ta Mexkan, he chase behin us and almos cot us, but I hooked right until we ran tah dah rivah. I was throwed outn da mobile, knock witless, and now - I ha no idee where da mobile is, Allz I knows is dat Mexkan lipes to have the mobile, the peoples, and ol Junya. But youz know what we coonass's says :Lache pa la potate!<br/>
