Hey guys,<br>
This weather has inspired me to spend each day outdoors.  I think I <br>
have found I enjoy carving more when I sit at a beautiful park in <br>
the sunshine.<br>
<br>
Anways, I planted the four microboxes of the Jazz Quartet Series <br>
today in Arlington.  <br>
<br>
Also, I tweaked the clues for Into The Woods yesterday.  I thought I <br>
was about to meet my first letterboxer on the trail yesterday-but <br>
alas, he was a geocacher.  Oh well, he was friendly but it seemed to <br>
me he was missing some of the natural beauty around by having to <br>
stare so intently into his GPS.  I tried to convert him to LB but to <br>
no avail. ;)<br>
