                    <html><body><div>I just finished this workshop - and it blew my mind!  It truly was totally awesome and oh so much fun, but it really taxed my brain!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have to tell you just one story from the weekend - </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now bear in mind, I was determined to keep letterboxing and scouting OUT of the weekend - to stretch my mind to think about other things.  So the instructors, the very cool Tom Prasada-Rao and Cary Cooper, began the day giving us writing assignments and giving us short periods of time to do them in.  And we pretty much HAD to read them out loud - safe environment, no heavy criticism and all that, but still...  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, the third assignment was to write the first line of a song.  Easy, right?  Well I had already kind of flubbed the first two, proven what a songwriting-newbie I am, and I felt the pressure.  We had two minutes to come up with the one line - ONE LINE.  Time was ticking down and I couldn't help it - I fell back on what I know.  My first line was "Lucy loves letterboxing like flowers love the rain".  Okay - I know, it's kinda lame and a little cheesey, but it was a line - ONE LINE.  I was UNDER PRESSURE, OKAY?  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So the next step of the assignment was to pass our one line to our neighbor for them to write three more lines for a whole verse, and to write the first line of the next verse, then they were to hand them back and we were to finish the second verse.  Yikes!  I looked at the guy to my right in horror - and I handed him my paper and apologized.  He began reading and he said "What?  What did you write?"  I leaned over and read it to him, as if that would solve his problem.  He said "Oh.  That's what I thought it said."  I apologized again.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now realize - this guy is one of those kind of guys who has an answer for everything, and usually a smart aleck answer - a guy after my own heart (don't tell Fearless Fox).  I already KNEW I was gonna like sitting next to this guy, but I had no idea how much until he shot back his response to my one line:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>MINE: </div>
<div>Lucy loves letterboxing like flowers love the rain</div>
<div> </div>
<div>HIS: </div>
<div>Lucy loves the little ones though they may be profane</div>
<div>Profanity in a letterbox and a heart that loves just fine</div>
<div>Makes Lucy's litter a lot loved like flowers on the vine.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lucy loves her litter and her letterboxing too.      <br clear="all"/></div>
<div>MINE:</div>
<div>But her litter doesn't letterbox and that makes Lucy blue</div>
<div>Now Lucy's letterboxing is a lonely affair</div>
<div>But still for her litter she has love to spare.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Okay, weird I know.  But we were UNDER PRESSURE!  Anyway, we were both relieved just to have survived the exercise.  But wait - I had to read it OUT LOUD!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I read this weird little bit of verse to the group and I could sort of feel everyone on either side of us moving a their chairs a little further away.   Suddenly, I realized that he and everyone else had interpreted letterboxing as LITTERBOXING!  So now - reread what he wrote and what I wrote and think cats and litterboxes.  Oh my!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Okay, it was a weekend of bizarre trains of thought and real weirdness...but at least now I know how to write a song about letterboxing!</div>
