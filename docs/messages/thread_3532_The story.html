But this may show you what a simple word of thanks may mean to a soldier.<br/>
<br/>
This dude was in the Air Force in Viet Nam.  But he wasn't your typical<br/>
wing-nut.  He was jump-qualified, and spent a whole lot of time in Indian<br/>
country setting up navigation beacons for the arc-light missions and other<br/>
stuff.  He saw the elephant so to speak.<br/>
<br/>
He is now retired, a ham operator in CA.  He has adopted a number of soldiers by<br/>
daily flying a flag in their honor, and sending them a goodie box every few<br/>
weeks.  My son is one of them.<br/>
<br/>
Here is the story he shared with my son in a letter inside a package..  He<br/>
always sends me a copy.  On a recent trip home he was chatting with his wife<br/>
about "their soldiers".<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
In his own words......<br/>
<br/>
On the trip home, we were talking about our troops and how to convince them that<br/>
their service is their gift to us, and she suggested my Idaho story.  We'll give<br/>
it a try and hopefully you'll understand.  It too takes place in combat but is<br/>
not a combat story.  We were about 2 years into the war, we'd finished all the<br/>
NVN TACAN missions, and were now either supporting infantry units with comm, or<br/>
doing missions along the HCM Trail for the intel guys.  One of my guys, Terry,<br/>
was from a very small town in Idaho where he had a wife, young son, Mom, Dad,<br/>
and a little brother.  In fact, he was my only married troop.<br/>
<br/>
When we were on bases prepping for a mission, we wore regular fatigues, didn't<br/>
have to carry our rifles, and like everyone else, had baseball caps with our<br/>
unit name embroidered on the front.  Ours were black, and I'm wearing one in the<br/>
photo [our name led to the nickname "1st MOB" which was sort of cool].  Terry<br/>
had sent two of them home for his son and brother and the whole town adopted us.<br/>
Their first package arrived just as we were starting a 60-day mission in the NW<br/>
of RVN on the border with Laos.  We were refueled and resupplied weekly by<br/>
helicopter, and each time they dropped off a mail sack, there'd be a town<br/>
package in it.<br/>
<br/>
Each package would have snacks, candy, games, magazines, the little newspaper<br/>
for Terry, and letters for each of us . each time your letter would be written<br/>
by a different family in town.  Everything was packed in pop corn which we ate<br/>
too.  Like most of our missions, we were alone on this one, and the packages<br/>
really meant a lot to us.  The people talked to us like we were theirs, and the<br/>
letters almost always would have a family photo, usually decorated by the kids<br/>
in the picture.  They usually had kids' drawings and the like as well.<br/>
<br/>
About a month into the mission, the refueling A/C arrived and dropped off<br/>
another mail sack.  It had the usual package from the town which had the normal<br/>
stuff and letters.  But in addition, there was a large envelope.  In the<br/>
envelope was an 8x10 photo.  It had been taken in front of the bleachers on the<br/>
ball field at the school.  Terry's wife was seated in the center of the front<br/>
row holding their son.  His Mom, Dad, and Brother were seated on one side of<br/>
her.  On her other side was a sign that said "TERRY."  The rest of the front row<br/>
had signs with our names or nicknames on them.  The entire town was seated<br/>
behind, and everyone in the photo, including babies and two dogs, were wearing<br/>
our black hats.<br/>
<br/>
James, we had probably 30 or more combat missions under our belts by this time.<br/>
In addition to the two Airmen I told you about, I had also lost one of my<br/>
Soldiers and one of my Marines by this time.  We were sort of hardened; I had<br/>
been told more than once that we were a bit fatalistic; our humor tended to be<br/>
fairly dark; and, with the occasional harassment we were getting, we were fairly<br/>
jumpy.  Despite all that, the photo put all 23 of us in tears.  It was like a<br/>
huge hug from across the Pacific.  The feeling of "belonging" and that these<br/>
people really did care about us was overwhelming.<br/>
<br/>
We had been sort of rotating the "write back" duties.  We had nothing material<br/>
to send to them, but we did have an AF Polaroid camera and some film.  We took a<br/>
group photo with the timer, but it was disappointing . the print was fairly<br/>
small, you couldn't really see our faces with our gear on, and we didn't really<br/>
dare take it off.  We didn't have enough film for individual pictures so we took<br/>
them in pairs.  Everyone wrote a letter to the town, and we sent the whole thing<br/>
to our COC who mailed it for us.  About the end of the mission, we heard that<br/>
they had gotten our package, and had put the photos and our letters into a<br/>
little display in the Town Hall where they had some historical things.<br/>
<br/>
Terry was subsequently injured and ended up in the AF hospital at Lackland AFB<br/>
in San Antonio.  We sort of figured that would end the package stream, but when<br/>
the town said we were "adopted," they really meant it and every week to ten<br/>
days, we'd get the package.  When supporting the infantry, we shared the stuff<br/>
of course, and the guys were really stunned at how much support we got.  We all<br/>
knew by this time that the war was hugely unpopular at home, and I can't believe<br/>
that everyone in the town felt good about it, but they really had made the<br/>
separation between the war and the warriors.  I finally wrote to them and told<br/>
them we had received a rotation date and would be coming home soon.  We got one<br/>
more package from them with an invitation to all of us to visit, and thanking us<br/>
for our service.  The photo is Terry earlier at a new base being built.  Our<br/>
Commander had given the mission to us as a stand-down for about a month.<br/>
Years later, like 1989 maybe, I was an engineer working for a defense<br/>
contractor, and I had occasion to go to Idaho Falls for a couple days of project<br/>
meetings with one of our sub-contractors.  I realized I was close to the town<br/>
and might not get another chance, so I called the office, told them I was taking<br/>
another day, and drove up after my meetings.  I found the town . it looked<br/>
pretty much as I had imagined it from Terry's descriptions.  Terry and his<br/>
family were long gone of course, but I found the Town Hall, on a town square<br/>
which was a park.  And inside, in a corner, I found the display.  They had<br/>
enlarged our group photo to 8x10 [pretty grainy], and it was next to theirs.<br/>
Our others were arranged around them, and our letters were in plastic protectors<br/>
in a loose leaf binder.<br/>
<br/>
Seeing their photo was an instant transport in time and space for me, and I<br/>
didn't hold things together much better than when I first saw it.  That same<br/>
feeling of belonging came over me and I'm not sure how long I stood there<br/>
looking at it.  I lost two more of my Airmen after that mission, and seeing<br/>
their faces in the photos was both really great and really tough.  I leafed<br/>
through the binder and found my letter.<br/>
About this time, a fairly elderly woman came up behind me and asked if I'd like<br/>
to hear the whole story behind the display.  She startled me [I was still 10,000<br/>
miles and 20 years away], and with my usual social ineptness, I blurted out, "I<br/>
know the story ma'am, I'm Skip, that's me with TJ in that photo, and I wrote<br/>
this letter."  At this point she had her heart attack.  Well . not quite, but<br/>
she did a pretty good impression of one.  She made me promise not to move, and<br/>
disappeared through one of the doors.<br/>
<br/>
Very shortly, the 5 or 6 people who worked in the Town Hall came out and met me.<br/>
I tried to thank them but it was really difficult to find the right words.  News<br/>
apparently travels fast in a small town because within minutes, people were<br/>
streaming into the building.  Some were older than me and were the people who<br/>
had written all those letters and packed the packages.  Some were younger than<br/>
me and were the kids in all those family photos we got.  Lots of hugs,<br/>
introductions, and me trying to thank them repeatedly.  The school was a block<br/>
away, it let out, and the kids began streaming through the door.  Kodak stock<br/>
probably doubled that day with all the pictures being taken.  I finally had to<br/>
leave to catch my flight.  I did my best but I don't think I really succeeded in<br/>
explaining to them the impact their support had for me and my guys.  At least I<br/>
got to try.  They all just kept telling me that we had already thanked them with<br/>
our service.  Two others have made it there, had a similar experience, and also<br/>
believe they failed to adequately thank them.  They too got the same . "You've<br/>
already thanked us with your service."<br/>
<br/>
Terry recovered, remained in the AF, and retired as an E-8.  They had another<br/>
boy, and finally settled in FL where until recently, he was in real estate<br/>
development.  They are grandparents to a half-dozen, and, thanks to Brent's kids<br/>
[Brent was the kid on his Mom's lap in the photo] will become great grandparents<br/>
about the same time we do this summer.  Brent enlisted in the AF [after Vietnam,<br/>
thank God!], served 22 years and also retired as an E-8.  Brent got a degree in<br/>
computer science on the GI Bill and is currently working in North Carolina in<br/>
the "Research Triangle" area.  His brother Mike became a Marine, served four<br/>
years, also got a degree on the GI Bill, and is currently in law enforcement in<br/>
Alabama.  As may be obvious, we are in fairly close contact, now thanks to<br/>
email.<br/>
<br/>
So James, take two things away from this story:  I know, better than nearly<br/>
everyone, what it means to get support from American strangers when you're in<br/>
combat; and, just like the folks in that little town, you thank us every day<br/>
with your service to our Nation . far more thanks than we deserve.<br/>
<br/>
Stay safe James.  You and your comrades are truly awesome!  Heroes are hard to<br/>
find these days, but we're pretty lucky . we've got a number of them and you're<br/>
one.<br/>
<br/>
There you have it.  What a wonderful person.  Not because he adopted my son who<br/>
is also a ham operator.  But because my son is one of a number of soldiers he<br/>
adopted.<br/>
<br/>
I can think of no other words to add.  Hope you enjoyed it.<br/>

<div><strong>Thank you so much for sharing this story.  
My dad and others with him didn't receive the greatest reception when they 
returned home from Vietnam.  I loved the very perceptive statement in the 
story about the disconnect for those sending the packages between their feelings 
about the war and the warriors.  I've often seen someone in uniform (which 
is QUITE often here in San Antonio) and made a point to thank them for their 
service to our country.  One man stands out...he looked very important and 
"strong," but, when I went to him with our children to thank him for his 
service, he got misty - eyed, and said he didn't think anyone cared!!  How 
could someone live in this city of all places and not feel cared 
for?</strong></div>
<div><strong></strong> </div>
<div><strong>Brings me to a question...where would I get 
information on a soldier that our family could adopt?  I probably would 
need some clue as to what would be appropriate to send in a care 
package. </strong></div>

<div>OK - a few have asked, so I will share. Delete it if you are not 
  interested.<br/>But this may show you what a simple word of thanks may mean to 
  a soldier.<br/><br/>This dude was in the Air Force in Viet Nam. But he wasn't 
  your typical<br/>wing-nut. He was jump-qualified, and spent a whole lot of time 
  in Indian<br/>country setting up navigation beacons for the arc-light missions 
  and other<br/>stuff. He saw the elephant so to speak.<br/><br/>He is now retired, 
  a ham operator in CA. He has adopted a number of soldiers by<br/>daily flying a 
  flag in their honor, and sending them a goodie box every few<br/>weeks. My son 
  is one of them.<br/><br/>Here is the story he shared with my son in a letter 
  inside a package.. He<br/>always sends me a copy. On a recent trip home he was 
  chatting with his wife<br/>about "their soldiers".<br/><br/>In his own 
  words......<br/><br/>On the trip home, we were talking about our troops and how 
  to convince them that<br/>their service is their gift to us, and she suggested 
  my Idaho story. We'll give<br/>it a try and hopefully you'll understand. It too 
  takes place in combat but is<br/>not a combat story. We were about 2 years into 
  the war, we'd finished all the<br/>NVN TACAN missions, and were now either 
  supporting infantry units with comm, or<br/>doing missions along the HCM Trail 
  for the intel guys. One of my guys, Terry,<br/>was from a very small town in 
  Idaho where he had a wife, young son, Mom, Dad,<br/>and a little brother. In 
  fact, he was my only married troop.<br/><br/>When we were on bases prepping for 
  a mission, we wore regular fatigues, didn't<br/>have to carry our rifles, and 
  like everyone else, had baseball caps with our<br/>unit name embroidered on the 
  front. Ours were black, and I'm wearing one in the<br/>photo [our name led to 
  the nickname "1st MOB" which was sort of cool]. Terry<br/>had sent two of them 
  home for his son and brother and the whole town adopted us.<br/>Their first 
  package arrived just as we were starting a 60-day mission in the NW<br/>of RVN 
  on the border with Laos. We were refueled and resupplied weekly 
  by<br/>helicopter, and each time they dropped off a mail sack, there'd be a 
  town<br/>package in it.<br/><br/>Each package would have snacks, candy, games, 
  magazines, the little newspaper<br/>for Terry, and letters for each of us . 
  each time your letter would be written<br/>by a different family in town. 
  Everything was packed in pop corn which we ate<br/>too. Like most of our 
  missions, we were alone on this one, and the packages<br/>really meant a lot to 
  us. The people talked to us like we were theirs, and the<br/>letters almost 
  always would have a family photo, usually decorated by the kids<br/>in the 
  picture. They usually had kids' drawings and the like as well.<br/><br/>About a 
  month into the mission, the refueling A/C arrived and dropped off<br/>another 
  mail sack. It had the usual package from the town which had the 
  normal<br/>stuff and letters. But in addition, there was a large envelope. In 
  the<br/>envelope was an 8x10 photo. It had been taken in front of the bleachers 
  on the<br/>ball field at the school. Terry's wife was seated in the center of 
  the front<br/>row holding their son. His Mom, Dad, and Brother were seated on 
  one side of<br/>her. On her other side was a sign that said "TERRY." The rest 
  of the front row<br/>had signs with our names or nicknames on them. The entire 
  town was seated<br/>behind, and everyone in the photo, including babies and two 
  dogs, were wearing<br/>our black hats.<br/><br/>James, we had probably 30 or more 
  combat missions under our belts by this time.<br/>In addition to the two Airmen 
  I told you about, I had also lost one of my<br/>Soldiers and one of my Marines 
  by this time. We were sort of hardened; I had<br/>been told more than once that 
  we were a bit fatalistic; our humor tended to be<br/>fairly dark; and, with the 
  occasional harassment we were getting, we were fairly<br/>jumpy. Despite all 
  that, the photo put all 23 of us in tears. It was like a<br/>huge hug from 
  across the Pacific. The feeling of "belonging" and that these<br/>people really 
  did care about us was overwhelming.<br/><br/>We had been sort of rotating the 
  "write back" duties. We had nothing material<br/>to send to them, but we did 
  have an AF Polaroid camera and some film. We took a<br/>group photo with the 
  timer, but it was disappointing . the print was fairly<br/>small, you couldn't 
  really see our faces with our gear on, and we didn't really<br/>dare take it 
  off. We didn't have enough film for individual pictures so we took<br/>them in 
  pairs. Everyone wrote a letter to the town, and we sent the whole thing<br/>to 
  our COC who mailed it for us. About the end of the mission, we heard 
  that<br/>they had gotten our package, and had put the photos and our letters 
  into a<br/>little display in the Town Hall where they had some historical 
  things.<br/><br/>Terry was subsequently injured and ended up in the AF hospital 
  at Lackland AFB<br/>in San Antonio. We sort of figured that would end the 
  package stream, but when<br/>the town said we were "adopted," they really meant 
  it and every week to ten<br/>days, we'd get the package. When supporting the 
  infantry, we shared the stuff<br/>of course, and the guys were really stunned 
  at how much support we got. We all<br/>knew by this time that the war was 
  hugely unpopular at home, and I can't believe<br/>that everyone in the town 
  felt good about it, but they really had made the<br/>separation between the war 
  and the warriors. I finally wrote to them and told<br/>them we had received a 
  rotation date and would be coming home soon. We got one<br/>more package from 
  them with an invitation to all of us to visit, and thanking us<br/>for our 
  service. The photo is Terry earlier at a new base being built. 
  Our<br/>Commander had given the mission to us as a stand-down for about a 
  month.<br/>Years later, like 1989 maybe, I was an engineer working for a 
  defense<br/>contractor, and I had occasion to go to Idaho Falls for a couple 
  days of project<br/>meetings with one of our sub-contractors. I realized I was 
  close to the town<br/>and might not get another chance, so I called the office, 
  told them I was taking<br/>another day, and drove up after my meetings. I found 
  the town . it looked<br/>pretty much as I had imagined it from Terry's 
  descriptions. Terry and his<br/>family were long gone of course, but I found 
  the Town Hall, on a town square<br/>which was a park. And inside, in a corner, 
  I found the display. They had<br/>enlarged our group photo to 8x10 [pretty 
  grainy], and it was next to theirs.<br/>Our others were arranged around them, 
  and our letters were in plastic protectors<br/>in a loose leaf 
  binder.<br/><br/>Seeing their photo was an instant transport in time and space 
  for me, and I<br/>didn't hold things together much better than when I first saw 
  it. That same<br/>feeling of belonging came over me and I'm not sure how long I 
  stood there<br/>looking at it. I lost two more of my Airmen after that mission, 
  and seeing<br/>their faces in the photos was both really great and really 
  tough. I leafed<br/>through the binder and found my letter.<br/>About this time, 
  a fairly elderly woman came up behind me and asked if I'd like<br/>to hear the 
  whole story behind the display. She startled me [I was still 10,000<br/>miles 
  and 20 years away], and with my usual social ineptness, I blurted out, 
  "I<br/>know the story ma'am, I'm Skip, that's me with TJ in that photo, and I 
  wrote<br/>this letter." At this point she had her heart attack. Well . not 
  quite, but<br/>she did a pretty good impression of one. She made me promise not 
  to move, and<br/>disappeared through one of the doors.<br/><br/>Very shortly, the 
  5 or 6 people who worked in the Town Hall came out and met me.<br/>I tried to 
  thank them but it was really difficult to find the right words. 
  News<br/>apparently travels fast in a small town because within minutes, people 
  were<br/>streaming into the building. Some were older than me and were the 
  people who<br/>had written all those letters and packed the packages. Some were 
  younger than<br/>me and were the kids in all those family photos we got. Lots 
  of hugs,<br/>introductions, and me trying to thank them repeatedly. The school 
  was a block<br/>away, it let out, and the kids began streaming through the 
  door. Kodak stock<br/>probably doubled that day with all the pictures being 
  taken. I finally had to<br/>leave to catch my flight. I did my best but I don't 
  think I really succeeded in<br/>explaining to them the impact their support had 
  for me and my guys. At least I<br/>got to try. They all just kept telling me 
  that we had already thanked them with<br/>our service. Two others have made it 
  there, had a similar experience, and also<br/>believe they failed to adequately 
  thank them. They too got the same . "You've<br/>already thanked us with your 
  service."<br/><br/>Terry recovered, remained in the AF, and retired as an E-8. 
  They had another<br/>boy, and finally settled in FL where until recently, he 
  was in real estate<br/>development. They are grandparents to a half-dozen, and, 
  thanks to Brent's kids<br/>[Brent was the kid on his Mom's lap in the photo] 
  will become great grandparents<br/>about the same time we do this summer. Brent 
  enlisted in the AF [after Vietnam,<br/>thank God!], served 22 years and also 
  retired as an E-8. Brent got a degree in<br/>computer science on the GI Bill 
  and is currently working in North Carolina in<br/>the "Research Triangle" area. 
  His brother Mike became a Marine, served four<br/>years, also got a degree on 
  the GI Bill, and is currently in law enforcement in<br/>Alabama. As may be 
  obvious, we are in fairly close contact, now thanks to<br/>email.<br/><br/>So 
  James, take two things away from this story: I know, better than 
  nearly<br/>everyone, what it means to get support from American strangers when 
  you're in<br/>combat; and, just like the folks in that little town, you thank 
  us every day<br/>with your service to our Nation . far more thanks than we 
  deserve.<br/><br/>Stay safe James. You and your comrades are truly awesome! 
  Heroes are hard to<br/>find these days, but we're pretty lucky . we've got a 
  number of them and you're<br/>one.<br/><br/>There you have it. What a wonderful 
  person. Not because he adopted my son who<br/>is also a ham operator. But 
  because my son is one of a number of soldiers he<br/>adopted.<br/><br/>I can 
  think of no other words to add. Hope you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Mike -

Lots of hugs,<br/>introductions, and me trying to thank them repeatedly. The school was a block<br/>away, it let out, and the kids began streaming through the door. Kodak stock<br/>probably doubled that day with all the pictures being taken. I finally had to<br/>leave to catch my flight. I did my best but I don't think I really succeeded in<br/>explaining to them the impact their support had for me and my guys. At least I<br/>got to try. They all just kept telling me that we had already thanked them with<br/>our
 service. Two others have made it there, had a similar experience, and also<br/>believe they failed to adequately thank them. They too got the same . "You've<br/>already thanked us with your service."<br/><br/>Terry recovered, remained in the AF, and retired as an E-8. They had another<br/>boy, and finally settled in FL where until recently, he was in real estate<br/>development. They are grandparents to a half-dozen, and, thanks to Brent's kids<br/>[Brent was the kid on his Mom's lap in the photo] will become great grandparents<br/>about the same time we do this summer. Brent enlisted in the AF [after Vietnam,<br/>thank God!], served 22 years and also retired as an E-8. Brent got a degree in<br/>computer science on the GI Bill and is currently working in North Carolina in<br/>the "Research Triangle" area. His brother Mike became a Marine, served four<br/>years, also got a degree on the GI Bill, and is currently in law enforcement in<br/>Alabama. As may be obvious, we are in fairly
 close contact, now thanks to<br/>email.<br/><br/>So James, take two things away from this story: I know, better than nearly<br/>everyone, what it means to get support from American strangers when you're in<br/>combat; and, just like the folks in that little town, you thank us every day<br/>with your service to our Nation . far more thanks than we deserve.<br/><br/>Stay safe James. You and your comrades are truly awesome! Heroes are hard to<br/>find these days, but we're pretty lucky . we've got a number of them and you're<br/>one.<br/><br/>There you have it. What a wonderful person. Not because he adopted my son who<br/>is also a ham operator. But because my son is one of a number of soldiers he<br/>adopted.<br/><br/>I can think of no other words to add.

Delete it if you are not interested.<br/>But this may show you what a simple word of thanks may mean to a soldier.<br/><br/>This dude was in
 the Air Force in Viet Nam. But he wasn't your typical<br/>wing-nut. He was jump-qualified, and spent a whole lot of time in Indian<br/>country setting up navigation beacons for the arc-light missions and other<br/>stuff. He saw the elephant so to speak.<br/><br/>He is now retired, a ham operator in CA. He has adopted a number of soldiers by<br/>daily flying a flag in their honor, and sending them a goodie box every few<br/>weeks. My son is one of them.<br/><br/>Here is the story he shared with my son in a letter inside a package.. He<br/>always sends me a copy. On a recent trip home he was chatting with his wife<br/>about "their soldiers".<br/><br/>In his own words......<br/><br/>On the trip home, we were talking about our troops and how to convince them that<br/>their service is their gift to us, and she suggested my Idaho story. We'll give<br/>it a try and hopefully you'll understand. It too takes place in combat but is<br/>not a combat story. We were about 2 years into the war, we'd
 finished all the<br/>NVN TACAN missions, and were now either supporting infantry units with comm, or<br/>doing missions along the HCM Trail for the intel guys. One of my guys, Terry,<br/>was from a very small town in Idaho where he had a wife, young son, Mom, Dad,<br/>and a little brother. In fact, he was my only married troop.<br/><br/>When we were on bases prepping for a mission, we wore regular fatigues, didn't<br/>have to carry our rifles, and like everyone else, had baseball caps with our<br/>unit name embroidered on the front. Ours were black, and I'm wearing one in the<br/>photo [our name led to the nickname "1st MOB" which was sort of cool]. Terry<br/>had sent two of them home for his son and brother and the whole town adopted us.<br/>Their first package arrived just as we were starting a 60-day mission in the NW<br/>of RVN on the border with Laos. We were refueled and resupplied weekly by<br/>helicopter, and each time they dropped off a mail sack, there'd be a town<br/>package
 in it.<br/><br/>Each package would have snacks, candy, games, magazines, the little newspaper<br/>for Terry, and letters for each of us . each time your letter would be written<br/>by a different family in town. Everything was packed in pop corn which we ate<br/>too. Like most of our missions, we were alone on this one, and the packages<br/>really meant a lot to us. The people talked to us like we were theirs, and the<br/>letters almost always would have a family photo, usually decorated by the kids<br/>in the picture. They usually had kids' drawings and the like as well.<br/><br/>About a month into the mission, the refueling A/C arrived and dropped off<br/>another mail sack. It had the usual package from the town which had the normal<br/>stuff and letters. But in addition, there was a large envelope. In the<br/>envelope was an 8x10 photo. It had been taken in front of the bleachers on the<br/>ball field at the school. Terry's wife was seated in the center of the front<br/>row holding
 their son. His Mom, Dad, and Brother were seated on one side of<br/>her. On her other side was a sign that said "TERRY." The rest of the front row<br/>had signs with our names or nicknames on them. The entire town was seated<br/>behind, and everyone in the photo, including babies and two dogs, were wearing<br/>our black hats.<br/><br/>James, we had probably 30 or more combat missions under our belts by this time.<br/>In addition to the two Airmen I told you about, I had also lost one of my<br/>Soldiers and one of my Marines by this time. We were sort of hardened; I had<br/>been told more than once that we were a bit fatalistic; our humor tended to be<br/>fairly dark; and, with the occasional harassment we were getting, we were fairly<br/>jumpy. Despite all that, the photo put all 23 of us in tears. It was like a<br/>huge hug from across the Pacific. The feeling of "belonging" and that these<br/>people really did care about us was overwhelming.<br/><br/>We had been sort of rotating the
 "write back" duties. We had nothing material<br/>to send to them, but we did have an AF Polaroid camera and some film. We took a<br/>group photo with the timer, but it was disappointing . the print was fairly<br/>small, you couldn't really see our faces with our gear on, and we didn't really<br/>dare take it off. We didn't have enough film for individual pictures so we took<br/>them in pairs. Everyone wrote a letter to the town, and we sent the whole thing<br/>to our COC who mailed it for us. About the end of the mission, we heard that<br/>they had gotten our package, and had put the photos and our letters into a<br/>little display in the Town Hall where they had some historical things.<br/><br/>Terry was subsequently injured and ended up in the AF hospital at Lackland AFB<br/>in San Antonio. We sort of figured that would end the package stream, but when<br/>the town said we were "adopted," they really meant it and every week to ten<br/>days, we'd get the package. When supporting the
 infantry, we shared the stuff<br/>of course, and the guys were really stunned at how much support we got. We all<br/>knew by this time that the war was hugely unpopular at home, and I can't believe<br/>that everyone in the town felt good about it, but they really had made the<br/>separation between the war and the warriors. I finally wrote to them and told<br/>them we had received a rotation date and would be coming home soon. We got one<br/>more package from them with an invitation to all of us to visit, and thanking us<br/>for our service. The photo is Terry earlier at a new base being built. Our<br/>Commander had given the mission to us as a stand-down for about a month.<br/>Years later, like 1989 maybe, I was an engineer working for a defense<br/>contractor, and I had occasion to go to Idaho Falls for a couple days of project<br/>meetings with one of our sub-contractors. I realized I was close to the town<br/>and might not get another chance, so I called the office, told them I
 was taking<br/>another day, and drove up after my meetings. I found the town . it looked<br/>pretty much as I had imagined it from Terry's descriptions. Terry and his<br/>family were long gone of course, but I found the Town Hall, on a town square<br/>which was a park. And inside, in a corner, I found the display. They had<br/>enlarged our group photo to 8x10 [pretty grainy], and it was next to theirs.<br/>Our others were arranged around them, and our letters were in plastic protectors<br/>in a loose leaf binder.<br/><br/>Seeing their photo was an instant transport in time and space for me, and I<br/>didn't hold things together much better than when I first saw it. That same<br/>feeling of belonging came over me and I'm not sure how long I stood there<br/>looking at it. I lost two more of my Airmen after that mission, and seeing<br/>their faces in the photos was both really great and really tough. I leafed<br/>through the binder and found my letter.<br/>About this time, a fairly elderly
 woman came up behind me and asked if I'd like<br/>to hear the whole story behind the display. She startled me [I was still 10,000<br/>miles and 20 years away], and with my usual social ineptness, I blurted out, "I<br/>know the story ma'am, I'm Skip, that's me with TJ in that photo, and I wrote<br/>this letter." At this point she had her heart attack. Well . not quite, but<br/>she did a pretty good impression of one. She made me promise not to move, and<br/>disappeared through one of the doors.<br/><br/>Very shortly, the 5 or 6 people who worked in the Town Hall came out and met me.<br/>I tried to thank them but it was really difficult to find the right words. News<br/>apparently travels fast in a small town because within minutes, people were<br/>streaming into the building. Some were older than me and were the people who<br/>had written all those letters and packed the packages. Some were younger than<br/>me and were the kids in all those family photos we got. Lots of
 hugs,<br/>introductions, and me trying to thank them repeatedly. The school was a block<br/>away, it let out, and the kids began streaming through the door. Kodak stock<br/>probably doubled that day with all the pictures being taken. I finally had to<br/>leave to catch my flight. I did my best but I don't think I really succeeded in<br/>explaining to them the impact their support had for me and my guys. At least I<br/>got to try.

Two others have made it there, had a similar experience, and also<br/>believe they failed to adequately thank them. They too got the same .

      wasn't your typical<br/>wing-nut. He was jump-qualified, and spent a whole 
      lot of time in Indian<br/>country setting up navigation beacons for the 
      arc-light missions and other<br/>stuff. He saw the elephant so to 
      speak.<br/><br/>He is now retired, a ham operator in CA. He has adopted a 
      number of soldiers by<br/>daily flying a flag in their honor, and sending 
      them a goodie box every few<br/>weeks. My son is one of them.<br/><br/>Here 
      is the story he shared with my son in a letter inside a package.. 
      He<br/>always sends me a copy. On a recent trip home he was chatting with 
      his wife<br/>about "their soldiers".<br/><br/>In his own 
      words......<br/><br/>On the trip home, we were talking about our troops and 
      how to convince them that<br/>their service is their gift to us, and she 
      suggested my Idaho story. We'll give<br/>it a try and hopefully you'll 
      understand. It too takes place in combat but is<br/>not a combat story. We 
      were about 2 years into the war, we'd finished all the<br/>NVN TACAN 
      missions, and were now either supporting infantry units with comm, 
      or<br/>doing missions along the HCM Trail for the intel guys. One of my 
      guys, Terry,<br/>was from a very small town in Idaho where he had a wife, 
      young son, Mom, Dad,<br/>and a little brother. In fact, he was my only 
      married troop.<br/><br/>When we were on bases prepping for a mission, we 
      wore regular fatigues, didn't<br/>have to carry our rifles, and like 
      everyone else, had baseball caps with our<br/>unit name embroidered on the 
      front. Ours were black, and I'm wearing one in the<br/>photo [our name led 
      to the nickname "1st MOB" which was sort of cool]. Terry<br/>had sent two 
      of them home for his son and brother and the whole town adopted 
      us.<br/>Their first package arrived just as we were starting a 60-day 
      mission in the NW<br/>of RVN on the border with Laos. We were refueled and 
      resupplied weekly by<br/>helicopter, and each time they dropped off a mail 
      sack, there'd be a town<br/>package in it.<br/><br/>Each package would have 
      snacks, candy, games, magazines, the little newspaper<br/>for Terry, and 
      letters for each of us . each time your letter would be written<br/>by a 
      different family in town. Everything was packed in pop corn which we 
      ate<br/>too. Like most of our missions, we were alone on this one, and the 
      packages<br/>really meant a lot to us. The people talked to us like we were 
      theirs, and the<br/>letters almost always would have a family photo, 
      usually decorated by the kids<br/>in the picture. They usually had kids' 
      drawings and the like as well.<br/><br/>About a month into the mission, the 
      refueling A/C arrived and dropped off<br/>another mail sack. It had the 
      usual package from the town which had the normal<br/>stuff and letters. But 
      in addition, there was a large envelope. In the<br/>envelope was an 8x10 
      photo. It had been taken in front of the bleachers on the<br/>ball field at 
      the school. Terry's wife was seated in the center of the front<br/>row 
      holding their son. His Mom, Dad, and Brother were seated on one side 
      of<br/>her. On her other side was a sign that said "TERRY." The rest of the 
      front row<br/>had signs with our names or nicknames on them. The entire 
      town was seated<br/>behind, and everyone in the photo, including babies and 
      two dogs, were wearing<br/>our black hats.<br/><br/>James, we had probably 30 
      or more combat missions under our belts by this time.<br/>In addition to 
      the two Airmen I told you about, I had also lost one of my<br/>Soldiers and 
      one of my Marines by this time. We were sort of hardened; I had<br/>been 
      told more than once that we were a bit fatalistic; our humor tended to 
      be<br/>fairly dark; and, with the occasional harassment we were getting, we 
      were fairly<br/>jumpy. Despite all that, the photo put all 23 of us in 
      tears. It was like a<br/>huge hug from across the Pacific. The feeling of 
      "belonging" and that these<br/>people really did care about us was 
      overwhelming.<br/><br/>We had been sort of rotating the "write back" duties. 
      We had nothing material<br/>to send to them, but we did have an AF Polaroid 
      camera and some film. We took a<br/>group photo with the timer, but it was 
      disappointing . the print was fairly<br/>small, you couldn't really see our 
      faces with our gear on, and we didn't really<br/>dare take it off. We 
      didn't have enough film for individual pictures so we took<br/>them in 
      pairs. Everyone wrote a letter to the town, and we sent the whole 
      thing<br/>to our COC who mailed it for us. About the end of the mission, we 
      heard that<br/>they had gotten our package, and had put the photos and our 
      letters into a<br/>little display in the Town Hall where they had some 
      historical things.<br/><br/>Terry was subsequently injured and ended up in 
      the AF hospital at Lackland AFB<br/>in San Antonio. We sort of figured that 
      would end the package stream, but when<br/>the town said we were "adopted," 
      they really meant it and every week to ten<br/>days, we'd get the package. 
      When supporting the infantry, we shared the stuff<br/>of course, and the 
      guys were really stunned at how much support we got. We all<br/>knew by 
      this time that the war was hugely unpopular at home, and I can't 
      believe<br/>that everyone in the town felt good about it, but they really 
      had made the<br/>separation between the war and the warriors. I finally 
      wrote to them and told<br/>them we had received a rotation date and would 
      be coming home soon. We got one<br/>more package from them with an 
      invitation to all of us to visit, and thanking us<br/>for our service. The 
      photo is Terry earlier at a new base being built. Our<br/>Commander had 
      given the mission to us as a stand-down for about a month.<br/>Years later, 
      like 1989 maybe, I was an engineer working for a defense<br/>contractor, 
      and I had occasion to go to Idaho Falls for a couple days of 
      project<br/>meetings with one of our sub-contractors. I realized I was 
      close to the town<br/>and might not get another chance, so I called the 
      office, told them I was taking<br/>another day, and drove up after my 
      meetings. I found the town . it looked<br/>pretty much as I had imagined it 
      from Terry's descriptions. Terry and his<br/>family were long gone of 
      course, but I found the Town Hall, on a town square<br/>which was a park. 
      And inside, in a corner, I found the display. They had<br/>enlarged our 
      group photo to 8x10 [pretty grainy], and it was next to theirs.<br/>Our 
      others were arranged around them, and our letters were in plastic 
      protectors<br/>in a loose leaf binder.<br/><br/>Seeing their photo was an 
      instant transport in time and space for me, and I<br/>didn't hold things 
      together much better than when I first saw it. That same<br/>feeling of 
      belonging came over me and I'm not sure how long I stood there<br/>looking 
      at it. I lost two more of my Airmen after that mission, and 
      seeing<br/>their faces in the photos was both really great and really 
      tough. I leafed<br/>through the binder and found my letter.<br/>About this 
      time, a fairly elderly woman came up behind me and asked if I'd like<br/>to 
      hear the whole story behind the display. She startled me [I was still 
      10,000<br/>miles and 20 years away], and with my usual social ineptness, I 
      blurted out, "I<br/>know the story ma'am, I'm Skip, that's me with TJ in 
      that photo, and I wrote<br/>this letter." At this point she had her heart 
      attack. Well . not quite, but<br/>she did a pretty good impression of one. 
      She made me promise not to move, and<br/>disappeared through one of the 
      doors.<br/><br/>Very shortly, the 5 or 6 people who worked in the Town Hall 
      came out and met me.<br/>I tried to thank them but it was really difficult 
      to find the right words. News<br/>apparently travels fast in a small town 
      because within minutes, people were<br/>streaming into the building. Some 
      were older than me and were the people who<br/>had written all those 
      letters and packed the packages. Some were younger than<br/>me and were the 
      kids in all those family photos we got. Lots of hugs,<br/>introductions, 
      and me trying to thank them repeatedly. The school was a block<br/>away, it 
      let out, and the kids began streaming through the door. Kodak 
      stock<br/>probably doubled that day with all the pictures being taken. I 
      finally had to<br/>leave to catch my flight. I did my best but I don't 
      think I really succeeded in<br/>explaining to them the impact their support 
      had for me and my guys. At least I<br/>got to try. They all just kept 
      telling me that we had already thanked them with<br/>our service. Two 
      others have made it there, had a similar experience, and also<br/>believe 
      they failed to adequately thank them. They too got the same . 
      "You've<br/>already thanked us with your service."<br/><br/>Terry recovered, 
      remained in the AF, and retired as an E-8. They had another<br/>boy, and 
      finally settled in FL where until recently, he was in real 
      estate<br/>development. They are grandparents to a half-dozen, and, thanks 
      to Brent's kids<br/>[Brent was the kid on his Mom's lap in the photo] will 
      become great grandparents<br/>about the same time we do this summer. Brent 
      enlisted in the AF [after Vietnam,<br/>thank God!], served 22 years and 
      also retired as an E-8. Brent got a degree in<br/>computer science on the 
      GI Bill and is currently working in North Carolina in<br/>the "Research 
      Triangle" area. His brother Mike became a Marine, served four<br/>years, 
      also got a degree on the GI Bill, and is currently in law enforcement 
      in<br/>Alabama. As may be obvious, we are in fairly close contact, now 
      thanks to<br/>email.<br/><br/>So James, take two things away from this story: 
      I know, better than nearly<br/>everyone, what it means to get support from 
      American strangers when you're in<br/>combat; and, just like the folks in 
      that little town, you thank us every day<br/>with your service to our 
      Nation . far more thanks than we deserve.<br/><br/>Stay safe James. You and 
      your comrades are truly awesome! Heroes are hard to<br/>find these days, 
      but we're pretty lucky . we've got a number of them and 
      you're<br/>one.<br/><br/>There you have it. What a wonderful person. Not 
      because he adopted my son who<br/>is also a ham operator. But because my 
      son is one of a number of soldiers he<br/>adopted.<br/><br/>I can think of no 
      other words to add. Hope you enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Mike - KD9KC.<br/>El Paso,
