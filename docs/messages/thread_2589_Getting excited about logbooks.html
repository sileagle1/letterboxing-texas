                    <html><body><div>My dear-friend-who-drags-me-in-to-everything-she-does and I went shopping today for letterboxing stuff for the Cub Scout event coming up in April.  We bought bunches of stamp pads, but even better, we shopped PAPER!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For ease of talking about her (because dear-friend-who-drags-me-in-to-everything-she-does is simply too long, even if I initialize it), I will call her by what will be her trailname if I ever get her into letterboxing - She Who Reads.  That's her name under some other venue, and she has promised me she won't consider using anything else.  So she is - She Who Reads.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hobby Lobby is a wondrous place.  We walked in the store and the air seemed fresher and the light a little brighter.  Of course, it could've been the powder fresh scented air freshener that squirted just as we walked in, and the lack of lampshades on the nearby display of lamps, but I prefer to think of it as fresher and brighter.  I LOVE that place!
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I had not ever shopped paper there before, but I am now thoroughly enthused about the potential for making cool logbooks!  We are going to stay fairly simple, but we are going to use Mat Paper for the backs of the book, a nice grade of cardstock - no gloss - for the pages, and a lightly textured colored cardstock for the front cover.  Probably going to use a comb binder to punch holes, then let the boys weave through the holes using hemp, then decorate the covers with natural material.  So many ideas - and what a springboard for starting to make my own books!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She Who Reads shamelessly pulled me in on this event by making letterboxing the vehicle for teaching other things to the boys, but she's starting to perk her ears up to it herself!   Hehe...<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Personally I'm getting a little nervous about logbooks!  Since I've <br>
committed to demonstrating how to make a logbook at the gathering... <br>
which is only two weeks away... gulp!... I'm getting a little <br>
anxious.  Trying to put together instructions is not as easy as I'd <br>
imagined.  It's kind of like my DH who can find his way home easily <br>
enough, but can't give directions on how to reach our house, even <br>
though we've lived here for 20 years.<br>
<br>
On a different note, we had a wonderful letterboxing day.  The <br>
weather was beautiful - warm in the sun, cool in the shade.  We went <br>
to Brazos Bend State Park and found several letterboxes from the <br>
March '05 gathering.  If you've never been letterboxing there, I <br>
highly recommend it!  The boxes displayed the wonderful creativity <br>
I've come to expect from Texas Letterboxers.  The teens were excited <br>
to see 3 alligators up close.  I got a kick out of looking through <br>
the logbook in a box that has been in place for couple years and <br>
seeing then "Mother of Four" had stamped in (seems the singing <br>
letterboxing baby hadn't yet made her appearance at that time!).  We <br>
finished off the day with SoccerChik planting her first ever <br>
letterbox, Wish Upon a Star (see AQ for clues).  Her idea, her <br>
carving, her hand-made logbook, her choice of location, her clues.  <br>
Makes a letterboxing Momma very proud!<br>

I am a sucker for all things paper.  Always have been.  I collect<br>
ephemera from the past.  I hoard different kinds of paper.  I am a<br>
sucker for any kind of paper grab bag (sure, I'll find a use for it<br>
someday!) Unfortunately, I am lacking an art room, so I make do with a<br>
craft closet (with spillouts into the rest of the house).  <br>
<br>
However, I am also the one who can come up with 5 crafts & games for<br>
the kindergarten Valentine party with just the stuff in my house.  <br>

<div>Brazos Bend is one of those parks that Lightning and I have visited, but Fearless Fox has not.  Those parks are rareties indeed!  We had a great time at that gathering and letterboxing there.  That's the gathering we got flooded out of our tent at (search archives for THAT story) and our shoes were horribly soaked as a result.  We were determined to box just a little more Sunday morning so we sloshed around for a couple of hours, scaring off alligators all morning, until we couldn't take the shoe thing anymore and headed on home.  Our shoes never fully recovered, nor did the tent that let us down (and I still morn the exit of that tent - it was a good one right up until that night).  Did y'all go to the observatory?

<p>Personally I'm getting a little nervous about logbooks! Since I've <br/>committed to demonstrating how to make a logbook at the gathering... <br/>which is only two weeks away... gulp!... I'm getting a little 
<br/>anxious. Trying to put together instructions is not as easy as I'd <br/>imagined. It's kind of like my DH who can find his way home easily <br/>enough, but can't give directions on how to reach our house, even 
<br/>though we've lived here for 20 years.<br/><br/>On a different note, we had a wonderful letterboxing day. The <br/>weather was beautiful - warm in the sun, cool in the shade. We went <br/>to Brazos Bend State Park and found several letterboxes from the 
<br/>March '05 gathering. If you've never been letterboxing there, I <br/>highly recommend it! The boxes displayed the wonderful creativity <br/>I've come to expect from Texas Letterboxers. The teens were excited 
<br/>to see 3 alligators up close. I got a kick out of looking through <br/>the logbook in a box that has been in place for couple years and <br/>seeing then "Mother of Four" had stamped in (seems the singing <br/>letterboxing baby hadn't yet made her appearance at that time!). We 
<br/>finished off the day with SoccerChik planting her first ever <br/>letterbox, Wish Upon a Star (see AQ for clues). Her idea, her <br/>carving, her hand-made logbook, her choice of location, her clues. <br/>Makes a letterboxing Momma very proud!

</p><div>Y'all are making me laugh so much with this discussion.  And speaking my language.  I don't think M05 or Dewberry made it downstairs to the art room in the basement.  But basically...ok, I'm not saying.  Last week, I did go to Michael's with my 40% coupon in hand intent on getting a set of Marvy's as mine exited the building at the gathering.  However, that wonderful Fiskar's papercutter is on closeout (and I can't stand the new designs - too flimsy) and well, the 40% off coupon fine print does not exclude closeout.  Now, I have a back up.  Circle cutters?  Got several different types!  Paper cutters?  No prob!  Binding machine?  Got 'cha covered!  lololol.  Everything cropper hopper made?  probably in the art room.  With spares.

<div><font size="2">Yet another reason I need a new house! When I had my graphic design business, I always wanted an oak architect's file to keep my artwork in. I searched for years, but the cheapest ones I could ever find (oak or metal) was well over a couple hundred dollars - used, and many were close to a thousand. After I moved to Connecticut and had my antique business, I spent many hours wandering through resale shops, etc. One day while cruising the aisles of my favorite Goodwill, I stumbled upon a gorgeous huge, oak, five drawer architect's flat file in perfect condition for $25. It was so big and heavy, we had to go home first and take the seat out of the Jeep and the top off just to get it home, and it took two big men to lift it. Right now, it's sitting out in my garage just waiting for a space to put it. I can't wait to get it IN the house and organize my art, paper, etc in it.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I also found a music file (narrow open cabinet with about 12 slots) which was in "not so good" condition at a garage sale for $7. I brought it home and added legs, fixed it up, painted it and use it to hold my shallow baskets of paints, canvas, palettes, etc. Love it! I need to put casters on it so I can easily roll it around beside my easel (but I've been meaning to do that for at least four years).</font></div>
