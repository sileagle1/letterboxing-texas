I have one box that I would say is "high risk" of<br/>
being cleaned up.  I am going to go check on it one<br/>
more time before I post the clues.  It's a really cool<br/>
stamp, and I would hate to see it go missing.  <br/>
<br/>
I wonder, do you keep your original artwork for your<br/>
stamps?  I keep my final artwork and tape it to an<br/>
index card and put into a ziploc baggie.  If I ever<br/>
need to re-do one, I'll have it - now whether I could<br/>
re-do it as well is another question.<br/>
