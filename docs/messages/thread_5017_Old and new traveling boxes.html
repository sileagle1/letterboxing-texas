<p>I guess great minds think alike. We were just talking this morning about the 
retirement of the Circus and starting a new traveling box. My idea, since we 
have had a bus and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield 
Overland Mail. But I like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging 
raging bulls. Would Bell Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show? 
If the circus is making a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no 
reason that the Rodeo couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is 
there? The Circus has been around for over three years so that's not a bad run. 
I have a couple of observations about the traveling boxes. The first is that, in 
my opinion, there should be a size limit for the stamps. There are some really 
large Circus stamps and that just makes the box fill up faster. I know there 
were some published rules or guidelines for the first two buses, such as prompt 
notification when a box is found so that folks won't travel a great distance 
only to find that the box has already been picked up. I was considering a trip 
when Bell Motel reported her find, and I appreciated the notification, but that 
hasn't always been the case, so maybe we should revisit the rules. I know the 
traveling boxes have owners, but I think all of us feel like partial owners and 
feel the responsibility of ownership. One other point, and I'd like to hear 
other opinions on this, is that the first two boxes counted as one find for 
every stamp, so you could really pad your find stats by finding the box. I think 
that generated a lot of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way 
to grab the box. For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one 
find. That's a lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/><br/>Boots Tex

I suppose if we could make a rule that the box has to be handed off to a member of this group - not mailed and not hidden - and that the person receiving must post a message here to say they have received it, it would work fine. That way the person who makes the hand-off knows who they gave it to and the person receiving it has to acknowledge that they got it. <br/>
<br/>The other thing that occurred to me was having several regional gatherings for the specific purpose of stamping the Traveling Boxes. They could be UPS'd between the keeper (Baby Bear) and the regional host. BUT - I wouldn't want Baby Bear to get stuck with all those UPS charges, so we would have to work out a way for him not to "bear" the burden. Just an idea...<br/>

The original container for the Circus was very full when I got it. Every stamp was in it's OWN Zip-loc AND wrapped in cloth or some other custom wrapping. 42 such stamps take up a lot of room. Perhaps the stamps could be repackaged somewhat to reduce space.<br>
<br>
Because the original container was so full, I moved all the contents into a 2.5 gallon pail from Lowe's which I then camo'ed with spray paint. I still have the original container. In fact it was in the Jeep when the Circus went missing. Apparently the Jackal didn't want it. Anyway, the CURRENT container was approximately 2/3 full when I last saw it so the potential is there for further additions without fear of overflowing.<br>
<br>
The former container is available if someone wishes to start a new traveler.  Perhaps the new box could be declared a sort of cootie in that it can only be passed directly from one letterboxer to another rather than hidden or mailed.<br>
<br>
I feel that people should be free to count finds any way they choose. That being said, at least amongst the boxers who regularly contribute to the AltasQuest forums the consensus seems to be that you should count letterboxes found, not stamps found.<br>
<br>

<p>Good ideas.  I'd also like to give kudos to The Jackal, dastardly fellow that he is, for his creative clues and for opening my eyes to the great looking trails wherein lies his hidden den.  There's a 16 mile long trail there that needs a few letterboxes.  We've found a couple there, but it's been awhile.  Looks like it deserves a fresh look.  Did everyone figure out the location based on his clues?  I think there was more interest in the Circus box because of his cleverness.<br/>

&gt; Iâ€™d love for us to have a Rodeo and Wild West Show.  Great idea to have a stagecoach.  Also great idea to have established rules and guidelines.  When a traveling box is planted, I think it would be smart for someone to announce they were going after said box.  Corazon and I were tempted make the drive this weekend, but we werenâ€™t keen on driving all that way and not knowing if we were to be rewarded.  And if we couldnâ€™t find it, is it because we were looking in the wrong place, or had it already been picked up.  Anyway, Iâ€™d like to make that recommendation.</p>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would also like to suggest that the retired boxes still be circulated--from person to person.  I would like to be able to get the Circus from Bell Motel (or whoever has it) and stamp at my leisure instead of frantically stamping them at an event.<br/>

&gt; <br/></div>
&gt; It would be fun to be able to count all the stamps as finds.  I hadnâ€™t thought about that as the reason to get the box.  I just wanted to see all the clever stamps!<div class="im"><br/>

&gt; I guess great minds think alike. We were just talking this morning about the retirement of the Circus and starting a new traveling box. My idea, since we have had a bus and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield Overland Mail. But I like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging raging bulls. Would Bell Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show? If the circus is making a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no reason that the Rodeo couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is there? The Circus has been around for over three years so that's not a bad run. I have a couple of observations about the traveling boxes. The first is that, in my opinion, there should be a size limit for the stamps. There are some really large Circus stamps and that just makes the box fill up faster. I know there were some published rules or guidelines for the first two buses, such as prompt notification when a box is found so that folks won't travel a great distance only to find that the box has already been picked up. I was considering a trip when Bell Motel reported her find, and I appreciated the notification, but that hasn't always been the case, so maybe we should revisit the rules. I know the traveling boxes have owners, but I think all of us feel like partial owners and feel the responsibility of ownership. One other point, and I'd like to hear other opinions on this, is that the first two boxes counted as one find for every stamp, so you could really pad your find stats by finding the box. I think that generated a lot of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way to grab the box. For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one find. That's a lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/>

&gt; &gt; If the TTC has grown too big for its ample box, I think we should make it a TALE Event box like the TTB2 for the same reasons BL states. Since the next TALE is a long way off, I guess the TTC could continue to tour until then with no new players added before being brought to TALE. Since Baby Bear is the owner of the TTC and currently is keeper of TTB2, he should voice his opinion.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We came to the same dilemma a couple of years ago with the second Bus. It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; was so full that the lid would hardly stay on. The decision was to make it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; an event box and a new travelling box was started - the Circus.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I understand that some folks haven't seen the Circus and would love to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their hands on it - the problem I see with allowing it to continue to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rotate is that it almost becomes a liability to get because there is so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; much fabulous artwork and hardwork in it, that when the finder has to go<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out to place it, it is hard to find a place that is secure enough to ensure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it won't be found by anyone besides us, and then all our collective<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; creativity is gone in an instant, much like the first Bus. That, and if it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; is brimming over, the risk of the lid coming loose and the contents<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; scattering become greater. The lid thing is easier to fix - the hiding<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thing is more difficult.<br/>

<p>Good ideas. I'd also like to give kudos to The Jackal, dastardly fellow 
    that he is, for his creative clues and for opening my eyes to the great 
    looking trails wherein lies his hidden den. There's a 16 mile long trail 
    there that needs a few letterboxes. We've found a couple there, but it's 
    been awhile. Looks like it deserves a fresh look. Did everyone figure out 
    the location based on his clues? I think there was more interest in the 
    Circus box because of his cleverness.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com</a>, Bonnie Lind

    Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Re: ttc<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I guess great 
    minds think alike. We were just talking this morning about the retirement of 
    the Circus and starting a new traveling box. My idea, since we have had a 
    bus and a train, was to have a stagecoach, like the Butterfield Overland 
    Mail. But I like the idea of Bozo wearing baggy pants and dodging raging 
    bulls. Would Bell Motel be willing to start the Rodeo and Wild West Show? If 
    the circus is making a farewell tour without new passengers, there's no 
    reason that the Rodeo couldn't have its first performance simultaneously, is 
    there? The Circus has been around for over three years so that's not a bad 
    run. I have a couple of observations about the traveling boxes. The first is 
    that, in my opinion, there should be a size limit for the stamps. There are 
    some really large Circus stamps and that just makes the box fill up faster. 
    I know there were some published rules or guidelines for the first two 
    buses, such as prompt notification when a box is found so that folks won't 
    travel a great distance only to find that the box has already been picked 
    up. I was considering a trip when Bell Motel reported her find, and I 
    appreciated the notification, but that hasn't always been the case, so maybe 
    we should revisit the rules. I know the traveling boxes have owners, but I 
    think all of us feel like partial owners and feel the responsibility of 
    ownership. One other point, and I'd like to hear other opinions on this, is 
    that the first two boxes counted as one find for every stamp, so you could 
    really pad your find stats by finding the box. I think that generated a lot 
    of excitement and was a good reason to go out of your way to grab the box. 
    For the circus box, all of those 42 stamps only count as one find. That's a 
    lot of work for one find. What's your opinion?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots Tex

<p>Since I had the Circus before it was highjacked and Bell Motel hasn't chimed 
in yet, allow me make a few comments.<br/><br/>The original container for the 
Circus was very full when I got it. Every stamp was in it's OWN Zip-loc AND 
wrapped in cloth or some other custom wrapping. 42 such stamps take up a lot of 
room. Perhaps the stamps could be repackaged somewhat to reduce 
space.<br/><br/>Because the original container was so full, I moved all the 
contents into a 2.5 gallon pail from Lowe's which I then camo'ed with spray 
paint. I still have the original container. In fact it was in the Jeep when the 
Circus went missing. Apparently the Jackal didn't want it. Anyway, the CURRENT 
container was approximately 2/3 full when I last saw it so the potential is 
there for further additions without fear of overflowing.<br/><br/>The former 
container is available if someone wishes to start a new traveler. Perhaps the 
new box could be declared a sort of cootie in that it can only be passed 
directly from one letterboxer to another rather than hidden or mailed.<br/><br/>I 
feel that people should be free to count finds any way they choose. That being 
said, at least amongst the boxers who regularly contribute to the AltasQuest 
forums the consensus seems to be that you should count letterboxes found, not 
stamps found.<br/><br/>PI Joe - who is relieved that the Circus is back in good 
hands.<br/><br/></p></div><!-- end group email --></div></div></div></body></html>

this entire thread yet, but if I'm repeating what has already been said, then 
ignore me! (It's really not rude, I ignore myself half the time!). Remember back 
about six years ago when Ruby Tuesday had the birthday box and it would be sent 
to whomever had the next birthday? (That was when we only had about 25 people on 
the list.) Whoever received it was responsible for sending it to the next 
birthday person on the list (postage and insurance and it wasn't cheap but it 
was optional to receive it and soooo worth it!) . It was a box to behold, with 
celebration items, stamps, notes, little fun gifts etc. If you signed up to 
receive the box on your birthday, you assumed the responsibility for the box and 
for getting it mailed to the next person within a few days. Everyone knew who 
had it so it would have been embarrassing not to move it on as required. I 
had just arrived back in Texas from my four years in Connecticut when the box 
came to me, and I felt instantly like I was part of something special - which I 
was! Texas is a big ol' place, so obviously the traveling boxes don't move from 
point A to point B without an effort. I think it might be worth considering 
mailing these boxes so it levels the playing field. With the Birthday 
Celebration box, it would be sent back to Ruby Tuesday occasionally so she could 
do maintenance and restock it with "presents".<br/>Puddle

<p>I'm not saying we have to do it like we always have, but in the past, the 
  heartache with passing the box person to person is much like what happens with 
  postals - they get stuck somewhere never to be seen again (anyone who has done 
  postals knows exactly what I mean). I suppose if we could make a rule 
  that the box has to be handed off to a member of this group - not mailed and 
  not hidden - and that the person receiving must post a message here to say 
  they have received it, it would work fine. That way the person who makes 
  the hand-off knows who they gave it to and the person receiving it has to 
  acknowledge that they got it. <br/><br/>The other thing that occurred to 
  me was having several regional gatherings for the specific purpose of stamping 
  the Traveling Boxes. They could be UPS'd between the keeper (Baby Bear) 
  and the regional host. BUT - I wouldn't want Baby Bear to get stuck with 
  all those UPS charges, so we would have to work out a way for him not to 
  "bear" the burden. Just an idea...<br/><br/>BL<br/><br/><br/></p>
