    The Texas Grill is on TX71, in towards Bastrop and on the west side
    of the Colorado River. The place you are probably thinking of just
    outside of Bastrop State Park is the Roadside Grill.<br/>

If you are coming Friday night PLEASE sign up and give your head count so we can get a somewhat accurate head count for the reservation.   If you do sign up, but find later you can't come please update us.   If your not sure, you can sign up later.  I will give a final reservation date probably in early February.   Thanks!!!<br>
