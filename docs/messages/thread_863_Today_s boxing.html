One in Vidor and one in Orange (TX of course). While searching for the <br>
second box, we were happily greeted by two loving dogs (oh how I LOVE <br>
dogs) who merrily hiked half the trail with us. They only stopped <br>
because the pathway was blocked to our four-legged friends.<br>
<br>
It is so much fun walking around in nature.<br>
Have a wonderful day!<br>
