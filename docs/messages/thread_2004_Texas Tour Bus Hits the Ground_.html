<div> </div>
<div>To get there:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Go to the Davey Dogwood Park in Palestine. To get there, take Loop 256 around Palestine until you get to Link Street, which is also 3309. Turn north on Link/3309 and continue until you see signs pointing left for Davey Dogwood Park. Turn left into the park.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>Continue on the entrance road past the turn on the left for the picnic area.  Ignore that left (it's called _____ Mountain Picnic Area and is just a loop around), but after you pass it bear left at every point until you see the first sign for Anderson County Dogwood Park Road #1.  Follow that sign and continue following signs for Road #1 until you see a sign that says "No buses"  When you see that sign, turn left (unless you are in a bus - which now that I think about it, it's kind of ironic that I chose to hide the bus on a No Bus road) and watch your odometer.  At 1/10th of a mile, you will see a dirt road that juts to the left but is blocked by a barbed wire fence.  Park and jump out and walk to the fence on the right edge of the dirt road, then turn right and walk down the fence about six steps.  The bus is hidden under pine straw and sticks at your feet.  You will easily be able to park for the couple minutes at most it will take to retrieve the box.  I believe this road is hardly traveled except during dogwood season, so you should be pretty much alone up there.  Quite a waste if you ask me - it's a beautiful drive even without dogwoods!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Watch one way roads through this park and good luck getting out!  While you're there look for my Signs of Spring, and for that matter while you are in Palestine, look for my brand new box also planted today - Columbia of the Pineywoods, eat at The Ranch House, and (if you are not there on Sunday) be sure to go to Eilenbargers for cookies.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Good Luck!</div>

picked up the box a little after 9 p.m.  Kudos to her for doing a <br>
little night boxing in a park that seems to get dark before the rest <br>
of the world!<br>

Hope no one else is out there roaming Davey Dogwood - THAT would be an <br>
experience!<br>
