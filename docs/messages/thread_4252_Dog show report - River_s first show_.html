Good evening.<br>
<br>
	Dog show report - 2 and 3 Oct 2009.  <br>
<br>
	2 Oct 2009.  River and I are entered in Rally Novice B.  Rally because<br>
it is fun, and easy for beginners.  Novice because River is a Novice dog.  B -<br>
because I put a title on another dog - Parker.  Were River my first show dog, I<br>
would be in the A class.  <br>
	<br>
	Every team (1 competitor and 1 dog is a team) starts out with 100<br>
points, and points are deducted for errors.  The number of points deducted<br>
depends on the severity of the error.  Some errors can get you disqualified<br>
(D-Qed).  Example - Pooping in the ring = D-Q!!!  You must score a 70 or above<br>
to pass, but each and every team scoring a 70 or above is "Qualified" and gets<br>
one point towards the title and a green qualifying ribbon.  Three points<br>
(qualifying scores) and you earn the title.  The top 4 scoring teams also get a<br>
ribbon for first through fourth place.<br>
<br>
	Now - many of you know River and I have been training together almost<br>
from his birth.  A solid year of training - as he is one year old now.  That<br>
said - he is still VERY MUCH a puppy, and he has a small attention span.<br>
Sometimes working with him is difficult, and it is better to quit than to get<br>
mad.  So you have to understand - while River is a good pup, and the future<br>
looks bright, right now I would be happy if he just held it together long enough<br>
to make a score of 70.<br>
<br>
	There were 6 competitors entered in my class on Friday.  When I went to<br>
pick up my number and the course map, I learned that I was number 30 and would<br>
be the last one in the ring.  Some say they save the best for last.  Yeah -<br>
right.  I took the course map back to out canopy and River and I did some<br>
practice.  We did OK.  But things have a way of going wrong when you get in the<br>
ring.<br>
<br>
	One competitor didn't show up.  So 5 stood ready to go into the ring at<br>
1030.  The first competitor had a really good dog, the dog did it all and did it<br>
right.  The owner mis-read a sign and performed the second stage backward.  She<br>
and her dog were D-Qed.  The second, third and fourth competitors all had dogs<br>
much like River, sorta ready for this, but maybe not so much.  Each team had<br>
their troubles, but all made it without being disqualified.  With only 4 dogs in<br>
the running, unless River and I got D-Qed, we were assured 2 ribbons.  One for<br>
qualifying, and one for first through fourth place, whatever we earned. <br>
<br>
	Finally came our turn.  We went in, River gave me a nice sit, and the<br>
judge asked if I was ready.  Was I ready?  NO!  Well - I was...  Sorta.  I was<br>
not real sure about River.  His attention was drifting all over the place.  But<br>
it was too late to back out now.  So I gave him a quick kiss on his head and<br>
whispered in his ear "OK - Lets have some fun".  Then I said "Yes - sir, we're<br>
ready".<br>
<br>
	The Judge said "FORWARD", and we started off.  First stage was a heeling<br>
weave around the orange cones.  It was tight, the cones were close to the ring<br>
side and River is a big dog.  But we made it.  Stages 2 through 11 were not a<br>
problem for us.  Stage 12 is where we lost it.  Call Front, 1-2-3 steps back,<br>
forward.<br>
<br>
	Here is how it should work.  While heeling along - I must abruptly stop<br>
and take a step back while calling "RIVER - FRONT".  River needs to pass me,<br>
turn right 180, then sit in front of me looking up at my face.  He did that.<br>
Perfect.  Then I take one step back while calling him to "FRONT".  River must<br>
step forward and sit in front of me looking up at my face again at the same time<br>
I move.  Then two steps back, then finally three steps back.  Then I move<br>
forward and River falls into heel position and we continue.<br>
<br>
	On the 3-steps, River was slow coming off his sit to follow, so he made<br>
up for it by leaping past me and sitting to my right looking behind me.  He was<br>
distracted watching the dog in the next ring doing a retrieve.  So -3 points for<br>
the slow move and -10 points for an incorrectly completed stage.  We lost<br>
another 3 points for minor errors, and came out of the ring with an 84.<br>
<br>
	Now - I was very happy about this.  An 84 is a qualifying score.  Not<br>
great - but qualifying.  The judge tried to explain to me where we messed up.  I<br>
didn't hear him, I was just too happy we were still above 70.  We left the ring<br>
and I gave River a big hug and a thank-you.  I was happy.  Moni and some of the<br>
other competitors said River did good.  Well - they always say that.  I tell<br>
them that too.<br>
<br>
	The judge finished up the paperwork, wrote the scores on the<br>
score-board, and called the 4 qualified teams into the ring for awards.  As I<br>
came in the ring I was SHOCKED to see that 84 was the high score.  River and I<br>
got First place - the BLUE RIBBON!  Sure, we messed up.  But I guess the others<br>
messed up even more.    As the judge handed me my green and blue ribbons, he<br>
told me River was a fine dog and had a great future.  Shoot - we know that.  I<br>
thanked him and accepted the ribbons.  1 down, two to go.<br>
<br>
	3 Oct 2009.  Today's show was another surprise - but in a different way.<br>
It rained all day.  We were wet and cold.  I did my very best to see that River<br>
and Daisy were sheltered.  I should have worn long pants too, but I had two<br>
light jackets, so I was OK.  At about 0830 I went to the ring to get my number<br>
and a course map.  First off, all the competitors showed up.  So there were 6 of<br>
us.  I was certainly not expecting a repeat of Friday.  I was again just hoping<br>
to keep River's attention long enough to get in and out of the ring with at<br>
least 70 points left.  This course had a stage where River was expected to get<br>
"DOWN" on his belly for me.  Hmmmm - never tried that in the wet grass before.<br>
We better practice.  Well - he wasn't happy doing it, but he did it.  <br>
<br>
	At 1015 6 competitors stood ready to enter the ring.  All were doing<br>
good.  No DQs today, so I expected we were certainly out of the winner's circle.<br>
Still, I had hopes of qualifying.  The others made little mistakes.  Just little<br>
things.  They all looked so good.  Then it was our turn.  Well - the pressure to<br>
place was off, the others did such a fine job.  So we just needed to get a 70<br>
and another green ribbon.<br>
<br>
	Now, you have to understand... I never see River work.  I see his nose<br>
and maybe part of his head while we are heeling.  But I do not see what he is<br>
doing.  He is there, or he isn't.  In the ring is too late to be looking back.<br>
Win or lose, my job on the team is to walk the course, read the signs, and give<br>
the commands.  River's job is to heel and follow the commands.  I hope.<br>
<br>
	Well - the judge called for team 30.  River and I entered the ring.  The<br>
judge looked small hunched in her rain coat.  She asked if we were ready.  Well<br>
- yes - better than yesterday because there was no pressure.  We just wanted our<br>
70 points and get out of the rain.  She said "FORWARD" and off we went.  On the<br>
second stage River had to come front and sit, then swing to my left back into<br>
heel position when told to do so.  When I called "SWING" River leapt in the air<br>
and almost spun in flight to land next to me.  I almost lost it there, Parker<br>
used to do it just like that.  But I kept moving.  It seemed like just seconds<br>
later we were finished.  It went by so quickly, and I couldn't remember River<br>
doing any major errors.  He had one sit that was off a bit sideways.  I didn't<br>
make any mistakes either.  As we left the ring everyone was applauding us.  I<br>
went over to Moni, and she told me that River was having a blast in the ring,<br>
and the judge was smiling the whole time.<br>
<br>
	Another competitor came to me and said I needed to check the score<br>
board.  I wonder what could be wrong - we couldn't be D-Qed.  WOW - 99 points!<br>
First place again.  We entered the ring for the awards.  And yes - River earned<br>
a second blue ribbon for us.  I am happy.<br>
<br>
	Two down, one to go.  I can't wait to see what we do on Sunday.<br>

<body style="background-color: #ffffff;">Mike,<br/><br/>That's so exciting! Congratulations. Give River a good ear scratch from me tonight. And good luck tomorrow. <br/><br/>We adopted a puppy from the Humane Society this morning. We called it a birthday present for Beaver, but it's really a family dog. I think we are going to have to put Maggie - my 13 year old Dalmatian - down soon. Her health is declining rapidly and I don't want her to suffer. I had her in grad school before I knew my husband. <br/><br/>Good luck tomorrow. <br/><br/>Heather<p>Sent via BlackBerry by AT&amp;T</p><hr/><div><b>From: </b> "Mike Olbrisch" &lt;mike-2007@elp.rr.com&gt;

  report - River's first show.</div>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p><br/>Good evening.<br/><br/>Dog show report - 2 and 3 Oct 2009. <br/><br/>2 Oct 
  2009. River and I are entered in Rally Novice B. Rally because<br/>it is fun, 
  and easy for beginners. Novice because River is a Novice dog. B -<br/>because I 
  put a title on another dog - Parker. Were River my first show dog, I<br/>would 
  be in the A class. <br/><br/>Every team (1 competitor and 1 dog is a team) 
  starts out with 100<br/>points, and points are deducted for errors. The number 
  of points deducted<br/>depends on the severity of the error. Some errors can 
  get you disqualified<br/>(D-Qed). Example - Pooping in the ring = D-Q!!! You 
  must score a 70 or above<br/>to pass, but each and every team scoring a 70 or 
  above is "Qualified" and gets<br/>one point towards the title and a green 
  qualifying ribbon. Three points<br/>(qualifying scores) and you earn the title. 
  The top 4 scoring teams also get a<br/>ribbon for first through fourth 
  place.<br/><br/>Now - many of you know River and I have been training together 
  almost<br/>from his birth. A solid year of training - as he is one year old 
  now. That<br/>said - he is still VERY MUCH a puppy, and he has a small 
  attention span.<br/>Sometimes working with him is difficult, and it is better 
  to quit than to get<br/>mad. So you have to understand - while River is a good 
  pup, and the future<br/>looks bright, right now I would be happy if he just 
  held it together long enough<br/>to make a score of 70.<br/><br/>There were 6 
  competitors entered in my class on Friday. When I went to<br/>pick up my number 
  and the course map, I learned that I was number 30 and would<br/>be the last 
  one in the ring. Some say they save the best for last. Yeah -<br/>right. I took 
  the course map back to out canopy and River and I did some<br/>practice. We did 
  OK. But things have a way of going wrong when you get in 
  the<br/>ring.<br/><br/>One competitor didn't show up. So 5 stood ready to go into 
  the ring at<br/>1030. The first competitor had a really good dog, the dog did 
  it all and did it<br/>right. The owner mis-read a sign and performed the second 
  stage backward. She<br/>and her dog were D-Qed. The second, third and fourth 
  competitors all had dogs<br/>much like River, sorta ready for this, but maybe 
  not so much. Each team had<br/>their troubles, but all made it without being 
  disqualified. With only 4 dogs in<br/>the running, unless River and I got 
  D-Qed, we were assured 2 ribbons. One for<br/>qualifying, and one for first 
  through fourth place, whatever we earned. <br/><br/>Finally came our turn. We 
  went in, River gave me a nice sit, and the<br/>judge asked if I was ready. Was 
  I ready? NO! Well - I was... Sorta. I was<br/>not real sure about River. His 
  attention was drifting all over the place. But<br/>it was too late to back out 
  now. So I gave him a quick kiss on his head and<br/>whispered in his ear "OK - 
  Lets have some fun". Then I said "Yes - sir, we're<br/>ready".<br/><br/>The Judge 
  said "FORWARD", and we started off. First stage was a heeling<br/>weave around 
  the orange cones. It was tight, the cones were close to the ring<br/>side and 
  River is a big dog. But we made it. Stages 2 through 11 were not a<br/>problem 
  for us. Stage 12 is where we lost it. Call Front, 1-2-3 steps 
  back,<br/>forward.<br/><br/>Here is how it should work. While heeling along - I 
  must abruptly stop<br/>and take a step back while calling "RIVER - FRONT". 
  River needs to pass me,<br/>turn right 180, then sit in front of me looking up 
  at my face. He did that.<br/>Perfect. Then I take one step back while calling 
  him to "FRONT". River must<br/>step forward and sit in front of me looking up 
  at my face again at the same time<br/>I move. Then two steps back, then finally 
  three steps back. Then I move<br/>forward and River falls into heel position 
  and we continue.<br/><br/>On the 3-steps, River was slow coming off his sit to 
  follow, so he made<br/>up for it by leaping past me and sitting to my right 
  looking behind me. He was<br/>distracted watching the dog in the next ring 
  doing a retrieve. So -3 points for<br/>the slow move and -10 points for an 
  incorrectly completed stage. We lost<br/>another 3 points for minor errors, and 
  came out of the ring with an 84.<br/><br/>Now - I was very happy about this. An 
  84 is a qualifying score. Not<br/>great - but qualifying. The judge tried to 
  explain to me where we messed up. I<br/>didn't hear him, I was just too happy 
  we were still above 70. We left the ring<br/>and I gave River a big hug and a 
  thank-you. I was happy. Moni and some of the<br/>other competitors said River 
  did good. Well - they always say that. I tell<br/>them that too.<br/><br/>The 
  judge finished up the paperwork, wrote the scores on the<br/>score-board, and 
  called the 4 qualified teams into the ring for awards. As I<br/>came in the 
  ring I was SHOCKED to see that 84 was the high score. River and I<br/>got First 
  place - the BLUE RIBBON! Sure, we messed up. But I guess the others<br/>messed 
  up even more. As the judge handed me my green and blue ribbons, he<br/>told me 
  River was a fine dog and had a great future. Shoot - we know that. 
  I<br/>thanked him and accepted the ribbons. 1 down, two to go.<br/><br/>3 Oct 
  2009. Today's show was another surprise - but in a different way.<br/>It rained 
  all day. We were wet and cold. I did my very best to see that River<br/>and 
  Daisy were sheltered. I should have worn long pants too, but I had 
  two<br/>light jackets, so I was OK. At about 0830 I went to the ring to get my 
  number<br/>and a course map. First off, all the competitors showed up. So there 
  were 6 of<br/>us. I was certainly not expecting a repeat of Friday. I was again 
  just hoping<br/>to keep River's attention long enough to get in and out of the 
  ring with at<br/>least 70 points left. This course had a stage where River was 
  expected to get<br/>"DOWN" on his belly for me. Hmmmm - never tried that in the 
  wet grass before.<br/>We better practice. Well - he wasn't happy doing it, but 
  he did it. <br/><br/>At 1015 6 competitors stood ready to enter the ring. All 
  were doing<br/>good. No DQs today, so I expected we were certainly out of the 
  winner's circle.<br/>Still, I had hopes of qualifying. The others made little 
  mistakes. Just little<br/>things. They all looked so good. Then it was our 
  turn. Well - the pressure to<br/>place was off, the others did such a fine job. 
  So we just needed to get a 70<br/>and another green ribbon.<br/><br/>Now, you 
  have to understand..<wbr>. I never see River work. I see his nose<br/>and maybe 
  part of his head while we are heeling. But I do not see what he is<br/>doing. 
  He is there, or he isn't. In the ring is too late to be looking back.<br/>Win 
  or lose, my job on the team is to walk the course, read the signs, and 
  give<br/>the commands. River's job is to heel and follow the commands. I 
  hope.<br/><br/>Well - the judge called for team 30. River and I entered the 
  ring. The<br/>judge looked small hunched in her rain coat. She asked if we were 
  ready. Well<br/>- yes - better than yesterday because there was no pressure. We 
  just wanted our<br/>70 points and get out of the rain. She said "FORWARD" and 
  off we went. On the<br/>second stage River had to come front and sit, then 
  swing to my left back into<br/>heel position when told to do so. When I called 
  "SWING" River leapt in the air<br/>and almost spun in flight to land next to 
  me. I almost lost it there, Parker<br/>used to do it just like that. But I kept 
  moving. It seemed like just seconds<br/>later we were finished. It went by so 
  quickly, and I couldn't remember River<br/>doing any major errors. He had one 
  sit that was off a bit sideways. I didn't<br/>make any mistakes either. As we 
  left the ring everyone was applauding us. I<br/>went over to Moni, and she told 
  me that River was having a blast in the ring,<br/>and the judge was smiling the 
  whole time.<br/><br/>Another competitor came to me and said I needed to check 
  the score<br/>board. I wonder what could be wrong - we couldn't be D-Qed. WOW - 
  99 points!<br/>First place again. We entered the ring for the awards. And yes - 
  River earned<br/>a second blue ribbon for us. I am happy.<br/><br/>Two down, one 
  to go. I can't wait to see what we do on Sunday.<br/><br/>Mike - KD9KC.<br/>El

&gt; <br/>
&gt; Good evening.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Dog show report - 2 and 3 Oct 2009.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	2 Oct 2009.  River and I are entered in Rally Novice B.  Rally because<br/>
&gt; it is fun, and easy for beginners.  Novice because River is a Novice dog.  B -<br/>
&gt; because I put a title on another dog - Parker.  Were River my first show dog, I<br/>
&gt; would be in the A class.  <br/>
&gt; 	<br/>
&gt; 	Every team (1 competitor and 1 dog is a team) starts out with 100<br/>
&gt; points, and points are deducted for errors.  The number of points deducted<br/>
&gt; depends on the severity of the error.  Some errors can get you disqualified<br/>
&gt; (D-Qed).  Example - Pooping in the ring = D-Q!!!  You must score a 70 or above<br/>
&gt; to pass, but each and every team scoring a 70 or above is "Qualified" and gets<br/>
&gt; one point towards the title and a green qualifying ribbon.  Three points<br/>
&gt; (qualifying scores) and you earn the title.  The top 4 scoring teams also get a<br/>
&gt; ribbon for first through fourth place.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Now - many of you know River and I have been training together almost<br/>
&gt; from his birth.  A solid year of training - as he is one year old now.  That<br/>
&gt; said - he is still VERY MUCH a puppy, and he has a small attention span.<br/>
&gt; Sometimes working with him is difficult, and it is better to quit than to get<br/>
&gt; mad.  So you have to understand - while River is a good pup, and the future<br/>
&gt; looks bright, right now I would be happy if he just held it together long enough<br/>
&gt; to make a score of 70.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	There were 6 competitors entered in my class on Friday.  When I went to<br/>
&gt; pick up my number and the course map, I learned that I was number 30 and would<br/>
&gt; be the last one in the ring.  Some say they save the best for last.  Yeah -<br/>
&gt; right.  I took the course map back to out canopy and River and I did some<br/>
&gt; practice.  We did OK.  But things have a way of going wrong when you get in the<br/>
&gt; ring.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	One competitor didn't show up.  So 5 stood ready to go into the ring at<br/>
&gt; 1030.  The first competitor had a really good dog, the dog did it all and did it<br/>
&gt; right.  The owner mis-read a sign and performed the second stage backward.  She<br/>
&gt; and her dog were D-Qed.  The second, third and fourth competitors all had dogs<br/>
&gt; much like River, sorta ready for this, but maybe not so much.  Each team had<br/>
&gt; their troubles, but all made it without being disqualified.  With only 4 dogs in<br/>
&gt; the running, unless River and I got D-Qed, we were assured 2 ribbons.  One for<br/>
&gt; qualifying, and one for first through fourth place, whatever we earned. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Finally came our turn.  We went in, River gave me a nice sit, and the<br/>
&gt; judge asked if I was ready.  Was I ready?  NO!  Well - I was...  Sorta.  I was<br/>
&gt; not real sure about River.  His attention was drifting all over the place.  But<br/>
&gt; it was too late to back out now.  So I gave him a quick kiss on his head and<br/>
&gt; whispered in his ear "OK - Lets have some fun".  Then I said "Yes - sir, we're<br/>
&gt; ready".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The Judge said "FORWARD", and we started off.  First stage was a heeling<br/>
&gt; weave around the orange cones.  It was tight, the cones were close to the ring<br/>
&gt; side and River is a big dog.  But we made it.  Stages 2 through 11 were not a<br/>
&gt; problem for us.  Stage 12 is where we lost it.  Call Front, 1-2-3 steps back,<br/>
&gt; forward.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Here is how it should work.  While heeling along - I must abruptly stop<br/>
&gt; and take a step back while calling "RIVER - FRONT".  River needs to pass me,<br/>
&gt; turn right 180, then sit in front of me looking up at my face.  He did that.<br/>
&gt; Perfect.  Then I take one step back while calling him to "FRONT".  River must<br/>
&gt; step forward and sit in front of me looking up at my face again at the same time<br/>
&gt; I move.  Then two steps back, then finally three steps back.  Then I move<br/>
&gt; forward and River falls into heel position and we continue.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	On the 3-steps, River was slow coming off his sit to follow, so he made<br/>
&gt; up for it by leaping past me and sitting to my right looking behind me.  He was<br/>
&gt; distracted watching the dog in the next ring doing a retrieve.  So -3 points for<br/>
&gt; the slow move and -10 points for an incorrectly completed stage.  We lost<br/>
&gt; another 3 points for minor errors, and came out of the ring with an 84.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Now - I was very happy about this.  An 84 is a qualifying score.  Not<br/>
&gt; great - but qualifying.  The judge tried to explain to me where we messed up.  I<br/>
&gt; didn't hear him, I was just too happy we were still above 70.  We left the ring<br/>
&gt; and I gave River a big hug and a thank-you.  I was happy.  Moni and some of the<br/>
&gt; other competitors said River did good.  Well - they always say that.  I tell<br/>
&gt; them that too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	The judge finished up the paperwork, wrote the scores on the<br/>
&gt; score-board, and called the 4 qualified teams into the ring for awards.  As I<br/>
&gt; came in the ring I was SHOCKED to see that 84 was the high score.  River and I<br/>
&gt; got First place - the BLUE RIBBON!  Sure, we messed up.  But I guess the others<br/>
&gt; messed up even more.    As the judge handed me my green and blue ribbons, he<br/>
&gt; told me River was a fine dog and had a great future.  Shoot - we know that.  I<br/>
&gt; thanked him and accepted the ribbons.  1 down, two to go.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	3 Oct 2009.  Today's show was another surprise - but in a different way.<br/>
&gt; It rained all day.  We were wet and cold.  I did my very best to see that River<br/>
&gt; and Daisy were sheltered.  I should have worn long pants too, but I had two<br/>
&gt; light jackets, so I was OK.  At about 0830 I went to the ring to get my number<br/>
&gt; and a course map.  First off, all the competitors showed up.  So there were 6 of<br/>
&gt; us.  I was certainly not expecting a repeat of Friday.  I was again just hoping<br/>
&gt; to keep River's attention long enough to get in and out of the ring with at<br/>
&gt; least 70 points left.  This course had a stage where River was expected to get<br/>
&gt; "DOWN" on his belly for me.  Hmmmm - never tried that in the wet grass before.<br/>
&gt; We better practice.  Well - he wasn't happy doing it, but he did it.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	At 1015 6 competitors stood ready to enter the ring.  All were doing<br/>
&gt; good.  No DQs today, so I expected we were certainly out of the winner's circle.<br/>
&gt; Still, I had hopes of qualifying.  The others made little mistakes.  Just little<br/>
&gt; things.  They all looked so good.  Then it was our turn.  Well - the pressure to<br/>
&gt; place was off, the others did such a fine job.  So we just needed to get a 70<br/>
&gt; and another green ribbon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Now, you have to understand... I never see River work.  I see his nose<br/>
&gt; and maybe part of his head while we are heeling.  But I do not see what he is<br/>
&gt; doing.  He is there, or he isn't.  In the ring is too late to be looking back.<br/>
&gt; Win or lose, my job on the team is to walk the course, read the signs, and give<br/>
&gt; the commands.  River's job is to heel and follow the commands.  I hope.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Well - the judge called for team 30.  River and I entered the ring.  The<br/>
&gt; judge looked small hunched in her rain coat.  She asked if we were ready.  Well<br/>
&gt; - yes - better than yesterday because there was no pressure.  We just wanted our<br/>
&gt; 70 points and get out of the rain.  She said "FORWARD" and off we went.  On the<br/>
&gt; second stage River had to come front and sit, then swing to my left back into<br/>
&gt; heel position when told to do so.  When I called "SWING" River leapt in the air<br/>
&gt; and almost spun in flight to land next to me.  I almost lost it there, Parker<br/>
&gt; used to do it just like that.  But I kept moving.  It seemed like just seconds<br/>
&gt; later we were finished.  It went by so quickly, and I couldn't remember River<br/>
&gt; doing any major errors.  He had one sit that was off a bit sideways.  I didn't<br/>
&gt; make any mistakes either.  As we left the ring everyone was applauding us.  I<br/>
&gt; went over to Moni, and she told me that River was having a blast in the ring,<br/>
&gt; and the judge was smiling the whole time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Another competitor came to me and said I needed to check the score<br/>
&gt; board.  I wonder what could be wrong - we couldn't be D-Qed.  WOW - 99 points!<br/>
&gt; First place again.  We entered the ring for the awards.  And yes - River earned<br/>
&gt; a second blue ribbon for us.  I am happy.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 	Two down, one to go.  I can't wait to see what we do on Sunday.<br/>

    evening.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Dog show report - 2 and 3 Oct 2009. <br/>&gt; 
    <br/>&gt; 2 Oct 2009. River and I are entered in Rally Novice B. Rally 
    because<br/>&gt; it is fun, and easy for beginners. Novice because River is a 
    Novice dog. B -<br/>&gt; because I put a title on another dog - Parker. Were 
    River my first show dog, I<br/>&gt; would be in the A class. <br/>&gt; 
    <br/>&gt; Every team (1 competitor and 1 dog is a team) starts out with 
    100<br/>&gt; points, and points are deducted for errors. The number of points 
    deducted<br/>&gt; depends on the severity of the error. Some errors can get 
    you disqualified<br/>&gt; (D-Qed). Example - Pooping in the ring = D-Q!!! You 
    must score a 70 or above<br/>&gt; to pass, but each and every team scoring a 
    70 or above is "Qualified" and gets<br/>&gt; one point towards the title and 
    a green qualifying ribbon. Three points<br/>&gt; (qualifying scores) and you 
    earn the title. The top 4 scoring teams also get a<br/>&gt; ribbon for first 
    through fourth place.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now - many of you know River and I 
    have been training together almost<br/>&gt; from his birth. A solid year of 
    training - as he is one year old now. That<br/>&gt; said - he is still VERY 
    MUCH a puppy, and he has a small attention span.<br/>&gt; Sometimes working 
    with him is difficult, and it is better to quit than to get<br/>&gt; mad. So 
    you have to understand - while River is a good pup, and the future<br/>&gt; 
    looks bright, right now I would be happy if he just held it together long 
    enough<br/>&gt; to make a score of 70.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; There were 6 
    competitors entered in my class on Friday. When I went to<br/>&gt; pick up my 
    number and the course map, I learned that I was number 30 and would<br/>&gt; 
    be the last one in the ring. Some say they save the best for last. Yeah 
    -<br/>&gt; right. I took the course map back to out canopy and River and I 
    did some<br/>&gt; practice. We did OK. But things have a way of going wrong 
    when you get in the<br/>&gt; ring.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; One competitor didn't 
    show up. So 5 stood ready to go into the ring at<br/>&gt; 1030. The first 
    competitor had a really good dog, the dog did it all and did it<br/>&gt; 
    right. The owner mis-read a sign and performed the second stage backward. 
    She<br/>&gt; and her dog were D-Qed. The second, third and fourth competitors 
    all had dogs<br/>&gt; much like River, sorta ready for this, but maybe not so 
    much. Each team had<br/>&gt; their troubles, but all made it without being 
    disqualified. With only 4 dogs in<br/>&gt; the running, unless River and I 
    got D-Qed, we were assured 2 ribbons. One for<br/>&gt; qualifying, and one 
    for first through fourth place, whatever we earned. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
    Finally came our turn. We went in, River gave me a nice sit, and the<br/>&gt; 
    judge asked if I was ready. Was I ready? NO! Well - I was... Sorta. I 
    was<br/>&gt; not real sure about River. His attention was drifting all over 
    the place. But<br/>&gt; it was too late to back out now. So I gave him a 
    quick kiss on his head and<br/>&gt; whispered in his ear "OK - Lets have some 
    fun". Then I said "Yes - sir, we're<br/>&gt; ready".<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The 
    Judge said "FORWARD", and we started off. First stage was a heeling<br/>&gt; 
    weave around the orange cones. It was tight, the cones were close to the 
    ring<br/>&gt; side and River is a big dog. But we made it. Stages 2 through 
    11 were not a<br/>&gt; problem for us. Stage 12 is where we lost it. Call 
    Front, 1-2-3 steps back,<br/>&gt; forward.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Here is how it 
    should work. While heeling along - I must abruptly stop<br/>&gt; and take a 
    step back while calling "RIVER - FRONT". River needs to pass me,<br/>&gt; 
    turn right 180, then sit in front of me looking up at my face. He did 
    that.<br/>&gt; Perfect. Then I take one step back while calling him to 
    "FRONT". River must<br/>&gt; step forward and sit in front of me looking up 
    at my face again at the same time<br/>&gt; I move. Then two steps back, then 
    finally three steps back. Then I move<br/>&gt; forward and River falls into 
    heel position and we continue.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; On the 3-steps, River was 
    slow coming off his sit to follow, so he made<br/>&gt; up for it by leaping 
    past me and sitting to my right looking behind me. He was<br/>&gt; distracted 
    watching the dog in the next ring doing a retrieve. So -3 points for<br/>&gt; 
    the slow move and -10 points for an incorrectly completed stage. We 
    lost<br/>&gt; another 3 points for minor errors, and came out of the ring 
    with an 84.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now - I was very happy about this. An 84 is a 
    qualifying score. Not<br/>&gt; great - but qualifying. The judge tried to 
    explain to me where we messed up. I<br/>&gt; didn't hear him, I was just too 
    happy we were still above 70. We left the ring<br/>&gt; and I gave River a 
    big hug and a thank-you. I was happy. Moni and some of the<br/>&gt; other 
    competitors said River did good. Well - they always say that. I tell<br/>&gt; 
    them that too.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; The judge finished up the paperwork, wrote 
    the scores on the<br/>&gt; score-board, and called the 4 qualified teams into 
    the ring for awards. As I<br/>&gt; came in the ring I was SHOCKED to see that 
    84 was the high score. River and I<br/>&gt; got First place - the BLUE 
    RIBBON! Sure, we messed up. But I guess the others<br/>&gt; messed up even 
    more. As the judge handed me my green and blue ribbons, he<br/>&gt; told me 
    River was a fine dog and had a great future. Shoot - we know that. I<br/>&gt; 
    thanked him and accepted the ribbons. 1 down, two to go.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 3 
    Oct 2009. Today's show was another surprise - but in a different 
    way.<br/>&gt; It rained all day. We were wet and cold. I did my very best to 
    see that River<br/>&gt; and Daisy were sheltered. I should have worn long 
    pants too, but I had two<br/>&gt; light jackets, so I was OK. At about 0830 I 
    went to the ring to get my number<br/>&gt; and a course map. First off, all 
    the competitors showed up. So there were 6 of<br/>&gt; us. I was certainly 
    not expecting a repeat of Friday. I was again just hoping<br/>&gt; to keep 
    River's attention long enough to get in and out of the ring with at<br/>&gt; 
    least 70 points left. This course had a stage where River was expected to 
    get<br/>&gt; "DOWN" on his belly for me. Hmmmm - never tried that in the wet 
    grass before.<br/>&gt; We better practice. Well - he wasn't happy doing it, 
    but he did it. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; At 1015 6 competitors stood ready to enter 
    the ring. All were doing<br/>&gt; good. No DQs today, so I expected we were

    to get a 70<br/>&gt; and another green ribbon.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now, you have 
    to understand..<wbr>. I never see River work. I see his nose<br/>&gt; and 
    maybe part of his head while we are heeling. But I do not see what he 
    is<br/>&gt; doing. He is there, or he isn't. In the ring is too late to be 
    looking back.<br/>&gt; Win or lose, my job on the team is to walk the course, 
    read the signs, and give<br/>&gt; the commands. River's job is to heel and 
    follow the commands. I hope.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Well - the judge called for 
    team 30. River and I entered the ring. The<br/>&gt; judge looked small 
    hunched in her rain coat. She asked if we were ready. Well<br/>&gt; - yes - 
    better than yesterday because there was no pressure. We just wanted 
    our<br/>&gt; 70 points and get out of the rain. She said "FORWARD" and off we 
    went. On the<br/>&gt; second stage River had to come front and sit, then 
    swing to my left back into<br/>&gt; heel position when told to do so. When I 
    called "SWING" River leapt in the air<br/>&gt; and almost spun in flight to 
    land next to me. I almost lost it there, Parker<br/>&gt; used to do it just 
    like that. But I kept moving. It seemed like just seconds<br/>&gt; later we 
    were finished. It went by so quickly, and I couldn't remember River<br/>&gt;

    time.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Another competitor came to me and said I needed to 
    check the score<br/>&gt; board. I wonder what could be wrong - we couldn't be 
    D-Qed. WOW - 99 points!<br/>&gt; First place again. We entered the ring for 
    the awards. And yes - River earned<br/>&gt; a second blue ribbon for us. I am 
    happy.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Two down, one to go. I can't wait to see what we do 
    on Sunday.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike - KD9KC.<br/>&gt; El Paso, Tx. <br/>&gt;
