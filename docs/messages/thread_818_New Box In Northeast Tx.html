My wife and I went to Lufkin this weekend to visit a friend<br>
and then spent the night in a B&B outside of Nacogdoches.  The<br>
weather was great and we enjoyed walking around town, especially<br>
at the SFA Arboretum.  I managed to place a box (Sam I Am) <br>
in the SFA Experimental Forest outside of Nacogdoches, another<br>
great place to visit.  I will post clues as soon as LBNA site<br>
is working again.  I only had time to find one box in the area,<br>
Barefoot Lucy's Pack 403 box in Ratcliff Rec Area.  It was<br>
doing well with a few visits and the park looked like a great<br>
place to camp.  I highly recommend visiting this part of TX<br>
and I hope to get farther north when I have more time.  The <br>
wildflowers were great, even if they were not Bluebonnets.<br>
