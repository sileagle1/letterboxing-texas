Wow, everytime I go out of town a bunch more new boxers pop up on <br/>
this talklist.  That's fantastic!  Do I smell new boxes in the <br/>
making?<br/>
<br/>
I had a delightful time boxing in McAllister Park in San Antonio <br/>
last Friday.  I found Silver Eagle's Lone Star Beer, Baby Bears <br/>
Peanuts, and Scoutdogs three boxes-Dancers, Cowboy, and Longhorn.  I <br/>
also discovered that stinging nettles are no fun!!!!!! :0  You'd <br/>
think I would learn to wear pants instead of shorts and sandals out <br/>
boxing.  It was so neat, though to find five boxes all in good shape <br/>
on the same trail.<br/>
<br/>
Of course I also had to take the little Samurai Stampers to Sea <br/>
World and the cheesy tourist traps across the street from the <br/>
Alamo!  I found it amusing that you could find the symbol of the <br/>
Shrine of Texas Liberty on a shot glass and a snowglobe!  If Day <br/>
Crockett were alive <br/>
today............................................!?<br/>
<br/>
On an unrelated side note I found a great bumper sticker the other <br/>
day that I promptly put on my car because I thought it so appropo to <br/>
LB.  It was a quote from Tolkien:<br/>
<br/>
"Not all who wander are lost"<br/>

<div>Love that bumper sticker!!  I will have to 
look for it!!  Just FYI..  when I was a wee girl scout our camp had a 
ton of sting nettle.  The best solution for the stuff is elephant ear, if 
you can find it.  Just rub it over where the stinging nettle is.. should 
help!!</div>

Thanks for the update.  San Antonio is on the agenda for us hopefully <br/>
next month.  Although our two last trips to Dallas and Rusk didn't <br/>
work out so well (stalled before we ever left by sick kids).  We seem <br/>
to do better when we just decide to get in the car and go than when we <br/>
try to plan it out.<br/>

<div>  So I'm not the only person who wader through waist-high brambles and 
fire ants in sandals and shorts!   AND I love the bumper 
sticker!  I have a "Brake for Moose" caution sticker on my little Miata 
bumper, but I'd add that one, too, if I found it.  And the Alamo snow-globe 
seems pretty neat to me, but then, I love those cheesy snow-globes and look for 
them everywhere I go. -- Viewfinder (tx2chic)</div></body></html>
