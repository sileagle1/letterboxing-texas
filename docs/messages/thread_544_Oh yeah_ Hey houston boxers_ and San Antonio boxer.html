Does anyone know where I can get some good carving stuff in Houston <br/>

I have to take this stamp carving thing a little more seriously.<br/>

In Houston, Texas Art Supply (their prices are usually better than <br/>
Michael's, too).  In the section for carving linoleum (remember art <br/>
class when you were a kid?), they have all kinds of different sized <br/>
blades, the intro kit, and "the pink stuff."  If you can't get there <br/>
personally, they have a website.<br/>

OH, you are so sweet! No, I will be going to either San Antonio or <br/>
Houston some time soon....Have to find more boxes. Here in the <br/>
Valley people look at you like you are crazy if you ask for this <br/>
stuff... Thank you. I think I will order it from Texas ARt supply <br/>
unless anyone knows how to get it cheap, like wholesale price, and <br/>
we could devide up a lot of it.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again<br/>
