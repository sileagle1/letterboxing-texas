Does anyone know where I can get some good carving stuff in Houston <br>
or San Antonio? I need EZ-cut or PZ-cut or whatever and some tools. <br>
I have to take this stamp carving thing a little more seriously.<br>

In Houston, Texas Art Supply (their prices are usually better than <br>
Michael's, too).  In the section for carving linoleum (remember art <br>
class when you were a kid?), they have all kinds of different sized <br>
blades, the intro kit, and "the pink stuff."  If you can't get there <br>
personally, they have a website.<br>

OH, you are so sweet! No, I will be going to either San Antonio or <br>
Houston some time soon....Have to find more boxes. Here in the <br>
Valley people look at you like you are crazy if you ask for this <br>
stuff... Thank you. I think I will order it from Texas ARt supply <br>
unless anyone knows how to get it cheap, like wholesale price, and <br>
we could devide up a lot of it.<br>
<br>
Thank you again<br>
