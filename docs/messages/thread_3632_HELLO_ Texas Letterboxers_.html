I actually joined this group when I joined my Church group to get <br>
Church emails.  I didn't really understand how the yahoo group thing <br>
worked so gave it up until today.  Cha Cha Cheetah sent me <br>
instructions:  log on, check your email. (duh!)  Well, I have been a <br>
member since June 22...of 2007!  I had 5,767 emails in my inbox!  <br>
<br>
It has taken me an hour and a half but I am down to a clean inbox and I <br>
have learned alot about your talkative group!  :)  I learned a lot <br>
about Texas.  I learned what TALE stands for. I even read about the <br>
gathering that I hosted...and what the broom signified.<br>
<br>
Thanks, ChaCha.  I'm glad I have found you guys.  :) Good night!<br>
