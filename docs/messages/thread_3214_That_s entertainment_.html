                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey All!<br/>
I am still up here in Arlington, actively boxing, but hadn't posted <br/>
since forever on this site,nor had I checked the posts in awhile.  <br/>
I'm so glad I finally got around to checking it!  <br/>
<br/>
The Miata stories totally cracked me up and made me think of the time <br/>
I visited Teller City in Colorado. my Grandfather told me about a <br/>
ghost town up near Poudre Canyon.  Well, when I was in my 20's I <br/>
finally drove my Chrysler Cirrus up there and totally bottomed it out <br/>
on all the huge rocks and ruts in the old mountain road!  I kept <br/>
thinking, it's going to be worth it, it's going to be worth it!  <br/>
After 2 1/2 hours of that I finally arrived in Teller City expecting <br/>
to see almost a Hollywood movie set of saloons, horse troughs and <br/>
tumbleweeds!  Uhhhh, there were a few old timbers still lying on the <br/>
ground in a rough rectangular shape. :(  Now I would completely <br/>
appreciate it and be fascinated by an old silver mining town <br/>
abandoned so quickly that it was said dishes were still on the <br/>
tables. (I also would now HAVE to plant a box there.  Hmmmm, I have a <br/>
pickup truck now........) However, in my naive youth, I just kept <br/>
thinking "I ruined my car for this?"!, "A bunch of logs on the <br/>
ground!"<br/>
<br/>
BTW, is anybody itching to see National Treasure II?  I may have to <br/>
go back down to Granbury and spruce up my John Wilkes Booth box, <br/>
based on the previews!';)<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Love the ghost town story. Isn't it amazing how lb'g has changed our point of view on the world?<br/><br/>I would like to know how, being the biggest National Treasure fan, I am just now finding out about the 2nd movie? I can practically quote the whole movie. I have never been so insulted in my entire life. Disney sends me emails about trips all the time. Could there be a reason they didn't send me one regarding the filming of NT2? I'm so mad, I may wait till the movie is out 3 days before going to see it. That'll teach them. <br/><br/>NOOOO, I have something even better, I'll go see another movie that first weekend. That'll really get em.<br/><br/>Janet, BF<br/><br/><b><i>samuraistampers &lt;samuraistampers@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hey All!<br/> I am still up here in Arlington, actively boxing, but hadn't posted <br/> since forever on this site,nor had I checked the posts in awhile.  <br/> I'm so glad I finally got around to checking it!  <br/> <br/> The Miata stories totally cracked me up and made me think of the time <br/> I visited Teller City in Colorado. my Grandfather told me about a <br/> ghost town up near Poudre Canyon.
