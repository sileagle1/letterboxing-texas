&gt; Being a ghost sometimes has its perks; you can meet and chat with <br/>
&gt; other ghosts, some of whom were famous and important mortals.  Just <br/>
&gt; the other day I was thinking about Davy Crockett and wondering what <br/>
&gt; was up with him, so I took a little trip over to the Alamo and <br/>
found <br/>
&gt; him (more properly, his ghost), sitting there looking a little <br/>
&gt; dejected.  He was still wearing his old buckskins and that coonskin <br/>
&gt; cap which was getting a little scraggly looking, if you ask me, and <br/>
&gt; he was cleaning his old Tennessee long rifle.  Anyway, I asked him <br/>
&gt; how he had been doing and he allowed as to how he was doin' <br/>
tol'able, <br/>
&gt; except that he missed his favorite pastime, which was hunting and <br/>
&gt; asked if I knew if there were any bears around, any old kind would <br/>
&gt; do.  I told him that there were very few bears left in Texas <br/>
because <br/>
&gt; people like him had killed them all.  He said he was sorry about <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; and would like to make amends if he could.  Maybe he could find a <br/>
&gt; bear, just any old bear, and apologize for killing so many of them <br/>
in <br/>
&gt; his lifetime.  I told him that I knew of a bear out west of <br/>
Houston, <br/>
&gt; but that he was just a Baby Bear.  I asked him if he would like to <br/>
&gt; take a trip on the Texas Tour Bus and I'd show him where the cub <br/>
&gt; lived, if he would promise that he only wanted to apologize.  He <br/>
&gt; brightened up at the prospect and said he'd just take me up on it.  <br/>
&gt; We got on board with all the other well-known Texans, a few of whom <br/>
&gt; he remembered, and some he had heard of, and headed for a place <br/>
&gt; called Cypress, where I knew the little bear lived.  Pretty soon, <br/>
&gt; Davy (or more properly, his ghost), took over the wheel and drove <br/>
&gt; that bus all the way to Cypress.  I don't know how he learned to <br/>
&gt; drive, but ghosts can do about anything they want to if they try <br/>
hard <br/>
&gt; enough.  We found the house of the Baby Bear and he parked out <br/>
front, <br/>
&gt; surveying the neighborhood, which was a very nice one, indeed, for <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; Baby Bear.  Then, he turned up the walk and, just before he got to <br/>
&gt; the front door, he thought he heard something, so he turned to the <br/>
&gt; right and ducked under some bushes.  The last I saw of him, he was <br/>
&gt; sitting on top of the bus sighting in that long rifle, with a grin <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; his face and a gleam in his eye.  I have no idea what he had in <br/>
mind.<br/>

<div>It is entirely possible that these are impostures - clones (or is it clowns?) of the real TTB2. Perhaps the original bus is still in the hands of Bozo.... or who knows.... perhaps on its way to the DFW area. Ponder that, Oh Great President of the Anti-IRABoxer Fan Club.</div>
