                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, Ashby, myself, Random and Enaj, all of us went <br/>
letterboxing before going to the Deaf Festival they were having in <br/>
Jacksonville.  I have to say it was a delightful little trip.  We <br/>
did not find all the letterboxes, and we think some of them must be <br/>
missing.<br/>
<br/>
POOR POOR Enaj!  We split up the search among the four of us, <br/>
letting each person have a turn looking for a box, and each time it <br/>
was Enaj's turn to find the box...we didn't find it!  And that was <br/>
after a good long while of looking!<br/>
<br/>
Also, while in Jacksonville, I finally dropped off The Cichlid Guy's <br/>
hitchhiker "Traveling Pumpkins," and I also wish that i had waited <br/>
and dropped off the "In this Sign" hitchhiker there in honor of the <br/>
Deaf Festival...but oh well.  AND we found the "H. H. Chic" <br/>
hitchhiker by Tx2chick.<br/>
<br/>
So all in all, it was a great outing that ended well, and not only <br/>
that Enaj and Random held up surprizingly well despite the long day!<br/>

<div>I trust you will be notifying the placer(s) of missing boxes in Jacksonville?  I know mine were all in place not too long ago, so if one has recently gone missing, I want to run check it before too long passes!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, if you don't get a response from the placer after you report to them that it's missing, would you email me off the list and let me know?  I'd like to check on those as well...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks!</div>

<div>Yay!  (Is that the Hobo Chick?) I'd love to hear from you again when 
you drop her off at the next spot on her travels, just to keep track of where's 
she's been!  So good to hear of her whereabouts!  -- Viewfinder (of
