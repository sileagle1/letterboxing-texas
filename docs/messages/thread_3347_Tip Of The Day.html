I thought it might be useful to also have a tip of the day.  It could <br>
be any tip pertaining to letterboxing that you feel others might <br>
benefit from, especially newcomers.  We may get more than one per day <br>
at first, but try to space them out so we have time to digest and <br>
discuss each.  I'll start us off.<br>
<br>
Many of you may not be aware of the features available in this <br>
Talklist shown on the left side, so I want to point them out.  First <br>
of all you must log into the Talklist to see all of them, and some of <br>
you that get posts via email might not ever do that.  By the way, if <br>
you don't want to receive posts via email, which is the default, you <br>
can pick another option by clicking Edit Membership.  So, looking on <br>
the left I will point out some of the features:<br>
<br>
Files - contains documents and other files submitted by members for <br>
everyone to view.  <br>
<br>
Photos - albums with pictures submitted by members for everyone to <br>
view<br>
<br>
Links - contains links to websites submitted by members for everyone <br>
to click on<br>
<br>
Database - databases submitted by members for everyone to view and/or <br>
update (like potluck info for TALE5)<br>
<br>
Polls - Polls created by members to obtain information<br>
<br>
Calendar - not used much, but could contain future notices<br>
<br>
So try them out and see for yourself, you just might have fun while <br>
learning a few things!<br>
