<div> </div>
<div>Lightning and I DID get out and find a few boxes today.  We worked a little on JBK's May Series which is focused around Mother's Day, so it was nice to find those boxes on Mother's Day with my kiddo.  We were lazy though and didn't find them all.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got a few boxes up into the far northeast, but from what I've heard I don't think we planted any virgin counties.  Atoy Adventurers are planning on running through that area on their way to Oklahoma this next week and may plant some then.  My plans personally fell through.  Can't remember how much I've said, but Fearless Fox had surgery earlier this week and it turned out to be a bit more complicated than they thought, and he's had difficulty with his pain medications besides, so I didn't feel good straying from home for the whole day.  I had planned then to run a couple of errands and then make a run up there and plant three virgin counties, but when I returned home to check in before I left, I found my refrigerator had given up the ghost - finally.  Thankfully we had been shopping for refrigerators so I knew what I wanted, but I had also just been to the grocery store in anticipation of being gone a lot this weekend so the broken one was full.  I spent the rest of my day buying a fridge and getting rid of the old one and shifting things around and waiting for the new one to be delivered.  Ack. Guess you could say I got a new refrigerator for Mother's Day!  
<br/><br/>BUT - we got up this morning and Fearless Fox had told Lightning to take me to breakfast, so he did (although I paid - is that how it is supposed to work?).  In the meantime, I printed the clues to the 10 boxes here in town that I haven't yet gotten - 10 boxes unfound!  Unbelievable!  Lightning and I sat at breakfast and went over the clues and planned our attack and finally headed out.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The first one had limited hours, and when we hit it we weren't within their open hours, so we planned to come back.  The next one was in a church cemetery, but thankfully it wasn't right next to the church since we were playing hookie from church this morning and they were in the middle of services when we passed.  This is a little country cemetery, yet another one that JBK found with a spectacular view.  As we sat on one of the benches stamping in, we looked out over a stunning rolling green valley. The colors were so rich and pungent that I had to put my sunglasses back on to look out over the valley without hurting my eyes. There are times I feel sorry for the rest of you who don't get to spend your days in Northeast Texas.  There was no need to be in church to feel that we were in God's Country.  The next one also had limited hours and again, when we were there wasn't when they were there, so we planned to return for that one too.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On our way to the fourth of the series, we stopped by the Tomato Bowl and got Atoy Adventurer's Rain, Rain Go Away.  When I read those clues, I would've sworn that box would NOT last very long, but it is small enough and cleverly enough hidden that it may have a fighting chance.  It was a pretty cool spot!  We got to the fourth in the May Series and found it quickly and took a little time to sit under the shade of their trees and watch the world go by.  It goes by very slowly in Jacksonville on a Sunday morning.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We also looked for Its the Cheesiest by Atoy Adventurers, which was conveniently very near to JBK's box, but we couldn't find it.  What's that book?  Who Stole My Cheese?  Or the other one, Who Moved My Cheese?  Either one of these titles might be appros po, or it may just be a case of Beyond Macaroni And Cheese, which might have been what I was doing - looking beyond.  ANYWAY...that was a try again.  Lightning and I were feeling lazy and decided to go home and be bums for a couple of hours before going out anymore.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When we finally got out again, it was after the two places were already closed again, so those will have to wait still.  We decided to go feed my in-laws' menagerie before going to find more boxes, which meant we had to run the fence line looking for a particular goat that likes to stick her head through the fence and then can't get it back.  Lightning got his motorbike and I took the mule (motorized mule - thank you very much!) and we worked the fenceline in different directions.  Now it isn't that I'm especially drawn to helping a goat that doesn't have sense enough to keep her head on the right side of the fence - I'm all for survival of the fittest - but my mother-in-law has every one of her 60+ goats named and is desperately attached to all of them, and I sure wouldn't want to have her find this goat hung up in the fence and dead because we had been heartless.  After we finished checking the fence, we decided to ride the trails over the land.  My in-laws have 60 acres or so of rough terrain with trees and open pasture, a creek, a small pond, and considerable lakefront footage.  A smorgasbord of birdwatching and wildlife observation.  So Lightning took off and I followed on the mule, trying desperately to keep up even though I am a real chicken when it comes to steep gravelly hills that drop off into a creek bed and steep upward climbs that seem like they are more than 90 degrees in themselves.  My in-law's boxer would climb in with me for awhile and then she would give up on me, until she got tired again and would decide riding with me was better than nothing.  We got almost all the way around the trail and back to the farm area, when we came up on a large sassafras tree down across the trail and partially pulling some fence down.  Lightning could get under it because he was short enough, but the mule couldn't make it.  We tried pushing and pulling, but couldn't budge that tree.  Finally we decided I would turn around and go back and he would continue on.  I was having fun tearing through the backwoods and I missed a turn and couldn't for the life of me find my way back.  I came up on a creek crossing that was indisputably impossible, so I had to back the mule up the hill and turn around.  And I somehow managed to loop around to the same point again.  Finally, I found where I was missing the boat and got back on track, but not before Lightning, who was supposed to meet me at the gate to let me out, decided to go looking for me.  I finally topped the hill and saw him, and I saw him break into a smile when he saw me.  I knew what he was thinking - how was he going to tell his daddy he lost his mama on Mother's Day???  We rode back out together so I wouldn't get lost again, and just in the nick of daylight.  So much for boxing more after we got done out there.
