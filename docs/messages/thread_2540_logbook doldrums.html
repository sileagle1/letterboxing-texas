<div>One thing I have really 
enjoyed about postal letterboxes is seeing the amazing logbooks that people 
create.  Usually they are much more elaborate than anything you would make 
for a regular box in the wild, but it is really amazing to see the ideas and 
details people put into their logs.  One was even an origami star that 
pulled out to reveal places for stamping...truly amazing!  I just love to 
see what people come up with!  MO5</div></body></html>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="244262411-26012007">Well - just another example of my lack of imagination, poor 
artistic ability, and time-compression.  It probably all relates to 
time.  If I had the time, I could sit and imagine other stuff.  Once I 
come up with an idea I am usually successful in making it 
work.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="244262411-26012007">For now, my log books are simple, black, 3x5 inches, of 
good heavy paper, and cost $3 at Hobby Lobby.  This is a good thing.  
If making letterboxes required me to make the log books and carve the stamps, 
there would be no letterboxes in El Paso.  Because I wouldn't be a 
letterboxer.  And the two boxes that do not belong to me in El Paso would 
be gone.  One was stolen, and I re-hid it.  The other would have been 
lost in the on-going flood-damage clean-up.</span></div>
<div> </div>
<div><span class="244262411-26012007">Ah-well.....  0430, time to hit the road for work.  It is 
raining and I am so tired today.....  and I have to spend a few hours 
working on electronics in the rain - high above the ground today.  Maybe 
the boss will call it off for safety.  Then again, people need electricity 
- rain or not.  Maybe he will give me a helper so I am not alone out there 
at the remote site.</span></div>

I just signed up for my very first postal and now I'm getting freaked out. It's the Quilt Block Swap. We are going to send out 19 6x6 quilt squares and then we'll get 19 to go with the 1 we kept. By the time the postal is done, we'll have a quilt to make. Cool huh, till you made me think of the log book. AHHHHHH! What do I do?</div> <div> </div> <div>Oh and for when the stamps come in to me (and I think some of the others) I am going to stamp them on a 5x7 mat board (or something like that) and frame it so that I have a "picture" of the stamps.

                    <html><body><div>This reminds me in a very indirect way of something I did when I was 15 - I was on an 8 week bus trip with 32 other people through the Great Northwest.  Every time I sent a letter home, I had everyone on the bus, most of whom were insanely creative or at least caught up in the spirit of such a trip, sign the envelope with short messages of their own or artwork.  The envelopes wound up awfully cluttered and looking back I'm surprised they ever got home - poor postman.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I ran across a few of those envelopes a few months ago and they were truly works of art!  They were visually appealing and spoke volumes about the mood of the moment both on our bus and in the world of that time.  I can imagine that having a page that opens out to allow folks to stamp anywhere they want and that forces people to stamp closely to conserve space would create the same sort of effect.  And I guess that is one of my frustrations with standard logbooks - by having page after page, we inadvertantly find ourselves conforming to the expected and "staying inside the lines".
