<div>Okay, I got a call from my sister-in-law, TX Flutterby, last evening while I was on my way home from Palestine where I dropped the Tour Bus and another box.  I told her she'd better check the list and hustle to get the Tour Bus, but she reminded me that she's a little out of range - she's in Maryland, heading to Delaware and going to pass through Connecticut and Cape Cod and all points east of us, not necessarily in that order.  Her LSS got a gig driving someone's personal vehicle to the East Coast so the vehicle owner can have it while he's there, and meanwhile the guy paid for their family vacation - some people have all the luck!  So she's driving around up there in LB country - and she forgot her logbook and her stamp and didn't take ANY clues.  She IS a newbie after all, so she'll learn - I told her "a dollar store and a library will fix you right up!"

<div>To make me more envious, it turns out Lightning is going to get to make the second half of that trip - the one to go pick the vehicle back up - in about ten days.  He's going to get to ride shotgun with my brother-in-law, and he's poised to begin planning which boxes they'll get when he finds out their itinerary.  Some people's kids...what a last minute odyssey before starting back to school!
