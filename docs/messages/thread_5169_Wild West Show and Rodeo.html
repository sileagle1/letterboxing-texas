                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, this was fun! I learned some tricks and skills from the best Wild West Show & Rodeo performers out there! From sharp shooting, to rope tricks and trick riding. I didn’t dare attempt the bull riding, but really enjoyed watching the best of the best. I learned that barrel racing is not a sport for the faint of heart. As one racer explained to me: “3 barrels, 2 hearts, 1 dream”! You’ve got to love these people. But it finally had to come to and end as the show must move on. Be sure to catch them when they’re in your area!<br>
<br>
•	Next show: The Greenbelt, 8 miles east of Denton, Texas.<br>
•	From Dallas/Fort Worth, go North on I-35W to 380 (University DR) in Denton, Texas<br>
•	Turn Right (East), and go approximately 8 miles to trailhead clearly marked on North side of road.<br>
•	Park in parking lot. Register your car at the kiosk.<br>
•	Go north on the trail approximately one mile until the trail crosses under a railroad track<br>
•	Go right at the track to the second trestle and look under the SPOR for the box!<br>

<div class="MsoNormal" style="margin: 0in 0in 0pt;"><font size="3"><font face="Comic Sans MS, sans-serif">I heard that the Wild West Show, having just left McKinney,
was hanging out in the Denton area camping under a railroad trestle, so I
reckoned they were hoping to get on a little farther down southwest to Ft.
Worth, aka Cowtown, City of Cowboys and Culture, to do a little sightseeing and
visiting and enjoying the western heritage.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> 
</span>So I beat it up there to find the cowboys and cowgirls and invite them
to stay with me a spell and let me host them while they check out some of the local
western color: the National Cowgirl Hall of Fame, Will Rogers Arena (home of
the Ft Worth Stock Show and Rodeo), and of course the Ft. Worth Stockyards to
see the daily longhorn cattle drive on Exchange Avenue, Saturday night rodeo,
Walk of Fame, and other Wild West attractions centered here. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes;"> </span>I overheard them saying as how they are hoping
to lure a famous local Wild West performer to join their show, so we’ll just
see how that goes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">   </span>I’m a little
concerned though at just what all they might be getting up to while they are
here, since they seem to be a rowdy bunch given to ridin’, shootin’ and
drinkin’ (not necessarily in that order), and who knows what else, so I’m
hoping to move them right along as soon as they indicate a willingness to relocate
once again, probably soon!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes;">  </span>Keep your
horses saddled and ready to go!<?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" /><o:p></o:p></font></font></div>

<div><span>I received a call from Frost Maiden last night inviting me to come up to see her in Burleson. This was somewhat unusual as our standing dinner date night is Wednesday. In any case, I complied and when I arrived I discovered the wildest Wild West Show and Rodeo imaginable being performed in her yard! It made me want to holler "Yee-Haw!" (I refrained.) I pass this information on so that any who may have been planning to see the show in Fort Worth could be advised that the entire troupe is back in rehearsal mode, auditioning a new act -- or maybe two. I will provide fair warning should I discover further future plans for this extravaganza.</span></div>

<div class="yiv795374434MsoNormal"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">Those Wild West and Rodeo performers with
their crazy buffalo, bulls and horses!<span>  </span>Try
to keep a low profile with your neighbors entertaining these guys awhile!<span>  </span>They were eager to visit the National Cowgirl
Hall of Fame, see the Russells and Remingtons at the Amon Carter Museum of Art,
watch a few cutting horse shows at Will Rogers, and then head on over to the FW
Stockyards for some whoopin’ and hollerin’ at the White Elephant Saloon, but
pretty soon things just got out of hand when they hit Sundance Square.<span>  </span>Since they wanted to meet Tad Lucas, Rodeo’s
First Lady, I took them out to see her at Rose Hill and while they were
wandering around out there, I left them!<span> 
</span>That’s where you can find them if you hurry, and along the way, you may
want to stop and find The Cowgirls letterbox that I placed near Ms.Lucas' marker
in her honor, too, so here are both sets of clues.</span></div>

<div class="yiv795374434MsoNormal"><u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">To find the Cowgirls Letterbox</span></u><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">:<span>  </span>Ft. Worth, Shannon Rose
Hill Cemetery,7301 E Lancaster, approx 2 mi E of Loop 820. Enter Main Cemetery
entrance on East side of parking lot through main gate and continue uphill
around stone wall.<span>  </span>Follow roads
generally going to right and downhill toward East side of cemetery to cemetery road
paralleling fence along Sandy Lane, then left (N) and continue towards back of
cemetery along road that parallels fence.<span> 
</span>Watch for set of short concrete steps on left going uphill, and then
look for single stone marker about 4 ½ <span> </span>ft
<span> </span>tall on hill on left:<span>  </span>TAD LUCAS.<span> 
</span>Park along here (If you reach Temple 23 on curb at curve in road, you’ve
just passed it). After paying respects to Tad Lucas, look to right past second
set of steps to find Huddleston marker. Cowgirls box is under boxwood shrub
next to Herman Clyde. (NOTE: The Cowgirls letterbox is to remain in place, not
travel with the Wild West Show.<span>  </span>I added
a stamp for Ms. Lucas to the Wild West Show and Rodeo since she wanted to join
the tour)<br/>
<br/>
<u>To find the Wild West Show and Rodeo</u>:<span> 
</span>From the Tad Lucas marker, continue to left around curve with old stone
chapel up on hill ahead, toward maintenance barn. Just past Schmidt, park at
the sidewalk on the right near a small lone cedar. Follow the walk N to Nguyen
and turn left to end of walk at maintenance area fence.<span>  </span>Look under tall bushes next to fence where
walk ends.</span></div>

<div class="yiv795374434MsoNormal"><span style="color: black; font-size: 10pt;">OR:  just head on back toward the N end of the cemetery toward the maintenance area, look for the fence, walk, bushes, and grab the WW box and go!</span></div>
