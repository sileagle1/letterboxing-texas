    Okay, I think I have the TCM part figured out. It is interesting how
    many places in Central Texas have TCM connections.  Now that I know
    about this box I doubt I'm going to be able to wait until March to
    go check it out!<br/>

<br>
If y'all want to hear about what happened to Baby Bear and I the day we found TCM, look at message #183 in this List:<br>

http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/message/183<br>

Once y'all have figured out what the location is you will understand how creepy we felt.<br>

&gt; &gt; I was looking through my old notes I found clues to another letterbox <br/>
&gt; &gt; placed by the Mattke family during the first TX letterbox event held <br/>
&gt; &gt; at Bastrop SP. They gave me a slip of paper with the clues <br/>
&gt; &gt; hand-written on it so Baby Bear and I could look for it after the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Event. They intended to post the clues on LBNA but never did, so I <br/>
&gt; &gt; doubt anyone else ever got to look for the box. The letterbox is <br/>
&gt; &gt; called TCM and I have scanned the original note and placed it in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Files section of this List. Not sure if the box is still there but the <br/>
&gt; &gt; location is worth going to (it is not in Bastrop SP). After looking at <br/>
&gt; &gt; the clues, see if you can figure out what TCM stands for and what is <br/>
&gt; &gt; significant about its location.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Silver Eagle<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; Okay, I think I have the TCM part figured out. It is interesting how <br/>
&gt; many places in Central Texas have TCM connections.  Now that I know <br/>
&gt; about this box I doubt I'm going to be able to wait until March to go <br/>
&gt; check it out!<br/>

&gt; BTW - Park &amp; Hide was still in place and in great shape a year ago.<br/>
