doing too much boxing latley.  Now that summer is here we will be <br>
getting out again.  I am very sorry to read that Hershey's kiss has <br>
gone missing again, I'll try to get out there soon and see what I can <br>
do about it.  We have visitors for the next two weeks, so it will <br>
have to be after that.  I'll let you know what I find.  Any <br>
suggestions on how to get boxes to stay put?  -Mother of four<br>
