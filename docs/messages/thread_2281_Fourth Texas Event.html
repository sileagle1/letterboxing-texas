a little more trail.  I know the first event was held in Bastrop, but many 
Texas boxers weren't letterboxing at the time (or had rodeo tickets that day, 
ahem-ahem) maybe we could consider that park again.  In my humble opinion 
it is one of the prettiest parks in Texas.  But we'll go wherever you

                    <html><body><div>I agree about the trail space - while the Rusk area has a lot of good trail, that park didn't and I think we need to have lots of trail in close proximity to the gathering area.  Of course, I think that's less important if the event is lower-key and doesn't have a lot going on at ground zero, so we can spread further out to find and plant.

<div>I would rather go to a different park we haven't been to before, but if there were a lot of votes in favor of Bastrop, I wouldn't mind going back there - it really is a beautiful part of the state and there are tons of trails.  It's funny looking at that area now, because at the time of the first gathering, my surrounding area (say, 8 counties around me) had &lt;10 boxes and I thought I was going to heaven when I saw how many Bastrop had!  I just checked the Bastrop listings and my county now has about five times as many boxes as Bastrop County!
