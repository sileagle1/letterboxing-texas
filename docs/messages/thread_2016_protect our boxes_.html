</p><div>I have heard from several of our esteemed Texas letterboxers recently that some of their boxes which have been hidden and safe for a long time have recently gone missing, have be found left out in the open, or have been vandalized. We are lucky to have so many new letterboxers joining our ranks recently and this is an opportunity for us to all have more people finding our boxes and hiding more for us to find. It might be a good time however, to remind letterboxers that it is important to take your time when searching for boxes to make sure you are not being observed while removing or replacing the boxes, and to especially take the time to repack the boxes carefully, sealing the baggies well and making sure the lids are back on tightly.  Please recover the box well and make sure before walking away from the box location to double check and make sure the box is not visible. You may have to take a minute or two to find a few more pieces of bark or another rock to recover the box, but doing so will insure that the box is safe and will not be accidentally found by passersby.  Finding the box and stamping into the logbook is only part of the sport; rehiding it so that it will remain safe and will be found by boxers for years to come is the other part. I think if you make a decision to go looking for a letterbox, you need to realize by doing so, you have a responsibility to all the other letterboxers to do all you can do to protect and preserve that box. By taking the time to rehide the box well will help insure that the box can continue to "live on" for a long time. Most of us really enjoy reading back through the older box's logbooks and seeing who all has found the box before us. To me, that's even more fun than being a first finder. Last spring when I was up in CT, I had so much fun reading through logbooks and seeing the signatures of some of the "infamous old-timers" of letterboxing fame like Wanda and Pete, and other notables. The more involved you become in the sport, the more meaning this will have for you. There are some very interesting and notable boxers in Texas that I am always thrilled to find have taken the time to discover and stamp into my boxes.  I've had several boxes reported missing this week which had been out there for awhile, and I plan to replace a couple of them, but the sad part is that the original logbooks with some really cool stamps will not be in it for others to enjoy. Of course, that is the nature of the game, but as letterboxers, we should all be equally inspired to want to protect the boxes we have found for others to find and enjoy.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for your consideration, and thank you to all those letterboxers who have found my boxes and taken such good care of them!</div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <html><body><div>I so appreciate what PuddleSplasher wrote about practicing care because I'm smarting a bit from the near destruction of one of my favorite boxes - Killough Monument.  Silver Eagle passed through my area yesterday and emailed me to let me know he had been to find Killough and found it in very rough shape.  I went to check on it this evening to see the damage for myself, and Silver Eagle had very clearly put big effort into making it look more like a letterbox yesterday, but he was right - it looked terrible.  I am thankful he fixed the box as best he could and then let me know so I could decide what to do about the whole situation.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Something clearly happened to my box box between late June when I checked up on it and it was fine, and yesterday.  I can't really tell what that was, but I do know it is a box that you don't just stumble upon.  Since I replaced it last year (my first choice of hiding spot out there was - well - foolish, and it disappeared almost immediately), it has been a reliable box with a good hide and easy to recover.  It's even animal proof.  All in all, a low risk box.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm terribly sad that my box has been through the wringer, but I'm probably most upset because one of the stamps that sustained a lot of damage is Celtic Lions'.  Ruby Tuesday encouraged me last year to replace that box before her and Stillwater's visit to this area, and I did it for her.  I had dragged my feet on replacing it because I was upset to have lost it the first time, but I felt really good about it after I put it back out there.  We then had a great visit at the local coffee house that weekend, and every time I checked that box and saw their stamp, it made me smile and remember that time.  I've got their stamp in other boxes and in my logbook, and I'll have other opportunities to get it again, but it was the convergence of time, place, and good company that made that particular copy of their stamp special.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have no reason to believe that a letterboxer's lack of diligence is to blame for what happened to Killough.  Things happen to boxes and it is hard on placers to have to deal with it, especially for special boxes.  It is often hard on previous finders too, who have formed some type of attachment to a box by virtue of the adventure of the find.  However, "things happen" isn't a good reason to compound the risk to a box by being careless with it.  In fact, "things happen" should be a reason to make sure they don't happen as a direct result of poor hiding or other careless handling.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If a finder understands that by finding a box, they are becoming a part of the box's history and an interconnection of boxers through that particular logbook, I think they are careful to respect that history and their place in it.  I tend to think of a box as a living, breathing thing because, while I know it is inanimate, it is an expression of everyone who has ever touched it.

<div>You describe quite well the emotional effect of losing a creation.  And every point you make is right on the money - don't let it kill you, don't let it defeat you, just persevere.  YOU ARE RIGHT.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - the fact that a placer should be philosophical about losing a box isn't a reason for finders to be careless.  In fact, if a finder reads your description of the work you put into making a cache/box, they should realize how important it is to put the same degree of work into helping to preserve it through cautious handling - recovering well mainly.

<div>I loved your Killough Monument Box, Lucy, and am sad that it's been 
vandalized.  I agree, reading the logbooks is one of the best things about 
finding boxes that have been in place for awhile, and I always feel honored to 
add my stamp to the logbook.  It's sad when the logbook disappears.  
You can always recarve stamps, but logbooks are treasures!  So far, at 
least to my knowledge I've only lost one letterbox out of about 30 I've 
created, but it was the very first stamp I'd ever carved, from a drawing done by 
my granddaughter, and I was sad to lose it even though I've replaced it.  
But lately, I've found many of my boxes left sort of casually lying on top 
of the bark, rocks, etc. that I'd gathered to cover them, or the bags not sealed 
inside.  I've had at least one logbook totally soaked - the finder who 
reported it to me had discovered the box and contents scattered on the ground 
near its hiding place, but at least all the contents were still there even 
though most of the original stamps and notes are now unreadable.  Thanks 
for the reminders.  Every letterboxer feels frustration finding a 
soggy logbook or when a search ends without finding the box at all because its 
gone missing, and its up to all of us finders to be sure we aren't the person 
responsible for that missing box by exercising caution and care finding and 
replacing them. When you do replace your box, I'll go back and restamp it!

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As best I recall:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had a gathering back in the fall in Waxahachie called the JEN Barnraising.  The idea was to plant boxes throughout a three county area that had no boxes.  Several folks planted boxes at the gathering, and some planted boxes in the gathering area after the fact.  Strawberry planted two or three boxes just prior to the gathering.  Silver Eagle was one who planted a box after the event.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One box was found by park staff.  I think it made them a little uneasy, and one of them went and did an internet search based on the park name, and somehow came up with Silver Eagle's box.  Coincidentally the box found was near a well, and Silver Eagle's clues said recover well.  Apparently that was enough to send park staff over the edge, and they emailed Silver Eagle and chastised him for planting a box near the well.  They told him he could plant out in the woods and open areas, but please to stay away from the buildings.  He was puzzled because his box was nowhere near any kind of structure!  He posted to our list with his puzzlement, thinking someone must have found his box and taken it away from its spot and it turned up near a structure.  Between his ongoing communication with them and with us, we finally figured out it was one of Strawberry's boxes and what had them so upset was that they thought that to find the box we were supposed to uncover the well - well gee!  I'd be upset too - that would be really dangerous!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got it all sorted out and had a great laugh about it.  Of course, Strawberry had no intentions of anyone uncovering any well to find her box, and Silver Eagle's box was still where it belonged, and his clue only said "recover well" - they didn't say "Recover THE well".  The confusion came when they tried to track down the placer of the discovered box (Strawberry's) and found clues (Silver Eagle's) that appeared to relate to the well location.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - when you see in clues the phrase "Recover well", you are now part of the inside joke.  Yes, it is a caution to rehide properly, but it is also an opportunity for a private chuckle at the site of a box.

 because I'm smarting a bit from the near destruction of one of my favorite boxes - Killough Monument.  Silver Eagle passed through my area yesterday and emailed me to let me know he had been to find Killough and found it in very rough shape.  I went to check on it this evening to see the damage for myself, and Silver Eagle had very clearly put big effort into making it look more like a letterbox yesterday, but he was right - it looked terrible.  I am thankful he fixed the box as best he could and then let me know so I could decide what to do about the whole situation. </div> <div> </div> <div>Something clearly happened to my box box between late June when I checked up on it and it was fine, and yesterday.  I can't really tell what that was, but I do know it is a box that you don't just stumble upon.  Since I replaced it last year (my first choice of hiding spot out there was - well - foolish, and it disappeared almost
 immediately)<wbr>, it has been a reliable box with a good hide and easy to recover.  It's even animal proof.  All in all, a low risk box. </wbr></div> <div> </div> <div>I'm terribly sad that my box has been through the wringer, but I'm probably most upset because one of the stamps that sustained a lot of damage is Celtic Lions'.  Ruby Tuesday encouraged me last year to replace that box before her and Stillwater's visit to this area, and I did it for her.  I had dragged my feet on replacing it because I was upset to have lost it the first time, but I felt really good about it after I put it back out there.  We then had a great visit at the local coffee house that weekend, and every time I checked that box and saw their stamp, it made me smile and remember that time.  I've got their stamp in other boxes and in my logbook, and I'll have other opportunities to get it again, but it was the convergence of time, place, and good company that
 made that particular copy of their stamp special.   </div> <div> </div> <div>I have no reason to believe that a letterboxer'<wbr>s lack of diligence is to blame for what happened to Killough.  Things happen to boxes and it is hard on placers to have to deal with it, especially for special boxes.  It is often hard on previous finders too, who have formed some type of attachment to a box by virtue of the adventure of the find.  However, "things happen" isn't a good reason to compound the risk to a box by being careless with it.  In fact, "things happen" should be a reason to make sure they don't happen as a direct result of poor hiding or other careless handling. </wbr></div> <div> </div> <div>If a finder understands that by finding a box, they are becoming a part of the box's history and an interconnection of boxers through that particular logbook, I think they are careful to respect that history and their place in it.  I
 tend to think of a box as a living, breathing thing because, while I know it is inanimate, it is an expression of everyone who has ever touched it. </div> <div> </div> <div>BarefootLucy</div> <div>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"</div> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/></div></blockquote></body></html>
