                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I'm about to babble, in case anyone else wants to run with this idea...<br/>
<br/>
I was just thinking about how cool it could be to start kids on<br/>
letterboxing by having a local event where people swap stamp imprints<br/>
instead of candy treats at Halloween.<br/>
<br/>
Here's one way to work with really little guys, to create their own<br/>
rubber stamps:<br/>
<br/>
Use styrofoam trays from the produce and meat departments at the<br/>
grocery store.<br/>
<br/>
As a negative print, kids can use a pencil (broader/duller points are<br/>
better) to impress a design onto the styrofoam.  The wider the<br/>
line/impression, the better.  But, this will create a short-term<br/>
rubber stamp.<br/>
<br/>
(The foam--like all plastic--has a "memory" and will slowly fill in<br/>
the area that was pushed down with the pencil.  Experiment to find one<br/>
that's very slow to remember, before you do this with kids.)<br/>
<br/>
As a positive print, even kiddie scissors usually cut styrofoam. <br/>
Children can cut out cool shapes (think Matisse) and glue them onto a<br/>
wooden cube (from Michael's, etc., wood sections).  You may need to<br/>
build up a few layers, or use double-stick foam insulation tape (a<br/>
thin version is made by 3M and sold at office supply stores, or you<br/>
can get the thicker kind at Wal-Mart, etc.) and this will raise the<br/>
cut-out shape above the wood support.<br/>
<br/>
These will usually print with pigment-type rubber stamp pads, if the<br/>
stamps resist the ink on the dye pads.  Worst case, you can use<br/>
water-based block printing ink. (Saturate a square of felt from the<br/>
fabric store, to make your own ink pad for this.)<br/>
<br/>
There is actually a foam sheet that is ideal for this kind of project,<br/>
if you can find it at art supply stores.  I haven't used it in<br/>
forever, and I've forgotten what it's called.  They usually keep it in<br/>
the section for that's for grade school teachers.<br/>
<br/>
Of course, you can work with regular rubber stamp supplies, for older kids.<br/>
<br/>
Taking this ahead to spring, wouldn't it be fun to hide letterboxing<br/>
stamps in big (L'eggs-type) plastic eggs and hide them for the annual<br/>
Easter Egg hunt!<br/>
<br/>
Am I reinventing the wheel?  Are other people already doing this?  I<br/>
can see this organized by the children's room at a public library, at<br/>
a church, by a Scouting group, homeschoolers, etc.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, that's what's running through my brain this sunny Saturday.<br/>
<br/>
