                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I've gotten a good bit of feedback on dates and<br/>
I've been doing some research about the Johnson Ellis<br/>
Navarro (JEN) area, so here is the beginning of a<br/>
plan.<br/>
<br/>
Date:  10/23/05<br/>
Base:  Waxahachie<br/>
<br/>
I'm sorry to those couple folks who said they couldn't<br/>
be there the 23rd - that just seems to be the date<br/>
when the fewest folks had conflicts.<br/>
<br/>
Waxahachie is the dead center of the three counties. <br/>
I felt like that was important because of the nature<br/>
of what we'll be doing - we'll be scattering in the<br/>
morning to plant, then regathering around noon to EAT<br/>
and EXCHANGE, then going off to find.<br/>
<br/>
I checked with my scouter friends who are more<br/>
familiar with that area than I am, and they tell me<br/>
there is no camping except RV camping in or around<br/>
Waxahachie.  The closest camping is Bardwell Lake,<br/>
operated by the Army Corps of Engineers, about 20<br/>
miles away.  My family will be camping there in all<br/>
likelihood.  I understand it's nice camping (bear in<br/>
mind, that "nice" in scout terms, so that may not be<br/>
heavy on amenities, but they do compare it to State<br/>
Parks).  Here's the website for the Bardwell camping<br/>
area closest to Waxahachie.<br/>
<br/>
http://www.swf-wc.usace.army.mil/bardwell/main.htm<br/>
<br/>
Right now, I'm trying to get as complete a list as I<br/>
can of towns in the three counties, and I will follow<br/>
that with some historical background and listings of<br/>
parks and trails, so that those who want to<br/>
participate can come armed with ideas and boxes.  If<br/>
anyone wants to help with this (or any) part of the<br/>
project, let me know!<br/>
<br/>
I've got my eye on a park in Waxahachie to set up as a<br/>
home base.  I'm hoping we can have power so we can<br/>
have a computer to post clues to, to make clue<br/>
distribution easier and to make posting to LBNA<br/>
possible right away.<br/>
<br/>
I am going to set up a webpage here shortly to post<br/>
updates to, and I'll post the information I have so<br/>
far there and then shoot the link out to y'all!<br/>

The CelticLions want to create a ghostly box for that haunted restaurant in<br/>

ever dined there?<br/>
