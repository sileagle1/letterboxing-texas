&gt;...By the way, I never mark a box as attempted even if I'm pretty sure I'm in the right place, because I don't know what the point is. There was a box on the Pacific Coast Trail that I spent about two hours searching for and finally decided it was missing and gave up. A few weeks later, it was found by other letterboxers, so obviously I was not in the right place. It happens. Glad I didn't allow my ego to mark it as attempted.<br/>
