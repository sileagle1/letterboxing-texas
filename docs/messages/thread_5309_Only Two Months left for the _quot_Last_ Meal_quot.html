Can't wait to see you all, and see all the stamps carved for TALE 11! Ready to camp, visit, and stamp in a few logbooks!<br/>Blue Butterfly<br/></p></body>

<p>It's very casual and friendly. Seriously, everyone is anxious to meet everyone else and exchange stamps with them. The day really passes too quickly as there are so many people to see and hopefully you'll plan to stay an extra day to find all those incredible boxes that have been hidden just prior to the event (most of which you can't get the clues to until the event). There's a pot luck lunch (outstanding), a group photo, and other events usually planned (as well as the dinner the night before). Trust me, you will not feel like an outsider... because you're NOT! You're a Texas Letterboxer and that's what the event is all about. Come and have fun.</p>
