21 June 2006<br/>
I've followed a camouflage bus from south east Texas to a small town <br/>
called Nacogdoches.  The bus pulled in this evening to a forest, <br/>
which is apparently operated by the local college.  <br/>
<br/>
22 June 2006<br/>
I watched the people on the bus last night.  There seem to be all <br/>
kinds of people...politicians, athletes, musicians, and others.  I'm <br/>
not exactly sure why all of these people are traveling together.  It <br/>
must be some sort of illegal activity. <br/>
<br/>
This morning, the bus moved to a residential area in Nacogdoches.  I <br/>
reported my findings to the Chief, and he said to continue my <br/>
observations.  <br/>
<br/>
26 June 2006<br/>
The riders of the bus got on again this morning, but it looks like <br/>
they've added two people.  They appear to be Tex Ritter and <br/>
Frederick Fennell.  Once again, I have no idea what these people <br/>
have in common.  <br/>
<br/>
I followed the cammo bus out of Nacogdoches on 259.  They are headed <br/>
north.  When they got to Mt. Enterprise, they turned East onto 84.  <br/>
My guess was they are headed for another secluded area.  I was <br/>
right.  They went about two miles, then they pulled off on the side <br/>
of the road.  This bus must have four wheel drive, because they went <br/>
right into the woods!  When I realized where they pulled in, I <br/>
stopped at the head of the Griff Ross trail and decided to leave my <br/>
car at the small parking area.  <br/>
<br/>
I walked along the trail, and when I came to a T, I followed the bus <br/>
tracks to the right.  I walked along, and when I came to a sign that <br/>
said WHITE OAK, I stopped and pretended to read the sign.  Actually, <br/>
I was listening for the noise of this rowdy bunch.  Sure enough, I <br/>
could hear them.  I went 15 steps from the White Oak sign, and <br/>
looked left.  I could see the camo bus.  It is behind a pine tree <br/>
about 8 steps off the trail.  I'll find a place to camp out and see <br/>
what happens next. <br/>
