                    <div class="plaintext-content">These events just get better and better! There are always plenty of new people to meet, old friends to see, good fun, plenty of laughs, yummy food, exchanges to make, and great boxes to find! I'm never disappointed, and this was no exception. What a fun group of people. You letterboxers just outdid yourselves with clever, fun boxes to find too! Thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for bringing us all together once again and hosting such a fun event. I LOVED this park! Viewfinder and I did the "Steep Step Trail" today and it was amazingly beautiful - and exhausting! The dogwoods in that canyon were gorgeous. Thanks LSQ and Boots for telling us about it!<br/>

And to top it all off, we got back to the car and found a cootie left by Goofy Girl - it was a pair of boy's tighty whities complete with inky brown skid marks - and a logbook and stamp inside. Ewww. We all laughed so hard. It was a terrific end to a terrific day. Thanks for all your creativity and all your great boxes. And thanks to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for organizing it sll!<br/>
