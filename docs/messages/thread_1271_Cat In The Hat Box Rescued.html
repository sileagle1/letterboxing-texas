<div>Believe it or not, the park personnel was extremely interested and helpful - even to the point to bringing out maps and showing us other possible places to locate the boxes! We hiked around the Caprock Trail twice, once to retreve the boxes and scout for good locations, then again to place the boxes and write (and double check) the clues. I used to enjoy hiking out there before I had moved to CT five years ago, so it was fun for me to get to go back and hike that area again. We actually spent two and a half hours out there, so by the time we left it was "good and hot"! That meant we had to hit a favorite restaurant of mine in the area for fried green tomatoes and iced tea for our reward! I surely LOVE being back home in TEXAS!</div>

Kudos to Puddlesplasher and Viewfinder for being the<br/>
heroes of the day.  Always nice to know we can count<br/>
on each other to catch our backs when we're out of<br/>
range...<br/>
