                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just want to publicly thank Lucy for the wonderful box that she put <br/>
out yesterday for Joan and I.  Yesterday was the 4 month "anniversary" <br/>
of Joan's death, and I am sure that she would be so happy that she was <br/>
honored in such a way.  The first box that Joan and I found was at the <br/>
footbridge, so placing the Friends are Friends Forever box at the <br/>
footbridge was perfect.  Lucy, you are a wonderful friend.  I thank <br/>
you from the bottom of my heart.  Joan was a wonderful friend.  The <br/>
last 4 months have been tremendously hard on me, and letterboxing has <br/>
kept me going.  I do not post a lot of messages on the board, but I <br/>
feel as though the people in this group have become my friends, even <br/>
though I have yet to have the privilege of meeting most of you.  This <br/>
hobby has also helped to bring me closer to my mom, who has gone on <br/>
several adventures with me, and my cousin who lives in grand prairie, <br/>
who I have managed to hook into the hobby.  Again thank you to Lucy <br/>
for not only the Friends box, but also for being there for me, and <br/>
also to all of you for making the last few months more bearable.<br/>
JB<br/>
