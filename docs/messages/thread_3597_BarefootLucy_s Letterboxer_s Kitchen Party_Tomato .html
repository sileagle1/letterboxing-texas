room, and<br/>
&gt; study, so more folks are welcomed to this event!  It may be a tight<br/>
fit, but<br/>
&gt; it's gonna be fun because there will be letterboxers and food, and a<br/>
&gt; festival a few blocks away (everything is just a few blocks away in<br/>
&gt; Jacksonville) for those who can't resist a good main street party!<br/>

&gt; Pampered Chef, email me privately and I'll tell you how to do it (or<br/>
I'll<br/>
