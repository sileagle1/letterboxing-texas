For those that don't know, in late 2006 we set a goal to color in all the counties of TX by placing at least 1 box in every county that did not have one.  We set no time constraint, but I never dreamed we would complete it in less than 3 years.  Thanks to all that contributed!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Because some of these boxes are very remote and don't get visited much, they tend to vulnerable.  Many of them are the only box in the county.  I have some fairly remote boxes that have been planted for almost a year and have never been found.  If you get the opportunity to go find any of the boxes that are "on the road less traveled", why not consider taking a box to place.  That way, if you don't find the planted box, you can leave one so that the next person has one to find.  The recent box planted in Terrell County is very remote and El Lobo went considerably out of his way to place it.  Thanks, El Lobo and Star Seeker, for placing those boxes.  They live in Midland and so most of their placed boxes tend to be in the western part of the state, so maybe you haven't had the chance to find any, but I can tell you from experience that their boxes and stamps are of very high quality and worth going out of the way to find, should you find yourself out that way.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I know everyone is still sad over Blooming Flowers, but I would like to acknowledge a huge milestone in TX LB history.  This last weekend, El Lobo placed letterboxes in the last 2 virgin counties (Crane &amp; Terrell), thus allowing us to color in the entire state!  I sent the webmasters an updated TX Clue map with all counties colored green and they have already posted it.  I also uploaded the final map to the Files section of this List showing counties added by year since we started this quest in late 2006.  You can also see an old TX Clue map in the Files section from that time period and marvel at how far we have come.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; For those that don't know, in late 2006 we set a goal to color in all the counties of TX by placing at least 1 box in every county that did not have one.  We set no time constraint, but I never dreamed we would complete it in less than 3 years.  Thanks to all that contributed!  <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That's not a bad idea.  Since this is Texas, the rest of the country would probably be disappointed if we didn't brag a little bit.  Out of curiosity, I looked up the states with the most counties and was a little surprised.  Alaska only has 29 (what's the point of a county with no people and nothing but ice to stand on?).  Montana, the 3rd largest state, only has 56 and California only has 58.  The state with the second-most counties, which surprised me, is Georgia, with 159, but fewer than 100 have letterboxes.  Like good Texans, we deserve to pat ourselves on the back!<br/>

<br/>One box does not make a county an established letterboxing area, does it? For one thing, one box can go missing far more quickly than ten boxes. For another, it's harder to entice finders to go across one of those big honking huge West Texas counties to go after one box. Sad but true. Heck, folks don't even like to visit a relatively local park unless there are a bunch of boxes to find!<br/>
<br/>Personally, I don't mind a box sitting out there for months or even years without a finder - in fact, I have a two year old box (almost three years old) that has never been found in Arkansas. I really look forward to the day it is found so I can celebrate the experience of the location with the finder. My secret fear is that it is gone though. But one of these days it will either be found or I'll revisit it and know for sure. Anyway, all of this to say, one box has a lot more difficult time thriving than a few boxes and some placers get discouraged when their boxes aren't found.<br/>
<br/>On the other hand, my fear is that we overplant. I've said it before, so I won't dwell on it. But I just don't enjoy Easter egg hunting along a trail because part of my enjoyment of letterboxing is enjoying the location as I enjoy the letterboxing. A few well-placed boxes enhances the location - a plethora of boxes tossed along the trail takes away from it. But that's my .02...<br/>
<br/>I have to admit, I planted one box specifically so I could green a county (I think I greened some others, but they were boxes I wanted to plant specifically). It wasn't a great hide although everyone who has found it has said kind words about it, but I did it on my way to Arkansas in a county that really has no reason to exist. Once other boxes find their way into that county, it won't hurt my feelings for that box to go away - it was sort of a placeholder, rather than a hidden jewel.<br/>
<br/>It was exciting in the early days to look at that drab brown map and realize the state was wide open, or just about, for planting. And hasn't it been satisfying to watch it fill up? That's one way that I feel badly for new boxers coming along. They didn't get to experience the thrill of watching Texas become a bona fide letterboxing state. HOWEVER, they may not get to green a Texas county, but they can sure follow behind those of us who did and place better boxes than those placeholder boxes that are out there!<br/>
<br/>Some of you remember the JEN Barnraising - either because you attended or because there was much talk about it. We had a gathering for the specific purpose of planting boxes in Johnson, Ellis, and Navarro counties, just south of Dallas, which all had NO boxes at all. It was a planting gathering, not a finding gathering, although we had fun finding the boxes we had planted and trying to figure out Gryzzled Gryphon's clues for his contribution. We planted them, then left them behind as gifts to future boxers in that area - at that time there was only Delivery Girl, and she was brand new!<br/>
<br/>The beauty of letterboxing is in its creativity. All the counties may be covered, but that doesn't mean there are no more new and interesting ways to add to our great activity. Just as PI Joe recently changed the game up a bit by introducing Treasure Hiking, and TeamKing introduced the Tour Bus to us and has kept us entertained for a few years now, and just as Ruby Tuesday set out that unbelievably awesome Clue game at the second gathering, and as Dewberry and Mother of 5 have done some over the top gatherings with wickedly interesting twists and turns, and BootsTex and his Murder at the Arboretum, and Silver Eagle's game series, and Puddle Splasher lurks about trying to find ways to turn over the apple cart...the list goes on.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Okay, I just reread Boots' question, and I veered a little off-topic although I stand by what I said.<br/><br/>In my opinion, I do NOT think it was a bad thing to rush to get boxes where there were no boxers. If we want to cultivate new boxers, we have to have boxes somewhat close to them. <br/>
<br/>As in my case, six and a half years ago, it was only because I had a little leverage on the day that I was able to convince Fearless Fox to travel an hour and a half on a "maybe." If Silver Eagle and Baby Bear had only planted in the Houston area because that's where they were more like to be found, I never would have become a letterboxer.<br/>
<br/>Boots, I know how much you like to know your boxes are being found and kept well, but I'm so glad you put some out there where it may take awhile to be found. Future boxes will appreciate you for it as the rest of us appreciate your and LSQ's outstanding boxes. I'll bet you didn't like waiting on Christmas when you were a kid either, did you?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm really not lamenting the fact that some of those boxes haven't been found.  Some, in fact, have been found by non-letterboxers, and that has made the plant, or all those plants, worthwhile.  One, in Knox County, was found by the subject of the letterbox, Wyman Meinzer, official Texas state photographer, and a rancher discovered, online, that a box was hidden on his ranch in Throckmorton County (at a remote historical marker) and was curious about what it contained.  He promised to go take a look at it, but he liked the fact that it was there.  Another, in Seymour, was found by a school teacher who took her class out to see it before it disappeared.  A few have not been found, but I knew when I placed them that they may meet that fate.  I'm just saying that there is no longer the enticement of "greening" a county. Now, I need to focus on finding a box in every county.  I've got a big Texas county map on my wall with pins showing our placed boxes.  There are a whole lot of counties out there without pins, so that's the next challenge.<br/>

&gt; Okay, I just reread Boots' question, and I veered a little off-topic<br/>
&gt; although I stand by what I said.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In my opinion, I do NOT think it was a bad thing to rush to get boxes where<br/>
&gt; there were no boxers.  If we want to cultivate new boxers, we have to have<br/>
&gt; boxes somewhat close to them.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As in my case, six and a half years ago, it was only because I had a little<br/>
&gt; leverage on the day that I was able to convince Fearless Fox to travel an<br/>
&gt; hour and a half on a "maybe."   If Silver Eagle and Baby Bear had only<br/>
&gt; planted in the Houston area because that's where they were more like to be<br/>
&gt; found, I never would have become a letterboxer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Boots, I know how much you like to know your boxes are being found and kept<br/>
&gt; well, but I'm so glad you put some out there where it may take awhile to be<br/>
&gt; found.  Future boxes will appreciate you for it as the rest of us appreciate<br/>
&gt; your and LSQ's outstanding boxes.  I'll bet you didn't like waiting on<br/>
&gt; Christmas when you were a kid either, did you?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">When we first started letterboxing in 2005, I watched for new boxes close to us every day and we'd go find the new ones before the week was out.  Now, there are too many for us to find, so we tend to make letterboxing trips to places where there are a lot of boxes (still don't get them all) and ignore the ones closer to us, thinking "I'll save that one for a day when I just need to find a letterbox" or maybe when I'll be going that way, I can stop and get that one.  The trouble is, I forget about them.  I need to make a resolution to go find your boxes, NLW.  I'm looking at my calendar now.  Thanks for placing them.<br/>

&gt; I was just checking out some letterboxes on LbNA and when I clicked on Texas and it came up all green, I realized that I missed the white spaces that used to be there. Green means that there are no frontiers left in Texas for placing letterboxes. I wonder if you turned all the boxes that have only one or two boxes, most of them never found, back to white, how many would there be? I guess the frontiers for finding boxes are still there, you just can't glance at the map and see them. Does anybody understand what I mean? Maybe we shouldn't have tried so hard to put boxes in places where there are no letterboxers. What do you think?<br/>

I think that was my only contribution to the greening Texas project, but to my knowledge, it's still there and is visited from time to time. Although it was the only box in Archer County for quite some time (can't remember if it still is), it has had its share of visitors.</div>

It's an involved story, but he inherited the land from his wife upon her death and sold it for $950.  I am going to make it up there some day to find The Last Picture Show and visit the bookstore, but probably no time soon, so all future Archer County letterbox ideas are fair game.  First, I need to find those 5 boxes in New Caney.  I pass through there a couple of times a month, so it's not too much out of my way, I just need to plan ahead. (Talking to myself.)<br/>

<div>Isn't that amazing? Two of America's best authors owned (and owns) property in Archer County. Unless you own the mineral rights, that land may not be worth more than $950 today.... just kidding. Having been "born and reared" in Wichita County (adjacent to Archer), I can say that over my very long life span, I haven't seen much change in Archer City since I was a kid... other than Larry McMurtry's bookstores that is. I must admit, I like that.</div>
<div>Speaking of that region, Silver Eagle, do you know if your Lake Arrowhead box is still there? That one is still on my list to look for.</div>

<p>Since everyone has probably already "googled" it, I can tell you that, although Mark Twain never set foot on Texas soil, and never crossed it on the way to somewhere else, he owned 320 acres of Texas soil in Archer County. It's an involved story, but he inherited the land from his wife upon her death and sold it for $950. I am going to make it up there some day to find The Last Picture Show and visit the bookstore, but probably no time soon, so all future Archer County letterbox ideas are fair game. First, I need to find those 5 boxes in New Caney. I pass through there a couple of times a month, so it's not too much out of my way, I just need to plan ahead.

Do I have to wait for you to place a box in Archer City before I can learn what the Mark Twain connection is? If so, while you're up there planting the box, be sure to visit my "The Last Picture Show" box in Archer City. I think that was my only contribution to the greening Texas project, but to my knowledge, it's still there and is visited from time to time. Although it was the only box in Archer County for quite some time (can't remember if it still is), it has had its share of visitors.<br/>&gt; Oh, and Barefoot Lucy, it's true....

That's the trouble with placing boxes in remote areas: it's hard to get back out there to check on them. I'm sure that J. B. Kokopelli has more "unfound" boxes than I do out in the Panhandle, and I'll bet Silver Eagle and Baby Bear have many boxes that have never been reported as found from their South Texas trip last year. So, I really have nothing to complain about, do I? I still want to go find that Gene Autry box of yours. Did you know that Mark Twain has a connection to Archer County?

I have a box up in Tioga, Texas that has only been reported as found once or twice, but when I checked on it, the logbook was half full. A lot of boxers don't report their finds.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; As for me, I've just been too focused on my daughter's dance school to do much boxing this winter, but I can guarantee that as the days grow longer (and it's not dark when I leave the studio), and when the weather warms a bit, I'll be out there looking for all the fabulous boxes I've been missing this winter in the DFW area! Keep planting! (Remember, if they are hidden well, the chance of them surviving a long time is much better, if they aren't being found as often.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Here's my sorry excuse for not rushing out and finding all the new boxes that have recently been planted: I remember a time about five years ago when I had found every box in the DFW area and far beyond. Luckily, we have a lot of boxes now, and to me it's like having a fat savings account; I just love knowing that when I want to go letterboxing, I've got plenty of boxes to look for.

First of all, I don't search via the map system that often, but search by county manually.  The fact that there is a box in every county lets me know that we can pick any destination and (budget permitting, of course) seize the day.  I even check my home/surrounding counties frequently to see if there are any new plants that weren't announced on the newsletter.<br/>
<br/>
I wish I had discovered letterboxing before we moved to Washington county, because there is a lot of potential for both plants and finds where we used to live! (Lubbock &amp; Amarillo areas)  We definitely plan on doing both the next time we're up that way...we're just not sure when that is. :\<br/>
