I suggest the people that have boxes with clues only<br>
obtainable by email to check and see if Mr. Gryphon<br>
has visited, and if he has, try to figure out which<br>
email is his.  Then at least we would have a way to<br>
contact him.  If he hasn't visited any of these boxes,<br>
maybe somebody could place a Gryphon box near Coryell<br>
county and require email for the clues.  That might <br>
bring him out.<br>
