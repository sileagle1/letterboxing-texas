                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am from SE OHIO and part of your boxing since I have a son in TX.<br>
<br>
2 years ago when there were no boxes in the county, I had to travel a <br>
long way to events.<br>
<br>
This year I am hoping to get up the nerve to host an event in our <br>
county.  I notice there are none on Labor Day so there you go you see!!<br>
<br>
Should anyone be interested in sending a box to plant, please contact <br>
me and I will send you my address for a stamp to be placed at the <br>
event from your stash.<br>
<br>
We will accept any stamp that might be a retired postal, or something <br>
that you really don't know what to do with either!<br>
<br>
Labor Day 2008 if you are in the area of SE OH please check AQ soon <br>
for an event in this area.<br>
