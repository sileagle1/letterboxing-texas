<br/>
Shreveport is only about two hours West of us and we are also new <br/>
boxers. We found our first three boxes last weekend and had to <br/>
report one missing.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
My husband is as enthusiastic about this hobby as I have become. We <br/>
have dozens of ideas for "plants" in East Texas but have not yet <br/>
attempted to carve a stamp.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We are currently known as the parents of "cowabunga kid" (a definite <br/>
ninja turtle fan) with his own ninja turtle stamp. We are still <br/>
considering our trail names and read with great delight the goings <br/>
on on this list.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Since there are no boxes really close to us we are looking at the <br/>
mystery boxes and one specific box "Gryzzled Gryphon Bait" the <br/>
clues are fun and have kept us learning as we try to decipher them. <br/>
The planters of this box Celtic Lions have corresponded and <br/>
encouraged us(as well as corrected us) and this is a fun way to be <br/>
connected even when we can not be hunting. We hope to attempt <br/>
finding this box (still one difficult clue and the drive to tackle) <br/>
in a few weeks.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
We have also been intrigued with the discussion over the "I'm Sari, <br/>
I Tigress" and may try to seek that one later this year.<br/>

Am on vacation, but couldn't help but see this mention of one of my<br/>
plants, one of my favorite plants in fact.  <br/>
<br/>
I love it that others might be as interested in creating and finding<br/>
these type of boxes as I am.  It thrills me to no end that more and<br/>
more of us seem to be having a lot of fun with our plants!  <br/>
<br/>
Variety is the spice of life and it's great that there are different<br/>
types of boxes for everyone.  Some people like drive bys; others like<br/>
short or long hikes.  Some people like straight-forward clues; some<br/>
like them a little more convoluted.  Some people like to rack up their<br/>
F numbers; others don't pay attention to their numbers at all.<br/>
<br/>
I believe that the journey is part of the process and part of the fun.<br/>
  Hopefully, many of our boxes are geared toward that. If you need<br/>
help identifying which mystery boxes are easier or perhaps a little<br/>
nudge, I'm generally happy to do that.  I am not very likely to<br/>
respond to an email that says, "Before I waste my time. . ."  <br/>
