Seriously, Elwood Fan I think you did the right thing and I appreciate your efforts.  No box is worth going to jail over (though some are close).<br>
<br>
However, this brings up another potential problem:  letterboxers looking for the box who are unaware of what is going on in that area.  BL, could you add a note to the clues that says something like "This box is temporarily unavailable due to construction in the area"?  Later, when Elwood Fan feels comfortable about access we can remove the note.  Thanks for helping preserve a legacy.<br>
