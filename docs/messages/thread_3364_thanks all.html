I had found it long ago. It is so much fun and getting out<br>
in the fresh air and away from the housework?? I already<br>
have another meeting Saturday, sure wish I could of went<br>
to the meeting there in Bastrop but maybe next time, and <br>
if it wasn't so far away I could try and make it later on<br>
in the afternoon, will have to wait and see how long the first<br>
one will last. I hope the weather holds out for you all.<br>
