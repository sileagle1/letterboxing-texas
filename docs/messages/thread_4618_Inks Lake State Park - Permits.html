For any new boxes I think you will still have to get a ranger to approve your location, which could take a long time if they are busy or not available.  This is one of the major drawbacks to the whole permit process since most visits to parks are only for a short time.  I wonder if we can place the box, then request a permit via email later?  You would run the risk of having your location disapproved, but at least you could place a box on your own time table.  I'm not trying to start another debate on permits, just trying to think of ways to make them more palatable.<br>

> I got back from vacation and had email from Chrissy also wanting me to permit the box.  I asked her if she could email it to me, which she did, and emailed back to her.  So far seems to work well (though form says nothing about letterbox, and is set up specifically for Geocaching).   Anyway, sent it to her today so we will see if creates a problem or not.  I have a feeling this will become the norm for all State Parks, but hopefully they will work with us using email as way to permit.   <br>
