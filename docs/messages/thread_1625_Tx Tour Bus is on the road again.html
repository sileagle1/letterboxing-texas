<p>On the road again, </p>
<p>I'm so glad this bus is on the road again!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The Bus is back on the road in Foster Park, in Fort Worth.  You can't Google or Mapquest the Park; it gives you Foster Dr which is the oppostie side of town from the Bus.  The easiest way to get there is to take SW Loop 820 and Exit South Drive.  Go northeast.  Follow South Drive down the big hill, then back up the hill, then as you start to go down another hill, you'll see the park!  The park is divided by South Drive.  Park in the parking lot on the north side.  Follow the bike trail north.  </p>
<p>Cross over the wooden bridge.</p>
<p>Cross over three creeks (dry creeks this time of year!) Keep following the bike trail.   Count as you go.  1 creek, 2 creek, 3 creek... STOP.</p>
<p>Face northeast, looking at the creek.  At a compass reading of approx. 30 degrees, you will see two trees on the left side of the bank.  In front of them is a dead log.  The Bus is behind the dead log, covered with leaves and rocks.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>This trail is bike friendly, dog friendly, and stroller friendly.  There is also a playground here so if you have kiddos, bring em!  </p>
<p>Park hours are dawn till dusk.  And remember, bring a backpack to hide the Bus in.  I brought the double stroller and put the Bus in one seat and covered it up with a blanket.  Worked really well!</p>
<p>Happy hunting!</p>
