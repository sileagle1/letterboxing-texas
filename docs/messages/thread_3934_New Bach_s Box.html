&gt; Yesterday, I braved the ice in Dallas (OK, no ice by 4:00 p.m., and <br/>
I had to be there anyway) to replace Bach's Box on the SMU campus <br/>
with a new Bach's Box 2, with a new and improved stamp and logbook, <br/>
in a slightly different location.  Those college campuses are always <br/>
doing construction somewhere, but I ask you, why would they dig up <br/>
perfectly good lampposts just to move them to the other side of the <br/>
street!  And of course, when they removed the lampposts, they had to <br/>
take out the bushes immediately behind them as well, and of course, <br/>
Bach's Box was a goner after having survived this very unlikely <br/>
location on campus for 3 years.  Oh well, that's the risk of <br/>
letterboxing, and now there's a new box there in a slightly different <br/>
location, still near enough to that beautiful Wave fountain/sculpture <br/>
in front of the Meadows Museum to make you, me, and J.S. Bach all <br/>
quite happy in the location.  As with the first Bach's Box, though, <br/>
this one does require some very stealthy behavior in actually <br/>
retrieving and replacing the box, though, to avoid being seen or <br/>

Duh -- that should have been "all those letterboxers (not <br/>
letterboxes) wandering around looking for something ..."  unless <br/>
maybe the letterbox itself was wandering around trying to find itself <br/>

<div>Okay, I'm sorry, but I find humor in the lamppost situation.  My first thought was, </div>
<div> </div>
<div>"Why did the lampposts cross the road?"</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Following by the old boy scout skit:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Boy 1: Searches diligently all over the place for "something".  High and low he looks, over and under.</div>
<div>Boy 2 comes in:  "What are you looking for?"</div>
<div>Boy 1: "I lost my watch"</div>
<div>Boy 2: "I'll help you look."</div>
<div>Continue on, with 2, 3, 4 more boys coming in, asking the same question, getting the same answer, and offering to look too (They ARE boy scouts, after all).</div>
<div>Boy 6 comes in: "What are y'all looking for?"</div>
<div>Boy 1: "I lost my watch."</div>
<div>Boy 6: "Well where did you lose it?"</div>
<div>Boy 1 points several feet away and says, "Over there"</div>
<div>Boy 6: "Well why are you looking here then?"</div>
<div>Boy 1: "The light's better here."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Random.  Sorry.  Cool you replaced the box though.</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!" </div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>
