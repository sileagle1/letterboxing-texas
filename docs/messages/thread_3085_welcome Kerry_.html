<div>Welcome Kerry!  
First of all, let me say that the fact that you are worrying about being subtle 
is a sign that you will be great letterboxers!  Also, contacting the 
placers after finding (or not :)) a box is great.  I love it when people 
tell me they found my boxes (or didn't) and a little about their 
experience.  And really, silly kids are some of the best "camouflage" you 
can have.  No one ever wonders why a kid is on his hands and knees looking 
in some bushes or climbing over some rocks, and if you kid is half as loud as 
mine usually are people will take one look and run the other way!  -Mother
