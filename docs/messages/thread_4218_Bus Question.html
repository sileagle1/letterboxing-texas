                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was kind of waiting to see what others might say, but since no one is weighing in, I might as well tell you what I think.  My opinion is that it has already been out too long and should be put back on the road as soon as possible, to give more people a chance to see it and add a passenger, even if it has to go out somewhere around where you live.  From what Silver Eagle said, each finder has been keeping it for an average of two months.  I think a week or two would be enough time to stamp all the stamps in your logbook and get a new one carved for the box.  I know there are circumstances that keep that from happening, but that sould be the goal of every finder.  This is just my opinion, mind you. Maybe someone will pick it up who can move a little farther away.  I would just keep an eye on it if nobody picks it up right away.  It's so big, it shouldn't stay out very long, because that increases the chances of it being found accidentally by a non-letterboxer.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of course, that's true, but the question was about whether it was better to hide it locally or take it out of the area.  Picking a safe spot to hide the box is always a priority.  There is usually a scramble to get the box, but no sense of urgency to get it back on the road.  <br>

<p>Of course, that's true, but the question was about whether it was better to hide it locally or take it out of the area.  Picking a safe spot to hide the box is always a priority.  There is usually a scramble to get the box, but no sense of urgency to get it back on the road.  <br/>

&gt; I'm of the "right is more important than fast" camp myself.  If finding a good safe hiding place for a large box in your area is a challenge, by all means wait until you can move it along somewhere where it will be protected.  <br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; A long time out of circulation is far preferable to gone forever.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BUT distance moved is not nearly as important as keeping it moving because someone will eventually be able to get it moved out of your area.<br/>

Picking a safe spot to hide the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box is always a priority. There is usually a scramble to get the box, but no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense of urgency to get it back on the road.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>&lt;letterboxingtexas%<wbr>40yahoogroups.<wbr>com&gt;,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "BarefootLucy" &lt;barefootlucy@<wbr>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm of the "right is more important than fast" camp myself.

&gt; &gt; The first Texas Tour Bus sometimes remained hidden for weeks at a
time because there weren't as many letterboxers back then. It was lost because
it was handed to someone on the trail who said they were new letterboxers and
was never seen again. So it's important to hide it well and immediately post
its location on this board so that all serious letterboxers have an equal shot
at it. By the way, LSQ and I plan to be in <st1:place w:st="on">NE Texas</st1:place>
for a couple of days next week, finding a few boxes and placing a few. We'll be
through Tyler and Marshall. There are a lot of boxes up there, so we won't get
all of them, but we'll get a few. We've already had the Circus Train, but if we
happen to be in the right spot at the right time, maybe we could move it to a
different place. Maybe <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Jacksonville</st1:place></st1:city>.
Maybe <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Corsicana</st1:place></st1:city>.
We won't be as far west as <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Ft.</st1:placetype>
<st1:placename w:st="on">Worth</st1:placename></st1:place>, sorry Janet. We'll
look for a wi-fi spot occasionally and keep in touch, just in case.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I just think it is important to emphasize that while speed is
important in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; getting it back out, speed is not so critical as to be worth
risking the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box. Lots of folks don't realize until they have that box how
big it is,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then open it to see the wealth of artwork they have in their
possession,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and then when they go to rehide it, they suddenly realize it's
not that easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and that they are responsible for what is, to us, a national
treasure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Don't want 'em to feel pressured by the speed factor.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; But yeah, I agree that it does need to be a priority to get it
back on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; road!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, that's true, but the question was about whether
it was better to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hide it locally or take it out of the area. Picking a safe
spot to hide the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box is always a priority. There is usually a scramble to
get the box, but no<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sense of urgency to get it back on the road.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm of the "right is more important than
fast" camp myself. If finding a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good safe hiding place for a large box in your area is a
challenge, by all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means wait until you can move it along somewhere where it
will be protected.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A long time out of circulation is far preferable to
gone forever.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BUT distance moved is not nearly as important as
keeping it moving<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because someone will eventually be able to get it moved out
of your area.<br/>
