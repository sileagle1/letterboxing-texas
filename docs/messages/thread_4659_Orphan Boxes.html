<p><span>I do not mind looking after letterboxes left in my
neighborhood.  Were it not for Silver Eagle leaving a single letterbox in
El Paso, I would not be a letterboxer today.  PERIOD!  I check in on
his now and then, and I don’t think he minds a bit.  I have gone out
of my way to repair boxes when traveling.  I think we all have.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>OTOH, while I have planted several around El Paso, I have never
planted outside the area.  Well, not more than 100 miles or so anyway. 
For the last two years, I have not had the time for letterboxing.  If I
can’t maintain what I have locally, how can I justify adding more?<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>I don’t know where you are, but perhaps the boxing community
of your area will adopt a few of your best (or maybe all) of your boxes when
you leave.  Now might be a good time to start thinking and asking about
it.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">In my opinion, as long as you are an active letterboxer and continue to update your clues with current status, your boxes are not abandoned or orphaned.  I have planted many boxes all over the country (and elsewhere) and I see nothing wrong with it.  If there is a problem with the box, I update the clues (e.g. full log) and the next letterboxer usually helps out.  If the box is reported missing more than once, I update the clues to reflect that, and if it really is missing, there is no litter to worry about.<br/>

P.S.  Thanks to all you letterboxers who have helped my boxes over the years!<br/>
