<div>When I created that HH originally my trailname was TX2chic, but later 
I changed it to Viewfinder (the TX2chic referred to both me and my sister, whose 
trailname is Puddle-Splasher).  So now all of my boxes are listed under 
Viewfinder.  Glad you mentioned it on the Texas list so I could see 
it.  </div>
<div>    This little chickee started her journey on a 
freightcar at the Whistle Stop Spur in Keller, and she's carrying a hobo 
bag on a stick over her shoulder.  The original logbook got soaked - I 
think she went through some floods during Rita in South Texas - and Baby Bear 
found her and kindly replaced the logbook and returned the original to me, so 
though it's blurry and messy, I have it.  I'll be delighted to know where 
else she travels to.  Thanks again.  </div></font></body></html>
