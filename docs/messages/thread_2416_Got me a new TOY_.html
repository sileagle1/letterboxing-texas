</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've actually tried all the tips that came with it.  Even the ones that would obviously not be very good.  What the heck, right?  The highlights...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I first tried out the threaded tip mandrel, and it took off like a shot across the rubber.  I had to keep a very firm hand with it, but I managed to peel away a good bit of rubber quickly.  I also managed to get some tight corners.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The screw mandrel makes absolutely perfectly round holes in the rubber.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The carbide cutter didn't work at all well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The one I've found that works really, really well though is an engraving cutter.  It takes a light touch and can get into tight spaces with excellent precision.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What I really like best so far is that it doesn't require a tight grip (except on that threaded tip mandrel), and it doesn't eat away a lot of rubber.  The problem with how I carve now is I tend to have a heavy hand and I cut deep.  My stamp images are pretty good, but the stamp itself looks pretty rough (as was discussed in a previous thread - like I whittled them).  With this, it seems I'll be able to get a lot better control over the depth of my cut.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My husband also got me a circular saw attachment and a plane attachment.  I had no idea why the plane, except that we have Pinewood Derby coming up and I figured I could use it on cars.  Finally he told me I can fix the front door now, which requires that we throw our weight into it to open since the wet season has kicked in and the door has swollen.  I told him this is a FUN tool, not a work tool, but I'm sure I'll do it anyway just to see how it works at that.  I'm blown away by all the cool things you can get to go with a Dremel.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On another note, I'm thoroughly impressed with Dremel's documentation.  I read the book as far as the Operation Instructions, then started experimenting.  After I finished that, I picked the book back up, turned a few pages and found a detailed description of each attachment, what its purpose is, what material it works best on and what size shank it has.  Turn another page and it has more detailed information on how best to use certain attachments.

<div>My husband gave me a 10" compound miter saw for Christmas, and yes, I did ask for it! I doubt that I can use it to carve stamps though.</div>
<div>My most exciting gift was from one of my daughters who gave me "Five Laps in a Corvette on the track at Texas Motor Speedway" starting with a race car driving school. Well, actually starting with signing a release form, then driving school. The first available date is January 20th, and since we have our Rusk gathering then, I'll have to wait until at least February.</div>

You know, I actually tried that on my Boxer! -But she wouldn't have <br/>

this is a nice spot for a box! <br/>

&gt; Heh heh heh - we have been using Dremel tools for a loooooonnnnnggg <br/>
time!<br/>
&gt; Bet you can't guess for what.  In fact, I am sure you will never <br/>
guess - so<br/>
&gt; I will share it with you.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; We use it for doing dog nails.  Yup - you ever try cutting the <br/>
nails on a<br/>
&gt; Great Dane with a nail clipper?  I got a strong grip - but I can't <br/>
do it.<br/>
&gt; But a Dremel tool with the sanding drum takes the nails down in no <br/>
time at<br/>
&gt; all.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Surprised?  <grin>. <br/>

<div>not at all surprised, since my only personal experiences with Dremels

they have other uses, too? -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>

<div>Well, PuddleSplasher, I can tell you from personal experience you'll love 
that!  I won't remind you which actual birthday it was, but you'll recall 
that my son-in-law and husband bought me a TMS Driving School experience, and I 
got to drive a Nascar 10 laps around the track with a Nascar driver as my 
passenger.  Got to do it twice, actually, since the first 10 laps I didn't 
get to pass anyone (my driver/passenger was scared to let me), so they let me go 
again with a braver (younger), more risk-taking driver/passenger, and I passed 
everyone and set the speed record for the night!  The worst part was NOT 
getting into the car through the window -or getting out - it was the speed and 
the walls coming at me so fast!  The best part of all this was, I was the 
only female driver among about 50 males, and I beat them all, except the kid who 
topped my record on the last set of 10 laps.  It was just about the 
scariest thing I've ever done, even scarier than that time our river raft 
flipped us out in the Royal Gorge and trapped us under the raft - and you will 
remember how scary that was, since you were there, too!  </div>

Just prior to opening that gift, I was holding my two <br/>month old red-headed granddaughter and explaining to her that she <br/>should never be satisfied until she's going mach 3 with her hair on <br/>fire. I guess I have to set a good example now! I'm feeling a need <br/>for a new stamp/box coming up!<br/>&gt; PS<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; ----- Original Message ----- <br/>&gt; From: <br/>&gt; To: <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a><br/>&gt; Sent: 12/26/2006 10:50:56 AM <br/>&gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Got me a new TOY!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; In a message dated 12/25/2006 11:22:32 PM Central Standard Time, <br/>cjagger405@.<wbr/>.. writes:<br/>&gt; "Five Laps in a Corvette on the track at Texas Motor Speedway" <br/>starting with a race car driving school. Well, actually starting with <br/>signing a release form, then driving school.<br/>&gt; Well, PuddleSplasher, I can tell you from personal experience <br/>you'll love that! I won't remind you which actual birthday it was, <br/>but you'll recall that my son-in-law and husband bought me a TMS <br/>Driving School experience, and I got to drive a Nascar 10 laps around <br/>the track with a Nascar driver as my passenger. Got to do it twice, <br/>actually, since the first 10 laps I didn't get to pass anyone (my <br/>driver/passenger was scared to let me), so they let me go again with <br/>a braver (younger), more risk-taking driver/passenger, and I passed <br/>everyone and set the speed record for the night! The worst part was <br/>NOT getting into the car through the window -or getting out - it was <br/>the speed and the walls coming at me so fast! The best part of all <br/>this was, I was the only female driver among about 50 males, and I <br/>beat them all, except the kid who topped my record on the last set of <br/>10 laps. It was just about the scariest thing I've ever done, even <br/>scarier than that time our river raft flipped us out in the Royal <br/>Gorge and trapped us under the raft - and you will remember how scary <br/>that was, since you were there, too! <br/>&gt; -- Viewfinder<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

<div>Actually, almost.  Since the seats don't adjust in a Nascar, they had 
to put a bunch of cushions behind me to move ME forward as far as I could go 
until I was perched on the front of the seat, which also moved me in front of 
those nice wrap-around safety seat guards.  I was also strapped in all 
around as if ready for a roll-over, wearing the heavily padded driver's suit, 
which made it tricky to get in and out of the car through the window, but I did 
it -- without any grace whatsoever (lost an earring in the process!)  And 
the headgear I wore almost made it impossible for me to have any peripheral 
vision, so I'm driving about 130 mph perched on the front edge of the seat to 
reach the clutch and accelerator and pretty much blind to cars around me, 
circling the oval track.  Certainly exciting!  I pretty much had to 
depend on the passenger/driver to let me know where the other cars were around 
me when I was ready to pass someone, or if someone was coming up around 
me.  -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
