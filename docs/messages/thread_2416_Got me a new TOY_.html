</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've actually tried all the tips that came with it.  Even the ones that would obviously not be very good.  What the heck, right?  The highlights...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I first tried out the threaded tip mandrel, and it took off like a shot across the rubber.  I had to keep a very firm hand with it, but I managed to peel away a good bit of rubber quickly.  I also managed to get some tight corners.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The screw mandrel makes absolutely perfectly round holes in the rubber.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The carbide cutter didn't work at all well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The one I've found that works really, really well though is an engraving cutter.  It takes a light touch and can get into tight spaces with excellent precision.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What I really like best so far is that it doesn't require a tight grip (except on that threaded tip mandrel), and it doesn't eat away a lot of rubber.  The problem with how I carve now is I tend to have a heavy hand and I cut deep.  My stamp images are pretty good, but the stamp itself looks pretty rough (as was discussed in a previous thread - like I whittled them).  With this, it seems I'll be able to get a lot better control over the depth of my cut.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My husband also got me a circular saw attachment and a plane attachment.  I had no idea why the plane, except that we have Pinewood Derby coming up and I figured I could use it on cars.  Finally he told me I can fix the front door now, which requires that we throw our weight into it to open since the wet season has kicked in and the door has swollen.  I told him this is a FUN tool, not a work tool, but I'm sure I'll do it anyway just to see how it works at that.  I'm blown away by all the cool things you can get to go with a Dremel.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On another note, I'm thoroughly impressed with Dremel's documentation.  I read the book as far as the Operation Instructions, then started experimenting.  After I finished that, I picked the book back up, turned a few pages and found a detailed description of each attachment, what its purpose is, what material it works best on and what size shank it has.  Turn another page and it has more detailed information on how best to use certain attachments.

This is too cool! I <br/>love it!<br/>&gt; And I think once I get the right attachments, it will be awesome. <br/>Lightning<br/>&gt; is surprisingly diplomatic for 10 years old, but he popped off with <br/>a "Now<br/>&gt; you won't be hurting yourself all the time".

<div>Well, PuddleSplasher, I can tell you from personal experience you'll love 
that!  I won't remind you which actual birthday it was, but you'll recall 
that my son-in-law and husband bought me a TMS Driving School experience, and I 
got to drive a Nascar 10 laps around the track with a Nascar driver as my 
passenger.  Got to do it twice, actually, since the first 10 laps I didn't 
get to pass anyone (my driver/passenger was scared to let me), so they let me go 
again with a braver (younger), more risk-taking driver/passenger, and I passed 
everyone and set the speed record for the night!  The worst part was NOT 
getting into the car through the window -or getting out - it was the speed and 
the walls coming at me so fast!  The best part of all this was, I was the 
only female driver among about 50 males, and I beat them all, except the kid who 
topped my record on the last set of 10 laps.  It was just about the 
scariest thing I've ever done, even scarier than that time our river raft 
flipped us out in the Royal Gorge and trapped us under the raft - and you will 
remember how scary that was, since you were there, too!  </div>

NOT getting into the car through the window -or getting out - it was <br>
the speed and the walls coming at me so fast!  The best part of all <br>
this was, I was the only female driver among about 50 males, and I <br>
beat them all, except the kid who topped my record on the last set of <br>
10 laps.  It was just about the scariest thing I've ever done, even <br>
scarier than that time our river raft flipped us out in the Royal <br>
Gorge and trapped us under the raft - and you will remember how scary <br>
that was, since you were there, too!  <br>

<div>Actually, almost.  Since the seats don't adjust in a Nascar, they had 
to put a bunch of cushions behind me to move ME forward as far as I could go 
until I was perched on the front of the seat, which also moved me in front of 
those nice wrap-around safety seat guards.  I was also strapped in all 
around as if ready for a roll-over, wearing the heavily padded driver's suit, 
which made it tricky to get in and out of the car through the window, but I did 
it -- without any grace whatsoever (lost an earring in the process!)  And 
the headgear I wore almost made it impossible for me to have any peripheral 
vision, so I'm driving about 130 mph perched on the front edge of the seat to 
reach the clutch and accelerator and pretty much blind to cars around me, 
circling the oval track.  Certainly exciting!  I pretty much had to 
depend on the passenger/driver to let me know where the other cars were around 
me when I was ready to pass someone, or if someone was coming up around 
me.  -- Viewfinder</div></font></body></html>
