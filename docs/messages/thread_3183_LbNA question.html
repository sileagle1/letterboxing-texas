This person said they were a new letterboxer and had found one of my <br>
boxes and asked a few questions about carving techniques.  When I <br>
tried to answer, I got an error saying the recipient (unknown LbNA <br>
user) was rejected by the server.  The person gave me her real name, <br>
but not her trail name, so I don't know to contact her.  If you will <br>
contact me again and give me your trail name or go through Atlas <br>
Quest, I'll be happy to answer you.  Thanks.<br>
