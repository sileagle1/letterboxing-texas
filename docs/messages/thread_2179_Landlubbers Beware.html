<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">That is so cool about 
the coyotes!  I had lived in TX for a long time, been camping in many many 
parks (yes, even in west Texas) and never seen one, much to my dismay.  The 
first one I saw was on a trail across from my Grandmother's farmhouse in 
Michigan where I had spent most of my childhood.  It was very Very close, 
right in the middle of the trail.  When my brother and I reported it to the 
ranger she told us it was a lost black lab.  The black labs I have seen 
don't much resemble a coyote, makes me sort of wonder about the training 
Michigan DPWS get.  Congrats on a great morning surprise!
