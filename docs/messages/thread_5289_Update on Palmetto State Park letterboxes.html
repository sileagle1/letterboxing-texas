<p>Palmetto State Park added new 
trails and renamed trails since we were there for TALE 7.<span>  </span>One of the changes is that the Palmetto 
Trail is now the Palmetto Interpretive Trail and all the numbers were removed. 
<span> </span>The trail that takes off between 
now missing numbers #8 and #9 has a name: Mesquite Flats Trail.<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>With that in mind, I went to 
Palmetto State Park last weekend and checked on about half of the letterboxes 
that are currently listed.<span>  </span>I went 
back today hoping to check on the other half, but the park is closed due to 
flooding.<span>  </span>Sadly I won’t be able to 
go back for another month, so here is my current update:</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Boxes still active as of 25 
October and I sent suggested clue updates to owners:</p>
<p>Indian Stamp-pede by Bloomin 
Gramma Jo</p>
<p>Dream Symbolism—Time Keeper in 
Dreams by topcrop</p>
<p>Roasting Marshmallows by Baileys 
Bunch</p>
<p>La Placa Supremo by Dawns 
Glory</p>
<p>Freddy Fender (Music Box #14) by 
Viewfinder</p>
<p>Cowboy Meets Day of the Dead by 
Mosaic Butterfly</p>
<p>Biscuit Making Renegade by Shadow 
Boxer<span>  </span>(clues are current)</p>
<p>NEW!  Jurassic Palmetto 
Park, just listed today!  HIdden last week; I hope the floods didn’t wash 
them away.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Boxes missing (according to 
me—they may still be there, but I couldn’t find them):</p>
<p>Chayopin by buttercup: <span> </span>(found the two small rocks, but no 
box)</p>
<p>Palmetto-Quilt Block Series by 
Lone Star Quilter (found strange looking tree and nearby oak, but no box)</p>
<p>Palmetto #2 by Baby Bear (looked 
behind every tree in the area)</p>
<p>Nacho Same-O Letterbox by 
Viewfinder<span>  </span>(found three trees, but 
the dead log was rotted away)</p>
<p>All Aboard! By Mazy Days (found 
tree with its “tongue stuck to frozen light pole,” but no box)</p>
<p>Salsa by Mosaic Butterfly (found 
bench, but no log)</p>
<p>Lydia Mendoza by Bell Motel 
(found rusty iron drain pipe, looked behind trees in 15 step radius, no box)</p>
<p>I’ll Get You, You Wascally 
Wenegade by Smitty </p>
<p>The Joker by TX Rebel</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Boxes on my list that I did not 
have a chance to check:</p>
<p>Spanglish by SandiBox</p>
<p>Campfire Burned IRA by Baby 
Bear</p>
<p>The Tex-Mex by Boots Tex</p>
<p>Influences in Texas (3) by Beach 
Bum</p>
<p>Loteria (4) by Corazon</p>
<p>Swampy by SandiBox</p>
<p>Chilly Bean by Gryzzled Gryphon 
(I don’t have the clues)</p>
<p> </p>

you would like for me to check on it, please let me know.</p>

<div>Sorry about that—I always enjoy your carvings.  No social trail 
anymore.  It took some doing to find the rusty iron drain pipe.  Once 
I found that, I had hope, but still couldn’t find the box.</div>
