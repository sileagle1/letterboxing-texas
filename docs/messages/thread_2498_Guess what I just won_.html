That means that 4 people in my family can go every day during the whole show. How exciting is that? I can't wait to take Cassie.</div> <div> </div> <div>Ever since I lived here the first time (1985), I've wanted to go. Back then I never could because I worked at the Big Boy on University. I loved it. Every night, lots of cowboys would come in. They'd be wearing their jeans, chaps, boots and spurs. I was in heaven. If I close my eyes and I can still hear the spurs.</div> <div> </div> <div>Okay, back to earth.
