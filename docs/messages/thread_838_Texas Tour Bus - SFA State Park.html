<br>
Placed by: TeamKing<br>
Placement date: May 13, 2005<br>
County: Austin<br>
Nearest city: San Felipe<br>
Number of boxes: 1<br>
Number of stamps: 2 plus 1 passenger<br>
<br>
<br>
The Texas Tour Bus has left the station!<br>
<br>
The first stop acknowledges the Father of Texas - Stephen F Austin - at <br>
the state park in his name.<br>
<br>
To get to the park: Take I-10 to exit #723 San Felipe (19 miles west of <br>
Katy, 3 east miles of Sealy, approx. 150 miles east of San Antonio) and <br>
follow the signs to the park - about 3 miles off of I-10.<br>
<br>
To find the box:<br>
As this is a state park, there is a $3 entrance fee for adults. Pay <br>
your fee and get a map. Either follow the signs or look on the map for <br>
the amphitheatre and the group camp area. Between these is the <br>
Cottonwood Trail. Follow the trail until you come to the Raccoon Bend <br>
trail going off to the right. Take this trail. At the top of the <br>
stairs, stop and look left. About 17 paces off is a 4-5 ft tree stump. <br>
Box is located about 1 ft from stump on the side closest to you and <br>
under some brush.<br>
<br>
As the first finder, your job is to take the box with you, add a <br>
passenger (stamp), and place it in a new location for someone else to <br>
find. Please let this list know when box is found so no one makes an <br>
unnecessary trip. Then after you re-place it, please place your clue on <br>
this list. That's it!<br>
<br>
Box is not listed on LBNA since this is a 'list only' traveling box. <br>
However, it is on Atlas Quest if you want log your find.<br>
<br>
Also, while in the park don't pass up the 'Father of Texas' stamp <br>
behind the amphitheatre or the 'Brazos Fish' stamp, which is off of the <br>
Sycamore Trail just down the road from the Cottonwood Trail.<br>
<br>
Thanks! Hope you enjoy it!</div>
