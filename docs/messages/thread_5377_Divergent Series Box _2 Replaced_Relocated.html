                    <html><body><p>After hearing that box #2 (Amity) of this series was already missing, I went out today and replaced it in a new but nearby location.  I have updated the clues so get them before you go.<br/><br/>With all the rain it was an interesting adventure trying to get to the box location.  The clues call for you to walk through a tunnel, but a creek runs through it and it was flooded today, making the tunnel a swimming proposition.  Instead I walked across Memorial road, through a muddy field and down where the box used to be.  You could do the same, but I recommend waiting until the waters recede.  Hopefully the new box will last longer in its new location.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p></body></html>
