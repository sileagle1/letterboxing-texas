<br/>
I just joined and wanted to say "Hi" to all. My trail name is Party Mouse, and already I recognize a few of you.  I live near Austin with my wife and 2 kids (daughter 15, son 13).  I work in IT, but am always ready to get outdoors.  Letterboxing gives me another great reason to do so.<br/>
<br/>
We just started letterboxing this past summer.  We "discovered" the hobby just before we took a trip with extended family to Durango, Colorado.  Found a few local boxes to whet our appetites, then found several along the way and while in Durango.  What a great splash of flavor it added to our vacation!  It took us to places we would have never seen otherwise.<br/>
<br/>
We haven't placed any boxes yet, but fully intend to.  Will let you all know when the time comes.  Glad to be a member of this group and looking forward to learning more, hearing some good stories, and meeting some great people.<br/>
