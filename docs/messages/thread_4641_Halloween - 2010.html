For your education, Cypress and darkness don't rhyme!  It sounds like a country song for Pete's sake!  Don't worry, I'll figure it out and find it all right.  It had better be good; remember, I do know where you live.  By the way, the next two boxes after yours in the Gulf Coast area also use "poetic" clues.  I hope this isn't a trend.<br>
