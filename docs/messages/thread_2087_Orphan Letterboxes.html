                    <div class="plaintext-content">This topic has come up in the past, and now that it has come up <br/>
again I decided to try and think of a solution.  First, let me state <br/>
my definition of an orphan letterbox.  It is any letterbox that has <br/>
an owner that no longer participates in letterboxing.  This can be a <br/>
problem because the clues, including the status of the box, can't be <br/>
updated, which can cause many needless searches for boxes that have <br/>
been missing for a long time.  It does not include boxes that are <br/>
located too far away for the owner to maintain the box.  As long as <br/>
other letterboxers help out with maintenance and the owner updates <br/>
the clues with any new status, these boxes pose no problem in my <br/>
opinion.<br/>
<br/>
The current solution for LBNA boxes is for a letterboxer to "adopt" <br/>
these orphan boxes.  This requires a webmaster to change ownership <br/>
of the boxes to the adopting letterboxer, who then has the ability <br/>
to update the clues.  The original ower can still be seen in the <br/>
clues, but the true owner of the box is the letterboxer who adopted <br/>
it.  The disadvantage of this method is that the adopter now has the <br/>
added responsibility of keeping up with these adopted boxes, along <br/>
with their own, which can be a daunting task if there are many.  It <br/>
also makes it look like they have placed many more boxes than they <br/>
really have.<br/>
<br/>
My first thought for a better solution was to allow a designated <br/>
letterboxer the ability to update orphan clues without changing the <br/>
ownership, but this would still require a significant ongoing effort <br/>
on their part.  My next thought was to see if the webmasters could <br/>
add an orphan flag to all boxes reported as orphans.  Then program a <br/>
change to the status flag that would add the words "reported <br/>
missing" to the box name if anyone selects the "attempted" status <br/>
for that box.  If the box is really not missing and the next <br/>
letterboxer finds it and selects "found" on the status, <br/>
the "reported missing" words in the box name would be removed.  This <br/>
would enable everyone the ability to update the status of the box  <br/>
without changing its ownership.  If the owner starts participating <br/>
again, the webmasters could remove the orphan flag and everything <br/>
would be back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
I emailed Choi (the main webmaster) with this suggestion but have <br/>
not heard back yet.  I don't know if these suggestions are feasible <br/>
for him to do, or if they are even the right thing to do, but I <br/>
thought I would ask.  If any of you have other suggestions, speak up <br/>
and I will forward them to him.  I know he has other more important <br/>
things on his platter (like keeping LBNA working), but if he and his <br/>
cohorts agree on a solution, maybe it will be added to the To Do <br/>
List.<br/>
<br/>
BTW, I also made my annual plea to get the TX Regions updated as per <br/>
the map we all decided on several years ago.  I don't expect it to <br/>
get done any time soon, but I keep hoping.<br/>

donation--simply a thanks for the years of fun.  In my mind, it's an<br/>
annual commitment to support this great hobby.<br/>
<br/>
Maybe they could institute something similar to the system Ryan did at<br/>
AQ--if someone hadn't logged in to LBNA in ___ months, the boxes could<br/>
be "orphaned."  I don't know.  It's a thorny problem.  Like I said, I<br/>
struggle to keep up on my own maintenance, so hesitate to add someone<br/>
else's.  However, for parks where I already have boxes or parks where<br/>
I go a lot, it really wouldn't be a problem to check on another box. <br/>
I try to do that anyway--I feel that we owe it to each other to keep<br/>
an eye on boxes, making sure they're well-hidden and doing ok.<br/>
<br/>
I would like to urge people who have retired boxes still listed on<br/>
LBNA to use the archive function--the box stays in the system, so<br/>
everyone who's logged a find can still keep the finds--but it won't<br/>
appear on the page listing, thereby reducing the number of boxes you<br/>
have to wade through.  You can unarchive it at any time if you want to<br/>
replace it.<br/>
<br/>
And finally, good luck with the annual appeal to change the regions. <br/>
The proposed ones make so much more sense. . .it would be a huge help<br/>
for Texas boxers. <br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Silver Eagle, I like your definition of an orphaned box - don't get me wrong; however, I would like to play a bit of the devil's advocate for a moment.  I only do this to make sure we are thinking through all the elements that need to be considered.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) How do we define someone who is no longer participating?  Is it someone who can't be reached by email?  Someone who hasn't planted any new boxes in xxx amount of time?  Someone who isn't participating on one of the talk lists?  Someone who hasn't logged any finds in awhile?  At what point can we declare them out of the game?  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Is there ever an occasion when some of a planter's boxes should be declared orphans, but not others?  I draw this example only to present a possibility and to get everyone thinking around the edges, NOT to present a likelihood:  Say I plant most of my boxes in East Texas, but I have one planted in Arkansas.  I toodle around and check on my local East Texas boxes with some degree of regularity, but I've kind of forgotten that box in Arkansas.  Someone contacts me through the website that my Arkansas box is in terrible condition and needs attention, and finally, that it has gone missing.  However, I changed my email address awhile back and forgot to change it on LBNA. I fly below the radar because I don't log finds and I don't participate on the lists.  Folks keep sending messages about that infernal missing box in Arkansas but unbeknownst to them, I'm not getting them.  I get reported to the LBNA folks because of that one box, but I've been down here diligently caring for all my other boxes and finding boxes nearly ever weekend.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) Do folks really distinguish between a "reported missing" flag and a "missing" flag? I'm with you on everything else you suggested, but I can't say I'm real crazy about putting flags on boxes.  I can be convinced though.  Am I reading this right that the flag would only happen to boxes already declare orphaned?  Flagging of any sort wouldn't be used as a determining factor to decide whether to orphan a box?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4) I can't quite wrap my mind around this (it was up until 3:30 this morning and had to go to work with me at 8:00), but I feel a little bit of circular logic here.  Depending on how we define a placer as being out of the game, we could be relying on reports to determine that boxes are orphaned and that a boxer has abandoned their boxes, in which case we flag their boxes with reported missing flags.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I said, I ain't arguing with the approach.  Just trying to think it all through.</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

<p>This is probably the hardest part of the whole idea.  I think we would have to </p>
<p>all agree that certain boxes were orphans before asking the webmasters to declare them.</p>
<p> <br/>&gt; 2) Is there ever an occasion when some of a planter's boxes should be<br/>&gt; declared orphans, but not others? I draw this example only to present a<br/>&gt; possibility and to get everyone thinking around the edges, NOT to present a<br/>&gt; likelihood: Say I plant most of my boxes in East Texas, but I have one<br/>&gt; planted in Arkansas.

<p>I had not thought of this possibility and I don't think it should happen.  If a</p>
<p>letterboxer is still active, none of their boxes should be declared orphans,</p>
<p>even if they don't keep up with status.</p>
<p> <br/>&gt; 3) Do folks really distinguish between a "reported missing" flag and a<br/>&gt; "missing" flag? I'm with you on everything else you suggested, but I can't<br/>&gt; say I'm real crazy about putting flags on boxes. I can be convinced<br/>&gt; though. Am I reading this right that the flag would only happen to boxes<br/>&gt; already declare orphaned? Flagging of any sort wouldn't be used as a<br/>&gt; determining factor to decide whether to orphan a box?</p>
<p>Correct, only boxes determined to be orphans (see #1) would have their</p>
<p>names changeable by the status flag.  So if someone checks "attempted" on</p>
<p>a regular LB, the box name does not change.  If someone checks "attempted"</p>
<p>on an orphan LB, the box name gets "reported missing" added to its name.</p>
<p>The bad thing about this is that if the box really is not missing, nobody will</p>
<p>go look for it.  That is why I suggested that if the status was changed to "found"</p>
<p>the "reported missing" would be taken off of the box name.</p>
<p> <br/>&gt; 4) I can't quite wrap my mind around this (it was up until 3:30 this morning<br/>&gt; and had to go to work with me at 8:00), but I feel a little bit of circular<br/>&gt; logic here. Depending on how we define a placer as being out of the game,<br/>&gt; we could be relying on reports to determine that boxes are orphaned and<br/>&gt; that a boxer has abandoned their boxes, in which case we flag their boxes<br/>&gt; with reported missing flags.</p>
<p>We would determine if boxes should be identified as orphans, then anyone</p>
<p>that updates the current status flag would affect the box name.</p>

<p>After looking at your questions, I realize this is probably too complicated and might</p>
<p>be too hard to implement.  The other solution that was tried several years ago of keeping</p>
<p>a database with status of boxes was a total flop and let to such ill will that many boxers</p>
<p>are still upset about it.  Choi has still not responded, so maybe he does not want to start</p>
<p>another war.   I will probably not persue this further.  Thanks for your responses. </p>

<p><span>Oh please don't stop now!<span>
  </span>I think your approach is the best start toward an LBNA fix that I've seen.<span>  </span>I just wanted to explore some possible issues.<span>  </span>The point I really, really like about it is that it focuses on the BOXER, not on the BOX.
<span>  </span><span> </span>Everything I had thought of focused on the box, which is like treating the symptoms, and not the cause. </span></p>
<p><span>Focusing on the box makes the determination subject to opinion and possible misguided information, far more than focusing on the boxer.
<span>  </span>Focusing on the boxer means that we have to go through more hoops to declare the boxer "out of the game", but it reduces the risk of wrongly declaring a box orphaned.</span></p>

<p><span>What if - when someone lists a box, they get a notice of disclaimer that states that their boxes will remain listed on LBNA subject to responsible box ownership - keeping statuses updated and current?
<span>  </span>In the event inquiries are made by boxers regarding boxes that have been repeatedly reported missing, and the webmasters/or whoever attempt to contact a placer by email and they are unresponsive, after some certain period of time their boxes will be declared orphaned.
<span>  </span>The key is that the placer needs to know the consequences when they initially list the box, not when they quit maintaining the box.</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>So here's another question:<span>  </span>To what level would you try to go to determine a boxer's status?
<span>  </span>What steps would be considered due diligence in trying to get a response from them?<span>  </span></span></p><br/><br/>

<br/>&gt; for her birthday. Glad to see this discussion continuing. I am one boxer<br/>&gt; who is experiencing ongoing frustration over orphaned boxes.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Silver Eagle, I like your definition of an orphaned box - don't get me
<br/>&gt; wrong; however, I would like to play a bit of the devil's advocate for a<br/>&gt; moment. I only do this to make sure we are thinking through all the<br/>&gt; elements that need to be considered.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 1) How do we define someone who is no longer participating? Is it someone
<br/>&gt; who can't be reached by email? Someone who hasn't planted any new boxes in<br/>&gt; xxx amount of time? Someone who isn't participating on one of the talk<br/>&gt; lists? Someone who hasn't logged any finds in awhile? At what point can
<br/>&gt; we declare them out of the game?</p></span></div>
<div>
<p>This is probably the hardest part of the whole idea.  I think we would have to </p>
<p>all agree that certain boxes were orphans before asking the webmasters to declare them.</p></div>
<div><span class="q">
<p> <br/>&gt; 2) Is there ever an occasion when some of a planter's boxes should be<br/>&gt; declared orphans, but not others? I draw this example only to present a<br/>&gt; possibility and to get everyone thinking around the edges, NOT to present a
<br/>&gt; likelihood: Say I plant most of my boxes in East Texas, but I have one<br/>&gt; planted in Arkansas. I toodle around and check on my local East Texas boxes<br/>&gt; with some degree of regularity, but I've kind of forgotten that box in
<br/>&gt; Arkansas. Someone contacts me through the website that my Arkansas box is<br/>&gt; in terrible condition and needs attention, and finally, that it has gone<br/>&gt; missing. However, I changed my email address awhile back and forgot to
<br/>&gt; change it on LBNA. I fly below the radar because I don't log finds and I<br/>&gt; don't participate on the lists. Folks keep sending messages about that<br/>&gt; infernal missing box in Arkansas but unbeknownst to them, I'm not getting
<br/>&gt; them. I get reported to the LBNA folks because of that one box, but I've<br/>&gt; been down here diligently caring for all my other boxes and finding boxes<br/>&gt; nearly ever weekend.</p></span></div>
<div>
<p>I had not thought of this possibility and I don't think it should happen.  If a</p>
<p>letterboxer is still active, none of their boxes should be declared orphans,</p>
<p>even if they don't keep up with status.</p></div>
<div><span class="q">
<p> <br/>&gt; 3) Do folks really distinguish between a "reported missing" flag and a<br/>&gt; "missing" flag? I'm with you on everything else you suggested, but I can't<br/>&gt; say I'm real crazy about putting flags on boxes. I can be convinced
<br/>&gt; though. Am I reading this right that the flag would only happen to boxes<br/>&gt; already declare orphaned? Flagging of any sort wouldn't be used as a<br/>&gt; determining factor to decide whether to orphan a box?</p>
</span></div>
<div>
<p>Correct, only boxes determined to be orphans (see #1) would have their</p>
<p>names changeable by the status flag.  So if someone checks "attempted" on</p>
<p>a regular LB, the box name does not change.  If someone checks "attempted"</p>
<p>on an orphan LB, the box name gets "reported missing" added to its name.</p>
<p>The bad thing about this is that if the box really is not missing, nobody will</p>
<p>go look for it.  That is why I suggested that if the status was changed to "found"</p>
<p>the "reported missing" would be taken off of the box name.</p></div>
<div><span class="q">
<p> <br/>&gt; 4) I can't quite wrap my mind around this (it was up until 3:30 this morning<br/>&gt; and had to go to work with me at 8:00), but I feel a little bit of circular<br/>&gt; logic here. Depending on how we define a placer as being out of the game,
<br/>&gt; we could be relying on reports to determine that boxes are orphaned and<br/>&gt; that a boxer has abandoned their boxes, in which case we flag their boxes<br/>&gt; with reported missing flags.</p></span></div>
<div>
<p>We would determine if boxes should be identified as orphans, then anyone</p>
<p>that updates the current status flag would affect the box name.</p></div>
<div><span class="q">
<p><br/>&gt; As I said, I ain't arguing with the approach. Just trying to think it all<br/>&gt; through.<br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/><br/></p></span>
</div>
<div>
<p>After looking at your questions, I realize this is probably too complicated and might</p>
<p>be too hard to implement.  The other solution that was tried several years ago of keeping</p>
<p>a database with status of boxes was a total flop and let to such ill will that many boxers</p>
<p>are still upset about it.  Choi has still not responded, so maybe he does not want to start</p>
<p>another war.   I will probably not persue this further.  Thanks for your responses. </p>
