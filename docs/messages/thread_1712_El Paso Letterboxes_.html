Hi Everyone.<br>
<br>
	If anyone is passing through the area, I wish you would take the<br>
time to drop in for my EASY letterboxes.  I picked up some hitch-hikers in<br>
AZ and CO, and brought them here.  But there is so little activity here I am<br>
now afraid they won't move for years.  They are located <br>

<br>
AND HERE:<br>

<br>
	Both are inside the state park, and are almost reachable with a<br>
wheelchair in 5 minutes each.<br>
<br>
NOTE - NOTE - NOTE - NOTE - NOTE......<br>

Mr. Silver Eagle - I was doing some hiking in the park today, Mogollon Mask<br>
is just fine and has had a few visitors since I came along.<br>
<br>
Y-all have a great week!!!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That is great news.  Maybe you can see if these visitors<br>
have email addresses on the Big List or LBNA and send<br>
them an email to please place a few boxes near you.<br>
I do plan to come that way again, but it probably won't<br>
be for another year.  Hang in there!<br>
