<div>Hi all,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We hit an emotional snag today, so here's a question to help us over the rough spots next time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Suppose a group of several people are going out letterboxing together.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>They all "find" the box together, so they all get to stamp in at that box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Correct?  Based on what I've seen in various boxes, I think that is usual.</div>
<div>(let me know if not!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But then, suppose while that same group is together, one of the boxes they find has a hitchhiker in it?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Does everyone get to stamp in the logbook of the hitch hiker, because they were all together?  Or would it be "more correct" for only one person to be designated as the Finder for that particular box, so only that one person would put their stamp in the hitch hiker log book, and the hh stamp would only go in that same person's personal log book?
</div>

<div>Well, if it were MY hitchhiker, I would want everyone to stamp in!  Here's how I see a HH.  It's a fly on the wall that travels around telling a story.  And the story I would read when the log eventually came back to me would be: "we were all out on a box hunt and we stumbled across a box with this HH - hooray we were all so glad to find it we couldn't wait to stamp in..." sort of thing. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>In your situation, my dilemma would be "who is the keeper?" more than "who is the finder?"</div>

<div>I agree, Lucy.  I'd love to see lots of different stamps in any HH 
logbooks I'm ever lucky enough to see again (only one of mine I've seen so far 
was completely waterlogged - think it had been through Hurricane Rita, and 
fortunately for both the HH and me, Baby Bear was kind enough to replace the 
original logbook.  But the original log &amp; stamps are just a colorful 
blur.)  Since my sister and I do a lot of boxing together, we often find 
HH's and sort of take turns keeping it, unless one of us was more "responsible" 
for finding that particular box and the other was sort of a go-along.  Then 
it's easy.  Also, if one of us finds a really cool HH without the other one 
being present, we'll usually let the other person stamp in it also before 
sending it on its way, or even hand it off to each other to place in the next 
box.  No rules, right?  Just keep 'em moving! --
