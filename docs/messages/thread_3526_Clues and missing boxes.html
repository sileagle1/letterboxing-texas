                    <html><body><div>That's really cool that letterboxing is so well accepted there.  I say this because we recently visited a place where the opposite was the story.  During a trip to Natchitoches we dropped in at Fort St. Jean Baptiste for a cool tour and hopefully to find  a couple of letterboxes.  The clues for the boxes stated they had been moved inside to the visitors center due to problems with snakes.  When we asked about the boxes we got a very negative reaction from the people in the visitors center.  They said letterboxers had lipped into the park without paying and trampled on areas that visitors were not allowed.  When we asked some others that worked at the fort they told the story a little differently.  In fact, they mentioned geocachers.  I'm not certain of their history with letterboxing, but they could not help us with the boxes and told us they were probably destroyed.</div> <div>Jim<br/><br/><b><i>Lois -James

<div>I found that box two or three years ago; I'm so glad to hear it is still alive and well. That was very nice of them to hold onto it, and nice of you to return it to its spot.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did see your name in the log book and also GG was the first finder <br/>
on 8/10/05. Just love to read logbooks.<br/>
The last finders were a group from Palestine, TX. Left their names <br/>
with the last one signing in as Greg on 2/3/ 08. The workers in the <br/>
office told me they had had a lot of volunteers cleaning up the <br/>
underbrush and trash on the trails lately so I suspect that is how it <br/>
was discovered out of it's hiding place. Sometimes volunteer workers <br/>
get a little over zealous.<br/>
