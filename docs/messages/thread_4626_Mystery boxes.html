<div>If it is the series I am thinking about? I missed the "clue" as well but did not mark it as an attempt. I emailed u on AQ and ask "what did I miss?" I think, Or maybe I wrote you a note on the "log" page and you were nice enough to email me on AQ and tell me what I missed. Honestly, I made that mistake in the past with a series of your boxes and got my feeling hurt by your reply/what you did to the clues for the boxes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe if you put something on the clue page on AQ/LBNA that says there is a twist to the last box or if you can't find one to email you instead of "logging" as an attempt. Or at least for the letterboxers to drop you a note about what their problem was and why they felt they could not find it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just a thought from someone who now always thinks twice about marking a box as an attempt.</div>

<div>I have a series of five boxes in Houston that I didn't list as "Mystery" boxes, but the clues for box number five take some creative thinking to solve. Therefore, it seems, every other "finder" lists that box as "attempted". So, one person finds it, the next person "attempts" it, the next person finds it....so on. I don't mind that as long as everyone understands that the "attempt" was an attempt to solve the clue and not a "box missing" report. Should I change the box from a traditional to a mystery?

<div>Boots, I'm thinking people are atempting it just from the last box with the last clue and not the set. </div>
<div>Maybe you should add to the last clue so people know how to put it together. Or maybe an extra envelope in the 4th box with a hint only to be open if you don't think you understand where the last box is. That way you don't ruin it for those playing who do get it.    </div>

<div>If it is the series I am thinking about? I missed the "clue" as well but did not mark it as an attempt. I emailed u on AQ and ask "what did I miss?" I think, Or maybe I wrote you a note on the "log" page and you were nice enough to email me on AQ and tell me what I missed. Honestly, I made that mistake in the past with a series of your boxes and got my feeling hurt by your reply/what you did to the clues for the boxes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe if you put something on the clue page on AQ/LBNA that says there is a twist to the last box or if you can't find one to email you instead of "logging" as an attempt. Or at least for the letterboxers to drop you a note about what their problem was and why they felt they could not find it. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just a thought from someone who now always thinks twice about marking a box as an attempt.</div>

<div>I have a series of five boxes in Houston that I didn't list as "Mystery" boxes, but the clues for box number five take some creative thinking to solve. Therefore, it seems, every other "finder" lists that box as "attempted". So, one person finds it, the next person "attempts" it, the next person finds it....so on. I don't mind that as long as everyone understands that the "attempt" was an attempt to solve the clue and not a "box missing" report. Should I change the box from a traditional to a mystery? Just wondering.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/></div></div>

I don't remember what I could have said to do that, unless I was trying to explain why a box shouldn't be logged as an "attempt" unless you were reasonably sure that you were in the right place and were pretty certain that the box was missing.  I'll try to make sure that doesn't happen in the future.  I guess I am a little too passionate about letterboxing and sometimes don't think about how my words can be misinterpreted. I am happy to know, however, that you think twice about logging an attempt. Thanks. <br/>

&gt; I have a series of five boxes in Houston that I didn't list as "Mystery" boxes, but the clues for box number five take some creative thinking to solve. Therefore, it seems, every other "finder" lists that box as "attempted". So, one person finds it, the next person "attempts" it, the next person finds it....so on. I don't mind that as long as everyone understands that the "attempt" was an attempt to solve the clue and not a "box missing" report. Should I change the box from a traditional to a mystery? Just wondering.<br/>

<br/>If you have successful finders, then - as you said - you know it's doable. Beyond that, it is up to you to do as you please with the clues. Can't tell you how many times I've had people write to tell me my Spring Hope box isn't there, only to go and find it right in its place - the clues are deceptively simple and yet surprisingly elusive. I especially enjoy the people who come back for it three or four times, finally "get it" at the least expected moment and hurry back to find the box itself.

This is just the kind of boxes that I love... something that makes me feel like I've accomplished something by having to "figure it out". I'll definitely have to come "attempt" this series. By the way, I never mark a box as attempted even if I'm pretty sure I'm in the right place, because I don't know what the point is. There was a box on the Pacific Coast Trail that I spent about two hours searching for and finally decided it was missing and gave up. A few weeks later, it was found by other letterboxers, so obviously I was not in the right place. It happens. Glad I didn't allow my ego to mark it as attempted.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have a series of five boxes in Houston that I didn't list as "Mystery" boxes, <br/>

&gt; Well if you were to give a clue about the last clue, then the series<br/>
&gt; couldn't be called NADA CLUE, could it?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I haven't been to Houston since Dewberry, TeamKing and MO5 did the book<br/>
&gt; gathering so I can't speak specifically to your series, but I have to say I<br/>
&gt; find it frustrating to get started but not be able to get to the end -<br/>
&gt; thrillingly frustrating!  I love a great challenge and if it means I have to<br/>
&gt; come back a second time, so be it.  But then, I'm one that loves the process<br/>
&gt; of getting there as much or more than the actual finding.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If you have successful finders, then - as you said - you know it's doable.<br/>
&gt; Beyond that, it is up to you to do as you please with the clues.  Can't tell<br/>
&gt; you how many times I've had people write to tell me my Spring Hope box isn't<br/>
&gt; there, only to go and find it right in its place - the clues are deceptively<br/>
&gt; simple and yet surprisingly elusive.  I especially enjoy the people who come<br/>
&gt; back for it three or four times, finally "get it" at the least expected<br/>
&gt; moment and hurry back to find the box itself.  THAT'S a placer's pleasure,<br/>
&gt; if you ask me!<br/>

&gt; I have a series of five boxes in Houston that I didn't list as "Mystery" boxes, but the clues for box number five take some creative thinking to solve.  Therefore, it seems, every other "finder" lists that box as "attempted".  So, one person finds it, the next person "attempts" it, the next person finds it....so on.  I don't mind that as long as everyone understands that the "attempt" was an attempt to solve the clue and not a "box missing" report.  Should I change the box from a traditional to a mystery?

I have to agree about not logging to find if something happend where you really didn't look for the box. Ex. I went to look for a box under a bush and 10 wasps came flying out. I decided to retry in the colder season.<br/><br/><br/>MegaFamily<br/>

      You have certainly peaked my curiosity with the discussion of this series! This is just the kind of boxes that I love... something that makes me feel like I've accomplished something by having to "figure it out". I'll definitely have to come "attempt" this series. By the way, I never mark a box as attempted even if I'm pretty sure I'm in the right place, because I don't know what the point is. There was a box on the Pacific Coast Trail that I spent about two hours searching for and finally decided it was missing and gave up. A few weeks later, it was found by other letterboxers, so obviously I was not in the right place. It happens. Glad I didn't allow my ego to mark it as attempted.<br/>

&gt; Yes, the series I'm talking about is called NADA CLUE and is in Memorial Park.  These boxes are a little different in that the listed clue only takes you to the first box, then each box has clues to take you to the next box, except for the last one, and there lies the mystery.  How do you get to the last box?  I assure you that the clues are available, you just have to figure them out on the fly so to speak.  I know it must be frustrating to get that far and not be able to find the last box, but many people have found it, so it isn't impossible.  I think I'll just make this series a "Mystery".  There are mystery boxes out there that I have yet to solve, but I occasionally revisit them and maybe one day I'll have a breakthrough, who knows?  Not everyone can solve every mystery.  Do you really think the experience is ruined because you can't find the fifth box? I'm just curious, because I'd like to know what people think.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I did the same thing but didn't mark it as a attempt either. You also told me <br/>
&gt; &gt; what I missed when you saw I hadn't found the last one. If I'm thinking of the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Memorial series of Boxes your writing about. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Boots, I'm thinking people are atempting it just from the last box with the last <br/>
&gt; &gt; clue and not the set. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe you should add to the last clue so people know how to put it together. Or <br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe an extra envelope in the 4th box with a hint only to be open if you don't <br/>
&gt; &gt; think you understand where the last box is. That way you don't ruin it for those <br/>
&gt; &gt; playing who do get it.    <br/>

&gt; &gt; If it is the series I am thinking about? I missed the "clue" as well but did not <br/>
&gt; &gt; mark it as an attempt. I emailed u on AQ and ask "what did I miss?" I think, Or <br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe I wrote you a note on the "log" page and you were nice enough to email me <br/>
&gt; &gt; on AQ and tell me what I missed. Honestly, I made that mistake in the past with <br/>
&gt; &gt; a series of your boxes and got my feeling hurt by your reply/what you did to the <br/>
&gt; &gt; clues for the boxes. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Maybe if you put something on the clue page on AQ/LBNA that says there is a <br/>
&gt; &gt; twist to the last box or if you can't find one to email you instead of "logging" <br/>
&gt; &gt; as an attempt. Or at least for the letterboxers to drop you a note about what <br/>
&gt; &gt; their problem was and why they felt they could not find it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Just a thought from someone who now always thinks twice about marking a box as <br/>
