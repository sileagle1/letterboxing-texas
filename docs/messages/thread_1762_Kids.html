hide a letterbox.  I went into the LbNA site with the idea that I <br>
would sign her up for an account with her own trail name, but I wanted <br>
to use my email address and I was denied for that reason.  How do you <br>
sign up a kid who doesn't have their own email address?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I would just set up an email account for purposes of<br>
the child's use because apparently LBNA won't let you<br>
record one email address for two accounts.  If you do<br>
it right, you can set it up so that the secondary<br>
account feeds into your main account, so you don't<br>
have to check both accounts regularly.  It's been a<br>
LONG time since I've done that though, so I don't<br>
recall which services allow that to be done...<br>
<br>
I'll do a little research.  I'm really in the same<br>
boat, since I first logged SJZ's early boxes in under<br>
my address (and actually, while she carved the stamp,<br>
hiding was a group effort, so I could justify it<br>
then).  Looking back, I would like my kids to have<br>
their own account so they will eventually have their<br>
own history of boxes listed as they get old enough to<br>
venture off on their own, as SJZ has.<br>
