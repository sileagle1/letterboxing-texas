some that I have already found. I finally was able to plant a box at <br/>
Henry's Chapel. I have wanted one there for a long time, but didn't <br/>
quite know which stamp I wanted there. This small community is on the <br/>
Historical List with a very interesting story behind it. We had a fun <br/>
day, and I was excited to finally get one planted there.<br/>
happy Boxing!<br/>
