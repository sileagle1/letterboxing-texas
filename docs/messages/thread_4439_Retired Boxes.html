<div>As a finder of both those boxes, Blue Butterfly, I can agree that they were special, beautiful locations and fun boxes.  If you replant them, I will come looking for them!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh no. My grandsons were the self-appointed guardians of your Arboretum box. We never go there without them slyly positioning themselves nearby and snagging it when no one is around so I can check on it. They'll be so disappointed (as I am). For a short time, there was one hidden under the foundation of one of those little houses in the pioneer area, but we couldn't find it last fall when we were there so it must have disappeared. I haven't been to the gardens yet this spring, but I have it on my schedule for one pretty day during spring break (this week). I think I'll go with my husband instead of my grandchildren because I'm wondering what it will be like to not constantly be saying, "don't climb on that/ don't step there!" Then I started thinking, it may not be all that different.<br/>

Lucy Locket had carved the stamp. which was one of her very first ones. It is missing, so I am retiring it for now, but look for a new box and a new carve in the near future. It was so much fun going there eating lunch and checking on the box. I was always looking at the stamp thinking how good LL had gotten at carving stamps. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Also, My Box at the Dallas Arboretum, Flowers, Birds, Leaves and Trees, planted Sept. 10,2005 is missing. My husband and I were there yesterday (awesome tulips! and Ferdinand the Bull) They have "cleaned" the area where the box was. As most of you know, this too was one of my very favorite places. Don't think I am going to place another box there anytime soon, but who knows. It is very difficult to find a "safe" place there. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I had to replace the logbooks in these two boxes several times over the years, and was always awed by who s tamped in and how many Boxers visited these locations. <br/>&gt; Thank-you!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Blue Butterfly<br/>&gt;<br/></p>

I wasn't able to get to the Pioneer Area, it was closed for a private party. the tulips weren't all bloomed out, but next week they should be, I say take the husband and grandsons. Read the "Adventures of Ferdinand the Bull" before you go. He is feartured  this year...he's really cute :) </p>

We never go there without them slyly positioning themselves nearby and snagging it when no one is around so I can check on it. They'll be so disappointed (as I am). For a short time, there was one hidden under the foundation of one of those little houses in the pioneer area, but we couldn't find it last fall when we were there so it must have disappeared. I haven't been to the gardens yet this spring, but I have it on my schedule for one pretty day during spring break (this week). I think I'll go with my husband instead of my grandchildren because I'm wondering what it will be like to not constantly be saying, "don't climb on that/ don't step there!" Then I started thinking, it may not be all that different.<br/>&gt; Puddle Splasher<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, "DeDe" bluebutterflytexas@ wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; On July 13, 2005, I planted my very first box at Love's Lookout.
