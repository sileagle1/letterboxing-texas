<div>We had a really weird letterboxing day last week. We went out to find a box 
near Eagle Mountain Lake. We were walking down the trail, and saw this little 
deer standing in the path.   I started walking up to him slowly, 
expecting him to bolt, but he started trotting right toward us!  He walked 
right up to me and started rubbing his head on me!  We petted him for a 
while and he followed us all the way to the box location. There was a couple 
sitting nearby, so we left, with the intention of hitting another box and 
coming back. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We headed up to New Fairview to find Howling, a 
box that hadn't been found in almost two years, and only once (By Gryzzled 
Gryphon, of course).  I expected it to be missing, but it was right where 
it was suppose to be, in pristine condition.  (Y'all get up there and find 
this lonely box!!)  While we were there, this little cotton tail just 
hopped right past us...not scared at all.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>When we got back to Eagle Mountain Lake and found 
the first box, the deer was at the entrance of the park.  We sat with him 
for a while, and then headed to the box.  We found it, after some trouble. 
I picked it up and it started sloshing, so I knew something wasn't right. 
Sure enough, it was FULL of water. The logbook was soaked, the felt around the 
stamp was soaked...it was bad. I sat at the table to evaluate the situation, and 
looked down to see that someone had written a tiny message into the table; "A 
restless wind blows through a letterbox." Much to my chagrin, my husband wrote 
back, "and now it's full of calm waters."<br/></div>
<div>I normally don't condone vandalism, but it was poignant. </div>

<div>Here are a couple of photos of our little 
deer friend.  We call him "Popcorn".</div>

<div>Wow!  What a day.  We were within a few 
miles of Howling last weekend and it was on my printed list of clues.  
Unfortunately we had to limit our boxes as Monday was a school (and work) day 
and we still had to travel home.  I'm glad to hear Howling is alive and 
well.</div>
