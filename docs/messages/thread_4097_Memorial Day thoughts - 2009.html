to reflect. We face challenges which rival those of the 20th Century. Our 
governing leadership seems to pull in a direction away from the Constitution. 
Government meddling in business ownership and business decisions is more 
appropriate to the discredited communism tried around the globe in the 20th 
Century than to the United States of any era.<br/><br/>Social changes are strange, 
they pull us in opposing directions. Religion and belief in a Creator is 
suppressed - still by peer pressure, but being increasingly reinforced by 
government action. Meanwhile that same government insists that fairness reign 
and that wherewithal be evenly distributed. Share and share alike, no one be 
more adept than another. All of us the same, controlled by 
bureaucrats.<br/><br/>Iran has launched a long range missile with some success. 
The US leadership doesn't see eye-to-eye with Israel, one of our formerly 
closest allies. The world wants Guantanamo to close. Our Congress won't fund it. 
Our House Speaker accuses our intelligence operators of lying. The newly 
installed CIA Director stands against the Speaker.<br/><br/>The world's terrorist 
community is still virulent. Their longing to annihilate non-believers is 
unfulfilled.<br/><br/>That's facing us; it's serious. Deadly serious. But it's not 
the time to consider the threat. It's time to look upon those that kept us alive 
to get here.<br/><br/>Memorial Day has us consider the blessing of the neighbor, 
friend, brother, sister, uncle, aunt, father, mother who has given all, the most 
profound sacrifice. Our most important blessing is the one we grieve over on 
Memorial Day: the heroes who died for our freedom. Our military members of 
service, lost to us on the battlefield. Our law enforcement-emergency services 
members of service, lost to us in battle in our homeland.<br/><br/>We have those 
critically injured, maimed, combat stressed service members - still alive and 
with us - who are as they are because they heeded the call. Take this time, 
along with family get-togethers and cookouts, to reflect on the blessing that is 
our warrior class. They got us this far.<br/><br/>And then, after the holiday, 
stand together and face the coming challenges. It's the least we can do in their 
honor.<br/></font><br/>  <br/></div></body></html>
