As far as my personal stamp, it is an eagle that I stamp<br>
with silver ink.  I started with a store bought stamp which<br>
I thought was great, but as I started carving stamps and<br>
placing them, I felt it was time to carve my own personal one.<br>
I chose the name Silver Eagle because that is what my name<br>
is for Indian Princesses, which my daughter and I participate in.<br>
I love eagles and since I am showing my age, Silver Eagle<br>
seemed appropriate.  At least I'm not a bald eagle!<br>

It is an organization sponsored by YMCA that is for Dads<br>
and daughters.  It has an Indian theme and honors their<br>
way of life by allowing Dads and daughters quality time<br>
together via sponsored activites and monthly meetings.<br>
It is less structured than Girl Scouts and we have<br>
enjoyed it for several years.  You can look at this<br>
link for more information:<br>
