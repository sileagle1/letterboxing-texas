                    <html><body><p>Funny about that - I thought the event was box-worthy around midnight and since I was sitting at the top of the stadium, I started scoping potential locations. Of course, by that time we were all pretty punch-drunk so I will want to see the ideas I had in the light of day.<br/>
</p><p>It WAS quite a game and since I rode the band bus to Nacogdoches, I got to stay for the WHOLE thing! It ended at 12:40 this morning.<br/></p><p>It started out looking like a walkaway for us - two touchdowns in the first 3 or 4 minutes, but Nacogdoches tied it back up before the half. After the half we scored again a couple of times and they matched, leaving the game 28-28 at the end of regular play. Because overtime possessions are all started from the 25 yard line, it made for alot of excitement as each team continued to score touchdowns in every possession, but no extra points or conversions.</p>
<p>Sometime during overtime, we got word that Marshall lost so we had a slot in the playoffs, and Nacogodoches had it figured out that they had to beat us by 7 points to get into the playoffs. We (in the crowd anyway) didn't know that, so when they scored their touchdown during the first OT and tied it up then took a knee on their extra point, we were stunned! It went back and forth like that - forever it seemed, with Nac trying to get ahead by 7. They played it very strategically, but in the last OT they didn't score and we were able to come up with a field goal, so the game was over.</p>
<p>It was quite an exciting game and while we love our team, I have to say I was disappointed for Nacogdoches because they played with a lot of heart. It would've been nice to see them go to the playoffs too after such a hard-played game.<br/>
</p><p>We managed to get loaded up in record time (it usually takes about an hour and we got done in 45 minutes) and got home about 2:30. One of the band members graciously announced that they had to be back at the school in exactly 12 hours to leave for marching contest in Palestine today. Ugh. <br/>
