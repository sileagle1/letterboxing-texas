<div> </div>
<div>Yahoo is rolling out some cool little toys called grouplets I thought y'all might like to play around with.  We may or may not leave them on our list, and there is some customization with them that can be done.  Take a look at them at the link below, mess around with them, and let me know if you have ideas for how to use them in our group. </div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/grouplets/subscriptions">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/grouplets/subscriptions</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>CAUTION:  These are BETA - all of them.  That means they may be buggy or may not act like you think they should.  When working with anything Beta, patience is the watchword.  If you don't like it, don't play with it, and if you feel like it, tell me why you don't like it.  They are not programs, so they shouldn't jack with your computer, more like database templates.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A note in the interest of personal safety - you have the ability in some of these "grouplets" to enter very specific personal information.  We moderators are not in the business of preventing you from telling everyone your life story AND your street address if you are inclined to share your personal identity with strangers, but I would suggest that you not provide any information that you would not hand out to someone you would not welcome at your front door. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I'll be interested to hear what you think about these little things.  One thing I already don't like about them is that they aren't accessible from the group's homepage, but I suspect that's because they are still in Beta.<br/>
