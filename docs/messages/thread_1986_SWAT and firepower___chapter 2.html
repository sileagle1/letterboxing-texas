                    <html><body><div>Okay, in my last sitrep for my second trip to Wacoon the 4th of July, I alluded to being surrounded by a SWAT team, and I thought I would go ahead and expound on that.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had as our mission to plant a box in Killeen - an area with nary a box, but with a new letterboxer recently returned from Irag and relocated to Fort Hood.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now you would think that it wouldn't be too hard to find a nice park in Killeen, but Lightning (my 10-year-old son, for the several new members) and I were hard pressed to find one for the box we wanted to plant - a "Welcome to Texas and thanks for everything" sort of box.  I'll bet we drove the streets of Killeen for two hours, after having already done some boxing in Temple and knowing we needed to head on back to our own town in a few short hours.  We were getting a bit desperate, and in our meanderings we spotted a tank and a helicopter on display in a very small monument area in Killeen.  We got out and began surveying it, wondering if this were the sort of place we could successfully plant a box.  It looked a little too manicured to me, and Lightning agreed, so we were hanging over the fence by the tank, each contemplating possible avenues we had not yet pursued for getting this box out of our hands.  It almost seemed as though the box became heavier and heavier as time relentlessly marched forward.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were shaken from our respective reveries as about 15-20 law enforcement vehicles swarmed around us, from several different agencies.  I looked at our feet to see if possibly we had infringed on the monument in some way, not thinking that they would surely not send that many officers to tell us to keep off the grass.  We scootched up closer to each other, and closer still when suddenly all the officers in all the cars started pouring out of their vehicles and handing out guns - lots and lots of guns.  At that point, I was beginning to wonder if we hadn't accidentally ventured onto Fort Hood - if 9/11 had indeed changed life around military bases this much - if loitering was more of a crime than I thought it was.  
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>After a moment or two of panic, and an almost overwhelming urge to blurt out every bad thing I have ever done and a great desire to NOT be letterboxing at that moment, I suddenly realized that they were actually paying no attention to us.  It was as though we were invisible to them.  Well.  That certainly changed things, and I was immediately glad I hadn't started blurting.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now my mind reverted at that moment to a time when my daughter (now almost 19) was very small and I was enjoying a nice day with her as a toddler in a beautiful park when something similar had happened to me.  On that occasion I was a little quicker to realize they weren't paying attention to me (probably because at that point in my life, I had a lot less to blurt than I do now), I continued to enjoy the park and to pretend there was nothing unusual going on.  As it turns out, I learned later that my peaceful little park was actually situated right beneath a jail facility on the fourth floor, and there was, as we sat there, a jailbreak underway.  Now I have no idea why they allowed us to continue sitting there, but they did.  Surely we weren't ever REALLY in danger.  ANYWAY....that incident crossed through my mind as we watched this swarming of SWAT team members.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I took a good look around and realized that we were indeed on the back side of the police department - could this be a repeat of that event nearly two decades ago?  And then I realized that they were all taking the weapons inside, AND they were all jovial.  That was good.  And finally, my mind settled in to what I was observing and it told me "Who better than a police officer to tell you where a park is?"
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now Lightning hadn't quite pulled all this together so he was a little taken aback when I grabbed his hand and marched up to one of the officers and said "Excuse me, but can you tell me where a park is?"  Judging by this guy's face, the last thing on his mind was being a Chamber of Commerce liaison.  I'm still uncertain whether they had been on an actual call out, or if they were only doing maneuvers, but clearly something big had been going on for them and hanging out by the swing set wasn't high on their list of things to think about.  To his credit though, he got his head together pretty quickly and started thinking about parks.  He asked what sort of park I was looking for, and I was unprepared for that question.  The straight answer would have been "Well you see I have this little camoflauge container (at which point I would have to pull out my little camoflauge container) and I want to hide it in one of your parks so other people can sneak around and find it".  That really didn't seem to be the right approach at the moment, so I said "We want to hike a bit...yeah, hike.  That's it!"  Lightning and I looked at each other and looked back at him and smiled convincingly.  He eased up a bit, and then said he didn't think they had any hiking trails in their parks.  Lucy's mouth runs away with her sometimes, and she said "You mean to tell me you Killeen people don't HIKE? You have no TRAILS?"  Oops.  I made an immediate note to myself "Don't insult the helping guy."  Finally he directed me to a very nice park with a hiking trail wanna be, which I had a terrible time finding even with good directions.  We looked for it for another hour at least!  And I'm just positive that I passed 7 or 8 police cars as we looked - I wonder if they were watching me as I looked for the park.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So yes, we were indeed surrounded by a SWAT team, although they weren't honoring us at the moment.  And thankfully so.  <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
<div> </div>
<div>P.S.  As to the box, it is planted and has been found by it's intended first finder, Mike's son, and I'm trying to get it posted.  You can, however, go to it on either AQ or LBNA and find it and get started on the research you would have to do to get the whole set of clues!
