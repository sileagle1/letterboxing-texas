I wasn't in the best mood today, and was reading e-mails before <br/>
heading into work... and saw Thimble Cat's e-mail about the new <br/>
(first) box in Temple.  Now I could look forward to having to leave <br/>
the house.  After work I went to find it.  I had to sit and read for <br/>
a while until a group of teenagers left.  I was almost ready to give <br/>
up for the day when they did, and I had the area to myself. <br/>
Thank you for the new box.  <br/>
I am working on planting my first box and scoped out a spot in <br/>
Temple last week.  I now have to do the stamps and boxes.  It might <br/>
take a while, but it's in the works.<br/>
<br/>
Now that the holidays are over, I'll take the opportunity to also <br/>
introduce myself.  I joined Lb in Tx about a month ago.  I've been <br/>
boxing for 6 months.  Started after I read a small mention about the <br/>
sport in, I believe, a rubber stamping magazine.  I am hooked.  <br/>
Unfortunately, my husband isn't.  Fortunately, he's good about it <br/>
(and likes to go to the park to take photographs).  I also hooked a <br/>
friend and believe that she will be planting some boxes, also.<br/>
I love to hike and be outdoors so this hobby is icing on the cake.  <br/>
