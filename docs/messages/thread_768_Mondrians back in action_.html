Hey all, I just replaced and slightly relocated all five of the <br>
Mondrian series.  Let's hope they last longer this time.<br>
<br>
On another note-What's up with the little green flags on the LB website <br>
next to some boxes?  Also, how do you report found boxes?  I tried <br>
clicking on Found boxes under member services and got a page where <br>
there was nothing to click to report found boxes.  I browsed the site <br>
for 20 minutes trying to find more info to no avail.<br>

forgot to answer your first question: the green flags indicate a box whose<br>
clues are hosted on another website, like Silver Eagle's, for example.<br>

Good luck,<br>
