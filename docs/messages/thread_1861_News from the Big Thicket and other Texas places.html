                    <div class="plaintext-content">  Monday morning Lone Star Quilter and I decided to take a letterbox <br>
hunting trip.  We had been feeding and pampering our wonderful and <br>
beautiful quilting guests for 12 straight days and needed a break.  <br>
So we headed over toward the big thicket area, knowing full well <br>
that we might be on a sight-seeing trip thanks to Hurricane Rita.  <br>
We attempted to find Baby Bear's Pitcher Plant near Warren, but are <br>
reporting it as lost.  Then we headed up to Martin Dies, Jr. State <br>
Park at Jasper.  The park is open now, but most of the trails are <br>
closed. Henhouse Ridge camping area is open, but Hickory Ridge is <br>
only partially open for camping.  We found a trail that was not <br>
marked as closed, but, as it turned out, probably should have been.  <br>
We actually found Hawk's Squirrelly Camper and DrooP's Wading Bird <br>
letterboxes.  The short bridge to the island was damaged, but had <br>
been partially repaired, so we considered that an invitation to <br>
cross it.  A large pine tree was lying across the bridge and we had <br>
to crawl under it, which we did.  I didn't say we were smart, just <br>
adventurous.  The trail to Squirrelly Camper was blocked by a huge <br>
tree, maybe 3 feet in diameter, which we climbed over.  Next, the <br>
top of a large fallen tree covered the trail and we had to make our <br>
way through the woods around it.  We found the box right where it <br>
should have been, high and dry.  Encouraged by the success, we <br>
crossed the long bridge to find Wading Bird, which we did.  It was <br>
in good condition as well.  All the small trees with the blue trail <br>
markers on them were broken and lying on the ground.  We did see one <br>
alligator from the bridge. <br>
   Deciding we had pushed our luck, we headed south to Village Creek <br>
State Park at Lumberton.  Monday was the first day that park was <br>
open since the hurricane and the damage was evident.  All the trails <br>
were closed and signs were posted prohibiting the use of the trails <br>
under threat of prosecution.  We decided those three boxes could <br>
wait for another day.  On to Anahuac to attempt to find Baby Bear's <br>
Coastal Night Lights, but no luck there.  We have reported it as <br>
missing.  Better luck  with Silver Eagle's Anahuac Anhinga <br>
Letterbox.  Although it had not been reported as found since June <br>
2004, it was sitting right where it belonged and was in great <br>
shape.  The Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge is a wonderful place to <br>
visit.  This is a coastal marsh area and is abounding with birds of <br>
every description.  We were there just before dusk and we saw a <br>
dozen or more different types of birds.  Thanks to Silver Eagle for <br>
taking us to this beautiful place.  You should all make it a point <br>
to find this letterbox.  Then, it was on to Galveston to spend the <br>
night and rest up for another day of 'boxing.  We found Hawk's <br>
Celtic Cross, Lucy Locket's Water Can, Dewberry's Pirate's Puzzle, <br>
Team King's Tribute to England Series #7, Quetzel's State Tall Ship, <br>
and Hawk's Sea Aggie.  Hawk's Cavalla letterbox is missing.  We <br>
attempted to find Celtic Lion's Oleander Island without success.  <br>
Having found only 9 boxes in the better part of two days, we decided <br>
to up our count by finding the Runaway Circus Series by Birds of a <br>
Feather.  It was almost on the way home.  We got there about 4:30 <br>
and knew we would have to hurry.  The gate had a padlock and chain <br>
but no closing time was posted.  We found all 8 boxes as well as <br>
Dewberry's Time Travelers with its 2 boxes and Runsforchocolate's <br>
box, Seven.  We had just replaced all the boxes when a security <br>
guard showed up and chased us out so he could lock up.  We ended up <br>
with 21 finds for the trip, so were well rewarded.  Thanks to all <br>
you guys out there for placing all the great letterboxes for us to <br>
find.  Happy Trails!<br>
