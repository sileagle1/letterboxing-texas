New to letterboxing.  Just got started 2 days ago!  Heard about it from <br>
a friend and am definately hooked.  My family loves it!  Husband loves <br>
it too!  We are going by the name K5 (there's 3 kids + me & hubby) We <br>
need to make a stamp.  So far we've found 5 in the Arlington, TX area.  <br>
Love it!  Any advice would be wonderful!  Best sites...etc...<br>
Thanks!  Can't wait to read your posts.<br>

<div>Welcome, Valerie!  It sounds as though you are in the DFW metroplex 
area, and there are quite a few boxes to be found around here, quite a growth 
spurt since two years ago when I first discovered letterboxing and only about 
8-15 boxes existed anywhere around Dallas or Ft Worth (and all of those were 
planted by Kantexan in Arlington or Celtic Lions in Dallas, thanks very very 
much to both!).  Suddenly in the past year there has been almost an 
explosion of interest in local letterboxing, so there is much more activity for 
the rest of us to enjoy.  I think I recognize your name from contacting me 
about at least one of my letterboxes, so maybe you've been a little north of the 
Arlington area, too. </div>

One of the first boxes I searched for was The Curse of the Witness Tree (I just looked it up and it's been pulled for maintenance). So, rather than look for it now, keep a watch on it. It's on LBNA. I had to search for it three times and it was maddening, then the most joy when I actually used the correct procedures and found the box.</div> <div> </div> <div>There are so many good boxes, it's hard to keep up. I've been lurking for a couple of weeks because it's a busy time of year here at work. I can't wait to get back out on the trails. If you're up to it. The Moose Series is awesome. The hike was great, the views fabulous and the stamps spectacular.
