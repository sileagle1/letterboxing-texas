                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have tried to piece together the history of letterboxing<br/>
in Texas, and this is what I have found so far:<br/>
<br/>
The first letterbox in TX was Duck Creek #1 in Dallas, placed<br/>
by someone named Julie on August 16, 1998.  She ended up<br/>
placing several more Duck Creek boxes, but all were gone by<br/>
the time I started boxing (I confirmed this myself).  <br/>
The next people to come onto the Texas letterboxing scene were<br/>
Eoghan and Pumpkin Pricess in the year 2000.  They lived in<br/>
Austin and placed several boxes in that area in 2000 and 2001,<br/>
but moved to Colorado before I started boxing.  Eoghan's<br/>
Lost Pines box, placed on 11/04/00, is currently the oldest<br/>
confirmed letterbox still alive in TX.<br/>
There were a few other boxes in Texas when I started, but<br/>
they were placed by non-Texans passing through.  These include<br/>
3 in Brownsville and 2 in Hueco Tanks.  I have confirmed that<br/>
all 3 in Brownsville are missing, but have not tried the ones<br/>
in Hueco Tanks.  The clues can be found in the letterbox basement:<br/>
<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, other TX letterboxers started showing up in 2003,<br/>
and Barefoot Lucy started the TX Talklist when there were only<br/>
a handful of us.  We then had our first Event in March, 2004,<br/>
where 35 letterboxers showed up, surprising me to no end.<br/>
<br/>
Even though letterboxing has grown way more than I ever expected<br/>
in Texas, I still get a kick out of the occasional note<br/>
I get from a new letterboxer way out in some remote part of<br/>
Texas that found one of my letterbox seeds and got hooked.<br/>
And that's the rest of the story.<br/>
