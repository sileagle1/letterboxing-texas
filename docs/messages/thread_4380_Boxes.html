I've had trouble finding Lock & Lock boxes lately, at least in the size that I like, so I've been experimenting with other "L&L knockoffs", in particular Sterlite Ultra Latch that I can get at the Walmart in Conroe for $2.00 (2.5 cup size) and Snap 'n Lock by Snapware (2 cup size) that I got at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $2.99.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The dishwasher test is over.  The Sterlite box, $2.00 at Walmart, was in perfect condition and the paper towel inside perfectly dry.  The Snap 'n Lock box, $2.99 at Bed Bath & Beyond, was also in perfect condition, but the paper towel was slightly damp, not wet by any means, but a little damp.  Based on my tests, I'd say the Sterlite box will make a fine letterbox, and at $2.00 is very cost effective.  The other one would probably be fine, too, since the dishwasher was likely a harsher environment than nature, even in Texas, but it costs more.  I have some of them, and I'll use them up, but I'll go with Sterlite.  Lock & Lock boxes are proven by several years experience, so you can't go wrong with them.  Now if I could figure out how to keep critters from chewing on them.<br>

I pried the lids off both and they returned to normal shape and fit perfectly and tight. The other two boxes are in the diswasher. I put paper towels inside and sealed the lids so I could tell easier if they leak at all. It's a sanitizing diswasher, so it will be hot and humid in there, like East Texas in the summertime. I'll report later.<br>

I've had trouble finding Lock & Lock boxes lately, at least in the size that I like, so I've been experimenting with other "L&L knockoffs", in particular Sterlite Ultra Latch that I can get at the Walmart in Conroe for $2.00 (2.5 cup size) and Snap 'n Lock by Snapware (2 cup size) that I got at Bed, Bath and Beyond for $2.99. I've put out a few of each and they seem to be working okay, but I haven't given them the microwave and dishwasher tests. I think I'll do that today. I have use some small 3" x 4" boxes that I got from DixieGraphix, but I don't really like the fact that the logbook has to be so small, 3" x 2". She also sells a 5" x 7", 2.3 cup size that would probably be good, but they are over $4.00 each plus postage. I'll bring a couple to the TALE7 event so everyone see them. All said, I still prefer the Lock & Lock if I could get it in the right size. They're made in Australia, so maybe that's the problem, or the knockoffs are putting them out of business. I'll also bring a variety of carving material to show. We can have a show and tell for new boxers.<br>

<p>I think you said Mainstays, is that a Walmart brand?  The ones I tried didn't warp, and I boiled water in them (closed) and sanitized them in the dishwasher (closed), but I didn't freeze them.<br/>

&gt; What kind did I say I was trying out?  I was thinking they were Sterlite,<br/>
&gt; but I've peeled all the labels off and I have a short memory.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I ran my containers through the dishwasher (heavy duty cycle) separate from<br/>
&gt; the lids - good idea to run some through together to see about leakage.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It seems like the larger sized containers are having a harder time still<br/>
&gt; than the smaller ones - the smaller ones seemed to sync up a little better<br/>
&gt; than they were a day or so out of the dishwasher.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My biggest concern is that they warp under hot conditions - so do they<br/>
&gt; contract in cold?  Over time what will that mean?  Do you think you could<br/>
&gt; try putting them in the freezer after they cool down from the dishwasher?<br/>
&gt; Meanwhile, I'll look back and see what kind I used.  I think I said in my<br/>
&gt; original post.<br/>
