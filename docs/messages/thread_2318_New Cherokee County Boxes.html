<br>
Oddly enough, I was sitting here working on a stamp in memory of "J"<br>
of JBK when I noticed my daily notification of new listings had<br>
arrived and there were 7 brand new boxes in my county!  Way to go on<br>
new plants, JBK.  I can't wait to go find them - it won't be this<br>
weekend, but maybe next.<br>
<br>
As I've been working on my stamp, I've contemplated how odd it is that<br>
I am working on a box for someone I never had the opportunity to meet.<br>
 I guess we letterboxers spend a lot of time passing near one another,<br>
and a lot less time actually meeting, don't we?<br>
