Event webpage found in the Links section of this list:<br/>

<br/>
As far as who brings what, Baby Bear and I will have<br/>
quite a bit of chili with bowls and spoons, but anyone<br/>
that wants to bring something else would be welcome.<br/>
Everyone should bring their own drinks.  Maybe we<br/>
could discuss who is bringing what on this list.<br/>
I plan to camp at Rusk at least Friday &amp; Saturday,<br/>
letterboxing during the day in surrounding area.  <br/>
Hopefully the Friday campers can find each other<br/>
that night to enjoy a group campfire like last year.<br/>
I enjoyed that so much since we got to talk without<br/>
the distraction of exchanging.  Looking forward to it!<br/>

&gt; I'm starting to plan my trip for the letterboxing event in Rusk.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I think it would be helpful if who's (Silver Eagle?) planning it to<br/>
&gt; start getting the info together?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Days, times, places to stay, price info, what's gonna be happening,<br/>
&gt; useful websites, how we're handling food (pot luck? "assignments" <br/>
like<br/>
&gt; who should bring forks)... etc.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, just an idea.<br/>
&gt; :)<br/>
