<div>You had to throw in sense of humor didn't you? I just hope I can put off transplant till after. How would that look if I said, Look I can't be there till June 14, I have to go to the Jacksonville Tomato Fest, what don't you understand? I may have to have notes from some of y'all to substantiate my request. I don't know what kind of sense of humor my doctor has. He never gets my jokes.<br/></div>

<br/>
I was not lucky enough to go to a cool environment and I didn't find as many letterboxes as I had hoped to find.  I was in Las Vegas for a bowling tournament and it was in the mid 90's +.  It was just too hot in that desert area without any shade cover.  I must say it was a nice, comfortable 70's inside the casinos. :)  <br/>
<br/>
I hope you're starting to feel better.  I've been thinking about you.<br/>
