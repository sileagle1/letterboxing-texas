<br/>
I need some guidance.  We are planning a trip to Memphis (from Lufkin)<br/>
and I thought it might be fun to break the trip up with some<br/>
letterboxing. In the past when we have made this one day drive we have<br/>
stopped at playgrounds mapped along the way, and that may be what we<br/>
have to do again this year.  Traveling with 2 little ones we have to<br/>
make alot of stops. <br/>
<br/>
I have researched boxes in Jefferson, Little Rock and can only locate<br/>
one in Memphis.  Anyone know of any at highway rest stops? Any<br/>
suggestions from anyone?  We can't make long side trips or we wouldn't<br/>
make it in one day. But I am hoping we can do some letter boxing on<br/>
the way out and back.<br/>
<br/>
Any input or a point in a direction to search would be appreciated.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>

<div>Hi, Compass.  I made that trip in May, from the DFW area to Memphis 
(and points beyond in TN and KY), and I found these boxes along the 
way:   I found 2 in Little Rock just off the interstate going 
through the city (American Eagle planted by Nancy Drew, and Victorian 
Fountain planted by Maddlove) which were both in interesting 
locations;  there were a couple of others closer to the river in Little 
Rock that I didn't have the time to go looking for.  Also, there's one at a 
highway rest stop on 1 40 just outside of Forrest City, AR (Adding a 
Splash of Color, planted by Wanda&amp;Pete) that I found last summer and it was 
still there in February of this year).  Not too far east of Memphis there's 
a neat box at the Burrow Cemetery in Galloway planted by Steve, and there are 2 
other interesting boxes north of Memphis in Henning (Roots of Henning) and 
Ripley (Ripley's Homegrown), planted by Gupta's Scriptiorari. Those 
locations are in small, interesting old towns worth the drive, if you have the 
time or happen to be going that direction!  Good luck.  </div>

Not sure if you're traveling by interstate, but the trip planner will<br/>
list all boxes within a certain range of whichever Interstate you<br/>
designate.  Very helpful.<br/>
