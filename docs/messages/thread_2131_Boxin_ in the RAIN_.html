<div>Yes!   Rain!  </div>
<div>    It is raining right here right now in Northeast 
Tarrant County, and it couldn't be nicer out there!  No high winds, no 
lightning or heavy storms, just steady, light, cool, wet RAIN!  I was so 
happy to see that rain this morning that the thought of getting out in it 
and taking a little walk, and finding some new letterboxes along the way, was 
almost too much!  </div>
<div>    So we did - PuddleSplasher (what could be a better 
trailname for today?) and I drove a few miles up the road to Denton and 
thoroughly enjoyed discovering 3 boxes planted by Beneficus Rex.  Let me 
tell you, those stamps are really beautiful, and 2 of the 3 were in pretty parks 
along nice trails that had us confused for a minute, thinking we had to be 
somewhere other than Texas (love it as we do).  </div>
<div>    Found:  Sidewinder Ourboros (and that is a 
really neat, cool stamp!), My 1st Box (another gorgeous stamp), and Belle MBF 
(yes, another really good stamp).  Thanks, Beneficus Rex, for leading us to 
new parks and places we've driven past many times but never knew existed.  
</div>
<div>    Also, a nice little serendipity:  we 
encountered a nice family of 4 out on their very first letterboxing outing, 
finding their first letterbox at the second one we went to this morning, so we 
introduced ourselves and they were able to do a stamp exchange to add to their 
first letterboxing experience (cute little girls in raincoats and umbrellas, 
covered in ink.  What a fun experience and they added to ours, too).  
</div>
<div>    Along the way I was able to replace a full logbook 
at Whistle Stop Spur in Keller, and check on Rooster (still safely in the 
cemetery near Henrietta Creek Orchard).  A very nice letterboxing day, in 
the rain.  </div>

<div>We talked about how much you would love these boxes after we found them 
today, Lucy, and since you'll be going back there to see your daughter again, we 
know you'll have more chances to do so!  They're all fairly close to each 
other in the same area of Denton (you had to be almost right on TOP of that park 
you were looking for!).  They're definitely good stamps, pretty locations, 
so we're looking forward to more cool boxes from Rex to take us back up there 
again!  -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
