                    <html><body><p>Yesterday we had to make a road trip down 59 to Lufkin - great we
thought - Livingston Park had been calling our name as well as
Lufkin.   This weather is my absolute fav so what reason
could we think of not to go lb.  After blowing off the dust off of
our bags, we headed out early to Livingston State Park.  On the
very first box we attempted, we were so swarmed with mosquitoes, we had
to run out of the woods. - we couldnt even get the box.  It was
awful - it reminded me of Galveston last summer.   The
mosquiotes were actually landing on our clues.  I am not sure a
bee keeper mask would have kept them away.<br/>
<br/>
The only safe place we could find was a picnic table by the water where
the breeze kept the bugs away.  It was gorgeous and the lake has
really filled up compared to last year.<br/>
<br/>
We did make a stop at the History Center in Diboll.  (We have a
box there but hid it when the center was closed).  The place is
great for kids as they let them climb all over the train outside. 
It even has a bell and a real airhorn for them to ring.  Traffic
on 59 may never be the same.  I kept waiting for a crash after the
# of times the kids rang them horn.  It is really loud. 
Anyway neat place.  <br/>
<br/>
Hopefully our next adventure that way will be more successful but at least we were able to enjoy a gorgeous day!!<br/>
