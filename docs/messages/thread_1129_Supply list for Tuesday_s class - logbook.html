<br>
If you're taking my free class on Tuesday night and want to make a<br>
small logbook, I'll teach a couple of very basic techniques for that. <br>
Frankly, they're things that you can figure out on your own, but I'll<br>
show a few "artsy" options, too.<br>
<br>
If you're planning to make a logbook, you'll need paper.  ANY paper is<br>
fine.  Five sheets of 8 1/2" x 11" paper will make a few very small<br>
logbooks.<br>
<br>
If you want a heavier cover on your logbook, bring something for that.<br>
Cardboard works fine, but if you want a very flexible cover, you may<br>
want fabric or even UltraSuede.<br>
<br>
If you know someone who sews, ask if he or she has leftover scraps for<br>
this.  Or, the remnants bin at the fabric store may have what you<br>
want, for cheap.  The sale aisles at the fabric store are also a good<br>
resource.<br>
<br>
Or, any thrift shop that has cheapo stained clothing and household<br>
items... you can cut around the stain and use the rest of the fabric<br>
or leather or... whatever.<br>
<br>
You'll also want embroidery floss, string, or other thick-ish thread. <br>
You can even use yarn or cording, if you want.<br>
<br>
You'll also need a nice fat embroidery needle... the<br>
tapestry/upholstery kind work the best because you can punch the holes<br>
with them AND sew with them.<br>
<br>
Any store that carries sewing needles--including some Wal-Marts--will<br>
have these needles.  Cheap ones are fine... you only need one.  Just<br>
be sure that your thread or yarn can fit through the eye of the<br>
needle.<br>
<br>
If you like to use a thimble when you sew, bring one.  This will also<br>
help push the needle through the paper if you're punching holes that<br>
way.<br>
<br>
You will need scissors.  Anything that will cut paper and your thread<br>
(and fabric, if you opt for a fabric cover) is fine.<br>
<br>
If your pages are going to get a lot of wear, you'll want cellophane<br>
tape.  Not the "magic" disappearing tape, but the old fashioned shiny<br>
stuff.  One roll will be plenty for the entire class to use.<br>
<br>
If you're going to get fancy about this, bring an awl or ice pick to<br>
push holes into your paper.  I'll bring a few wooden blocks and a<br>
hammer for anyone who needs to work with a lot of paper at once.  I'll<br>
also have my own awl.<br>
<br>
See you on Tuesday night!<br>
<br>
Cheerfully,<br>
