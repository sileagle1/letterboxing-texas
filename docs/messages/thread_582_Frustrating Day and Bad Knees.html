morning to take the Ghosts of Nacogdoches Historical<br/>
Trail through Nacogdoches.  I graduated from SFA, so I<br/>
carved a totally awesome lumberjack and was ready to<br/>
plant it today.  But FIRST, we were going to do the<br/>
historical trail, a trail that would qualify us for a<br/>
scout patch if we successfully finished it.  This is a<br/>
(concrete) street trail through downtown Nac, but even<br/>
though I didn't figure on having much of an<br/>
opportunity to plant it along the way, I kept my eyes<br/>
peeled just in case.<br/>
<br/>
Well, the trail was very interesting - 3.5 miles of<br/>
urban (concrete) hiking, basically from historical<br/>
marker to historical marker.  I've always loved Nac,<br/>
but now I really have a better understanding of the<br/>
town.  Unfortunately, the tour book had pretty rough,<br/>
and in some cases outdated, directions.  I figured<br/>
that out on the first leg, but I thought - "What the<br/>
heck?  I can figure it out if we're a little off."  Do<br/>
y'all know how important it is to know which side of<br/>
the (concrete) street you are supposed to be on on an<br/>
urban historical trail?  Yep.  Pretty important!  The<br/>
street directions were confusing, so I was careful to<br/>
use my compass to confirm direction as we went.  That<br/>
helped quite a bit until I came to one clue that said<br/>
"Turn North on xxx Street."  I read my compass and<br/>
looked at the (concrete) street, and I was pretty<br/>
sure, based on compass reading and in spite of being<br/>
tired, that the (concrete) street ran East and West! <br/>
We took it anyway, and sure enough, the next street<br/>
confirmed for me that it was an E/W street, not N/S. <br/>
We repeatedly managed to get ourselves from point A to<br/>
point B using the directions and our letterboxer<br/>
instinct, and a lot of guessing, but it really ate<br/>
into our time, until we had to ditch the last two<br/>
points of the hike AND planting my really cool<br/>
lumberjack.  Unfortunately, I had to get back to our<br/>
town to pick up my paycheck (it hasn't ever really<br/>
bothered me until today that my company doesn't do<br/>
direct deposit).  We are both dead tired this evening<br/>
and ready for bed here at 8 p.m. - and my knees?  Did<br/>
I mention that the entire hike was on CONCRETE?  I<br/>
always forget what a difference it is to have soil<br/>
under my feet.<br/>
<br/>
Wouldn't you know it - I decided that to save bulk in<br/>
my backpack as we hiked, I would go ahead and stamp<br/>
the box into my log and vice versa.  UGH!  I wish I<br/>
had at least not put the dates in!  I NEVER stamp in<br/>
until we are at the hiding place and ready to leave<br/>
the box behind, but I thought I was doing myself a<br/>
favor by leaving my log and personal stamps in the<br/>
car.  If it had been a micro, I could've easily placed<br/>
it - guess I'm gonna have to try a micro here soon.  <br/>
<br/>
Still though, it was a really neat trail and very<br/>
interesting! If you are ever in Nacogdoches and have<br/>
four or five hours to kill, give it a try!  Just<br/>
remember, it's a lesson in patience when it comes to<br/>
the direction, but it IS do-able.<br/>
<br/>
And I spoke to my West Texas crew a little while ago-<br/>
they didn't climb today as planned because of the<br/>
weather, and are tentatively planning to climb<br/>
tomorrow instead.  Hubby injured one of his knees in<br/>
Carlsbad Caverns today.  It's nothing major, but he's<br/>
trying to decide whether he wants to brave the<br/>
mountain.  It wouldn't be much fun to decide half-way<br/>
through the trip that the knee wouldn't make it.<br/>
<br/>
It sucks getting old, you know???<br/>
