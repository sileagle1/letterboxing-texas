Barefoot Lucy is the main player remaining from the early days and she continues to help behind the scenes by serving as one of the webmasters.  She could probably tell some interesting stories!<br/>

&gt; I'll agree as well.  I think I remember when the change in the map was made, if it was after November 2005.  Thanks for all you do for us, Silver Eagle.<br/>
