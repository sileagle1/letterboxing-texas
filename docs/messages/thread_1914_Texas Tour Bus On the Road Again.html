                    <div class="plaintext-content">     As we take the Texas Tour Bus to its next stop, I can hear the <br>
words to that old song, "On the Road Again".  Who's singing that, <br>
George Strait?  Oh, no, that's Willie Nelson, he's been on the bus <br>
for a while, and here he goes again.  George is one of the new <br>
guys.  He got off the stagecoach in Salado and hopped aboard the <br>
bus, along with a few other new passengers and a wayward hitchhiker. <br>
We started out this morning on a mission to get the bus on its <br>
way, "Under a Blue Clear Sky".  "Lead On", I said, but don't <br>
get "Carried Away", and don't "Run", just "Go On".  We've got to <br>
find a good hiding place for "The Big One".  "Nobody in His Right <br>
Mind Would've Left Her," I Tell BT,   "We Really Shouldn't Be Doing <br>
This".  Oh, "Right or Wrong", she'll be all right, was his <br>
reply.  "True".  Let's just go this "Round About Way" and I bet <br>
we'll find that "Ace in the Hole" we're looking for.  How are we <br>
going to remember the directions?  "Write This Down" he said.  We <br>
found just the spot and got the bus in its place.  I looked down at <br>
it and said, "It Ain't Cool to be Crazy About You".  As we were <br>
driving away, I said "I'd Like To Have That One Back".  BT's only <br>
reply was, "Easy Come, Easy Go".<br>
<br>
     The bus stopped this time at the Mercer Arboretum and Botanic <br>
Gardens.  Take I-45 to FM 1960 and head east.  Turn left on Aldine <br>
Westfield and go to the stop light with park entrances on both sides <br>
of the road.  Turn right into the parking lot and park by the <br>
visitors center.  Get a map or use the map board near the entrance <br>
and find your way to "East Oxbow Loop" shown on the map.  You will <br>
pass the bamboo section and the Tea House.  Once you find the trail <br>
post for "Littl Cypress TrailBig Cypress TrailPrimitive Trail,  <br>
turn right and count 40 steps down Little Cypress Trail.  Look for a <br>
10 foot tall tree stump on the right.  At the bottom of that tree, <br>
behind a log and covered with bark, you will find the Texas Tour <br>
Bus.  Take care of it and when you send her on, "She'll Leave You <br>
With a Smile".<br>
