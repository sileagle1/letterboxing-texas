I have a new one that I think is the trickiest so far.   I came up<br>
with this specific idea yesterday on my walk (ways to amuse myself to<br>
pass the time), and instead of planting the boxes I already had ready<br>
and the stamps I have just sitting there, I just had to do this one. <br>
It's called Calculator Games.  Look for it later--some of my<br>
AtlasQuest buddies from other states are previewing the clues for me,<br>
so I can assess difficulty level.  So far, one out of four has figured<br>
it out pretty quickly.<br>
