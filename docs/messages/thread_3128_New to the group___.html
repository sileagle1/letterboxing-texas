                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello - I'm new to the group and was asked to send a little <br>
introduction.<br>
My name is Brandi Westfall and I live in Midland, TX.  I read last <br>
week about letterboxing in an article in Wondertime magazine (a <br>
parenting magazine).  It was really an article about geocaching, but <br>
had a small blurb about letterboxing at the bottom.  I was instantly <br>
intrigued and did a search on letterboxing.org for boxes in my area.  <br>
I didn't expect to find anything, but there were actually 9 or 10 <br>
boxes.  <br>
<br>
I tried to explain the new hobby to my family (husband & 3 kids - <br>
6yrs, 3yrs & 1).  My girls (6 & 3) were thrilled with the idea of a <br>
hunt.  I carved us a quick stamp using some of the suggestions on <br>
atlasquest and letterboxing.org and we went out to find our first box <br>
on Friday - ACME Booter.  Then we found The HomeRun that Never Was on <br>
Saturday and Wascally Wabbitt, Tequila Mockingbird & Birds of the Air <br>
on Sunday.  We actually ran into some other letterboxers on Sunday <br>
and they helped us get through some very prickly mesquite bushes.  <br>
<br>
So, needless to say, I think we are hooked.  I've been telling my <br>
friends about it, but I'm not sure if they get it.<br>
<br>
I just think it is a great way for me to get outside with my kids and <br>
enjoy the world around us.  <br>
<br>
Hope to see you out on the trail!<br>
Brandi<br>
p.s. the trailname we are using is West5s!<br>

                    <html><body><p>Hi Brandy,<br/><br/>Welcome. Just to let you know, it took me almost a year to finally get my two friends from work interested enough to try letterboxing. They humored me when I would talk about it. But, it just didn't sound interesting. Then one night I was working with KMBaker and she asked exactly how it worked. She's deeply addicted now. Since July 4 she has almost as many finds as I've gotten in over a year. She'll probably get to 100 before me. But that's okay. The third person of our group Amie of Wermbo tried letterboxing in August and their family joined the addiction. Her husband carved his first stamp this weekend completely freehand. I'm very impressed.<br/><br/>This last weekend, we went camping and had a blast. We found 3 boxes as a group and planted one and the other two families went to find more after we split to go home (if I had known no hiking was involved in the other boxes I would've gone). They wore me out. I am 15 and 20 years older than them. It was so
 much fun though. Warm and windy and when we got home the rain came. How great is that?<br/><br/>It is a great activity for families and singles alike. Have fun, hope to meet you in March at the big Gathering.<br/><br/>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/>Letterboxing: It's not just a hobby, it's an adventure<br/><br/><b><i>west5s &lt;brandi@ccfmidland.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote class="replbq" style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;"> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hello - I'm new to the group and was asked to send a little <br/> introduction.<br/> My name is Brandi Westfall and I live in Midland, TX.

I carved us a quick stamp using some of the suggestions on <br/> atlasquest and letterboxing.<wbr>org and we went out to find our first box <br/> on Friday - ACME Booter.  Then we found The HomeRun that Never Was on <br/> Saturday and Wascally Wabbitt, Tequila Mockingbird &amp; Birds of the Air <br/> on Sunday.  We actually ran into some other letterboxers on Sunday <br/> and they helped us get through some very prickly mesquite bushes.  <br/> <br/> So, needless to say, I think we are hooked.  I've been telling my <br/>
 friends about it, but I'm not sure if they get it.<br/> <br/> I just think it is a great way for me to get outside with my kids and <br/> enjoy the world around us.  <br/> <br/> Hope to see you out on the trail!<br/> Brandi<br/> p.s. the trailname we are using is West5s!<br/> <br/> </wbr></wbr></div> </div> <!--End group email --> </blockquote><br/><p>
