If they're at all interested in continuing letterboxing perhaps<br>
they'll have listed themselves on AQ.  If they're not, it's probably<br>
gone for good.  I hope it's at least making a nice door stopper somewhere.<br>

I certainly think it's worth trying a few things to try and get it back.<br>

<div>I think this may have possibilities, PS.  We need to do something to 
track down the holders of the TTB1, since it contains so many special 
passengers!  Clearly, whoever received it doesn't know what it is or what 
to do with it or how to notify others about it, and this just might work! <font color="#8000ff" face="Pepita MT" size="5"><strong><em>Viewfinder</em></strong></font></div></font><br/><br/><br/><div><font style="color: black; font: normal 10pt ARIAL, SAN-SERIF;"><hr style="MARGIN-TOP: 10px"/>See what's free at <a href="http://www.aol.com?ncid=AOLAOF00020000000503" target="_blank" title="http://www.aol.com?ncid=AOLAOF00020000000503">AOL.com</a>. </font></div></body></html>

I do think if you posted a "box" with Austin coordinators on LBNA <br>
named attention: Shoot for the stars...with an explanation for the <br>
clues, and a plea to contact Monarch B or Wow Mom that would be our <br>
best shot.  Perhaps they or their friends would see it.<br>

                    <html><body><div>I've run the idea past Jay Drew on LBNA to make sure we don't get cross-wise with their terms of use and they are all behind us on trying to find the box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've also now emailed everyone with a log-on on LBNA with the word "shooting" in their names or email addresses.  There are two such listings on AQ, but one states themselves as being in Illinois and the other in Oregon.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think we should talk out the wording of the "box" - we want it to be titled broadly enough that anyone might read it, because we don't know who might actually know these people, but may not immediately think to read the clues because the trail name doesn't snap with them for whatever reason.
<br/><br/>It would be helpful to know what box they were near, if they happened to tell you, Monarch B.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think the box should be posted by WOW MOM or Gingercat or someone local there, so they can easily go and read the box and hit Contact Placer.</div>

fairly tenuous connection to letterboxing (no AQ log-on, not a member <br>
of any list, not having reported a find, etc.), so we're definitely <br>
all strangers to them.  It might seem a little "stalky."  <br>
<br>
Monarch B they met in person, chatted with and exchanged with, so <br>
there's more of a connection there than to any other letterboxer.  It <br>
seem less odd if she were trying to get in touch with them than <br>
someone they'd never heard of.<br>

I also gave her my email address in case she had any questions. I haven't heard anything from them.  I feel really bad.....I should have gotten more information from them.  At least an email or something.  I just figured that they were like most of us letterboxers and that because they seemed so enthusiastic about it that they would re-plant it soon and be responsible about it. Since I left it in their care, I feel guilty that it is now missing. Maybe a posting would be helpful. Maybe someone might see it and know
 them and be able to get in touch with them.

She never mentioned who the friend was (and I can only assume that they were from Austin area too) but they were very friendly and I felt comfortable at the time in giving it to them.  It was really crowded that day at the park and one of the reasons that we hadn't found a place to plant the box yet and therefore had it with us at the time we were doing the BS Salamander when we met.  I have tried searching for them myself on both the lists and haven't had any luck either.  It was mentioned in another posting about possibly doing a local newspaper posting in the Austin area.  Maybe that would help? It seems like they obviously don't know about the LBNA or AQ or haven't bothered to do anything with it. I did explain that the clues had to be posted here because they couldn't be found on either AQ or LBNA and that this was strictly a Texas
 LB.  I can only hope that they haven't moved or changed their trail name or worse.  That is a treasure trove of amazing stamps and so many more people deserve the chance to find it and record all of these great stamps.  I'm very willing to have them contact me at any time if yall think that would be best. <br/><br/><b><i>dewberrylb &lt;dewberrylb@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:  </p><blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid"><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>My only thought about using Monarch B is that these people have a <br/>fairly tenuous connection to letterboxing (no AQ log-on, not a member <br/>of any list, not having
