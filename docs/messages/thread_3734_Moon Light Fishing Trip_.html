                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well guys, <br>
<br>
My husband and I decided to eat a late dinner, and we both got a bad <br>
case of the "I can't sleep".  So I talked Mr. Angler aka Mr. Angel  <br>
into a moon light fishing trip.  Now usually Mr. Angler prefers the <br>
salt water of a bay, like around Port Bolivar.  But tonight I had <br>
somewhere else in mind.  So we headed for the fresh water of the <br>
Brazo.  When we got to our destination, the moon light lit the <br>
pathway just beautifully to the river.  Walking down the path we <br>
realized we had forgotten our poles.  But we decided to carry on to <br>
the river.  An armadillo crossed our path , but having  4 armadillos <br>
myself I knew what to do.  It decided itself to move on.   Almost to <br>
the river , we were stopped  again  by a rowdy bunch of  Natives.  <br>
At this point we gave up making it to the river bank.  Anyway  we <br>
weren't able to catch any fish, but did manage to help a bus load <br>
of  Natives on their journey.  <br>
<br>
Been in around Galveston parts all week, now headed to the county of <br>
Fayette for a week.  Don't know if the Natives will get off here or <br>
not.  I will let yall know when I do.  <br>
<br>
I am cured of the "I can't sleep" and will talk will yall soon.  -<br>

PS. My favorite part about the TTB2, is you find it when you are <br>
suppose to find it.  Thanks SE!<br>

I hope my Willie's not been keeping the bus too smoky with his *cough*<br>
cigarettes.  <br>
<br>
And, here's hoping the circus makes another stop around town.  For<br>
some reason, I have a burning desire to carve a flaming sword swallower.<br>
<br>
And on another note, I want to thank everyone who's been hiding boxes<br>
all around Harris County.  When my buddy Mother of Five and I get<br>
those kids in school (#4 goes to school for her) next week, we can't<br>
wait to hit the trails!  It's great to be torn about where to go<br>
first!  Yeah!<br>

<div>Well what I heard was that they kept getting delayed along the trip because they had to stop at every fast food joint - er - restaurant they passed, and none of them could make up their minds what they wanted to eat so they just kept ordering everything, and they thought it was all really, really funny!</div>
