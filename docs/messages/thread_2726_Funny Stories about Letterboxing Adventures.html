<br>
I am a bit behind in reading my emails so forgive me<br>
for being so late to jump on the bandwagon.  About the<br>
funniest thing that happened while letterboxing was<br>
back in Feb.  We went to find one of JBKokopelli's<br>
letterboxes at a cemetery outside of Rusk.  We<br>
followed the clues to the letter or so I thought,<br>
still have yet to find it although lots of others have<br>
found it since.  Anyway the cemetery is right next to<br>
a farm that has a pasture full of cows who fortunately<br>
were about the only audenience I had.  There was a<br>
antbed under the branches of the cedar tree where the<br>
letterbox is planted.  I was wearing knit pants that<br>
were a bit loose and I kept feeling something sting me<br>
on my calf.  I pulled my pants leg up a bit to<br>
discover that about half the colony of ants had<br>
crawled up my pants leg and were climbing up further<br>
and further!  I screamed and came out of my pants<br>
right then and there.  The girls were mortified and<br>
some of the cows I think were amused!  I dislodged the<br>
ants and pulled my pants back up and was very thankful<br>
that it was a rather deserted location.  Now the girls<br>
are very quick to point out the ant beds and make sure<br>
I am wearing jeans that aren't as easy to get off.<br>
<br>
Okay, you can stop laughing now!<br>
<br>
Happy Trails!!<br>
<br>
Sandy<br>
mom to Atoy Adventurers<br>

<div>Hello everyone!<br/><br/>I am a bit behind in reading my emails so forgive me<br/>for being so late to jump on the bandwagon. About the<br/>funniest thing that happened while letterboxing was<br/>back in Feb. We went to find one of JBKokopelli's 
<br/>letterboxes at a cemetery outside of Rusk. We<br/>followed the clues to the letter or so I thought,<br/>still have yet to find it although lots of others have<br/>found it since. Anyway the cemetery is right next to<br/>a farm that has a pasture full of cows who fortunately 
<br/>were about the only audenience I had. There was a<br/>antbed under the branches of the cedar tree where the<br/>letterbox is planted. I was wearing knit pants that<br/>were a bit loose and I kept feeling something sting me 
<br/>on my calf. I pulled my pants leg up a bit to<br/>discover that about half the colony of ants had<br/>crawled up my pants leg and were climbing up further<br/>and further! I screamed and came out of my pants<br/>right then and there. The girls were mortified and 
<br/>some of the cows I think were amused! I dislodged the<br/>ants and pulled my pants back up and was very thankful<br/>that it was a rather deserted location. Now the girls<br/>are very quick to point out the ant beds and make sure 
<br/>I am wearing jeans that aren't as easy to get off.<br/><br/>Okay, you can stop laughing now!<br/><br/>Happy Trails!!<br/><br/>Sandy<br/>mom to Atoy Adventurers<br/><br/>__________________________________________________<br/>

<br>
Not a LB story, but it reminds me of the time we took our cocker <br>
spaniel to Matagora Island.  Spaniels are bird dogs... and once he <br>
saw the seagulls, he was a gonner.  He chanced those birds for MILES <br>
down the beach.  We yelled, we bribed, we yelled some more, but we <br>
couldn't get his attention either.  He was completely focused on the <br>
birds.  If the seagulls dove into the water, the dog dove into the <br>
water.  If the seagulls flew a mile further down the beach, the dog <br>
ran a mile further down the beach.  We finally hopped into our Jeep <br>
and took off after him.  As we pulled close to the errant pup, my <br>
husband told me to jump out (of the moving vehicle) and grab him.  <br>
Do WHAT?!!!  I don't think so!  So instead, hubby pulled slightly <br>
ahead of the dog, threw the jeep into neutral, and HE jumped out of <br>
the rolling vehicle and grabbed the dog by the curly hairs on his <br>
stubby little tail.  Meanwhile, I'm howling with laughter.  To this <br>
day, I don't know if hubby was more angry with the dog or me!<br>
<br>
Thanks for sharing and bringing back memories!<br>
