Welcome to the group!  Lucky you, visiting Maryland.  I have family <br/>
there too, north of Baltimore.  They just started letterboxing a <br/>
couple of weeks ago... in fact, I've been busy carving stamps for <br/>
all of them, and now they've found their first boxes!<br/>

<div>It's usually a good idea to check the clues again before you go looking, 
since most planters will update their clues to indicate the status of their 
boxes if they are sure they are unavailable.  I know I've searched and been 
frustrated only to learn that the clues I was using were out of date.  I 
hope your teens enjoy their experience, and I also trust that you'll be sure 
they are careful to practice good letterboxing strategies of stealth and 
subtlety in finding the boxes and replace them carefully, sealing the bags 
and boxes and recovering them to protect them for future finders as 
well!   Happy letterboxing. </div>

<div>If you keep it in your mind that the box itself is only a part of the pleasure of letterboxing, you'll be able to help the kids you are working with keep dry runs in perspective.  Emphasize the opportunity to visit somewhere you would have never gone otherwise, or the fact that you are getting to see an old place through different eyes, or the pleasure of the company, or the beauty of the day.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A new letterboxer recently wrote on another list about how she uses dead ends (she was in another part of the country, one with very few boxes, and her family came up empty-handed on several outings before they found their first) as a character-building exercise:  she teaches empathy to her children by encouraging them to think about how the placer must feel when they learn a box of theirs has gone missing.  In teaching that lesson especially, she finds it easier to convey to them how important it is that they very carefully rehide the boxes they find.  She teaches them perseverence and a "never give up" attitude by saying "Well that's a bummer alright, but let's keep going until we DO find one!"  She also teaches them that there are no guarantees in life, but you never get the reward if you don't at least try.  And finally, she said that by learning all of this about dead ends, her kids were very appreciative when they did find a box, and they wanted to thank the planter right away.  When I read her post, I was struck by how wise a mom she was!

<div>It is always disappointing to come up empty-handed - we've ALL been there - but not finding a box can sometimes be almost as much fun (almost) as finding them.</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

<div>I used to do Volksmarches in Florida with my younger daughter. I even took my Girl Scout troop of 21 girls on one. Looking back, I can't even imagine taking 21 ten-year old girls on a seven mile hike. One thing about the Florida panhandle though... there were no hills! Welcome, Shirley.</div>

                    <html><body><p>Welcome new members!<br/><br/>My trail name is Cancan from Austin and I am going to have my two year anniversary here in this great state in a couple of days.  <br/><br/>I heard about letterboxing when I worked for MotorCities National Heritage in Detroit. My boss suggested that one of the museums we were working with put in a letterbox to attract people to the area and their venue.  She told me that it had been in the Smithsonian magazine a few years back and was making a resurgence in popularity.  At the time my family lived 15 miles north of Ann Arbor in Livingston County. It was Friday so I looked to see if there were any boxes near our house. The only one was called "Go To Hell" in Hell, Michigan.  So I went home and the family went to Hell, 
<span>almost</span> didn't find the box, went for dinner at the Dam Site Inn and stopped for dessert at the I Screams Ice Cream Parlor.  Highly Recommended for anyone going to the Ann Arbor area.
<br/><br/>I highly recommend joining us for the annual letterboxing event coming up  March 1, 2008 in Bastrop.  You can find more info on atlasquest under the toolbox heading&gt;event calendar. <br/><br/>Happy boxing,<br/>Cancan
