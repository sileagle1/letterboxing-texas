really cold here today in 43793 zip code.<br>

I suppose its the price we are paying for not needing to evacuate or <br>
doing without water and electricity this summer, right?<br>

And, Oh yes.....we had S N O W TODAY!!  Nothing to write home about and <br>
its not sticking yet due to the warm ground.<br>

We, James & Lois, do not envy your snow. We are actually glad we got <br>
out of Ohio before it came but I know it is pretty comming down while <br>
sitting by the fire and looking out of the window. We do that every <br>
once in a while here where we live. Maybe once or twice a year. That <br>
is the only way we like to see snow.<br>
