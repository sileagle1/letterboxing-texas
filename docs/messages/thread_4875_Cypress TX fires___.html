    Hey Baby Bear..how bad is the fire? I'm in Spring and while outside
    this afternoon had ash falling on me. I knew it was from the
    fires...We need some rain, NOW....I'll even take a low grade
    hurricane if we can get it!<br/>

<p>New stamp, new box, new logbook,
                                      new location. Sounds like new
                                      placement to me. What exactly
                                      remains of original Letterbox? I
                                      generally don't consider a box an
                                      original if the stamp itself is
                                      missing, but that is jus me. <br/>

                                      Hueco Tanks #1 <br/>
                                      &gt; letterbox was FOUND IN POOR
                                      CONDITION, and while I did make a
                                      new container, <br/>
                                      &gt; logbook and stamp, it was a
                                      copy of the original to the best
                                      of my ability. <br/>
                                      &gt; I considered it maintenance,
                                      not replacement. Due to the
                                      sensitivity of the <br/>
                                      &gt; area, the park superintendent
                                      asked that I find a better place
                                      for the box. <br/>
                                      &gt; I did so.<br/>
                                      &gt; <br/>
                                      &gt; The Hueco Tanks #2 box was
                                      never found despite two extensive
                                      searches.<br/>
                                      &gt; <br/>
                                      &gt; Again, I considered Hueco

                                      &gt; several years ago, so I hope
                                      those survivors can make it
                                      through this one, <br/>
                                      &gt; too, along with the many
                                      placed after. I especially hope

                                      survive. BTW, the Lost Pines LB is
                                      the oldest <br/>
                                      &gt; ACTIVE LB in TX, placed on
                                      11/04/00. Hueco Tanks LB was
                                      placed earlier that <br/>
                                      &gt; same year but Mike confirmed
                                      it missing, then placed a new one
                                      to replace <br/>
                                      &gt; it, so I consider it a
                                      different and newer box. The first
                                      LB in TX was Duck <br/>
                                      &gt; Creek placed in August of

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ash falling in Cypress for days, but seems to be stopping now.  New fire in Bush Park off I-10 put smoke in air for all the North Houston area for last 2 days.   Last night a fire was started near Lake Livingston due to car wreck, so hope it does not get into the National Forest.  If I see another person drop their cigarette out the window I think I may have to run them off the road, or chase them with my new AX, or is it my old AX, not sure since I replaced all the working parts of it 3 times.   Stay safe everyone!!!<br>
