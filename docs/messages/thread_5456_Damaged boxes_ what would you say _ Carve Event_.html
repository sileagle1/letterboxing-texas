                    <html><body><p>Good comments.  I guess the consensus is that there is no good answer, it depends on the situation, obviously.  You can carry extra Zip-lock bags,  in case the old bag is torn, but that may not be advised if the logbook is wet.  I know of some placers that don't even put baggies in their boxes and may not want a finder to provide one.  I don't think anyone should be expected to provide a new box if the old one is damaged.  In that case, reporting the problem to the placer is about all you can do. As has been said, if a box is in real trouble, a local boxer that you know may be willing to provide some help if asked.  As the placer, it might be a good idea to place a note on the clues, forewarning potential finders that there is a reported problem with the box.  Maybe you could say something like: "It has been reported that the logbook is wet and unusable.  The stamp, however, is still good.  I hope to replace the logbook soon."  The finders might even voluntarily bring an inexpensive replacement logbook if you put it that way.</p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>

<div>I missed out on carving yesterday, but made up for it by planting six in 
McKinney Falls State Park and also plotting where to put the night boxes.  
I have a bunch of carvings by nosox that I am looking forward to sharing with 
y’all!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was the wimpy one who opted not to leap across the waterfall.  I am 
planning on bringing some water shoes on my next visit and have that 
recommendation for my fellow wimps.  That said, I planted my boxes on the 
trail near the campsites—no leaping necessary.  I also checked out the 
group dining hall where our event will take place.  It is pretty 
nice!  And very close to a gorgeous trail by the river.  That area 
would be great for some temporary plants, but permanent boxes may get washed 
away if the river flooded.</div>

</p><div>It was a great time carving and learning some new techniques as well as 
making a few new friends.  Thanks bell for the fun Saturday. </div>
<div>I started my morning off much earlier planting at the state park and I have 
to say the water fall crossing was slippery and got my heart pumping.  I'm 
adventurous but it was kind of scary.  Lots of people after 10am on the 
trails very suddenly. It was quite before then. I also got turned around about 3 
times before I figured out what went wrong.  The trails could be marked 
better at crossings with the service roads. So I ended up hiking every trail 
across the falls mostly by mistake.  Lol 8 miles later,  one box 
planted by me,  one found #9 R by suprize. It was so fun.  I forgot 
how much I enjoy hiking.  Most of the trails are on even ground with a 
slight elevation gane. Only one badly muddy spot that was easy to go 
around.  The trees are just starting to get leaves and in 3 weeks it may be 
green! </div>

<p><span>The carving 
event was great fun and we got several boxes planted this morning.  We 
carved, shared tools and techniques, gossiped, and kept Bell Motel running up 
and down the stairs to print images!  Some of us are still working on 
additional stamps.  Bell Motel did a great job of hosting the event and 
keeping us all busy with supplies and snacks.  <o></o></span></p>
<p><span><o></o></span></p>
<p><span>One concern 
came up this morning…it’s clear that there will be many boxes planted on the 
trails which cross the falls.  You either have to wade knee deep water or 
jump between a couple of feet of rocks with an intimidating gap between 
them.  Some members of our group were not comfortable jumping and didn’t 
come prepared to wade.  I’d suggest  you send out a message to the 
members signed up for the event on AQ to warn them about the water crossing so 
they come prepared.  Four people planted there today and we found some 
boxes by accident…so those who don’t cross the water are going to miss out on a 
good number of boxes.  It looks like there are several out of state 
visitors for TALE so a warning on this forum may not reach everyone.

<p>This is tough since "the right thing to do" can vary between 
letterboxers.  Some would want the logbook mailed, others thrown away, and 
still others might even want the ziplock placed on the outside of the entire box 
(not my choice).  My own feeling is that the least I can expect is a note 
from the finder about the condition of the box, and anything else they do to try 
and help is welcome (or at least tolerated), even if it makes things 
worse.  About the only thing I hate is if they remove the entire box when 
the log is the only thing damaged, especially if it is far away from me, since 
it is much easier to replace a log than an entire box remotely.  My 
favorite response is if they live close enough to revisit and ask me what to do, 
which sometimes includes me mailing them a new log or stamp, but this is 
rare.  Boots, in your case I would do as Open Space said and thank them 
while gently explaining your wishes for next time, which could be carrying extra 
paper and ziplocks for future damaged logs.<br/><br/>On another note, how did the 
TALE Carve Event go?  Hopefully y'all are placing some new boxes for us 
today!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<o></o></p></div>
