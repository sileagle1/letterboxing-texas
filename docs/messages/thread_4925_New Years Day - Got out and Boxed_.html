                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got in from a great day out boxing in Central Texas.  First up was Bastrop State Park.  This was my first visit inside the park since the fire. They had reopened some of the trails on Dec 3rd but I held off until now hoping that more trails would be open. They have gotten more roads and areas open but not any more trails yet. Park Road 1A is now open in its entirety and the historic cabins north of the small pond are now open. <br/>
<br/>
The first thing I did was to start checking on some of the boxes that I could get to - The Mouse Microbox is alive and well, even though the historic structure that it is located at lost it's roof and wooden benches and railings. Next I checked on the only O-Knot box that was in an accessible area. It was located north of the historic cabins but I could not find it.  There was no trace of it left.  I did locate the remains of the orienteering station that marks the boxes location so I was in the right spot.<br/>
<br/>
After that I started re-exploring the park via the trails that are currently open.  Starting at the pond I took the blue trail south to the red trail then finally up the yellow trail to the Piney Hill (RV) Campgrounds. The black trail and the white trail are also open but the green trail is closed as well as the red trail south of the yellow trail junction and north of the blue trail junction. Also, the entire 7.5 mile Lost Pines Trail is closed so I was not able to check on the other three O-Knots boxes that Eoghan had placed here over 10 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
One last thing that I was able to do was place the first of a set of four new letterboxes that I plan to plant in the park over the next few months. They are called Bastrop Phoenix and are/will be numbered 1 thru 4. I'll have the first box listed on AQ and LbNA soon. <br/>
<br/>
Next I headed over to Buescher State Park and found 3 out of 4 boxes there, including checking on Lost Pines by Eoghan, arguably the oldest box in Texas.  It was in great shape.  Original container, original stamp, and original logbook! And there is plenty of room in it for more visitors. The last people to log in were Dawn's Glory and DreamWalker over 2.5 years ago! The box is now listed as WOM on AQ and LbNA however the original clues are listed, with Eoghan's permission, in the Files Section of the Yahoo Groups webpage for this mailing list.<br/>
<br/>
After that I visited Southeast Metro Travis County Park and planted a box there, the first in that park, along a nice 2.2 mile hiking loop.<br/>
<br/>
Then on to far South Austin to track down a few more boxes and on to home as the sun set slowly in the West.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the report, PI Joe.  I look forward to finding your new boxes, especially the appropriately named Phoenix boxes.  Sad that Eoghan's boxes in Bastrop are probably all gone, along with the Orienteering markers.  I hope they replace them so future boxes can take advantage.  Glad to hear Buescher was spared and that Lost Pines box is still there.  How rare to have a box with the original contents after over 10 years!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow, great report.  I was planning on doing some of this on Saturday, but see you covered most of it.  May still stop at park and see if more trails opened and get your box.  Thanks for the effort!!!<br/>
