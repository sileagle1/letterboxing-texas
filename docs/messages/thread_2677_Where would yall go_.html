Possum Kingdom or San Angelo.  I have never been to them but they sound <br/>
nice.  Of course, if you wanted to plant new boxes you could go to Lake <br/>
Brownwood or Colorado City SP.  Have fun!<br/>

<div>I figured we could go and find some and then place some on the way there or 
on our way back. I really need to start placing more in this area, there is only 
one in my county and none in the surrounding counties. It only took finding that 
one box, now we are totally hooked! <img src="http://cdn-cf.aol.com/se/smi/0201d26002/08"/></div><br/><br/><br/><div><hr/>AOL now offers free email to everyone.
