Possum Kingdom or San Angelo.  I have never been to them but they sound <br>
nice.  Of course, if you wanted to plant new boxes you could go to Lake <br>
Brownwood or Colorado City SP.  Have fun!<br>

<div>I figured we could go and find some and then place some on the way there or 
on our way back. I really need to start placing more in this area, there is only 
one in my county and none in the surrounding counties. It only took finding that
