Well - <grin>  my question was answered about 1 hour ago.  I got to see a<br>
very nice example.  In fact, 25 very nice examples.  <BIG-grin>.<br>
<br>
Yes - they arrived just fine.<br>
<br>
NOW - does anyone know anything about the ones on the LBNA site?  I could<br>
use about 8 of them for me and friends....  But it seems there is a minimum<br>
order of 50 if I understand it right.<br>
<br>
If someone wants to take that on - I will pledge for 10, maybe 15 if needed<br>
to make the count.  Anyone?????<br>
<br>
I would volunteer to do it, but this 0500-1600 work schedule and rebuilding<br>
the jeep motor has me just dragging.<br>
