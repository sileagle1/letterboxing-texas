Well - <grin>  my question was answered about 1 hour ago.  I got to see a<br/>
very nice example.  In fact, 25 very nice examples.  <big-grin>.<br/>
<br/>
Yes - they arrived just fine.<br/>
<br/>
NOW - does anyone know anything about the ones on the LBNA site?  I could<br/>
use about 8 of them for me and friends....  But it seems there is a minimum<br/>
order of 50 if I understand it right.<br/>
<br/>
If someone wants to take that on - I will pledge for 10, maybe 15 if needed<br/>
to make the count.  Anyone?????<br/>
<br/>
I would volunteer to do it, but this 0500-1600 work schedule and rebuilding<br/>
the jeep motor has me just dragging.<br/>

&gt; Hi Mike,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Sorry I couldn't email you the pic...I don't know how to do <br/>
&gt; attachments in Yahoo groups.  But...I did post the proof picture from <br/>
&gt; Superior Patches in the Photos section under a file called, obviously <br/>
&gt; enough, "TX Lb patch".<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope this helps.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
