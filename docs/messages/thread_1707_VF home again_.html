<div>    Kind spouse and I just returned from a quick (if a 
week can be quick) trip to western KY, business stuff, but managed to include 
just a little letterboxing--  and was it ever worthwhile!  Along the 
way (I40 near Forrest City, AR) we stopped and re-found Wanda &amp; Pete's 
Splash of Color - found it last summer, and yes, it's still there, many more 
visitors, nice little rest stop and break.  Then, in Paducah, KY, I finally 
got to look for Wacinton-Chicasaw Indian Tree (couldn't do it last summer, very 
frustrating!).  Didn't really expect it to be there since the last logged 
find was over a year ago, but there it was, many logbook entries and an amazing 
stamp!  Enjoyed a brief walk on a pretty nature trail in the park as a 
bonus.  Then one day my kind spouse and I crossed the Mississippi River on 
the Hickman Ferry (that was fun!) to reach the tiny town of Matthews, MO to find 
The Harvest Cafe, in, of course, the Harvest Cafe.  The cafe owner was 
absolutely thrilled when I asked for the letterbox because it had been there 
several months and no one had yet asked for it (well, it IS a little out of the 
way but definitely worth the detour).  Since she really didn't know much 
about letterboxing - a friend in California had carved the stamp and sent her 
the box for her cafe - she was excited to sit and talk to us about it, to 
examine my logbook, and delighted to receive the printout of the clues I had 
with me - she's not on the internet! We were excited to be FF, and to share our 
letterboxing adventures with her.</div>
<div>    Just before we left Texas, we placed a new 
letterbox (Baa Baa Black Sheep) somewhere in Irving.  The clues are posted 
on AQ and LBNA, and the "mystery location" won't be too difficult to figure out, 
especially if you read all the clues.  So far I haven't heard that it's 
been located, so the little black sheep is probably still hiding in the cold 
waiting for discovery!  </div></font></body></html>
