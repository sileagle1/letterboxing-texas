<p><span>The Greatest Show on Earth has arrived at a park near you </span></p>
<p><span>Maybe.<span>  </span></span></p>
<p><span></span> </p>
<p><span>After dealing with the transportation issues (the train broke down at a most inconvenient time) and hiding out from Hurricane Gustav (didn't want to get blown into another state), the Traveling Texas Circus has made camp at a park known for owls and soggy waffles.<o></o></span></p>
<p><o><span>Free parking is available on </span><st1><st1><span>Shirkmere Street</span></st1></st1><span>, near the baseball field.<span>  </span>Hey, clowns like to play baseball too!.<span>   </span>But the </span><st1><st1><span>Texas</span></st1></st1><span> heat started melting their makeup, so they decided to set up the big top under the trees.<span>  </span>Follow the 3<sup>rd</sup> base line to the trees, and find the trail at the northeast corner of the field.<o></o></span></o></p>
<p><o><span>Follow this trail for 19 steps until you reach the first junction.<span>  </span>Take the trail to your right for 24 steps.<span>  </span>Then take the trail to the left for 48 steps.<span>  </span>Don't despair, you're almost there!<span>  Don't you smell the elephants?  </span>Now take the trail to your right for 32 steps.<span>  S</span>ee the large red and white striped tent located on your left, about 20 steps from the trail behind a large pine tree?<o></o></span></o></p>
<p><o><span>Hope you enjoy the show! <o></o></span></o></p>
