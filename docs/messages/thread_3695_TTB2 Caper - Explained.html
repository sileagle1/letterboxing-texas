                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ok, no more clowning around, here is the whole story as I understand <br>
it.<br>
<br>
It all started when Baby Bear posted his flame against The Ghost Of <br>
IRA Boxer (TGOIB) and appointed himself President of the Anti-IRA <br>
Boxer Fan Club.  As you will remember, he warned TGOIB not to set <br>
foot in Cypress, which was actually a trap to get his hands on it.<br>
<br>
Soon after this, TGOIB sent an email to Silver Eagle & Barefoot Lucy <br>
asking for advice on the TTB2 since it was getting full, and signed <br>
off saying he didn't want to be anywhere near Cypress.  SE said that <br>
actually, it would be funny if TGOIB hid the box in Cypress to see <br>
which fan club would find it first.  BL then took it a step further <br>
and said it would really be funny if TGOIB hid it in BB's own yard.  <br>
They all agreed and gleefully set about plotting their TTB2 caper.<br>
<br>
TGOIB said he planned to add a stamp called The Ghost Of Davy <br>
Crockett and it would tie in with BB since Davy killed a baby bear <br>
when he was young.  SE provided TGOIB directions to BB's house to <br>
hide the box and called BB's wife, who works from home, to let her <br>
know what was going on.  TGOIB hid the box, and then posted his note <br>
to the TX List, leaving out directions to BB's house to protect his <br>
privacy.  SE sent an email to BB telling him to look on the TX List, <br>
and they all waited for the fun to begin.<br>
<br>
After several hours SE got a phone call from BB's wife, who had left <br>
their house on an errand, and she said BB got home from work but did <br>
not seem to know anything about the TTB2.  BB evidently did not get <br>
the email before he left work, so SE called and left a message <br>
telling BB to look at the TX List, then again waited for the fun to <br>
begin.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, several people started posting on the TX List, including <br>
one from Mommy Aulait about Cypress letterboxes that was totally <br>
unrelated to the TTB2 caper, but suspicious none the less.  Then <br>
Mother Of Five posted that it would really be funny if Puddle <br>
Splasher came down and stole the box right out of BB's yard.  This <br>
got SE to thinking that the TTB2 caper would REALLY be funny if he <br>
stole the box before BB could get it out of his own yard and kicked <br>
himself for not thinking of it sooner.  <br>
<br>
Since it would take over an hour to drive out there and BB was liable <br>
to get the phone message and start looking for the box any minute, SE <br>
did the next best thing.  He called BB's wife to explain the new plan <br>
and asked her to steal the box.  Unfortunately, she was not returning <br>
home for awhile, but not one to let a good joke die, she called a <br>
neighbor and asked him to steal the box.  She called SE back and told <br>
him BB evidently had not gotten the box yet since the neighbor was <br>
successful in stealing the box.<br>
<br>
Not five minutes later, SE got a call from a very concerned BB saying <br>
the TTB2 was not there.  He was worried that TGOIB had hidden the box <br>
at the wrong house.  SE gently suggested that perhaps someone had <br>
beat him to the box, and this changed BB from worried to mad at <br>
himself for not looking at the posts earlier.  He felt that his trap <br>
to get the TTB2 had worked perfectly, though never expecting the box <br>
to be in his own yard, only to be thwarted by some dirty <br>
letterboxer.  SE told him to not jump to conclusions yet, but keep <br>
watching the TX List to see if anyone claimed the box.<br>
<br>
Now the stage was set and all that was needed to complete the new <br>
version of the TTB2 caper was a post from the box stealer.  So I <br>
posted my note about grabbing the box right under BB's nose and the <br>
fireworks began.<br>
<br>
I eventually gave BB back the box and BB's wife explained her part, <br>
then SE explained the rest.  At this point, the TTB2 is safely in <br>
BB's paws, but I don't know how safe the conspirators are.  I hope <br>
you enjoyed the TTB2 Caper!<br>

<p>Ok, no more clowning around, here is the whole story as I understand <br/>it.<br/><br/>It all started when Baby Bear posted his flame against The Ghost Of <br/>IRA Boxer (TGOIB) and appointed himself President of the Anti-IRA <br/>
Boxer Fan Club. As you will remember, he warned TGOIB not to set <br/>foot in Cypress, which was actually a trap to get his hands on it.<br/><br/>Soon after this, TGOIB sent an email to Silver Eagle &amp; Barefoot Lucy <br/>asking for advice on the TTB2 since it was getting full, and signed <br/>
off saying he didn't want to be anywhere near Cypress. SE said that <br/>actually, it would be funny if TGOIB hid the box in Cypress to see <br/>which fan club would find it first. BL then took it a step further <br/>and said it would really be funny if TGOIB hid it in BB's own yard. <br/>
They all agreed and gleefully set about plotting their TTB2 caper.<br/><br/>TGOIB said he planned to add a stamp called The Ghost Of Davy <br/>Crockett and it would tie in with BB since Davy killed a baby bear <br/>when he was young. SE provided TGOIB directions to BB's house to <br/>
hide the box and called BB's wife, who works from home, to let her <br/>know what was going on. TGOIB hid the box, and then posted his note <br/>to the TX List, leaving out directions to BB's house to protect his <br/>
privacy. SE sent an email to BB telling him to look on the TX List, <br/>and they all waited for the fun to begin.<br/><br/>After several hours SE got a phone call from BB's wife, who had left <br/>their house on an errand, and she said BB got home from work but did <br/>

Splasher came down and stole the box right out of BB's yard. This <br/>got SE to thinking that the TTB2 caper would REALLY be funny if he <br/>stole the box before BB could get it out of his own yard and kicked <br/>himself for not thinking of it sooner. <br/>
<br/>Since it would take over an hour to drive out there and BB was liable <br/>to get the phone message and start looking for the box any minute, SE <br/>did the next best thing. He called BB's wife to explain the new plan <br/>

As you will remember, he warned TGOIB not to set <br/>&gt; foot in Cypress, which was actually a trap to get his hands on it.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Soon after this, TGOIB sent an email to Silver Eagle &amp; Barefoot <br/>Lucy <br/>&gt; asking for advice on the TTB2 since it was getting full, and signed <br/>&gt; off saying he didn't want to be anywhere near Cypress. SE said <br/>that <br/>&gt; actually, it would be funny if TGOIB hid the box in Cypress to see <br/>&gt; which fan club would find it first. BL then took it a step further <br/>&gt; and said it would really be funny if TGOIB hid it in BB's own <br/>yard. <br/>&gt; They all agreed and gleefully set about plotting their TTB2 caper.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; TGOIB said he planned to add a stamp called The Ghost Of Davy <br/>&gt; Crockett and it would tie in with BB since Davy killed a baby bear <br/>&gt; when he was young. SE provided TGOIB directions to BB's house to <br/>&gt; hide the box and called BB's wife, who works from home, to let her <br/>&gt; know what was going on. TGOIB hid the box, and then posted his <br/>note <br/>&gt; to the TX List, leaving out directions to BB's house to protect his <br/>&gt; privacy. SE sent an email to BB telling him to look on the TX <br/>List, <br/>&gt; and they all waited for the fun to begin.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; After several hours SE got a phone call from BB's wife, who had <br/>left <br/>&gt; their house on an errand, and she said BB got home from work but <br/>did <br/>&gt; not seem to know anything about the TTB2. BB evidently did not get <br/>&gt; the email before he left work, so SE called and left a message <br/>&gt; telling BB to look at the TX List, then again waited for the fun to <br/>&gt; begin.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Meanwhile, several people started posting on the TX List, including <br/>&gt; one from Mommy Aulait about Cypress letterboxes that was totally <br/>&gt; unrelated to the TTB2 caper, but suspicious none the less. Then <br/>&gt; Mother Of Five posted that it would really be funny if Puddle <br/>&gt; Splasher came down and stole the box right out of BB's yard. This <br/>&gt; got SE to thinking that the TTB2 caper would REALLY be funny if he <br/>&gt; stole the box before BB could get it out of his own yard and kicked <br/>&gt; himself for not thinking of it sooner. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Since it would take over an hour to drive out there and BB was <br/>liable <br/>&gt; to get the phone message and start looking for the box any minute, <br/>SE <br/>&gt; did the next best thing. He called BB's wife to explain the new <br/>plan <br/>&gt; and asked her to steal the box. Unfortunately, she was not <br/>returning <br/>&gt; home for awhile, but not one to let a good joke die, she called a <br/>&gt; neighbor and asked him to steal the box. She called SE back and <br/>told <br/>&gt; him BB evidently had not gotten the box yet since the neighbor was <br/>&gt; successful in stealing the box.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Not five minutes later, SE got a call from a very concerned BB <br/>saying <br/>&gt; the TTB2 was not there. He was worried that TGOIB had hidden the <br/>box <br/>&gt; at the wrong house. SE gently suggested that perhaps someone had <br/>&gt; beat him to the box, and this changed BB from worried to mad at <br/>&gt; himself for not looking at the posts earlier. He felt that his <br/>trap <br/>&gt; to get the TTB2 had worked perfectly, though never expecting the <br/>box <br/>&gt; to be in his own yard, only to be thwarted by some dirty <br/>&gt; letterboxer. SE told him to not jump to conclusions yet, but keep <br/>&gt; watching the TX List to see if anyone claimed the box.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Now the stage was set and all that was needed to complete the new <br/>&gt; version of the TTB2 caper was a post from the box stealer. So I <br/>&gt; posted my note about grabbing the box right under BB's nose and the <br/>&gt; fireworks began.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I eventually gave BB back the box and BB's wife explained her part, <br/>&gt; then SE explained the rest. At this point, the TTB2 is safely in <br/>&gt; BB's paws, but I don't know how safe the conspirators are.
