If I showed this post to anyone other than a letterboxer, they'd think y'all were crazy.</div> <div> </div> <div>Congrats, looking forward to see where it goes next. BTW, I hear if you drive North, you use less gas. Yep, read it on the internet.

 my<br/>phone. After thinking about the conversation, this is what I hear.<br/><br/>"Stacy..we need to get in our cars NOW and go to Wills Point." OMG! I<br/>say. The bus The bus!"<br/><br/>Turns out Texas Pokey saw the post 4 minutes after it was posted. I<br/>throw the kids in the car. Yes I buckled up Tadpole in his car seat.<br/>Luckily the diaper bag was packed and the car was full of gas. I<br/>head towards Txtatas to get hernot knowing if she is going with us<br/>yet. Hee hee. Second call from TP that TT cannot go this time. Darn<br/>It!!<br/><br/>I make a U-turn and race for the freeway. After hitting the drive<br/>thru for the older boys, I race for Lake Tawakoni SP. I had to put<br/>the cruise control on to control my speed down the I20. Going 70mph<br/>never seemed so slow. Thank goodness I was there not that long ago<br/>and still remember how to get there. If you know meI have no memory<br/>of where places are located or how to get home from them. My<br/>instructions from TP
 are "if you get there before metackle anyone in<br/>our way to the bus." Hmmm..should be interesting.<br/><br/>Upon arrival to the park I jump from the car, scan the parking lot to<br/>see if I recognize any cars from Bastrop. Nopethank goodness. No<br/>tackling necessary. TP pulls in next to me within minutes of my<br/>arrival. I leave my kids and the baby at the car and the rest of us<br/>just about run down the trail. After walking and sinking in poison<br/>ivy/oak I we make it to the tree.<br/><br/>SO AT 4:12 THE TEXAS TOUR BUS 2 has been busjacked.<br/><br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/><br/><br/><div>[URL=http://www.cruisecritic.com][IMG]http://clocks.cruisecritic.com/countdown.pl?name=jayceeinbedford&amp;date=2-9-2008&amp;image=Beach-9&amp;text=&amp;ship=Celebrity Century[/IMG][/URL]<br/></div> <div> </div> <div>Janet</div><p>
