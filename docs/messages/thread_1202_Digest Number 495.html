Canadian Rockies and Montana, and did manage to find a couple of

Columbia Falls and Hungry Horse - really neat stamp and great place.  The 
logbook had lots of cool stamps, including our own Silver Eagle and Baby 
Bear.   The other was in Banff - TopHatBox'R's Christmas Bow at Bow 
Falls, and I was FF!  Wow!  Going all the way from Texas to Canada to 
find a box placed by someone from Virgina, and being FF - what a thrill.  I 
think these may have been among the very few logbooks not yet signed by

  than a couple of Texas<br/>Letterboxer birthdays in one month. Either the 
  number of Lone Star<br/>letterboxers is really growing, or people born in 
  August are just naturals<br/>for this sport... Of course, since my husband and 
  I are also August babies,<br/>I prefer to believe the latter!<br/><br/>Today is
