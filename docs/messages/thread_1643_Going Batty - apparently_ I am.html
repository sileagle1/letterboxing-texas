Thanks for forwarding the emails to me.<br>
<br>
Would it be any trouble if ...<br>
Anyone lives around/near lake bardwell, or planning a<br>
trip to find all the boxes out there, to pick up my<br>
box and send it to me?<br>
I don't know when the next time I'll be able to make<br>
it out there and I surely don't want the box thrown<br>
away. I'd like a little keepsake of the logbook.<br>
<br>
If anyone does go by and picks it up, please let me<br>
know. I'll send you my address and return postage to<br>
you.<br>
Thanks<br>
Lena<br>
