<br/>
You are right, there was talk of a small gathering.  My sister-in-law <br/>
and her crew want to come down to Rusk and box and make a day or two <br/>
of it and I plan on hanging out with them while they're down, so <br/>
anyone else locally who wants to meet up will be welcome as well.<br/>
<br/>
We had originally planned it for the end of May, and at this point it <br/>
will probably be in July or maybe even in the fall.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyone anywhere who wants to join us is welcome, although my thought <br/>
is that it will be VERY small and VERY informal, mainly for the new <br/>
boxers in the area who missed the big gathering in Rusk and want to <br/>
meet other boxers and do exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
So the long and short is - the idea is there, but the plan isn't!<br/>
