                    <html><body><div>Well, I'm madly packing to get out of here moments after I get off work today.  Fearless Fox announced a few days ago that WE (as in Fearless Fox and me, no Lightning) are going to Arkansas to do some hiking/backpacking.  We are going to position ourselves tonight so we will be ready to set out early in the morning and backpack in to the place we will camp sometime tomorrow afternoon.  We're then going to spend Sunday hiking from there on a few trails he's been wanting to share with me for several months.  I'm a little worried about this since I haven't even been WALKING as I usually do because of the heat lately, but he assures me I can do it.  Seeing as how I'm positive he doesn't want to have to carry me out, I'm sure he has thought this through.

<div>I think he's getting even with me for the last trip when I went a little overboard on the letterboxing, so I'm packing only a few clues and will pull them out if he seems amenable to it, and hopefully I'll be able to place a box in the wilderness too.  Did y'all know Arkansas only has 42 boxes on LBNA?
