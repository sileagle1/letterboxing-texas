 to what I said.  While I love good carving, that comes a far second behind feeling like I'm catching a glimpse of the planter's point of view.  Letterboxing is an ironic game of socialization and isolation.  Quite often we are very isolated from each other while we are on the hunt, BUT - we are connecting with one another each time we take a set of clues and work our ways to a new box.  We connect with the placer and we connect with the other finders through their notes. </div> <div> </div> <div>And then she said that thing about improving - I love that too.  Yes - it is so cool to watch other boxers (and ourselves) develop as carvers and planters.  That's why lots of older boxers encourage new planters to go ahead and place their first carves even if they aren't happy with them.  It's terribly satisfying to look back at your own boxes, if nothing else, and see how you have improved!</div> <div> </div> <div>And then -
 don't worry whether other boxers find your plants.  Oh my goodness - I know that you will want to check your first box every single day to see if anyone found it.  Thankfully, my first successful box was 40 miles away or I would've been checking it constantly.  Also, it was planted before the day of online logging (say?  Did you new folk know that it's only been in the last three years or so that online logging was a big thing?  Used to be - we had to go check a box to see if we had had guests, unless someone was inclined to email us directly), so I waited seven months before the first finder...  I actually have a box in Arkansas that, to my knowledge, has never been found.  I LOVE the idea of it sitting there (it's about five miles in on a remote hike) and me sitting here, both waiting for a visitor.  How cool will it be for that boxer to be the FF on a two year old box????   WOW!<br/><br/></div> <div class="gmail_quote">On Wed, Aug 13, 2008 at 7:34 PM, Maribeth Jagger <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:cjagger405@earthlink.net">cjagger405@earthlin<wbr>k.net</wbr></a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid"> <div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div><font size="2">Okay! I feel your pain! I just hate it when I get a really fun idea for a letterbox but just can't seem to find an interesting place to hide it. I know I have some that are hidden in some pretty mundane spots, simply because I couldn't come up with an extraordinary location. I love it when I find a place I want to share, but that seems to happen all too rarely.  I'm one who believes strongly in placing a box in an interesting location, but I definitely recognize that it can't always be done. As far as your carvings not being good enough to lure people to your boxes, I don't think that's generally the case. There are some
 carvers out there that do such a nice job that I would make the extra effort to go hunt for their boxes, but I would not exclude a box because the stamp was not as intricately carved. I think most letterboxers just appreciate a truly good effort. Having said that, I think it's important to strive to improve the quality of your boxes as you continue, or else people will start to lose interest in finding them. There are some boxes that seem to hit on all the points: great location, great carve, wonderful logbook, wildly great clues, or a fantastic hike. But what makes those boxes so special is that they are rare. As far as my preference goes, while I admit I am delighted to find a beautifully carved stamp, that is probably the least thing that draws me to a box. The main thing for me are clues that are intriguing enough to draw me to a box - I just can't resist wonderful clues!</font></div> <div><font size="2"></font> </div> <div><font size="2">Here's my 2 cents worth:
 don't worry about people finding your plants right off. I have some boxes hidden in some pretty remote areas, so whenever I hear from someone who's gone to the trouble to find them, it makes it so much more exciting than the boxes that are visited regularly (plus there's the side benefit of not having to replace the logbooks very often). Also, don't be surprised if no one logs finding your box, but when you check on it, it has had quite a few visitors. I was totally surprised to find that happened with my Gene Autry box in Tioga. Gryzzled Gryphon is the only one who has logged a find, but I checked on it last week and it has had quite a few visitors.</font></div> <div><font size="2"></font> </div> <div><font size="2">I know you would like to have some boxes hidden in your area. I live in McKinney and the majority of the boxes hidden in McKinney are mine (I think there are only three that aren't). However, just recently, there are quite a few boxes popping up in some of
 the nearby communities, so "if you build it, they will come". I just don't want you to get discouraged because there aren't a lot of boxers in your area right now. My best advice to you is to enjoy the process, and to use a quality that happens to allude me: patience! Good luck with that!</font></div> <div><font size="2">Puddle Splasher</font></div> <div> </div> <div></div></div> <div class="Ih2E3d"> <div> </div> <blockquote style="BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid"> <div style="FONT: 10pt Arial">----- Original Message ----- </div> <div style="BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial"><b>From:</b> <a href="mailto:francesstinnett@yahoo.com" target="_blank" title="francesstinnett@yahoo.com">Frances Stinnett</a> </div> <div style="FONT: 10pt arial"><b>To: </b><a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com" target="_blank" title="letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a></div> <div style="FONT: 10pt arial"><b>Sent:</b> 8/13/2008

 there are other boxes spread out in this general area.  My stamps aren't worth making the trip for at this point, maybe some day!  I would love to have the input of more experienced boxes and think it would be helpful for all of us newbies.  Thanks,</div> <div> </div> <div>Fran   (Celtic Knotheads)<br/><br/></div> <div> </div> <div> </div></td></tr></tbody></table><br/></div></div></font></blockquote></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><span style="COLOR: white" width="1"></span></div></div></div></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/></blockquote></div> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/><br/><br/><div> </div><p>
