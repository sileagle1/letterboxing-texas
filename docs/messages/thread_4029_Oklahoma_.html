                    <div class="plaintext-content">I finally had my first opportunity to meet our new neighbor, Penguin Patrol, who lives just across the border in Oklahoma (who recently moved to Oklahoma from Michigan). She so graciously invited us Texans to come to an event she was hosting at Lake Murray yesterday. I've had the opportunity to exchange some LTCs with Penguin Patrol over the past year, so I KNEW her carving ability alone would be worth the trip, but she had also requested and received over forty-five stamps from excellent letterboxers around the country. Now WHO can refuse THAT? WOW! Was I impressed! She not only gathered all those amazing stamps (AMAZING stamps), but she found fabulous hiding places along many different trails and wrote clear, wonderful clues for each box. She actually had clue packets waiting for each participant when we arrived, along with clearly marked trail maps showing where each trail was and a list of boxes, with the clues, - in ORDER - on each trail. Some of the boxes were only temporary and were available only during the event, and she had all of those hidden on two trails so we could easily find those yesterday before they had to be returned to their owners. The rest are permanent boxes. I seriously cannot wait to return to the lake and find the rest. Also, lionsmane (who's carvings are fabulous) hid two new boxes, VF added a great box, and I also left a new one there. Anyone looking for a fabulous day of boxing should definitely head to Lake Murray. Also, I see that Penguin Patrol as been busy hiding quite a few boxes in Ardmore (five miles from the lake)! I believe Batty Girl also hid some boxes up there as well and I know she has some in Gaineville (across the border in Texas). As always, it was fun visiting with Gryzzled Gryphon, and seeing that PT Cruiser parked around the lake at various trailheads throughout the day!<br>
<br>
Thank you so much, Penguin Patrol for an amazing event! You really rocked! I can't wait to come back and find the rest of those boxes!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Aww, Sandy, thank you. You guys are so missed too. I hope the next time you are close enough we can get together again and catch up.<br>
<br>
Yes, the event went very well. The weather managed to cooperate so nicely, the trails weren't full of muggles, and no one had problems finding the boxes. Lots of laughs, lots of fun, and lots of new friends. A huge thank you to Viewfinder and Puddle Splasher for making me feel so welcome to the area. I really enjoyed the weekend and everyone's company. <br>
<br>
For those who missed out, there are about 40 boxes spread over various trails now permanently at this gorgeous lake for you to come find. I hope your travels will head you north one day to visit us up here in OK.<br>
