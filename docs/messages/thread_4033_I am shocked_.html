                    <div class="plaintext-content">Dear Texans,<br>
<br>
Is this how you welcome fellow letterboxers into your great state? Accusations and slander abound!<br>
<br>
Boots Tex and Barefoot Lucy: Investigator, Investigator, Investigator. If you say that 3 times (can you count), you might get it correct. I am an Investigator, not an Inspector.<br>
 <br>
Inspector: <br>
1. A person employed to inspect something<br>
2. A police officer who is in charge of usually several precincts<br>
<br>
Investigator<br>
1. A person not a member of a police force who is licensed to do detective work (as investigation of suspected wrongdoings or searching for missing persons or objects)<br>
<br>
How can you possibly expect me to take you seriously if you can not get my title correct? <br>
<br>
Corpus Christi to Amarillo is exactly 657 miles, and 10 hours driving time. I could have gone to San Angelo and looped up to Abilene which would have made it closer to your mileage. However, as comfortable as the brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar was, I preferred the shorter distance. Now, as I pointed out to Barefoot Lucy, I was in your great state of Texas way back in October of 2007. It is true, you have increased the number of your letterboxes since that time, to approximately 3,387. It is a disgrace that your mystery boxes have not increased proportionately. Even if you count the mysteries in the files, websites, and other mysterious places, the percentage of mysteries to traditionals is not that good. The question is; can you correct this situation?<br>
<br>
Barefoot Lucy, your observations are amazing. Incorrect, but nevertheless amazing. My record stands on its own merit. The PZKut Caper and the Missing Store of Good Manners Case were both solved to the satisfaction of my clients. Can I be faulted for the unsavory conduct of those that call themselves Letteboxers? I think not! <br>
<br>
Yes, I am familiar with the demise of poor IRA Boxer. Being an Investigator (notice that word) of somewhat moral conduct, I will state that I was not in the area when the crime occurred or when Detective Gandolph de Grey was detecting. Nor, might I add, was I in the area when your tour bus drove off without you. Perhaps you should have hired me to recover it. <br>
<br>
Barefoot Lucy, if indeed the sock is yours (and I still harbor my doubts), you have me to thank for its return. After all, was it not I that you followed into the Gilgal Garden?<br>
<br>
Puddle Splasher, I must agree with Barefoot Lucy on this one; you really should keep better tabs on current events.<br>
<br>
Sincerely, <br>
<br>
Investigator Francis Bacon <br>
<br>

I must inquire as to how much investigating was required for you to come to the realization that I am shameful? Most people seem to reach that conclusion quite rapidly. Hopefully your billing is not per hour.<br>
<br>
Of course, we are certainly honored to have you tour our state, however, I would be remiss if I were not to warn you to be quite leary of that clown, as well as the bear with whom he travels, and the ghost who wears peculiar boxers. That trio is nothing but trouble, and any information you can gather would be helpful to the letterboxing community in general. I actually have my doubts about the lady who prides herself as being barefooted, yet steals socks? Is that not a contradiction?<br>

I am afraid that not much investigating was required. Your reputation precedes you. <br>
 <br>
There sure are a lot of warnings going on in this group. Do y'all have anything better to do? Like perhaps plant mysteries? <br>

I must agree on the lady. Socks and barefoot is certainly a contradiction. Makes you wonder about her honor. <br>

<br>
I see you were recently in Texas, berating us Texans and Late Texans, about the lack of mystery boxes, yet you failed to visit Houston to "investigate" my mysterious death, which has yet to be solved.  I am forced to exist in that netherworld where murdered letterboxers go, content to haunt juvenile bears and haunt wayward letterboxes, when, with a little "investigating", you, perhaps, could have set me free.  If you were a true "investigator", you wouldn't fall back on that lame excuse that "I was not in the area when the crime occurred".  That's usually the first words uttered by the guilty party.  Where you between 9:00 AM and 10:00 AM December 6, 2007? <br>

However, as comfortable as the brand new shiny silver Lincoln Towncar was, I preferred the shorter distance. Now, as I pointed out to Barefoot Lucy, I was in your great state of Texas way back in October of 2007. It is true, you have increased the number of your letterboxes since that time, to approximately 3,387. It is a disgrace that your mystery boxes have not increased proportionately. Even if you count the mysteries in the files, websites, and other mysterious places, the percentage of mysteries to traditionals is not that good. The question is; can you correct this situation?<br>

I think not! <br>

If you had been paying attention, you would know that on the date and time in question, I was in the sunny state of Florida. <br>
 <br>
Thinking back to the facts behind your unfortunate demise, I can only mention the obvious. You should never turn your back on a Texan, or your front either, for that matter. <br>
 <br>
I assure you, ghost of IRA Boxer, that on my return trip, I will surely investigate this crime with the end result of setting you free. <br>

Must I point out that you are as contradictory as that Barefoot Lucy dame? Must I point out that it was you who believed the ghost of IRA Boxer was free? This in spite of the fact that he himself states otherwise. There is surely something wrong with the water in Texas. I hope you don't let the children drink it. <br>

I must ask you to please stop harrassing the wonderful members of my fan club.  Surely you have more important things to investigate.  How many mysteries have you solved lately, or do you merely investigate and naver solve?  I have powerful friends in the netherworld, not the least of which is The Ghost of Davy Crockett.  You don't want to get him on your bad side.  Just ask Baby Bear.<br>

I, Investigator Francis Bacon, harass? I simply point out the facts, and you accuse me of harassment? A fine howdy do that is! While I am sure the dames of your fan club are upstanding fine letterboxers, they do seem to be lacking in character judgment. <br>
 <br>
I will not answer your flagrant question on mysteries. Let me just say that the amount would bring you to your knees. <br>

Call on Davy Crockett, call on any of your powerful friends from the netherworld. I have The Ghostbuster's number and I know how to dial. <br>

How many mysteries have you solved lately, or do you merely investigate and naver solve?  I have powerful friends in the netherworld, not the least of which is The Ghost of Davy Crockett.  You don't want to get him on your bad side.  Just ask Baby Bear.<br>
