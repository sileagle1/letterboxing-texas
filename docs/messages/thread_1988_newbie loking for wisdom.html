                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings!<br>
I have just heard about letterboxing and I am excited to give it a try.<br>
My husband, Mike, and I have been married 27 years- we have three <br>
adult sons -Patrick age 26 USAF in Osan ,Korea-dad to Nolan(almost <br>
3);Matthew age 25 married and father of 2 year old Madison and 7 month <br>
old Miles and Chase age 20, professional college student.UTA. We also <br>
have a beautiful 4 year old son, Cullen (surprise!)<br>
We live in Van Zandt county but travel about alot. Next week we are <br>
going to Corpus Christi to a LLL conference and hope to try to find a <br>
box or two.This sounds like a great hobby to do with our little one <br>
and our grandchildren.<br>
We have visited the letterboxing.org site, do you all have any <br>
recommendations on other sites to search or places to begin for <br>
newbies in the heat with a little one who likes to be clever?<br>
Thanks in advance...I can not wait to get started.<br>

                    <html><body><div>Most clues for Texas boxes are on LBNA - <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a>, but you should be very familiar with <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com">www.atlasquest.com</a> also.  It may have a few boxes not listed on LBNA, and it has features LBNA doesn't have.  I can't imagine using one site without the other.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, Sea Dove of Birds of a Feather has created a great map-based Texas letterbox program that shows us graphically where boxes are - the catch is that placers have to give him permission to put their boxes on his map, so all boxes may not be there (but last time I checked, he had about 90% of them).  The address is 
<a href="http://www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com">www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com</a> .  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, you'll find there aren't a lot of boxes in your particular area - yet.  However, you aren't that far from Dallas. Also, you aren't far from us down in Cherokee County, where there are quite a few boxes also, and if you get down this way, email me directly and maybe we can meet and exchange!
