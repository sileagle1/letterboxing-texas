  We're new to this list.  We've been thinking about traveling out <br/>
your way so we decided to join your list.  Amy and I have been <br/>
boxing for about three years, and enjoy going new places.  Nothing <br/>
specific planned just yet but that depends on time-off and how our <br/>
young one travels.  Thanks for letting us on the list.<br/>

&gt; We've gotten about 10 new members in the last ten days<br/>

&gt; that?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You new folks, what brought you here?  Did you see an<br/>
&gt; article?  Planning on traveling to Texas soon?  Heard<br/>
&gt; that we are such a bright and articulate bunch that<br/>
&gt; you just HAD to be a part of our group?  Maybe you had<br/>
&gt; a coupon?  Hmmm?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Whatever brings you here, we welcome each and every<br/>
&gt; one of you with our big ol' Texas arms wide open!  If<br/>
&gt; you haven't already done so, speak up and tell us a<br/>
&gt; little about yourselves - how long you've been<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, what you like about the hobby, what you<br/>
&gt; hope to get from or share with us, what part of the<br/>
&gt; state you are from?  Anything you think would be of<br/>
&gt; interest to us!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This might also be a good time for old members to<br/>
&gt; update the group about themselves so the new folks can<br/>
&gt; get to know us too!<br/>
