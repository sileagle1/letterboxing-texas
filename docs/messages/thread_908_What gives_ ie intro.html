  We're new to this list.  We've been thinking about traveling out <br>
your way so we decided to join your list.  Amy and I have been <br>
boxing for about three years, and enjoy going new places.  Nothing <br>
specific planned just yet but that depends on time-off and how our <br>
young one travels.  Thanks for letting us on the list.<br>
