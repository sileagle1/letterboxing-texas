We have 3 Downtown Dallas boxes in various stages of readiness to plant<br>
- all are at historic sites. I'd love to hear from you all as to whether<br>
you (Texans) are likely to be searching for them or whether they are<br>
likely to be tourist boxers!<br>
Does everyone on this list tend to plan trips to letterbox? And does it<br>
increase the likelihood that you'll try an area if there is more than<br>
one box?<br>

Yes, the more in a city, the more likely we'd be to pick the area and find as many in a day/visit as possible.<br>
<br>
Or even if Dallas is on the way to somewhere, the is no reason we might not detour to grab a box or two!<br>

<br>
Gosh, Tiger, I guess your response makes me realize that my questions<br>
sounded pretty dumb;-)!  <br>
<br>
Let me explain: We're trying to decide how to set up the clues and<br>
locations for 3 urban letterboxes. We'd like to link all 3 because they<br>
have a common theme, but they are scattered over quite a large area. We<br>
were considering including helpful directions for driving/walking/public<br>
transportation from one box to another, but the clues began gaining epic<br>
proportions.<br>
<br>
It occurred to us that one way to decide how much info to include was to<br>
try to gauge whether most visitors to the letterboxes would be from<br>
around the DFW Metroplex, or whether a series of 3 might attract folks<br>
from further away in the state ( and out-of-state).<br>
  <br>
Thank you to those who responded enthusiastically - we'll send you the<br>
clues privately to beta test and give us some feedback! It will be a few<br>
weeks before they're all ready, but I'll let you know!<br>
