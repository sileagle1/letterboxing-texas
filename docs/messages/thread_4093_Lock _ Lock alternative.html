I picked up a couple at Kroger, but haven't seen them anywhere else yet, but they look great.  I bought some small boxes from Dixie Graphics online and the service was very good.  Dixie is a letterboxer and has other letterbox-related items.  She sent an LTC with the order that was fantastic.  Just a little plug.  I'd rather buy letterboxing supplies from letterboxers when I can.<br/>
