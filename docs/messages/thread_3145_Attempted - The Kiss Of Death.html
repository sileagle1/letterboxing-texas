after all.<br>
<br>
This is something I really struggle with, especially when someone <br>
reports that one of my boxes is missing.  Do I assume the box is <br>
really missing and change the status on my clues, or do I wait until <br>
another report comes in before deciding?  On the one hand, if I don't <br>
change the status, the next letterboxer might waste time looking for <br>
a missing box.  But on the other hand, the box might still be there, <br>
which has happened several times, and changing the status will give <br>
it the Kiss Of Death.  Of course, checking on the box myself would be <br>
the best option, but that is not always feasible.  My compromise has <br>
been to evaluate the report to determine how likely they were in the <br>
right spot, and if it sounds like they were in the right place I <br>
change my status to "reported missing", which means it might be <br>
missing but has not been confirmed by me.  If I'm not sure whether <br>
the boxer really was in the right spot, I record the report but don't <br>
change the status.  Then if I get another missing report in the <br>
future, I can see that it was reported missing at least once before <br>
and I then change the status.  This means the second boxer wasted an <br>
effort, but at least confirmed the status for me and future boxers.  <br>
Of course, the box still might be there, but at least boxers are <br>
warned that it might not be.<br>
<br>
Now as for the Attempted status that boxers can record on LBNA (and <br>
AQ), I have no control and have mixed feelings about it.  I <br>
originally would mark boxes as Attempted when I couldn't find them, <br>
just like I marked them as Found when I did, so that when looking at <br>
clues for boxes I could see at a glance which ones I had already <br>
found or attempted and could ignore them.  Unfortunately, this might <br>
give the box a Kiss Of Death which it may or may not deserve.  I <br>
guess ideally everyone should record Attempted only if they really <br>
think the box is missing, and future finders should still look for <br>
boxes with only one Attempted status.  If more than one Attempted <br>
exists on different dates, then that gives a better indication of the <br>
box status.  I would be much less likely to look for a box with 3 <br>
Attempts, but I probably would look for one with only 1 Attempt.  I <br>
guess it depends on whether you think more information, though <br>
possibly wrong, is better than no information.<br>
<br>
Hopefully all this is moot because letterboxers should be enjoying <br>
the location whether the box is missing or not.  Enjoy this fine <br>
weather while you can and have a great Halloween!<br>

<div> </div>
<div>I've decided that I'm not going to change a status on a box unless I or someone who has found it before verifies that it isn't where it is supposed to be.  There are also a very few finders I would trust to give me a good report even if they have never found it, but those are the same folks who wouldn't dare to mark a box Attempted because they know well enough that not finding a box doesn't mean it isn't there.  That may mean some finders waste a trip, but we all expect that, or should expect that, from time to time.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you pointed out, hopefully the boxer enjoyed the journey at least.  And that gives us good motivation to place boxes in good locations that can be enjoyed even if the box isn't there.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I confess that I put more weight on attempts and history from the websites when we are venturing outside our immediate area, but I have to agree with you - I would rather wait and see what I find in the logbook.  Reading a box's history online may tell its story, but it is like hearing the story in news report format instead of in a down-home letter format.  The logbook is where that's at.  Nothing like seeing a big ol' water splat in the middle of someone's signature stamp to let me know they were boxing in the rain like a maniac.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My personal logbook and the box logs are the final authority on where I've been and what I've found, as well as who else has cross paths with me either personally or at boxes.  If I haven't already read down the list of finders (which is never accurate anyway), I find I enjoy thumbing through the logbook a whole lot more.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once I've stamped in at a box, I've logged it.  Logging it online is redundant, and if it weren't for the fact that I know so many placers really like to get even a computer-generated "Found it" message, I wouldn't bother.  By the same token, it wouldn't bother me if the websites didn't have logging capabilities because getting found reports isn't important to me unless there is something significant about the find - first find, full logbook, left in the open, stuff like that - or unless the finder wants to tell me something special about finding the box.  Don't get me wrong - I don't have anything against getting those reports, it just doesn't thrill my soul.  Again though, I know other boxers really like to keep track of their finds online, so log away.  I get my personal satisfaction by going out and checking my boxes and being surprised and delighted by who's been there and when.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My goal these days is to beat anyone to boxes.  Beating Gryzzled Gryphon is a long ago hope.  I've had so little letterboxing time lately that I just hope to make it to a box before it gets retired!</div>

<div>It's exciting to actually be FF on a box, but it's also fun to find a box 
that has a really full log with lots of interesting stamps, some of which become 
very familiar but others that you might never have seen, especially from distant 
visitors.  Looking through those logs is part of the fun, I think.  
That's why, when I have to replace a log, I wrestle with whether or not to leave 
the previous log or logs and add a new one, or to take the old and replace it 
with a new.   I'd left the original logs and added new ones to two of 
my boxes,  which were later left thrown on the ground, boxes open and 
bags unsealed through our heavy rains, and all the contents - and logs - 
 were soaked, which meant the majority of the stamps and messages were 
obliterated.  For the most part, I'll take the original, and I'm glad that 
I did in several cases when the box later went missing but at least I had the 
first logbook.  </div>
