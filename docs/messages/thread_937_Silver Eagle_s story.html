<div>That green rubber stamp that turned into the alligator was my 
very first letterboxing find (along with Baby Bear's Stargazer).  I will 
never forget the kind reply I received when I sent an e mail telling Silver 
Eagle we found it, or how excited I was when Silver Eagle wrote to tell me he 
had found the first box I had placed!  I think we all owe them a giant 
"Texas Sized" thanks for having the patience to place boxes and wait for 
letterboxing to catch on in Texas...I know my kids and I have discovered so many 
amazing places...all because we were obsessed with finding a little plastic box 
with a carved eraser in it!  My oldest son actually had a dream the other 
day that Baby Bear had placed a box in the Brazos River, and that I was trying 
to make him dive to go and find it!  Thank you to you both for all your 
hard work, and for all the hours of fun that have resulted from it.
