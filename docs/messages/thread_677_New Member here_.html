<div>Hi all!</div>
<div>I am a new member, and wanted to introduce 
myself.</div>
<div>My name is Semalee, and when letterboxing I would 
sign it with Mags, or Bilbrey family.  We have been letterboxing for almost 
a year, but have not made any stamps or boxes yet, just having a great time 
finding all of the wonderful boxes that are out there.  I heard about 
letterboxing through a magazine article on how to walk more.  I knew this 
would be something that would quickly become addictive for me, and I was 
right!!  I have now gotten a couple of friends hooked and my sister!!  
We search for boxes whenever we are going anywhere else, because I think it is a 
great way to bring something back from a trip.  While in Colorado last 
summer we took my dad letterboxing and he loved it!!  Anyway, I am glad to 
be here.   Thank you so much to Jennifer of TeamKing for letting me 
know about this list.  I understand there is a gathering next Saturday, I 
am wondering if it is too late to RSVP??</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It is good to get a chance to be on this 
list.  Thank you!</div>
