you do it?  I love boxing and am thinking about heading to Denton<br>
tomorrow.  My kids are already frowning and moaning.  I just can't get<br>
them excited about it.  I have showed them pictures of the park with<br>
trails and lake.  "Not interested" is all I hear.  Leave me at home,<br>
please.  Well thats not gonna happen I say.  Its almost 2 hours away.<br>
 I know I can "make" them go with me, but thats a looong ride with bad<br>
attitudes.  So whats a mom gotta do.  "lightbulb"  upon searching the<br>
area of Denton I see there is a skatepark.  "What? Skatepark? COOL!"  <br>
<br>
 Before we make the drive does anyone know how far the Skate Works <br>
Skatepark is from the event?  I don't want to be too far away in the<br>
event a skate trick gets out of hand and first aide is needed for the<br>
boys instead of a LB.  :)<br>
