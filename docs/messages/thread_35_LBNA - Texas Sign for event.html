Baby Bear has already carved the Event stamp, but a LBTX logo<br/>
is a good idea.  Maybe it could be put on the top of this<br/>
Talklist.  You and anyone else can come up with examples and<br/>
we can pick one at the Event.  Also, if you want to organize <br/>
other activities that would be great.  The only problem is <br/>
that we may have over 40 people in a place designed for only 25,<br/>
so not sure what to expect.  I would like to have time for <br/>
various people to show their carving and logbook-making <br/>
techniques and to just visit with everyone, but hate to<br/>
put a timeline for everything.  I guess we will start at 11:00<br/>
by meeting, exchanging and eating, then different people can<br/>
do different things.  Some may prefer to go letterboxing in<br/>
groups or alone, others may want to do other activities, so if <br/>
you have ideas for activities go ahead and suggest them. <br/>
