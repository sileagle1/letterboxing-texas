                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I am brand new to letterboxing after reading about it in a <br>
magazine.  I'm in Houston and I was happy to find many boxes near my <br>
home.  I've taken my kids out a couple of times and so far we've found <br>
3 boxes.  We love the outdoors and this is a great alternative to the <br>
frog-catching my hubby does with them!  Our trail name is Treasure Bugs <br>
as we seem to always be together.  I am originally from Chicago, but <br>
transplanted here 11 years ago for a teaching job.  It was very <br>
appropriate that the first box I found was called "An Apple for my <br>
Teacher."<br>
I look forward to finding more boxes and to eventually one day actually <br>
hiding one.  <br>
Can someone please explain the tour bus to me...<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
Amy<br>

<div><font size="2">Welcome to the Texas letterboxing group, Treasure Bugs! You're lucky to be in the Houston area. There are some incredible boxers and boxes down there. I live north of Dallas. Have fun out there letterboxing. Be sure to teach your children that the most important part is to rehide those boxes carefully so they will be there for the next finder. Again, welcome.</font></div>
