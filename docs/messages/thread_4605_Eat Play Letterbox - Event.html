                    <div class="plaintext-content">Check the event calendar for the Eat Play Letterbox event in Galveston on October 30, 2010.  The purpose of the event is to Meet (eat), Play (find letterboxes) and Letterbox (plant letterboxes).  It seems that there are so many letterboxes in Galveston that are missing (probably) that no one is sure what's there and what's not and, of those that are there, condition may be an issue because of the hurricanes.  So we'll meet and try to find or visit every letterbox listed on Atlas Quest and LbNA as being in Galveston, more properly, on the island.  When we get a good list of boxes that are actually missing, we'll notify the owner, if he or she is still active or, failing to find the owner, notify the moderators of AQ and LbNA and see if they will archive or retire the box listing.  It's a one-day event with a meet at a restaurant to be determined and another meeting later in the day to access the damage and make a report.  All are welcome.<br>
