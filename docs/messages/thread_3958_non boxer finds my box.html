</p><div>I just received this email from a non-boxer who discovered one of my letterboxes:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was metal detecting in Waxahachie Sat, found your letterbox but did know it till I got home with it. Cold out so I just stuck it in my pouch and kept going. I turned it over and saw the info on the bottom. Opened it up and realized what it is. I will return it to the same spot next weekend. The last entry is 2/7/09. Any instructions or info you want before return it? Oh also, I see where each person that has found it used there stamp in it. I found your stamp enclosed in a separate bag within the container.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since that box has been there since our JEN Barnraising Event in Oct. 2005, I would love to see it safely returned as he said he would do. I emailed him websites to learn more about letterboxing. At least he seems to have good intentions to return it to the place he found it. (It's interesting that he didn't open it while he was in the area, but oh well...).</div>
