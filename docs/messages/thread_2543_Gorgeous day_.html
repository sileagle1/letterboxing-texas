<div>      After so many days of cold and wet 
and more cold, today's warm sunshine was an invitation to take a walk in the 
park.  So, after reading this morning that PuddleSplasher's newest Artist 
Series boxes had been placed, my kind spouse and I enjoyed a lovely walk on 
a pretty trail, finding all 4 beautiful letterboxes (with equally 
artistic logbooks), and had the added pleasure 
of stamping in while sitting in the sunshine on a pleasant park 
bench --  <strong><em>AND</em></strong> collecting those FF 
certificates!  Hooray!    </div>
<div>    Then, after enjoying lunch outside in the 
sunshine at Jason's Deli in Grapevine, I came home and recorded these finds in 
my own database and I discovered that I now have <strong><u>401</u></strong> 
finds!  Dali's Persistence of Time was #400, and Munch's The Scream is 
#401.  Whoo-Hoo!  This is a wonderful series, of course, since PS 
actually<em><strong> is</strong></em> an artist and her stamps and logbooks are 
always treasures to enjoy, but the added pleasures of the sunshine, the nice 
trail, actually being FF for these boxes, and reaching a letterboxing milestone 
added to our experience today. </div>
<div>    Which brings me back to the recent discussion 
of logbooks.   </div>
<div>    I consider that PuddleSplasher's logbooks are 
always excellent. She cuts the paper from sketchbooks so it stamps 
nicely, and the covers have either the imprint of the artisticly carved 
stamps or original artwork related to the letterbox, and even the bindings are 
unique, sometimes ribbon or twine or something appropriate to the overall 
effect.  I'll admit that my own aren't nearly that artistic, but I usually 
do like to create hand-made logbooks, cutting them to size and making the 
covers and sewing them together.  But sometimes, I just use what I can 
quickly put together if I don't have time to do create the logbook the way I'd 
really like to.  </div>
<div>    Some other logbooks I've found recently that I 
think are beautiful or unique include Stargazer's Safari Series and her 
Endangered Species of Texas series (only some of which I've found so 
far).  Each was hand-made and had her beautiful artwork on the cover - 
nice!  Also, CelticLions' Memoirs of a Meesha and the Adventures of a 
Mooshido Warrior mystery boxes had really clever, beautifully crafted shaped 
logbooks with unique details and folded covers.  Those added efforts make 
me smile and appreciate the time and trouble it takes to do something like 
that!  They must enjoy a great deal of personal satisfaction in creating 
them, and I certainly appreciate the results when I log in. </div>
<div>    The extra care and effort of the creator of the 
letterbox in carving the stamp and creating a hand-made logbook, not to mention 
putting it all together, finding the perfect location and planting the box, and 
then writing the clues (and some of those really clever clues - well, that's 
another discussion!), makes me feel even more responsible as a finder to 
carefully seal the plastic bags to protect their work or to replace torn bags 
with new ones if necessary, and to use caution and stealth if necessary to avoid 
being detected when finding and replacing the box, which is sometimes the most 
difficult part of letterboxing in urban locations and on busy trails -- and then 
to recover it very well and completely so all this artistic effort isn't 
lost to future finders!  </div>
<div>    Thanks to everyone who carves, creates, plants, and 
finds and recovers!  I really enjoyed the pleasant outing this morning and 
finding these boxes. And tomorrow, I hear the cold and wet is coming back for 
awhile. Oh well, time to start carving and cutting and sewing, I guess.
