<br/>
Among the letterboxes placed by Busy Bee,<br/>
In the site where three are hidden,<br/>
Seek Watchful Birds; turn 280* -<br/>
Blooms spring tween two stones, as bidden.<br/>
<br/>
Beneath are two resting places for hitchhikers.<br/>
Find two boxes in this hostel.<br/>
Leave at least one hitcher awaiting more takers.<br/>
Take or leave; help them travel well. <br/>
<br/>
Okay, please excuse the awful rhyme. LOL!<br/>
<br/>
You can exchange hitchhikers, take one without an exchange or only <br/>
drop some off here, as you think best advances any hitchhikers along <br/>
their way. Any exchanges made don't have to be even exchanges, such <br/>
as if you are leaving for a long letterboxing excursion and want to <br/>
place quite a few hitchhikers along the way. Just be sure to always <br/>
leave at least one hitchhiker in residence at all times. I am going <br/>
to try to keep the boxes stocked with several hitchhikers at all <br/>
times.<br/>
<br/>
This hostel does have it's own box stamp in one of the boxes, and it <br/>
is a 'three parter' of sorts, that can add to the total stamped <br/>
image if you come to visit more than once. <br/>
