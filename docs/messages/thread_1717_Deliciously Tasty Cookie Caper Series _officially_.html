<br>
I just wanted to let you all know that the Cookie Caper Series is <br>
now officially retired.  All of the boxes have now been pulled.<br>
<br>
"Thanks" to all those who expressed interest in the series!  It was <br>
a lot of fun for me to get to meet boxers from all over the state <br>
that I most likely would not have run into on the trails in my neck <br>
of the woods.  I think this experience has also made me a better <br>
boxer by forcing me to sit down and carve (even when I thought I <br>
couldn't), write clues (especially those cryptic ones) and plant <br>
boxes in good (ie. safe) hiding places.<br>
<br>
For those of you who missed the series this year...never fear!  I do <br>
plan on re-hiding the Series next year with our newly <br>
introduced "lemon cookie of some kind" AND our newly retired "Lemon <br>
Pastry Cremes" boxes.  Plus the Hitchhiker will be "all new" and <br>
most probably the bonus box, too!<br>
<br>
If you are interested in seeing the clues pages from this year, here <br>
is the link:<br>

<br>
Thanks again, Batty B (of the BusyBeesFamily)<br>
<br>
PS  I entered the Cookie Caper Series onto both LbNA and Atlasquest <br>
for those of you who like to keep track of your finds that way.  I <br>
think I may have messed up Lucy Locket's "online logbook" when I <br>
deleted an entry I had made earlier and replaced it with a newer, <br>
more correct entry.  Sorry!  :-(<br>
