<div><font size="2">Sounds like an event to me! About a year ago, we met Sprite from NY at Uncle Julios in Dallas and there were quite a few people who showed up. Twice we've met at the La Madelines in Grapevine and they reserved their back room for us free of charge. Everyone just went through the line and paid for their own dinner. I think that room easily holds 25 to 30 people. I told the manager it was an informal "hiking" group and he was all gung-ho! Maybe you should just pick a time and place and announce it on the Ta_Da list and also list it on the AQ event page and see how many people sign up. Sounds like fun.</font></div>

<div>It's at Mid Cities and Grapevine Hwy or Davis, one of those, they are so close. <br/><br/>But, I think the one in Watauga is closer. Just exit Western Center, off 35 and head East. Western Center changes names about every block, haha. When you cross Rufe Snow, it's on the right. Actually, it might be quicker to take 35 to 820 and exit Rufe Snow, lol.<br/><br/>Let me know if you want me to get you some and hold on to them. Then, one day we can meet somewhere closer.

 Sounds like an event to me! About a year ago, we met Sprite from NY <br/> at Uncle Julios in Dallas and there were quite a few people who <br/> showed up. Twice we've met at the La Madelines in Grapevine and they <br/> reserved their back room for us free of charge. Everyone just went <br/> through the line and paid for their own dinner. I think that room <br/> easily holds 25 to 30 people. I told the manager it was an <br/> informal "hiking" group and he was all gung-ho! Maybe you should just <br/> pick a time and place and announce it on the Ta_Da list and also list <br/> it on the AQ event page and see how many people sign up.

About a year ago, we met Sprite from NY <br/>at Uncle Julios in Dallas and there were quite a few people who <br/>showed up. Twice we've met at the La Madelines in Grapevine and they <br/>reserved their back room for us free of charge. Everyone just went <br/>through the line and paid for their own dinner. I think that room <br/>easily holds 25 to 30 people. I told the manager it was an <br/>informal "hiking" group and he was all gung-ho! Maybe you should just <br/>pick a time and place
 and announce it on the Ta_Da list and also list <br/>it on the AQ event page and see how many people sign up.

 <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It's at Mid Cities and Grapevine Hwy or Davis, one of those, they <br/>are so close. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But, I think the one in Watauga is closer. Just exit Western <br/>Center, off 35 and head East. Western Center changes names about <br/>every block, haha. When you cross Rufe Snow, it's on the right. <br/>Actually, it might be quicker to take 35 to 820 and exit Rufe Snow, <br/>lol.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Let me know if you want me to get you some and hold on to them. <br/>Then, one day we can meet somewhere closer. I wish they'd open up the <br/>Taco Time in Rhome again. I met Batty Girl and her family there once <br/>and never got to go back, boo hoo.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Janet<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Kelli Oliver &lt;kellioliver2004@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote: <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I plan on locating several areas then making the stamp before I buy <br/>any lock n locks.<br/>&gt; Where is there a
