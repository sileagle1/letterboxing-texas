<div>You know, I think the 
last line of Silver Eagle's post sums it all up in a nutshell.  If not 
finding a box spoils the trip, perhaps letterboxing is not for you.  When 
placers choose carefully the hiding spots for their boxes, finding the actual 
box is just the bonus at the end of a great outing.  I went back 2 (or 
maybe 3) times to find Baby Bear's "Blue Northern" when I very first started 
letterboxing almost four years ago, and it remains one of my all time favorites 
because the kids and I (and later, my parents) had such a great time out on the 
Lone Star Trail.  Because so many boxers here in Texas take the time to 
carefully choose where they hide a box, I have had the pleasure of discovering 
everything from a marvelous aquarium to botanical gardens to trails I never knew 
existed, and even a replica of Stonehenge in the middle of a cow field.  Of 
course we all want to find the stamp, but let's all slow down and enjoy the trip 
a little.  Now, I need to get up to school and make milk carton Haunted 
Houses with 44 first graders.  Wish me luck!

<div>It's the Slumbering Family Tree for me at the Ft Worth Botanical Gardens (a wonderful Kantexan box). After finding her box a couple of years ago, I never go to the gardens without visiting that special location. I've taken visitors there too and showed them the tree without ever mentioning that there was a letterbox nicely tucked away nearby. If her box should ever go missing, I'd hope that she'd replace it, but whether it's there or not, I will always continue to visit the location that she so generously shared with us by planting her letterbox.</div>
