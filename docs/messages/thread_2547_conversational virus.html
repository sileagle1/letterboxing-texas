<br>
I am glad that whatever conversational virus that was<br>
going through the list a little while back seems to<br>
have run its course and the list feels friendly again.<br>
 I was concerned and sad for a bit, watching the<br>
back-and-forth among a list that had been so friendly<br>
and warm for the entire year i've been hanging around<br>
the edges.  i'm glad things have eased between you all<br>
(apparently, anyway), and glad this is a list where<br>
folks talk directly about what's going on, even when<br>
it might seem difficult to do so.  further proof that<br>
letterboxers (in texas, anyway) are GREAT!<br>
