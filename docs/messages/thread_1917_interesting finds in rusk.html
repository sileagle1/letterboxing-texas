boxes from the gathering in March.  The most interesting site today <br/>
was the old Rusk College site.  We found a 6 week old kitten roaming <br/>
around with no mommy in site.  For those of you have never been to <br/>
this site, there is not a whole lot close by, so the kitten is now <br/>
home with us and has already been named LB for letterboxing.  Also I <br/>
went to look for a box from the March gathering called "Shenandoah <br/>
Shadow" and to check on our 2 boxes there and found that the <br/>
location for Shenandoah and "Snoopy Climbs to the Top" had totally <br/>
been wiped clean of all growth and the log that both of them was <br/>
near was completely removed.  After frantically searching, with <br/>
little LB circling my legs the whole time, I found the Shenandoah <br/>
Shadow box completely in tact and luckily enough we found our Snoopy <br/>
log book and stamp in tact but the box was completely destroyed.  So <br/>
we brought the Snoopy stamp, logbook, the Shenandoah box, and little <br/>
LB home with us.  I will try to get the Snoopy box back hidden asap, <br/>
but I need to know what the people from the March gathering would <br/>
like me to do with the Shenandoah Shadow box.  I do not mind re-<br/>
hiding it, just let me know.<br/>
What an adventure!!!<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm so glad you found Shenandoah Shadow - if you recall, that's the one I told you I couldn't find when I went to find your Snoopy box.  It had been hidden at virtually the exact same place as Snoopy, except that you wouldn't have known it when you hid Snoopy because those clues weren't posted yet.  I can't believe they cleared that stump away - it looked like it was a permanent fixture!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have an idea for a new hiding place - do you want to hide it near an existing box and let me know where, and I'll pick it up, possibly this weekend?  Or meet for an exchange?</div>
