<div>My first letterboxes were found in state forests 
in CT and Maine while visiting my sister in New 
England before she moved back home to Texas,  and they included a 
piggyback, a HH, and a bonus box, so I was hooked!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As soon as I got home and checked the website, I 
discovered a few (<em><u>very few</u></em>) boxes in Dallas and Ft. Worth and 
Arlington, all placed by Kantexan or Celtic Lions.  My first Texas boxes 
were Kantexan's Mondrian Series and Slumbering Family Tree, and Celtic 
Lions' Shawnee Trail and Wacky Tacky in Texas Lenin Statue - all still among my 
favorites.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Those first boxes all set a pretty high 
standard in my mind for letterboxing, too:  beautifully scenic or 
interesting and unusual locations, great stamps, cleverly concealed boxes, and 
something unique about each one (like Stillwater's artificial rock at the 
original Shawnee Trail, or the recreation of a Mondrian print with the 
5 Mondrian stamps).  I've got a lot of Silver Eagle and Baby Bear 
stamps, too, though, and amazingly to me, when I travel, no matter how far I go 
or where, among the letterboxes I find there always seem to be at least one by 
Silver Eagle/Baby Bear!  So they haven't only "seeded" Texas for the rest 
of us, they've got letterboxes out there EVERYWHERE! </div>
