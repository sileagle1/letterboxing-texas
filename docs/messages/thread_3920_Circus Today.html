                    <div class="plaintext-content">No, it's not what you think.  I don't know how many of you live in a <br/>
small town, but you don't always see the kind of things that may be <br/>
commonplace in the big city, so when something does happen, it can be <br/>
a big deal.  I drove in to town this morning, and that doesn't take <br/>
long where I live.  I was just going to haul off a little trash, but <br/>
I had to go way over to the other side of town, which is about 4 <br/>
miles from the house, and I began to see these little hand-written <br/>
paper signs, tacked to a stick and stuck in the ground on the side of <br/>
the road.  "Circus Today", they all said, and that got my <br/>
attention.  'Course, I was thinking it might be the Traveling Texas <br/>
Circus, so I followed the signs a bit, without getting too far off my <br/>
intended path.  I followed them past the courthouse to the grounds of <br/>
old Jones High School.  Thought it might be there, since the school <br/>
is not used anymore, but didn't see anything going on.  I thought <br/>
about my childhood in West Texas when the circus train would come to <br/>
town and we'd go down to the tracks and watch them unload the <br/>
elephants and set up the tents on a vacant lot.  But we don't have a <br/>
railroad in Coldspring, so that was out of the question.  I guess <br/>
they hauled everything in on trucks, but I doubted there would be <br/>
elephants.  Went down to Old Town Coldspring, but nothing was <br/>
happening.  I finally had to give up and get rid of the trash.  I <br/>
guess Silver Eagle was right:  the circus train must still be holed <br/>
up in Dewberry's garage, waiting for spring.<br/>

<div>We saw Carson and 
Barnes once, it was great because we got to go the day before the show and watch 
the elephants put up the tents.  It was here about 4 years ago, and as far 
as I can tell it hasn't been back to Houston since.  Too bad, it was a 
great show.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best circus I ever 
saw was in Ireland, a little tiny show that had about 10 people total.  The 
best part was that when the performers weren't doing their acts they could be 
found in the concession stand selling popcorn.</div>

<div>Carson &amp; Barnes Circus plans their route 
to play the Houston area every other year.  Only Ringling Bros. Barnum 
&amp; Bailey and the Shrine Circus play in Houston proper.  The smaller 
circuses play in the suburbs or nearby towns.  Travelling circuses play the 
south in the early spring and late fall, and move to the northern half of 
the U.S. in the summer.  Carson &amp; Barnes used to play Texas City, 
every other March.  When I hear of them coming your way, I will let you 
know.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My favorites are also the small, one-ring tent 
shows.  If you look closely, you'll find the performers being "candy 
butchers"-- selling popcorn and "floss" (cotton candy) at the small shows in the 
U.S. as well, including Shrine circuses.  Performers also run the pony 
"sweep" (ride) and inflatable rides during intermission and after the 
show.  The circus is hard work, and everybody pitches in.  A circus 
contract usually contains the requirement that the contracted, as well as 
performing his acts, must be "generally useful"!  I actually got to 
run the pony sweep for a week once, with a circus travelling near Houston.  
The ponies were owned by the ringmaster.  I learned how to scoop 
all the pony poop up in one swift motion with a huge shovel.  It 
was a great week!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are some Texas circus connections.  
Texas used to have it's own Circus Museum -- the 
Hertzberg Circus Museum in San Antonio.  The fabulous 
collection is now part of San Antonio's Witte Museum.  Several 
members of the Flying Valentine family -- a family of trapeze artists and 
circus owners -- live in the Houston area.  The local 
Houston chapter of the Circus Fans of America is named after the Valentine 
family.  Another favorite Texan in the circus world was the late, great 
Bobby Gibbs, an elephant trainer who (at 370 pounds) was almost as large as 
his elephants, and had a quick wit and a huge heart to match.  He 
retired from the circus to live near Dallas, and had a second career 
driving a truck hauling bananas, which he called "monkey pickles".  If 
anyone is interested, as I think of more Texas circus connections, I will post 
them.</div>

<p>
</p><div>Carson &amp; Barnes Circus plans their 
    route to play the Houston area every other year.  Only Ringling Bros. 
    Barnum &amp; Bailey and the Shrine Circus play in Houston proper.  The 
    smaller circuses play in the suburbs or nearby towns.  Travelling 
    circuses play the south in the early spring and late fall, and move to 
    the northern half of the U.S. in the summer.  Carson &amp; Barnes 
    used to play Texas City, every other March.  When I hear of them coming 
    your way, I will let you know.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My favorites are also the small, one-ring 
    tent shows.  If you look closely, you'll find the performers being 
    "candy butchers"-- selling popcorn and "floss" (cotton candy) at the small 
    shows in the U.S. as well, including Shrine circuses.  Performers 
    also run the pony "sweep" (ride) and inflatable rides during 
    intermission and after the show.  The circus is hard work, and 
    everybody pitches in.  A circus contract usually contains the 
    requirement that the contracted, as well as performing his acts, 
    must be "generally useful"!  I actually got to run the pony sweep 
    for a week once, with a circus travelling near Houston.  The ponies 
    were owned by the ringmaster.  I learned how to scoop all the 
    pony poop up in one swift motion with a huge shovel.  It was a 
    great week!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are some Texas circus connections.  
    Texas used to have it's own Circus Museum -- 
    the Hertzberg Circus Museum in San Antonio.  The fabulous 
    collection is now part of San Antonio's Witte 
    Museum.  Several members of the Flying Valentine family -- a 
    family of trapeze artists and circus owners -- live in the Houston 
    area.  The local Houston chapter of the Circus Fans of America is 
    named after the Valentine family.  Another favorite Texan in the circus 
    world was the late, great Bobby Gibbs, an elephant trainer who (at 370 
    pounds) was almost as large as his elephants, and had a quick wit and 
    a huge heart to match.  He retired from the circus to live near 
    Dallas, and had a second career driving a truck hauling bananas, which 
    he called "monkey pickles".  If anyone is interested, as I think of 
    more Texas circus connections, I will post them.</div>

</p><div>We saw Carson and 
      Barnes once, it was great because we got to go the day before the show and 
      watch the elephants put up the tents.  It was here about 4 years ago, 
      and as far as I can tell it hasn't been back to Houston since.  Too 
      bad, it was a great show.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The best circus I 
      ever saw was in Ireland, a little tiny show that had about 10 people 
      total.  The best part was that when the performers weren't doing
