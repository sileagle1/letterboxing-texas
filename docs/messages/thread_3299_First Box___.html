<br/>
According to LbNA, there are 36 letterboxes in Cypress, most of them <br/>
in Telge Park.  I'm not recommending our boxes over any other, bou <br/>
are certainly welcome to look for our boxes there, called Stingy <br/>
Jack and Legend of Sleepy Hollow.  I would encourage you to read the <br/>
clues and decide which box appeals to you in terms of subject, <br/>
location, walking distance, etc. Just follow the rules about being a <br/>
responsible letterboxer, making sure the box is sealed well and <br/>
rehidden and covered so that it can't accidentally be seen.  Also, <br/>
it's been raining out there for a couple of days, so the trails will <br/>
be wet and muddy.  Good luck.<br/>

month old and he has been with me for almost all of my boxes.  He <br/>
loves being outside in his stroller. Checking LBNA will help you find <br/>
the ones you are comfortable with.  I am not familiar with your area, <br/>
but feel free to come my way.  There are many boxes that you can <br/>
drive by if you don't want to take the new one out into the cold.  <br/>
Have fun. <br/>
