                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, Texas.  I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas.  In doing my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas.  Most of the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote".  It had never been found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br>
<br>
Dear Boots Tex,<br>
Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, at the cemetery tonight.  It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work.  This was our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our own.<br>
<br>
How cool is that?  As most of you know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes!  I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes.  I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br>

Years ago when my daughter was a Cowboys Cheerleader, she had to fill out one of those questioneres which was posted on the Cowboys website. One of the questions was to name someone whom she most admired. She named Senator Kay Bailey Hutchinson. Within a couple of weeks, she received an official letter out at Valley Ranch (home of the Cowboys) on United States Senate letterhead from Kay thanking her so much for the compliment, etc. Yep! Even U.S. Senators (or their staff) Google themselves.<br>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my 
  letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, 
  Texas. I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and 
  is the official photographer for the state of Texas. In doing my usual 
  research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I 
  discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas. Most of the 
  county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild 
  turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's 
  my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by 
  Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the 
  letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and 
  I called it "Meinzer's Coyote". It had never been found until today when I got 
  a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br/><br/>Dear Boots 
  Tex,<br/>Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, 
  coyote, at the cemetery tonight. It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great 
  time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work. This was our 
  first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our 
  own.<br/><br/>How cool is that? As most of you know, the usual subjects of my 
  letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of 
  the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes! I'm 
  hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes. I'll try to beat 
  Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/></p></div>

&gt; &gt; I'd like to share a quite amazing story (to me, at least), about one of my letterboxes, the one located in the small town of Benjamin, Knox County, Texas.  I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas.  In doing my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas.  Most of the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote".  It had never been found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Dear Boots Tex,<br/>
&gt; &gt; Wyman and I found the box with the stamp of a depiction of his, coyote, at the cemetery tonight.  It was loads of fun. Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work.  This was our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our own.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; How cool is that?  As most of you know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes!  I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes.  I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks very much, MO5.  Actually, I've been spending a lot of time lately carving stamps for a few boxes that we plan on placing in San Antonio the end of this month.  I'm been using up some of that orange PZ Kut and it's really not that bad.  It makes a really nice image and you can get really crisp lines with it.  The only thing is the color; the transferred image is harder to see.  Oh, and Stampeaz is out of orange now, too.  Where are we going to get carving material?  I really hate to go back to the "pink stuff", but may have to.<br>

I am a big fan of the work of Wyman Meinzer, who lives in Benjamin and is the official photographer for the state of Texas.  In doing my usual research for our trip out to that part of the state last December, I discovered that nothing had ever happened in Knox County, Texas.  Most of the county is taken up with large ranches and populated with javelina, wild turkey, coyotes and good upstanding citizens, but that's okay, because that's my kind of country. To get on with the story, I had a book of photographs by Mr. Meinzer which included a very nice picture of a howling coyote (not the letterboxing kind, mind you), so I made a box using his coyote as my stamp and I called it "Meinzer's Coyote".  It had never been found until today when I got a very nice notice from Mrs. Wyman Meinzer as follows:<br>

Wyman and I had a great time and we thank you for your kind words about Wyman's work.  This was our first box to find, and will now search for others and even place some of our own.<br>

As most of you know, the usual subjects of my letterboxes are of folks who populated Texas in the distant past, usually of the deceased variety, and none of them have ever found one of my boxes!  I'm hoping the Meinzers indeed do place some letterboxes.  I'll try to beat Gryzzled Gryphon to them.<br>
