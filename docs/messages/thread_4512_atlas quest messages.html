i have posted a message on AQ but was posting here as well since
everyone has been so nice. The reason that I have not been out boxing
and have been reading message boards is I have 2 children that have
tons of activities and myself as well so when im at home in the evening
I read forums on activites that I am involved in. I don't understand
what you mean when you say released near barefoot lucy<br/>

<div><font size="2">Hey Kim, You might want to go back and read some of the archives on the Texas list to learn a little more about Letterbox Bozo. We actually have a few "characters" on this list who may actually not be what you would consider, "human". We love them because they are basically a pain in the arse, but they're OUR pains! Take them lightly, enjoy them! Bozo (the clown) was referring the Texas Circus box when he mentioned being released close to Barefoot Lucy. Don't take this list too seriously. It's mostly a fun-loving group of great people.... and non-people. Enjoy.</font></div>

We actually have a few "characters" on this list who may actually not be what you would consider, "human". We love them because they are basically a pain in the arse, but they're OUR pains! Take them lightly, enjoy them! Bozo (the clown) was referring the Texas Circus box when he mentioned being released close to Barefoot Lucy. Don't take this list too seriously.

<div>OH<font size="2">! That's below the belt! You have no idea how <em>UN</em>funny that is, my friend. My legs look like I was dipped in a vat of boiling water from cozying up to a leafless poison ivy vine over two weeks ago. I noticed the vine after "hugging the tree", but I was hours away from my bottle of Technu. By the time I washed the oil off, the damage was done. Over the past two weeks, all I could think of to comfort myself was two years ago Dewberry had it in her HAIR and on her face, and Stillwater had to go to the hospital with his, so I can survive this. Not pretty. I melt in the face of poison ivy...... <em>I'm' melting.......</em></font></div>

We actually have a few "characters" on this list who may actually not be what you would consider, "human". We love them because they are basically a pain in the arse, but they're OUR pains! Take them lightly, enjoy them! Bozo (the clown) was referring the Texas Circus box when he mentioned being released close to Barefoot Lucy. Don't take this list too seriously. It's mostly a fun-loving group of great people.... and non-people. Enjoy.<br>

Since he is the driver of the TX Traveling Circus that is currently held by JBK near Barefoot Lucy, he is hoping to be released soon for the first finder to take home.  As for the fun rivalry between PS and BL, and between The Ghost Of IRA Boxer and the human bear, you will just have to look in the archives or ask about it at your next Gathering.  Just know that it is all in fun.  I think.<br>

P.S. I am curious to hear more about the fake wedding and how it affected the jilted ghost (Oonie) and grieving widow (IMA Boxer).<br>

All righty then, I guess I won't give Oonie that mirror for a wedding present like I'd planned. Maybe a nice lightning rod?<br>
