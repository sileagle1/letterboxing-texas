                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those of you who were wondering how my racing adventure went:<br>
<br>
Yesterday was my race car ride at Texas Motor Speedway which my <br>
daughter gave me for Christmas last year. At the Speedway, the <br>
outside track is the oval track used for the Nascar and Camel style <br>
cars, and is raked at 30%. The infield track is completely level and <br>
has several severe curves including two hairpins, and believe it or <br>
not, the Corvettes they race on that track go faster than the Nascars <br>
(so they said anyway). At any rate, this is the fastest I've ever <br>
gone in an automobile: five laps at over 170 mph and hour.<br>
<br>
When you get the green flag, they floorboard it and you immediately <br>
feel the G's. I thought I was smiling, but then realized it was just <br>
the G-force pulling the skin on my face around to the back of my <br>
head. A couple of times during the race, I had to reach up and pull <br>
my helmet back down over my forehead, and it was so tight when I <br>
originally put it on, I thought it was going to mash my head into a <br>
permanent oblong shape, but after a few curves, it was feeling rather <br>
loose. The scariest part was coming into the turns. I just had to be <br>
completely trusting of my wild, slightly insane driver. We would be <br>
going full speed up to the turns and slam on the brakes shift down <br>
and sling around those hairpin curves on the inner track. When we'd <br>
arrive at a turn at the same time as another car, one driver would be <br>
forced to the outer lane and the other would take the inner. When <br>
we'd take the outer lane, we'd immediately line up right behind the <br>
other car... I mean right on his bumper at that high rate of speed. <br>
Then my driver would always steal the lead back on the straight-of-<br>
way. Un-be-lieve-a-ble! It was an absolutely incredible experience, <br>
but one I NEVER want to do again. I really wasn't scared, and it was <br>
a lot of fun, but after the race, I was in the bathroom throwing up <br>
20 minutes later! At least I didn't get sick while I was in the race <br>
car. <br>
<br>
I think letterboxing, even when I'm climbing a mountain and my <br>
muscles are screaming, is much more my speed. At least, I'M in <br>
control.<br>

<div><font size="2">I think if your husbands are adventuress and are looking for a complete thrill, this would be an incredible gift. There are basically two events offered at the track (different companies). One is the Texas Driving Experience and you can either ride or drive. Believe me, the ride is an amazing thrill because how often do you get the opportunity to ride with a professional driver... full out? Also there is the Texas Driving School (?). Viewfinder did this one a few years ago, and she can tell you more about it. With that one,  you take a class first, then gear up and drive a Nascar as fast as you want to go on the oval track. I remember she loved it.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Mike, speaking of high-speed aircraft rides, when my two daughters were Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, they did quite a few USO tours. Once when they were leaving an aircraft carrier in the Persian Gulf, they were catapulted off the deck in their plane to get them back to the United Arabis. I can't remember the speed at which the planes left the deck, but they said that was the most amazing experience they'd ever had. They also did a lot of hopping around Korea in Blackhawks, which made their dad proud since he was developing the software for those particular helicopters. It's funny, they always felt totally safe flying around war zones with the military, but were scared to death to fly on a corporate jet from Dallas to Houston for an appearance. By the way, the Cowboys Cheerleaders are going to <u>Baghdad</u> this year for Christmas.</font></div>

I am so glad you shared this with us.

At the Speedway, the <br/> outside track is the
 oval track used for the Nascar and Camel style <br/> cars, and is raked at 30%. The infield track is completely level and <br/> has several severe curves including two hairpins, and believe it or <br/> not, the Corvettes they race on that track go faster than the Nascars <br/> (so they said anyway). At any rate, this is the fastest I've ever <br/> gone in an automobile: five laps at over 170 mph and hour.<br/> <br/> When you get the green flag, they floorboard it and you immediately <br/> feel the G's. I thought I was smiling, but then realized it was just <br/> the G-force pulling the skin on my face around to the back of my <br/> head. A couple of times during the race, I had to reach up and pull <br/> my helmet back down over my forehead, and it was so tight when I <br/> originally put it on, I thought it was going to mash my head into a <br/> permanent oblong shape, but after a few curves, it was feeling rather <br/> loose. The scariest part was coming into the turns. I just had to
 be <br/> completely trusting of my wild, slightly insane driver. We would be <br/> going full speed up to the turns and slam on the brakes shift down <br/> and sling around those hairpin curves on the inner track. When we'd <br/> arrive at a turn at the same time as another car, one driver would be <br/> forced to the outer lane and the other would take the inner. When <br/> we'd take the outer lane, we'd immediately line up right behind the <br/> other car... I mean right on his bumper at that high rate of speed. <br/> Then my driver would always steal the lead back on the straight-of-<br/> way. Un-be-lieve-<wbr>a-ble! It was an absolutely incredible experience, <br/> but one I NEVER want to do again. I really wasn't scared, and it was <br/> a lot of fun, but after the race, I was in the bathroom throwing up <br/> 20 minutes later! At least I didn't get sick while I was in the race <br/> car. <br/> <br/> I think letterboxing, even when I'm climbing a mountain and my <br/> muscles are
 screaming, is much more my speed. At least, I'M in <br/> control.<br/> <br/> Puddle Splasher<br/> <br/> </wbr></div> </div> <!--End group email --> </blockquote><br/><p>

The best one was the one where they decided who really got to stay on the squad. I really wanted to watch the one where they jumped out of the airplane, but I missed it. I do believe that's the one where the lady manager (what is she called?) decided to go with them. I think I would love jumping out a plane.

There are basically two events offered at the track (different companies). One is the Texas Driving Experience and you can either ride or drive. Believe me, the ride is an amazing thrill because how often do you get the opportunity to ride with a professional driver... full out? Also there is the Texas Driving School (?). Viewfinder did this one a few years ago, and she can tell you more about it. With that one,  you take a class first, then gear up and drive a Nascar as fast as you want to go on the oval track. I remember she loved it.</font></div> <div><font size="2"></font> </div> <div><font size="2">Mike, speaking of high-speed aircraft rides, when my two daughters were Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, they did quite a few USO tours. Once when they were leaving an aircraft carrier in the
 Persian Gulf, they were catapulted off the deck in their plane to get them back to the United Arabis. I can't remember the speed at which the planes left the deck, but they said that was the most amazing experience they'd ever had. They also did a lot of hopping around Korea in Blackhawks, which made their dad proud since he was developing the software for those particular helicopters. It's funny, they always felt totally safe flying around war zones with the military, but were scared to death to fly on a corporate jet from Dallas to Houston for an appearance. By the way, the Cowboys Cheerleaders are going to <u>Baghdad</u> this year for Christmas.</font></div> <div> </div> <div></div></div> <div> </div> <blockquote style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(0, 0, 0);"> <div style="font-family: Arial; font-style: normal; font-variant: normal; font-weight: normal; font-size: 10pt; line-height: normal; font-size-adjust: none; font-stretch: normal;">----- Original Message

to get you down quick, not for a nice ride.  Landing isn't nice either, no 
room for mistakes.  You have nearly 100 pounds of gear strapped on 
you.  You have your weapon and all the ammo you can carry.  You carry 
a heavy pack that is what you will have to live out of for several days.  
This pack is on a tether and once you are stable under the chute you drop your 
pack on this tether.  This is so it hits the ground first, and you slow 
your descent slightly before hitting the ground yourself.  Your jump may be 
in daylight, but more likely at night.  The weather - well - not your 
choice either.  If you are lucky, no enemy fire finds you coming 
down.  Yes - the Geneva Convention says they are not allowed to shoot you 
in the air.  If they are signatories of the Geneva 
Convention.</font></span></div>

<p>I enjoyed watching the DCC training camp show this year. I didn't get to 
  catch too many of the episodes, due to work, but I enjoyed the ones I was able 
  to watch. The best one was the one where they decided who really got to stay 
  on the squad. I really wanted to watch the one where they jumped out of the 
  airplane, but I missed it. I do believe that's the one where the lady manager 
  (what is she called?) decided to go with them. I think I would love jumping 
  out a plane. It can't be much different than parasailing,

    for a complete thrill, this would be an incredible gift. There are basically 
    two events offered at the track (different companies). One is the Texas 
    Driving Experience and you can either ride or drive. Believe me, the ride is 
    an amazing thrill because how often do you get the opportunity to ride with 
    a professional driver... full out? Also there is the Texas Driving School 
    (?). Viewfinder did this one a few years ago, and she can tell you more 
    about it. With that one,  you take a class first, then gear up and 
    drive a Nascar as fast as you want to go on the oval track. I remember she 
    loved it.</font></div>

<div><font size="2">Mike, speaking of high-speed aircraft rides, when my two 
    daughters were Dallas Cowboys Cheerleaders, they did quite a 
    few USO tours. Once when they were leaving an aircraft carrier in the 
    Persian Gulf, they were catapulted off the deck in their plane to get them 
    back to the United Arabis. I can't remember the speed at which the planes 
    left the deck, but they said that was the most amazing experience they'd 
    ever had. They also did a lot of hopping around Korea in Blackhawks, which 
    made their dad proud since he was developing the software for those 
    particular helicopters. It's funny, they always felt totally safe flying 
    around war zones with the military, but were scared to death to fly on a 
    corporate jet from Dallas to Houston for an appearance. By the way, the 
    Cowboys Cheerleaders are going to <u>Baghdad</u> this year for 
    Christmas.</font></div>

It's Team Texas Performance Driving School at Texas Motor Speedway, <br>
and  that's what I did about 8 or 9 years ago, where you actually do <br>
drive the NASCAR racecars yourself for 10 laps around the real track, <br>
with a professional driver as your passenger.  You first go through <br>
about an hour of performance driving school, learning the shape of <br>
the track, etc., and then you ride about 2 or 3 laps at up to 150 mph <br>
with a professional driver to get the feel of the track and the <br>
speed, and then you drive!  There are about 10 cars at a time on the <br>
track, all racing and trying to pass and it is the scariest thing <br>
I've ever done, too, and I've done some other scary things, but it <br>
was one heck of an adventure!  I didn't do hairpin curves in a <br>
Corvette at 170 mph like PuddleSplasher, but let me tell you, going <br>
about 130-150 mph in a real Nascar, dipping into the curve and coming <br>
up at the wall at those speeds and trying to pass other cars while <br>
you're doing it, well, it's a thrill!  If he'd like to drive for <br>
himself, maybe you should check it out for him.  But you might want <br>
to be sure his life insurance is all up-to-date first!  <br>

<p>There is another option available, and he CAN be behind the wheel.  <br/>
It's Team Texas Performance Driving School at Texas Motor Speedway, <br/>
and  that's what I did about 8 or 9 years ago, where you actually do <br/>
drive the NASCAR racecars yourself for 10 laps around the real track, <br/>
with a professional driver as your passenger.  You first go through <br/>
about an hour of performance driving school, learning the shape of <br/>
the track, etc., and then you ride about 2 or 3 laps at up to 150 mph <br/>
with a professional driver to get the feel of the track and the <br/>
speed, and then you drive!  There are about 10 cars at a time on the <br/>
track, all racing and trying to pass and it is the scariest thing <br/>
I've ever done, too, and I've done some other scary things, but it <br/>
was one heck of an adventure!  I didn't do hairpin curves in a <br/>
Corvette at 170 mph like PuddleSplasher, but let me tell you, going <br/>
about 130-150 mph in a real Nascar, dipping into the curve and coming <br/>
up at the wall at those speeds and trying to pass other cars while <br/>
you're doing it, well, it's a thrill!  If he'd like to drive for <br/>
himself, maybe you should check it out for him.  But you might want <br/>
to be sure his life insurance is all up-to-date first!  <br/>

&gt; Except for the throwing up part, that sounds pretty amazing!  <br/>
Totally not my<br/>
&gt; (snail-paced) speed though.  I too am thinking of doing that for my<br/>
&gt; husband.  I think he'd get a kick out of it, but he'd secretly be <br/>
annoyed<br/>
&gt; that he wasn't the one behind the wheel.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   Wow!  That sounds really fun - er, I think.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ever since you mentioned it several months ago, I've thought <br/>
about doing<br/>
&gt; &gt; that for my husband.  I wonder how we would feel about that!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   For those of you who were wondering how my racing adventure <br/>
went:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my race car ride at Texas Motor Speedway which my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; daughter gave me for Christmas last year. At the Speedway, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; outside track is the oval track used for the Nascar and Camel <br/>
style<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cars, and is raked at 30%. The infield track is completely <br/>
level and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has several severe curves including two hairpins, and believe <br/>
it or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not, the Corvettes they race on that track go faster than the <br/>
Nascars<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (so they said anyway). At any rate, this is the fastest I've <br/>
ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gone in an automobile: five laps at over 170 mph and hour.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; When you get the green flag, they floorboard it and you <br/>
immediately<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; feel the G's. I thought I was smiling, but then realized it was <br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the G-force pulling the skin on my face around to the back of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; head. A couple of times during the race, I had to reach up and <br/>
pull<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; my helmet back down over my forehead, and it was so tight when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; originally put it on, I thought it was going to mash my head <br/>
into a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; permanent oblong shape, but after a few curves, it was feeling <br/>
rather<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; loose. The scariest part was coming into the turns. I just had <br/>
to be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; completely trusting of my wild, slightly insane driver. We <br/>
would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going full speed up to the turns and slam on the brakes shift <br/>
down<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and sling around those hairpin curves on the inner track. When <br/>
we'd<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; arrive at a turn at the same time as another car, one driver <br/>
would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forced to the outer lane and the other would take the inner. <br/>
When<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we'd take the outer lane, we'd immediately line up right behind <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; other car... I mean right on his bumper at that high rate of <br/>
speed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Then my driver would always steal the lead back on the straight-<br/>
of-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; way. Un-be-lieve-a-ble! It was an absolutely incredible <br/>
experience,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but one I NEVER want to do again. I really wasn't scared, and <br/>
it was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a lot of fun, but after the race, I was in the bathroom <br/>
throwing up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 20 minutes later! At least I didn't get sick while I was in the <br/>
race<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; car.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think letterboxing, even when I'm climbing a mountain and my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; muscles are screaming, is much more my speed. At least, I'M in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; control.<br/>
