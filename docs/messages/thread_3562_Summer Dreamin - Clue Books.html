                    <html><body><div>Well since I promised clue books and this is one of those things I wait until the last minute to do so as to get any last minute boxes, when QueenBee asked me if I was indeed going to have clue books, I suddenly realized that the key to the place where the really good printer is was camping far, far away.  Okay, not so far away, but if I were to retrieve it, I would have to hike into deep woods to retrieve it - after dark - without a flashlight.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So being the diligent letterboxer that I am, off I drove to the far distant place (it really was well across town and in fact on the way to Palestine except well off the Palestine highway and so nowhere near Palestine really) knowing full well that I would soon be hiking in mosquito-infested, snake-filled woods overabundant with thorny-thingies in shorts (me in shorts, not the thorny-thingies).  During the whole trip on the way to P'stine but nowhere near P'stine at all, I was trying to decide if it might be worth it to write 20 clue books out by hand.  I decided it might not be, but I would have to decide after the dreaded hike.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so I arrived.  I was hoping Fearless Fox might have left his truck at the top of the hill, thus helping me to avoid The Hike, but he didn't - he drove it down into the jungle.  It was very dark.  I really, really wanted a flashlight.  I dug around in the trunk until I found - a battery-powered lantern!  YEA!  I could at least see the snakes before they struck my bare legs.  And off I went.  Deep into the dark, dark woods (the lantern only helped a little bit).  Far off into the woods I might add - but I really shouldn't because if Jim hasn't already been where I am talking about, he will someday and he will know I was exaggerating.  But it was a nice little jaunt.  And M-U-G-G-Y!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I eventually arrived at the part of the property in question where the Boy Scouts were camping and immediately four boys jumped up and insisted I take their seats.  I like Boy Scouts.  They are very polite - for those in the know, that would be the fifth point of the scout law.  For those not in the know, that would be Courteous.  Courteous is good in young people, don't you think?  So they insisted I sit down for awhile and so I swapped a story or two - listened to their adventures (building their own shelters to sleep in out of trees cut on the property by themselves) and eventually wandered off.  As I left, I remembered that I needed one of our chairs for tomorrow, so I mentioned to Fearless Fox that I needed a chair, so he pointed to the boy who was sitting in my chair and he  promptly jumped up, folded it up and carried it back up the mountainside to where I had parked for me.  Okay, it wasn't a mountainside, but it was up a good incline - it feels like a mountain when it's M-U-G-G-Y.  Did I mention that I like Boy Scouts because they are courteous?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, with key in hand, and careful not to drop it in the jungle, I followed the Boy Scout up the hillside to my car and drove straight to Fearless Fox's office where the good printer is.  And guess what - the whole purpose of writing this whole stinking email is to let those of you who are counting on clue books tomorrow know that I am sitting here killing time until they finish printing.<br clear="all"/>

<div>And PS - I think She Who Volunteers Me For Everything is going to be there tomorrow - and for the record, she is quite witty, at least to hear her tell it!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
