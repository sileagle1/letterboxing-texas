<br>
I just joined the group last weekend, and thought I'd better step in <br>
and say a quick hello! I'm also new to letterboxing... just found my <br>
first box last week! It was one of Silver Eagle's many... and I hope <br>
to find the time to hunt down many more.<br>
<br>
Not much input to give on the discussion of TX regions... I live in <br>
the panhandle and this area is pretty straight-forward. I do hunt for <br>
boxes by city and by region... never did it by county name because I <br>
might know my way well around TX, but not the counties. I think it <br>
all matters the most to those who live in the edges where you might <br>
be shifted from one region to another, so I think those should be <br>
heard the most.<br>
<br>
I'm a divorced mom to 2 boys, who are both still a bit young to enjoy <br>
the long hikes, but I'm always looking for the shorter, easier <br>
ones... especially for the summer, when the heat will make the longer <br>
hikes even harder to do. <br>
<br>
If I come up with any newbie questions, I will be sure to ask, but so <br>
far all the online sites have explained things well. And as for <br>
finding boxes... I think just plain experience will make things go <br>
easier for me. I have had several hunts that have resulted in DNF... <br>
but that just makes me more determined to go back and look again!<br>
<br>
Happy hunting and hiking!<br>

Looking forward to reports on my two boxes in your area.<br>
Now if we could just find somebody from West Texas, I think<br>
all the Texas Regions would be covered.  Welcome to the group!<br>

We are so happy to have you in our group!  <br>
<br>
Have you yet seen Jeff's (of Birds of a Feather)<br>
website for Texas boxers?  <br>
<br>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi<br>
<br>
It's an awesome site to post and search for boxes in<br>
Texas visually.<br>
<br>
We are pretty laid back in this group, so feel free to<br>
chime in with any contributions or questions you care<br>
to ask!<br>
<br>
Lucy<br>
