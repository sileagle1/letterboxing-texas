<br/>
I just joined the group last weekend, and thought I'd better step in <br/>
and say a quick hello! I'm also new to letterboxing... just found my <br/>
first box last week! It was one of Silver Eagle's many... and I hope <br/>
to find the time to hunt down many more.<br/>
<br/>
Not much input to give on the discussion of TX regions... I live in <br/>
the panhandle and this area is pretty straight-forward. I do hunt for <br/>
boxes by city and by region... never did it by county name because I <br/>
might know my way well around TX, but not the counties. I think it <br/>
all matters the most to those who live in the edges where you might <br/>
be shifted from one region to another, so I think those should be <br/>
heard the most.<br/>
<br/>
I'm a divorced mom to 2 boys, who are both still a bit young to enjoy <br/>
the long hikes, but I'm always looking for the shorter, easier <br/>
ones... especially for the summer, when the heat will make the longer <br/>
hikes even harder to do. <br/>
<br/>
If I come up with any newbie questions, I will be sure to ask, but so <br/>
far all the online sites have explained things well. And as for <br/>
finding boxes... I think just plain experience will make things go <br/>
easier for me. I have had several hunts that have resulted in DNF... <br/>
but that just makes me more determined to go back and look again!<br/>
<br/>
Happy hunting and hiking!<br/>

Looking forward to reports on my two boxes in your area.<br/>
Now if we could just find somebody from West Texas, I think<br/>
all the Texas Regions would be covered.  Welcome to the group!<br/>

We are so happy to have you in our group!  <br/>
<br/>
Have you yet seen Jeff's (of Birds of a Feather)<br/>
website for Texas boxers?  <br/>
<br/>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi<br/>
<br/>
It's an awesome site to post and search for boxes in<br/>
Texas visually.<br/>
<br/>
We are pretty laid back in this group, so feel free to<br/>
chime in with any contributions or questions you care<br/>
to ask!<br/>
<br/>
