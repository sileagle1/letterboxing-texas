                    <html><body><div>These past few evenings have been perfect early summer evenings here in Cherokee County.  I've found it very difficult to come inside for the day!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night I remembered that Blue Butterfly had planted a new box right here in my own county, so I herded Lightning up and got him in the car and off we headed to the cosmopolitan community of Troup, Texas.  I just love that drive from Jacksonville to Troup down Highway 135 - it reminds me why I came home to East Texas from San Diego.  Beautiful.  Just stunning.  Now bear in mind that we didn't leave the house until about 7:15, so we got the bonus view of the waning skies.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Poor ol' Lightning - he has his eye on a mini-bike so he's determined to work his 10 year old self into the ground this summer to buy it.  So he spent yesterday working for my mother-in-law, and I can tell you that she KNOWS how to work a kid!  Well he was tired, and every time I would exclaim about the astounding scenery, he would jump in his seat.  I finally realized I was waking him up over and over again.  Poor guy!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I finally got quiet and made my way to the site of BB's new box - Henry's Chapel.  I woke Lightning up to see if he wanted to stay in the car or go for the box, and he rolled one eye around at me and told me he wanted to stay - but being the good kid he is, he refrained from saying "Now I can finally sleep in peace for a little while!"  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Another cemetery box.  Now y'all know I'm not a huge supporter of cemetery boxes, but frankly, they are growing on me.  Nearly all that I've found have been well done, and I'm realizing that every cemetery I come to has a story of its own to tell.  This one was certainly no exception.  I think Henry's Chapel must be the neatest best kept old cemetery I've been to.  The graves are neatly aligned and they are all well-mowed and there were flowers on many of the graves, even the really old ones.  It isn't very big, but it IS very nice.  I happened to run across the grave of an old favorite teacher who must have passed away while I lived away from the area, so I took a moment to reflect on how he had affected my life, an especially touching moment since another such teacher passed away two days ago.  Isn't it odd how coincidences occur?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, I accidentally stumbled upon a benchmark in this cemetery - so if anyone collects benchmarks, take note that there is one at the site of this box.  I also noticed a large above ground entombment for a former legislator.  Very cool how old lawmakers are eventually tucked away in little country cemeteries, probably right back to the roots from whence they served.  A huge monument in the back corner of the cemetery caught my eye and I stored it in memory as I examined a very odd sight!  There was one long row of graves with concrete poured over the top of them to make grave covers, and on each cover was the imprint of mussel shells all over them.  One whole row, plus a couple graves adjacent to it, but not another single grave besides these had it!  They were from a span of at least 40 years, and by appearance there were several families involved.  Some of them also had headstones, others only had the name of the individual indented into the curb around the grave.  I asked BB what the story was and she doesn't know either - yet.  I also did some research today but couldn't find anything out.  Very odd.  Any of you cemetery buffs know what that's about?  I continued to wander on through the cemetery, checking out the very large monument, which turned out to be a reminder of a tragic death.  Very sad.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was quite a nice visit to this little cemetery, topped by a nice box too - as Blue Butterfly's always are!  Lightning didn't seem too disappointed that he missed it though.  He was still asleep when I got back to the car.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And in honor of a nice cemetery stroll and a beautiful evening, and the quickly fading light, I didn't backtrack home - I found my way crosscountry and explored some areas I haven't been to in years.  All in all, a very nice evening!

    Thanks for your kind words! I have several cemetery boxes because <br/>
of the history involved in them. I love digging through all the info <br/>
and seeing what I can find out about them. I did find out through a <br/>
friend of mine, that those graves with the shells on them are there <br/>
because the family had money and wanted their graves to be different. <br/>
The shells are just decorations. Her husband went to school at the <br/>
Sharp-Roofed school that was there. Even though he only went there one <br/>
year before it was closed, I find it very interesting that I actually <br/>
know someone who went to that school! <br/>
    I am glad you enjoyed the adventure and the box :)<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We visited a couple of really cool cemeteries over the weekend as <br/>
well.  You've got to visit TeamKing's letterbox "Crossroads of <br/>
Texas" at Hammond Colony cemetery near Hearne, not because of the <br/>
cemetery but because of the very famous person buried next to the <br/>
box, A person you would never guess.  The Mooreville Cemetery is <br/>
also lovely, on a hill overlooking farmland below in Mooreville. The <br/>
only letterbox in Falls County, "RIP", is there.  Lone Star Quilter <br/>
also placed a box in the "Old Georgetown" cemetery in Georgetown, <br/>
near the San Gabriel river.  Another memorable one, which also <br/>
happens to contain a letterbox, "Letter for a Son", placed by <br/>
TeamKing is the Old Masonic Cemetery in Chappell Hill, where Charles <br/>
Travis, son of William Travis, is buried.  Thanks, Lucy.<br/>
