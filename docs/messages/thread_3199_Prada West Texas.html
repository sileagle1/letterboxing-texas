                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are mirrors in the back corners of the "store", so you are <br>
likely just seeing a reflection of the open space across the street. <br>
I can assure you there are no doors on the back of the structure. The <br>
front door doesn't work either, it's essentially just another window <br>
into the display.<br>
     Astro D's first "Prada" box, was our first letterbox to find, <br>
and we picked up the new one on the day after Thanksgiving. It's a <br>
great stamp, and an interesting art piece.<br>
<br>
happy holidays all, gotta go study for finals now.<br>
