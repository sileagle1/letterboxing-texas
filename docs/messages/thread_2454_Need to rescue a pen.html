                    <html><body><div>I didn't tell the whole story about going BACK out to Maydelle to get PTK's box last night.  I left home about 4:20 yesterday afternoon to go BACK out to Maydelle to get it, knowing I had about an hour of good daylight, and a little more if I really pretended to be able to see.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I got BACK out to Maydelle, there were two cars sitting there and when I pulled up one left.  I figured the other would surely move on soon, but it didn't.  I finally got out and scaled down what I needed so I could carry the bare essentials in my hand without being too obvious (walking around with a backpack in this particular location just wouldn't have seemed right).  I started talking to a mysterious other party on my cell phone, all the while slipping closer and closer to where I thought the box was.  I knew I was in the right place (thought like a boxer) and glanced back - yep.  I was in full view of the other vehicle.  I paced the fence line for a bit, examined a few trees, talked away on my cell phone.  Kicked around a bit, and started picking up trash.  I managed to kick the box up and casually scoop it up with the rest of the trash in my hand (bearing in mind I had my stamping stuff in one hand, the phone in the other, and somewhere in between was a fistful of trash - and one letterbox).  I edged my way over to the furthest trash can and threw away all the trash and turned in such a way as to be able to shove the box up my shirt (there are days it is good not to be skinny) and I went and plopped down at a picnic table.  I finally managed to get stamped in and then only had to wait for them to leave.  And wait.  And wait.  And wait.  It was dark, and I was sitting at a picnic table all alone in the Neches River bottom.  With strangers in a car who refused to leave.  Now the Neches River bottom is kind of a scary place sometimes.  People live in the river bottom who don't ever go to town and don't have running water and don't like strangers.  Finally, I started talking on my phone again, and eased to my car and threw the box in my trunk and got in the car and left.  I drove down the road and turned around, and sure enough, they had left too!  Now what the heck was that and how rude was it to sit and wait until I had left to leave?   I mean really, couldn't he tell I was trying to be sneaky?  I went ahead and jumped out of my car and rehid the box and jumped back in and left - again.  And who should be returning but rude dude (okay, maybe he wasn't rude, but it sure felt like he was being inconsiderate - LOL).  What was going ON?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I left anyway because it was after dark and I was in a secluded place in the Neches River bottom.  But the more I got to thinking about it, I figured he was either 1) waiting to see what I was fiddling with out there in the back forty, or 2) he was a letterboxer.  I couldn't stand it.  I had to go back this morning and see if anyone had logged in.  SO - I made a THIRD trip to Maydelle this morning before I ever went to work!  Had anyone logged in?  Nope.  So what on earth was his DEAL???  Or maybe that WAS his deal - a deal.  Who knows.  Guess he wasn't a boxer though.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, back to the subject of my message - in the course of my trash collecting, I lost the cap from one of my markers.  Any ideas about how to salvage this pen?  It is, after all, one of the pens I used to color my personal stamp.  I kinda need it.  I thought about wrapping it in foil, but I can't help thinking there is an obvious solution to this problem.  And before someone suggests I go BACK out to Maydelle to look for it, I did that already!  At this rate, I'm gonna be elected mayor of Maydelle...

                    <html><body><div>I never get bored reading your posts. That just cracks me up. Before I give you my awesome, soon to be patented idea to rescue your pen, I have to tell you a little story:</div> <div> </div> <div>Christmas weekend, my DM, DD3, and I were going to our usual weekend Cracker Barrel breakfast. But this being the day after you know what, we had to be close to a Joann Fabrics. So, oh brilliant me decides to go to the CB near Grapevine Mills Mall (big mistake). We had at least a 20 minute wait. </div> <div> </div> <div>DM and DD3 went outside before me and to sit across from them I had to sit on the church bench (do they all have these?). We're chatting away. I'm wanting to smoke, but being the courteous one, I didn't (too close to the door). </div> <div> </div> <div>While chatting, this 'lady' comes and sits down next to me. Mind you there are at least 30 rockers all along the front of this building, over half are empty. She not only lights up a
 cigarette (right next to us), but she pulls out her cell phone and starts to talk really loudly on it. I got the 'you've got to be kidding me' look on my face and my DM just starts laughing.</div> <div> </div> <div>So, which one of you hid a letterbox at the CB in Grapevine, when did BL take up smoking, and why in the world would you be trying to find it on the 2nd busiest shopping day of the year.</div> <div> </div> <div>Of course, while I was flabbergasted at this Very Rude "lady", I was laughing at all the stories from you that float around in my head, popping out at whim.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks for the stories, now for my great idea:</div> <div> </div> <div>Take a latex glove, cut off a finger (please don't do this while the glove is on your hand) and use a rubberband, ponytail holder (with or without the baubles on it) and whallah, you now have a nifty, virtually cost-free, pen cap with 4 to spare.</div> <div> </div>
<div>Happy New Year,</div> <div> </div> <div>back from lurking,</div> <div>Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><img height="1" src="http://geo.yahoo.com/serv?s=97359714/grpId=11523462/grpspId=1705063107/msgId=8147/stime=1167880721/nc1=3848502/nc2=4025321/nc3=3848541" width="1"/> <br/><span></span> <!--End group email --></div><br/><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
