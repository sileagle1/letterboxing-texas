For those doing a head count of kids, mark my 9 year old daughter as one who does behave, but might pull a shy attack and rather hang with mom.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; keep the kids occupied while the adults do their<br/><br/>

&gt; &gt; very<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; good with kids. I wouldn't want to stick her with<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them the entire time, but she would enjoy<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; entertaining<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; well-behaved children at least part of the time.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; For the record, I have a 7 year old boy and a 16<br/><br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LBNA-Texas logo, <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could put it on the sign. Maybe it could be<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1st event stamp, or <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something uniquely Texas, or well the ideas<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; are<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; endless. If you <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like, I could come up with a few<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; examples,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or have all the <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kids big and small draw something, and bring<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; them<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the event. We <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could vote or have a drawing, or something.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; Also,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if we want to get <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more organized, I could come up with some<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; activites. Let me know <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what you think.<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Carie<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby Bear has already carved the Event stamp,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; but a<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LBTX logo<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a good idea. Maybe it could be put on the<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; top of<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Talklist. You and anyone else can come up with<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; examples and<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we can pick one at the Event. Also, if you want<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; organize <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other activities that would be great. The only<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem is <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we may have over 40 people in a place<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; designed<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for only 25,<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so not sure what to expect. I would like to<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time for <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various people to show their carving and<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logbook-making <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques and to just visit with everyone, but<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; hate<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put a timeline for everything. I guess we will<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start at 11:00<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by meeting, exchanging and eating, then<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; different<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; people can<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do different things. Some may prefer to go<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing in<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; groups or alone, others may want to do other<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; activities, so if <br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you have ideas for activities go ahead and<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; suggest<br/><br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them. <br/><br/>

Anything you feel like bringing would be appreciated.  I<br/>
personally would love to try your carne guisada &amp; tortillas!<br/>
There is supposedly electric outlets in the shelter if you<br/>
need to use a crock pot or something electrical to keep your<br/>
food warm.  Baby Bear is bringing an extension cord and I<br/>
will try to bring a multiplug, too.<br/>

Thanks for offering to put together some activities for kids. <br/>
<br/>
Our girls are 11, 9, and almost 7. <br/>
<br/>
They would enjoy the personal exchange stampin' frenzy, actual <br/>
hunting of boxes and just playing with the other kids.  If we give <br/>
them our two famous speeches, the ole' "be sure to include everyone" <br/>
and "be kind and considerate", they should behave :-)  I'm the type <br/>
who thinks this stuff always works out, no matter what I have planned.<br/>
