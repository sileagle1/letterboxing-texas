I would be willing to put together a few activities to<br>
keep the kids occupied while the adults do their<br>
thing, and I have a 16 year old daughter who is very<br>
good with kids.  I wouldn't want to stick her with<br>
them the entire time, but she would enjoy entertaining<br>
well-behaved children at least part of the time.<br>

For the record, I have a 7 year old boy and a 16 year<br>
old girl who will be attending.<br>

What food do we still need? Homeade bread or cornbread to go with the chili? If we need more of a main dish I can make a large pot of carne guisada and bring some tortillas. What about brownies? Speak to me oh planners of menus! <br>

For those doing a head count of kids, mark my 9 year old daughter as one who does behave, but might pull a shy attack and rather hang with mom.<br>

Anything you feel like bringing would be appreciated.  I<br>
personally would love to try your carne guisada & tortillas!<br>
There is supposedly electric outlets in the shelter if you<br>
need to use a crock pot or something electrical to keep your<br>
food warm.  Baby Bear is bringing an extension cord and I<br>
will try to bring a multiplug, too.<br>

Thanks for offering to put together some activities for kids. <br>
<br>
Our girls are 11, 9, and almost 7. <br>
<br>
They would enjoy the personal exchange stampin' frenzy, actual <br>
hunting of boxes and just playing with the other kids.  If we give <br>
them our two famous speeches, the ole' "be sure to include everyone" <br>
and "be kind and considerate", they should behave :-)  I'm the type <br>
who thinks this stuff always works out, no matter what I have planned.<br>
