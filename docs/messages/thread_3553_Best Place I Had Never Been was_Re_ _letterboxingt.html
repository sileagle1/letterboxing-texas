                    <html><body><div><strong>I LOVE THIS GROUP!!  Because of the great people involved here, I have learned so much about letterboxing and have gotten to see some really neat places in my area of South Texas.  </strong></div> <div><strong></strong> </div> <div><strong>A couple of months ago, Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter announced a new set of boxes they had placed between Seguin and Gonzales and I chose to take the "challenge."  We followed their trail of boxes and got to see the best state rest area EVER (I know that sounds a little silly, but, if you haven't searched out The Curse of the Courthouse Clock, it is definitely worth it).  As we continued on, we were transported to somewhere in the Florida Everglades as we entered the most unusual state park...Palmetto SP.  Being from San Antonio, I am used to pools, the riverwalk, and a few lakes...not swampland!!  Alligators,
 snapping turtles, and BIG snakes belong in the SA zoo, I've always said.  Imagine my surprise when I realized all of these live in harmony (?) at Palmetto!!  As we walked in search of our boxes ("Ram I Am" and "Palmetto: Quilt Block Series"), we got to see swamps,a really neat watering ram,  beautiful palmetto plants, a very large snake guarding a box I was after, and the kids swore they heard monkeys!!  This park was part of the CCC program, and was full of history and adventure.  So far, in all my months of letterboxing (haha), this is my favorite-and most unusual-letterbox hike.</strong></div> <div><strong></strong> </div> <div><strong>Texas Trailmix</strong></div> <div><br/><br/><b><i>janet clark &lt;jayceeinbedford@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div>Oh, that's easy for me.
