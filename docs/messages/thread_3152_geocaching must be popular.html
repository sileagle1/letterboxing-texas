                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't know much at all about how widespread geocaching is these  <br/>
days, but it must be everywhere.  We were out for a walk today and my  <br/>
son found some rocks stuffed in the hollow of where a tree branch had  <br/>
recently been cut off a large oak.  It was the oddest thing to see  <br/>
these very white rocks sitting in this hole.  He asked if he could  <br/>
pull the rocks out to see if something was hidden there.  We weren't  <br/>
letterboxing at the time, and the hollow was obviously too small to  <br/>
hide a box of any kind, so I said "sure."  I was kind of curious,  <br/>
myself.   Well, just as we are fishing out the last rock, a man comes  <br/>
jogging by and says, "You must be geocaching!"  I was speechless!  If  <br/>
he had said, "You must be letterboxing", I would have fainted dead  <br/>
away.   Geocaching must be popular!<br/>
