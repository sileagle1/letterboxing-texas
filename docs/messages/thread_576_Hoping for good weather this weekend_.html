before we get started placing our own....You can't place a box in <br/>
National parks? Where else can you not place a box? Where do I find <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You can place boxes in National Forests, but not in<br/>
National Parks.  Go figure.<br/>
<br/>
There are some rules on the letterboxing.org FAQ page.<br/>
 Go down under Etiquette, Conventions, and Rules and<br/>
click on "Are there any rules?".  That's a pretty good<br/>
start - those rules, plus the National Parks one.  I'm<br/>
sure others will chime in with rules not found on the<br/>
FAQ page, but there are actually very few rules that<br/>
courtesy, conservationism, and common sense won't<br/>
guide you through.  <br/>
<br/>
Don't worry about the rules - they aren't terribly<br/>
daunting.  Just remember about National Parks - and<br/>
actually, there are ways around even that one, and<br/>
possibly some folks will tell you how.  As for me, I<br/>
will regretfully stick to that one too, in hopes that<br/>
good behavior on our part will eventually lead the<br/>
powers that be to reconsider their ruling.<br/>

day at Roswell (sci-fi freaks they are) and went on to<br/>
Carlsbad Nat'l Park where they were watching the<br/>
sunset and looking across the border at the mountain. <br/>
They were reluctantly getting ready to head back to<br/>
wherever they are camping.  Over the next two days,<br/>
they plan on climbing Guadalupe and going down into<br/>
Carlsbad Caverns, among other things.  <br/>
<br/>
Baby Bear, when I talked to them, I told them you have<br/>
a box in the vicinity and they plan to grab it while<br/>
they are there.  Unfortunately, they didn't take their<br/>
stamps or a logbook, but my daughter is writing a<br/>
journal so she'll stamp into it and they'll draw<br/>
something to record their visit, if that's okay.  I<br/>
got a kick out of my husband, who is always willing to<br/>
go letterboxing, but doesn't ever suggest it.  I told<br/>
him Baby Bear had planted a box there, and he turned<br/>
to our daughter and told her "Baby Bear planted a box<br/>
and we have to get it!"  Now see, he was at the<br/>
gathering last year, but he hid out in our campsite<br/>
the whole time.  When I talked to my daughter, I asked<br/>
her if she thought he had any idea who Baby Bear is. <br/>
Turns out he does, but only from your stamps.  We're<br/>
gonna get him hooked yet!<br/>
<br/>
I had a terrible time being indoors at my desk today -<br/>
it was absolutely gorgeous in East Texas!  I'm off<br/>
work tomorrow and my son and I are going to hit the<br/>
trails!<br/>

<blockquote><tt>I just got off the phone with them.  They spent the<br/>day at Roswell (sci-fi freaks they are) and went on to<br/>Carlsbad Nat'l Park where they were watching the<br/>sunset and looking across the border at the mountain. <br/>They were reluctantly getting ready to head back to<br/>wherever they are camping.  Over the next two days,<br/>they plan on climbing Guadalupe and going down into<br/>Carlsbad Caverns, among other things.  <br/><br/>Baby Bear, when I talked to them, I told them you have<br/>a box in the vicinity and they plan to grab it while<br/>they are there.  Unfortunately, they didn't take their<br/>stamps or a logbook, but my daughter is writing a<br/>journal so she'll stamp into it and they'll draw<br/>something to record their visit, if that's okay.  I<br/>got a kick out of my husband, who is always willing to<br/>go letterboxing, but doesn't ever suggest
 it.  I told<br/>him Baby Bear had planted a box there, and he turned<br/>to our daughter and told her "Baby Bear planted a box<br/>and we have to get it!"  Now see, he was at the<br/>gathering last year, but he hid out in our campsite<br/>the whole time.  When I talked to my daughter, I asked<br/>her if she thought he had any idea who Baby Bear is. <br/>Turns out he does, but only from your stamps.  We're<br/>gonna get him hooked yet!<br/><br/>I had a terrible time being indoors at my desk today -<br/>it was absolutely gorgeous in East Texas!  I'm off<br/>work tomorrow and my son and I are going to hit the<br/>trails!<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/>(who is counting the days until March!)<br/><br/>--- BabyBear &lt;babybearlb2002@yahoo.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/>&gt; I did it over the Thanksgiving holiday.   Great<br/>&gt; hike.  Had to work around some ice on the shaded<br/>&gt; side of the mountain, but well worth the adventure. <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; PS - Plus
 you can snag the "Top of Texas".   <br/>&gt;  <br/>&gt; Baby Bear<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Cindy Harland &lt;harland@pnx.com&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; That hike is an awesome trip.<br/>&gt; Actually, thinking back on<br/>&gt; it, it is a CLIMB!

were out on a trek of our own all day today, and<br/>
somehow I missed hearing my cell phone, so I had a<br/>
message on my voice mail asking me if I remembered the<br/>
clues - yeah right!  Like THAT'S gonna happen! <br/>
Apparently they left the clues behind when they<br/>
started their hike.  They are planning on spending the<br/>
night on the trail tonight, so hopefully I'll be able<br/>
to reach them and give them again.  It'd really be a<br/>
bummer if they don't get to find it!  <br/>
<br/>
We are planning on returning out there in May or so,<br/>
so if nothing else, we'll all find it together then.<br/>

&gt; I hope they do find it!  My wife is also a closet<br/>
&gt; letterboxer.   She enjoys the hiking, and the great<br/>
&gt; places letterboxing has taken us to that we would<br/>
&gt; not have know about, but she is not driven like I am<br/>
&gt; to find and place boxes.  Oh well, I don't like<br/>
&gt; shopping, so I guess we are even.   Have a great<br/>
&gt; weekend!<br/>
