                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got back from a ski trip in New Mexico and found a<br/>
little time to letterbox along the way.  In Waco I found<br/>
Don't Mess With Texas but could not go to Cameron Park<br/>
to find Liberty Bell because of a bike race.  Does anybody<br/>
know the status of Liberty Bell LB?  I then went to Dallas<br/>
area and found Halloween and confirmed Spider's Lair is<br/>
still intact.  I placed George Strait in Amarillo before <br/>
heading to Red River, NM to ski for 3 days.  We headed south<br/>
through Taos where I placed Kit Carson and then to Santa Fe<br/>
where I found several boxes and placed Santa Fe Trail.  We<br/>
then headed to Fort Sumner and the grave of Billy The Kid<br/>
where I placed Billy The Kid.  Next stop was Lubbock where<br/>
I was unsuccessful finding That'll Be The Day but placed<br/>
Buddy Holly near his statue.  Abilene SP was next where<br/>
I was first finder of Caleb and placed Buffalo Gap.  The<br/>
final stops before getting home were San Gabriel in Georgetown<br/>
and Chisholm Trail in Round Rock.  It was a fun trip but<br/>
I am glad to be home after all that driving.  Looks like<br/>
several new Texas letterboxes have been placed while I was<br/>
gone.  Good job!<br/>

wood was there but not in place. Recently the kids and I ran by <br/>
there to just see if it had been replaced or magically reappered and <br/>
now log is gone - still no box..<br/>
