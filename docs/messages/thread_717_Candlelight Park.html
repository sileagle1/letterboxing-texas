temporarily pulled. The box is fine, it's just that<br/>
the tree that it was hidden in now has a great big<br/>
orange "X" on it -- marking it for removal by the<br/>
City. I'm glad I was able to nab the box before the<br/>
tree came down.<br/>
<br/>
We had a tornado go through this area on December 24,<br/>
2002, and it took the tops off of many trees. The tree<br/>
I hid the box in was one of these trees. A lady in the<br/>
park said that 56 trees were to be removed due to the<br/>
tornado damage. :(<br/>
<br/>
I will be replacing this box in the same park, or<br/>
nearby, as soon as I find a suitable place and the<br/>
City of Houston is finished with all the removals.<br/>
