and I decided to head East to The Red River Revel to check out the Arts<br/>
and Crafts and do a little letterboxing. The series The Boxalots have<br/>
on the campus were fun! I did get stopped by a security guard in a<br/>
vehicle asking if I needed help. He was very nice and helped me with<br/>
directions to the Jack London statue. There was a box located near this<br/>
statue, but it was missing. We searched and searched to no avail. We<br/>
decided to head to another building across campus to look for the<br/>
Centenary Swimming Box. As we approached the location, I was looking<br/>
hoping to see the spot where the box was suppose to be. I wasn"t<br/>
having much luck when PSGuru said "what about that box?" I looked and<br/>
there in a small tree was a letterbox just hanging on a bare limb! The<br/>
tree was close to the sidewalk,I grabbed it and was very surprised that<br/>
it was the Jack London Box! It was in plan sight and I was amazed that<br/>
it was still there. I stamped in the box and re-hide it where it was<br/>
suppose to be. I only stamped in 2 of the five boxes but, decided this<br/>
one was for the history books! For more info and a great history<br/>
lesson, read the clue for Forward, Forward Centenary Series. Thanks to<br/>
The Boxalots for planting this series.<br/>
