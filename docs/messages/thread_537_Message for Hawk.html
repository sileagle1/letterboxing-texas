Hawk:  Your micobox named "Quack" located in Bay Area Park is missing <br/>
its top.  Unfortuanately, we didn't have another top to replace the <br/>
missing one. (Will carry a few extra empty microboxes in the truck <br/>
from now on).  Your microbox was about ten feet from where it should <br/>
have been and was laying in the leaves.  We had a heck of a time <br/>
finding it, but were finally successful.  An extensive search of the <br/>
eara did not produce the missing top.  We live only  about five miles <br/>
from the park, so do you want me to replce it, or will you be going <br/>
out there to do it yourself?  Let me know so we can take care of it <br/>
before it gets too wet.<br/>

If you would be so kind as to replace the top, or a<br/>
complete new cannister (sometimes tops only seem to<br/>
seal on the original cannister). I live way north of<br/>
Quack!, so won't be able to replace the cannister for<br/>
a long time.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you again for the update and the offer of help.<br/>
It sounds like maybe a duck got ahold of it! Who<br/>
knows????<br/>

--- Dear Hawk.  Your box has been fixed.  No problems.  Everything <br/>
was dry and secure.  Hope to see you at Brazos Bend State Park in <br/>
March. Weather permitting, we'll be camping there over the weekend.  <br/>
Looking forward to meeting everyone.<br/>

I plan to be at Brazos Bend, but probably will drive<br/>
down for the day. I want to be there early enough for<br/>
coffee and stay late enough to sit around a campfire!<br/>
