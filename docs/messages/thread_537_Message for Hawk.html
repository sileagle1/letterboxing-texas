Hawk:  Your micobox named "Quack" located in Bay Area Park is missing <br>
its top.  Unfortuanately, we didn't have another top to replace the <br>
missing one. (Will carry a few extra empty microboxes in the truck <br>
from now on).  Your microbox was about ten feet from where it should <br>
have been and was laying in the leaves.  We had a heck of a time <br>
finding it, but were finally successful.  An extensive search of the <br>
eara did not produce the missing top.  We live only  about five miles <br>
from the park, so do you want me to replce it, or will you be going <br>
out there to do it yourself?  Let me know so we can take care of it <br>
before it gets too wet.<br>

If you would be so kind as to replace the top, or a<br>
complete new cannister (sometimes tops only seem to<br>
seal on the original cannister). I live way north of<br>
Quack!, so won't be able to replace the cannister for<br>
a long time.<br>
<br>
Thank you again for the update and the offer of help.<br>
It sounds like maybe a duck got ahold of it! Who<br>
knows????<br>

--- Dear Hawk.  Your box has been fixed.  No problems.  Everything <br>
was dry and secure.  Hope to see you at Brazos Bend State Park in <br>
March. Weather permitting, we'll be camping there over the weekend.  <br>
Looking forward to meeting everyone.<br>

Warm Regards,<br>

I plan to be at Brazos Bend, but probably will drive<br>
down for the day. I want to be there early enough for<br>
coffee and stay late enough to sit around a campfire!<br>
