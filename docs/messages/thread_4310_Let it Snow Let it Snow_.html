<br/>
Call from my son says maybe 1-5 and he know everyone in his subdivision except HIM is going to be excited!<br/>
<br/>
His wife is riding home in a brand new car and we are keeping our prayers going for all of you!  <br/>
<br/>
Get those cameras ready and please don't send any of them to your Yankee friends up north...we already have seen snow!  Enjoy.<br/>
