                    <div class="plaintext-content">i've been chatting with Urban Letterboxer, who has the red-eared <br/>
slider planted @ UTA.  apparently, UL's last contact here in the <br/>
metroplex is gone, and they're in need of someone else to take care of <br/>
this poor, lonely stamp.  i don't mind doing it, but i just wanted to <br/>
see if anyone else (who lives closer than the 50 miles it takes me to <br/>
get there) would find it more convenient for them to take this box on <br/>
as one of their own.  it's a cute stamp on a really neat campus, and <br/>
it even has its own criminal record--as is mentioned in the clues.  <br/>
catch me here or off-line, por favor--thanks!<br/>
<br/>
and while i'm at it:<br/>
baby bear, if people are already assuming the worst when you and SE <br/>
step out of the woods together, wouldn't you be compounding the <br/>
problem--at least in the eyes of those other people--by advertising <br/>
that he's your brother?  yikes.<br/>
