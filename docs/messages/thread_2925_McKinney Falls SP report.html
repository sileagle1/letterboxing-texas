the policy regarding letterboxes:<br>
<br>
"Attached is the policy/procedure regarding this type of activity. <br>
You are welcome to make an application and contact us to schedule an <br>
appointment for a site visit with either myself or Assistant Park <br>
Superintendent Janie Reeh to discuss the provisions of the policy <br>
and to assess site placement. An application will not be approved <br>
without a site visit. Approval of your application will depend upon <br>
many factors including the policy in it's entirity and availability <br>
of other 'caches' or similar activities in the general area. Permits <br>
must be renewed annually and will require scheduled quarterly <br>
maintenance during the permit period.<br>
 <br>
Sincerely,<br>
David Shirley, Park Superintendent<br>
McKinney Falls State Park<br>

So, I guess we won't place any letterboxes in that park.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What a shame that the policy requires you to visit quarterly and <br>
renew every year.  I wouldn't have as much problem filling out a <br>
permit if I only had to do it once.  This procedure pretty much <br>
limits placements to people that live close enough to visit 4 times a <br>
year.  If I can figure out the correct person to talk with, I would <br>
like to express my views.  Just talking with the Rangers will not <br>
change the policy.  Thanks for letting us know, Boots.<br>
