the box back where it should have been.  Today we got a report from <br/>

&gt; &gt; respectful of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; nearby letterboxes and I think they've had a positive impact on<br/>
&gt; &gt; area<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; All of this is to say that it sounds like we may have an<br/>
&gt; &gt; individual problem<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; going on in this area (not taking into account the Cedar Hill <br/>
box<br/>
&gt; &gt; of LSQ's),<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LSQ has had reports of the stamps missing from two of her <br/>
boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; One<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; report was that her box at Rusk Railroad Park called <br/>
Underground<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Railroad was found lying on a bench with no stamp. The finder<br/>
&gt; &gt; placed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the box back where it should have been. Today we got a report<br/>
&gt; &gt; from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some letterboxers from San Diego, Cal. that they found her box<br/>
&gt; &gt; at Cedar<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hill State Park, but that the stamp was missing. All they <br/>
found<br/>
&gt; &gt; in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box were two small shells and the logbook (geocachers?).<br/>

my Murder at the Arboretum boxes and I noticed that, in all seven <br/>
boxes, the individual baggies that I put the stamps and logbook in <br/>

someone was collecting all the small bags for some reason, or just <br/>

the small bags.<br/>

&gt; We checked on two of our boxes yesterday and found both lying <br/>
uncovered.  While we were there we checked on a friends box and found <br/>
it uncovered as well.  Much worse, his box had the baggies open, <br/>
potentially leaving the logbook exposed to the weather.  I have noted <br/>
this (boxes laying exposed or not hidden) on several of our recent <br/>
finds.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   This may require a self-evaluation of our letterboxing <br/>

enjoy finding letterboxes, make sure you leave them in a condition so <br/>
others might enjoy them as well.  <br/>

<p> </p>
<p>You are right that weather and storms can be a factor in displacing boxes, and hopefully planters keep that in mind when placing a box.<span>  </span>That's one reason why Puddle Splasher carries a rock with her to put on top of her newly planted boxes.<span>  </span>It's always a good idea to consider how water will flow through a given area when placing a box, so that you can know if it is in the path of run-off.<span>  </span>We sure learned that lesson last Spring with the 100 year deluge!<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<div><span>Given the type of damage sustained by my two boxes here in Jacksonville and the locations they were planted in, I don't think the recent rains were a factor (in fact, I think they were both pre-rain, now that I think about it).<span>  </span>I don't think the rains would have affected LSQ's Underground Railroad or JBK's Treasure at </span><span>Carey</span><span> </span><span>Lake</span><span> either.<span>  Not sure about the others...</span></span></div>
<div><span><span></span></span> </div>
<div><span><span>Exposure is a problem that seems to run in spells - although this spate is apparently an odd one in that there are missing pieces out of boxes.  Boxes being left exposed or not hidden well is the bane of a planter's world, and this is the one point that this list always tries to stress to new boxers - the best way for a new boxer to be considered a treasure in the letterboxing community is to rehide well and to let placers know when something needs to be done for a box (or to let them know you took care of it already).  Most newbies get that idea and graciously do everything they can to abide by that.  </span></span></div>
<div><span><span></span></span> </div>
<div><span><span>By addressing the poor rehiding issue amongst ourselves and reminding ourselves to be diligent, we minimize the exposure issues to only being the ones caused by weather and forces of nature and sometimes, just plain bad luck.</span></span></div>

<div>Okay, that's wierd. Last week when Viewfinder and I went back to Bastrop to find the boxes there, she found my Texas: What's Not to Love box which had only been planted one month ago. When she opened it, she asked why it didn't have any plastic bags in my box. NONE. I always use three bags in each box: heavy freezer Ziplock quart size bags. One each for the stamp and logbook and one to hold the other two. I also used Lock N Lock boxes, because it has been my experience that combination will work well to protect the stamp and logbook. ALL THREE bags were simply gone, and the logbook and stamp had just been tossed back inside the box. That was totally surprising, as if someone had wanted the plastic bags and took them. Yes, I can see someone not remembering to replace all three bags and getting home with an extra one in their backpack and wondering where it came from, but all THREE? I doubt it. I label the bags with magic marker too, so they would have known that they belonged in my box. Luckily, VF had an extra bag in her backpack so we we at least able to protect the logbook with a new one. It just sent a message to me that someone didn't have any respect for the effort I put into my letterbox. I was just left shaking my head. Very odd.</div>

<div>One of my boxes (Lock n Lock) that survived being totally underwater for weeks during last Spring's flood had water inside when the first finder got to it after the water subsided, so it obviously did leak. She said it was a testimony for using good baggies inside because although the inside of the box had water inside, the logbook and stamp were completely dry and safe because the last finder had taken the time to reseal the baggies well. When I checked on those boxes, there was scummy residue inside from the flood water, but she was right, the logbooks and stamps were totally fine. She also told me that the rocks I had on top of the boxes were still in place. (The only reason those boxes survived and didn't wash away was because I had good sized rocks on top of them holding them in place.) After her report, the boxes were reported as having been found a few more times before I had a chance to check on them, and by that time someone must have thought it was too much trouble to replace the rocks because I found them laying nearby. Silver Eagle is right. We are preaching to the choir on this list, but hopefully letterboxers will just slow down and take the time to rehide boxes just as they found them and they will have a chance of lasting a much longer time. I guess if we are given the opportunity to "mentor" a new letterboxer, we should drive home the point of taking care of those little treasures so they'll be around for future boxers.</div>

<p><span>well i have been having a lot of boxes go missing as
well..some of <br/>
them that have been missing are because of areas that were wooded <br/>

just got two more emails today about two of my boxes, one of which <br/>
the box was there but the stamp and logbook were missing...i spent <br/>
most of the day saturday replacing/checking on boxes that were <br/>
reported missing, and now have two more to check..oh well, i do <br/>
appreciate the updates from those who have reported them missing.<br/>

&gt; Eesh...this really disturbs me! Jim found my Flying Again box <br/>
open and<br/>
&gt; exposed recently and someone else found Spring Hope in a similar <br/>
condition<br/>
&gt; recently. The stamps were in place though. I've had some <br/>
concerns of a<br/>
&gt; recurrence of a past problem, but nothing to go on yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We seem to have really good geocachers in this area - my geocacher <br/>
friend,<br/>
&gt; Pearle, and his caching buddy, Fire2Water, are the two most <br/>
prevalent<br/>
&gt; placers around here and both are well aware of letterboxing and <br/>
how it<br/>
&gt; works. They are very good about posting in their clues to be <br/>
respectful of<br/>
&gt; nearby letterboxes and I think they've had a positive impact on <br/>
area<br/>
&gt; geocachers because they've demonstrated they can respect <br/>
letterboxes even if<br/>
&gt; they don't participate (and Fire2Water does letterbox some). <br/>
Pearle and I<br/>
&gt; seem to have a knack for finding the same spots and we've had <br/>
several<br/>
&gt; stashes in close proximity for approaching 2 years.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All of this is to say that it sounds like we may have an <br/>
individual problem<br/>
&gt; going on in this area (not taking into account the Cedar Hill box <br/>
of LSQ's),<br/>
&gt; whether it is a careless letterboxer or a geocacher-gone-<wbr/>rampant.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; BT, I'll look up dates on my problems and if you can look up the <br/>
dates of<br/>
&gt; your reports, maybe we can do a little comparison and see if we <br/>
see anything<br/>
&gt; jump out at us. I'll also email Pearle and see if he knows of any <br/>
problems<br/>
&gt; going on in their world.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Has anyone been missing stamps from their boxes? In the last <br/>
few days<br/>
&gt; &gt; LSQ has had reports of the stamps missing from two of her boxes. <br/>
One<br/>
&gt; &gt; report was that her box at <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Rusk</st1:placename>
<st1:placename w:st="on">Railroad</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>
called Underground<br/>
&gt; &gt; Railroad was found lying on a bench with no stamp. The finder <br/>
placed<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box back where it should have been. Today we got a report <br/>
from<br/>
&gt; &gt; some letterboxers from <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:city w:st="on">San
  Diego</st1:city>, <st1:state w:st="on">Cal.</st1:state></st1:place> that they
found her box <br/>
at Cedar<br/>
&gt; &gt; <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placetype w:st="on">Hill</st1:placetype> <st1:placetype w:st="on">State Park</st1:placetype></st1:place>, but that the stamp was
missing. All they found <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box were two small shells and the logbook (geocachers?<wbr/>).<br/>

<div>I have many more boxers who find my boxes and stamp them, than those who actually log their finds on AQ or LBNA. You just can't go by the last person who logged their find and assume they are responsible. It always amazes me when I've only had about 8 people notify me that they've found my boxes, but suddenly someone tells me the logbook is almost full (I usually put about 36 pages in my local logbooks and more in ones that I have to travel a long distance to get to). When I actually check the logbook, I find that there are many stamps from people I've never heard of before. That actually makes it fun to check those logbooks and see who all has actually visited the box. My point is, don't ever assume if you were the last person listed to find a box, that you are responsible. There were probably several people who visited it after you who just don't log their finds. Those are generally the people who are unaware of the importance of taking good care of the boxes.</div>

well. Someone as into the game as you seem to be wouldn't do <br/>something like that. I hope the boxes aren't compromised, however <br/>unlikely that may be. The area can be busy at times. It seems funny <br/>that all three were disturbed in a similar manner. I don't buy the <br/>
rain thing and it seems too much of a coincidence for a non-<br/>letterboxer to have found all three. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Have I mentioned that I'm a big fan of conspiracy theories. <br/>Might be just paranoia setting in. I've been spending too much time <br/>
working on the psych ward. Or maybe its all the pharmaceuticals in <br/>the tap water.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Jim <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Connie Warner &lt;cwenter1@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; Jim,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; It looks like I was the last boxer to find and record your Brushy <br/>
Creek Series, as well as the 3rd box in the same area, and I know <br/>that I resealed the baggies and recovered the boxes well with forest <br/>debris. I had another boxer with me who also logged in the logbooks <br/>but she didn't have a stamp of her own.<br/>
