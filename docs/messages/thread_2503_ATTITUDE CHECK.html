                    <html><body><div>Dear List Friends,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I SAY "friends" I MEAN "friends", but sometimes friends disagree.  At the moment, I find myself feeling distinctly at odds with this group, you, my friends.  I've said it - now you know. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've always felt a lot of pride in being associated with folks who can come together from many walks of life and varied personal situations under the umbrella of a pleasant pasttime and get along as harmoniously as we always have.  We have been able to discuss potentially touchy topics honestly and with respect for one another.  We were able to allow a wide latitude of topics, often topics that weren't strictly letterboxing.  That's because friends talk to one another about a variety of things.  I'm not sure at what exact point things changed, but they have.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is not in response to one person, one post, one note.  It is in response to an undercurrent that has been barely beneath the surface and causing tension, but things need to either get resolved or get settled down.  If you are reading my words and wondering what on earth I'm talking about, good.  You probably aren't involved, but you may want to read on anyway.  If you are reading my words and you are squirming a little wondering if I am talking to you, good.  You probably are involved, and you definitely want to read on.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want you to ask some rhetorical questions of yourself: </div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) Do I have a problem with any one person, or any group of people on this list?  What can I do to resolve that problem?</div>
<div>2) Am I posting with that problem in mind - i.e. picking with a purpose?  If I am, I will STOP.</div>
<div>3) Am I SURE I am reading messages with the intent behind them?  If I read messages out loud and smile while I read them, do they sound differently than they did in my head?</div>
<div>5) Do I want to be a part of the problem or a part of the solution?</div>
<div>6) Have I engaged in actions that have contributed to the problem instead of mitigating it?</div>
<div>7) In the grand scheme of things, are my issues or concerns things that should REALLY be taken seriously?  (sometimes they are, and I don't discount that).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We all make mistakes and I am certainly no exception.  I've wished I had handled some things relating to the recent tensions on this list better than I did.  I don't feel a need to detail my downfalls, but I do apologize to the list for them, and I promise to do better.  I want each of you to look to yourselves and do the same. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let me just say that I am considering my next move both personally and as List Mom.  I letterbox for pleasure, not for the opportunity to referee - I got all of that that I could love in soccer. It is simply time to get things resolved, and yet I find myself at wits' end.  If anyone has thoughts about how we can get happy again, by all means speak now.  Be part of the solution. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I fully expect I have made some of you mad with this post.  That wasn't my intent, but if it is the case, so be it.  But if I did, let me ask you this - what are you going to do about it?  You can be mad at me, but I still want to know - Are you going to be a part of the problem or a part of the solution?  For myself, I hope we are good enough friends that we will be able to get past the mad part.  And I sure hope you will choose to be part of the solution.  I mean that.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It saddens me that BL had to post this message, because it means <br/>
there are still problems that need to be resolved.  I think Lucy <br/>
feels it the most because many people expect her to resolve all the <br/>
problems herself since she is co-owner of the list.  Well guess what <br/>
folks, that's not her job.  If you have a problem with someone or <br/>
don't like what someone posts, talk with them privately and try to <br/>
resolve it yourself.  If that doesn't work, then just ignore them.  <br/>
Now if things escalate too far, BL and I will step in and try to <br/>
resolve the issue, but we would rather not have to.  I know on a list <br/>
this size there are bound to be a few people that don't get along, so <br/>
try to resolve issues with fellow letterboxers the same way you would <br/>
with co-workers or family, and I don't mean yelling :)<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line, BL is your letterboxing friend, not your Mother, so <br/>
please give her a break by following a few guidelines:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Be respectful of others, even when disagreeing<br/>
2.  If you disagree with an opinion, state yours in a non-offensive <br/>
manner and don't keep bringing it back up in the future<br/>
3.  Remember, letterboxing is supposed to be fun, not cause stress, <br/>
so if this list get to be too much, take a break from it for awhile<br/>
