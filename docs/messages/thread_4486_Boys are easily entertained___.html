                    <html><body><p>I had to drop Draconis viridis off at one of my f-i-l's properties to mow this morning and I decided it was just too nice to go back home. I was out and about pricing gardening stuff, when Dv called and needed some tools to work on the lawnmower. I took him some tools and a can of WD-40 (is it possible to fix something without at least having some WD-40 on hand in case you need it?). As I was leaving him behind, I looked in the rear view mirror to see him squatted down by the mower - a crescent wrench in one hand and the WD-40 in the other, with an oddly transfixed expression on his face - as though his whole young life was about to begin in earnest as he had tools, a malfunctioning piece of equipment, and no one to tell him what to do. I kept on driving.<br clear="all"/>
<br/>As I was about to go out on my second round of missions, to include stopping and checking on him, he called and said he had run out of gas. I guess that means he mastered the mower.<br/><br/>See how easy it is to entertain a boy?<br/>
