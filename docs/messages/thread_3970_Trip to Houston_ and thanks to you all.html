<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">My husband, Whiz Gee, and I went on a grand 
letter-boxing spree in Houston last Thursday through Sunday, finding 62 boxes, 
mostly in three parks -- Mercer Arboretum, Memorial Park, and Telge Park.  
Houston has an embarrassment of letterboxing riches!  I know the folks from 
Houston have been telling us about it, but seeing the destruction from Hurricane 
Ike up close and personal is overwhelming at times.  I remember one clue 
reading "Look for the fallen tree", and we were staring at a sea of fallen 
trees.  I wasn't prepared for how much rescue efforts would have been 
welcome on these boxes.  A fair number of boxes in Mercer 
Arboretum were resting out in the open, and though they had floated up in 
rising waters, and then settled back down on top of the debris.  We tucked 
those back into hiding places.  We only found one "hanging" box on the 
ground near a tree, and we hung it back up where it belonged.  I'm 
surprised more weren't blown to Louisiana.  I emailed dewberry that one 
tree in Memorial Park where her box had been tucked into roots, was now on it's 
side with the box still in the roots, but dangling up in the air!  We 
tucked it out of sight.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Most of the logbooks we found were damp.  
I have been saving any large silica pillows I've come across, and I tucked those 
into baggies of damp logbooks to help dry them out.  But, I didn't bring 
nearly enough silica, and I only brought two logbooks to replace soggy ones 
with; so by the middle of the trip we were really feeling guilty that we 
couldn't help out more boxes.  Actually, there were very few boxes we 
couldn't find, some just took more effort at hacking in and around debris than 
others.  At Telge Park, we found the bottom half of a small round 
Lock-and-Lock that had been artfully painted in camouflage colors.  If you 
recognize that as your box, we can confirm that its contents are missing.  
</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We did stop in at Texas Art Supply on Montrose, and 
gleefully bought ink pads, bottles of re-inkers, and carving tools that I've 
never seen anywhere else.   What a treasure!  </font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">So, I hope that more letterboxers make a trip to 
Houston, to find the myriads of boxes, and to help out with Hurricane 
Relief.  Bring lots of Hurricane Relief supplies when you 
come.</font></div>
