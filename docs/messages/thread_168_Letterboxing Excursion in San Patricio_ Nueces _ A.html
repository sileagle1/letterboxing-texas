                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yesterday, Corazon, Calico Rose and I got an early start on a day of <br/>
letterboxing. <br/>
 We went to Lake Corpus Christi first to search for Baby Bear's <br/>
MUSIC MAN. Holding back a branch of a thorn bush, I got stung on the <br/>
finger by some kind of wasp. It was extremely painful, but <br/>
fortunately I had Benedryl Spray in the van which helped. <br/>
Unfortunately the box had been vandalized and everything was missing <br/>
except the box, in one spot, and the lid, in another. We replaced <br/>
the book and signed in, hiding the box back in the place it should <br/>
have been. <br/>
<br/>
 From there we went to the City of Corpus Christi Wildlife and Bird <br/>
Sanctuary where we found Baby Bear's LIGHT CATCHER, in great shape. <br/>
We were surprised by two men and three boys coming up the trail from <br/>
fishing just as the box was re-hidden, but they didn't see <br/>
anything 'letterboxy'. We talked awhile and admired their fish <br/>
before they headed on toward the parking area. As we came out a few <br/>
minutes later they were still loading things up and asked us if we <br/>
were bird watchers or what we were doing out there. I told them I <br/>
was studying the plants, wildflowers and trees, with an eye to their <br/>
proliferation and a change in the varieties and habitat, etc. and <br/>
brought my two friends with me that day....which was true, <br/>
but... ;)  <br/>
<br/>
 Then we drove into Corpus Christi and had lunch before going out to <br/>
Mustang Island State Park where we found Baby Bear's CORAL SNAKE <br/>
alive and well. I had two dolls along with me for a 'vacation doll' <br/>
project, so I took their photo as they found the box too. ;)<br/>
<br/>
 We were unable to find Silver Eagle's TEXAS TURTLE letterbox <br/>
despite having a gardening fork to really move lots of rock, to see <br/>
underneath. The rock in that spot had slid down to the lower ground <br/>
in a pretty big area, but then we scatched a lot of area looking <br/>
under the rocks. We had in mind that it might be a microbox/film <br/>
canister, so we looked pretty thoroughly. A family stopped near the <br/>
Padre Island sign to take a photo, while Calico Rose and Corazon <br/>
tried to look nonchalant with my garden fork in hand standing around <br/>
on the rocky area. LOL! I was at the sign, again trying to pose my <br/>
two 'vacation dolls' for a photo on that sign and get them to stay <br/>
up. I took them down and let the family pose for a photo first, <br/>
since we were going to be awhile. I took their photo for them and <br/>
they left. Then I went back to my task and Corazon and Calico Rose <br/>
went back to theirs. <br/>
<br/>
 From there we went to Aransas Pass where we found Baby Bear's SUPER <br/>
FROGGER. It was very wet inside, but the stamp was fine. We dried <br/>
out the container and replaced the booklet with a new one, stamped <br/>
in, then replaced it in it's spot. I have emailed Baby Bear for his <br/>
address so I can send him the old booklet.<br/>
<br/>
 It started raining on us there, and we continued on in a heavy rain <br/>
storm, thunder and lightening to the Aransas Wildlife Refuge near <br/>
Tivoli. There, we saw hundreds of tiny frogs jumping across the road <br/>
all the way in and out of the Refuge. Plus, we saw two HUGE frogs of <br/>
a variety that none of us had ever seen before. They were maybe 5 <br/>
inches 'tall' sitting down, were rather more 'upright' than <br/>
frogs/toads I had seen before and bright lime green especially <br/>
around the head and face. The rest of them were kind of variatated <br/>
green and gray. Anyone know what kind they are? <br/>
<br/>
In the Refuge, Corazon and Calico Rose found my HURRICANE CLAUDETTE <br/>
letterbox, and we intended to look for the rest there, but the storm <br/>
intensified so we had to give up and leave for home. <br/>
<br/>
Although all we saw in the Refuge were jillions of frogs, on the <br/>
road home, we saw wild turkeys, one a tom with his tail spread, a <br/>
herd of wild pigs, several groups of nice deer, and a coyote. <br/>
<br/>
We had a great day and plan to go letterboxing in Wilson, Comal, and <br/>
Hays Counties the first of next week.<br/>
