                    <div class="plaintext-content">It does not look good for event next year, or any boxes surviving in the park.  But most of all this was a great park due to the trees, and that seems to be gone.  Here is the latest report I could find:<br>
<br>
BASTROP COUNTY, Texas -- As the sun peaked through the charred and blackened pine trees Tuesday, one could see a blanket of ash around Bastrop State Park.<br>
 <br>
The wildfire spread fast leaving behind a trail of destruction. It scorched 95 percent of the 6,000-acre park.<br>
 <br>
"Every day I drive through and it seems like there are more and more trees turning from a little bit of green, a little bit of hope, to complete brown," said Park Superintendent Todd McClanahan. "It hurts. It absolutely hurts."<br>
 <br>
McClanahan lives on site with his family. The fire came dangerously close to his home. Tuesday morning he took KVUE's Steve Alberts and Doug Naugle on a tour to see the damage in his own backyard.<br>
 <br>
"It's pretty difficult," said McClanahan. "We're fortunate that our house survived, but in the long term, I feel like I lost my home.<br>
 <br>
He won't be the only one to feel such a loss.<br>
 <br>
"This is a special place for so many Texans and across the nation," said McClanahan.<br>
 <br>
With flames shooting 40 to 50 feet above the tree tops, they were still able to save historic building from the 1930s. Thirteen stone and wooden cabins were built by the Civilian Conservation Corp as part of President Franklin Roosevelt's New Deal movement to put people back to work during the Depression. <br>
<br>
The fire came within just feet of the cabins. All 13 survived, because of quick action by firefighters and park rangers. They cut fire lines around the cabins and hosed them down. The fire did destroy two scenic structures, along with tens of thousands of pine trees which make the area so majestic. <br>
 <br>
"Due to the drought there will be a lot of trees that will continue to die due to lack of moisture," said McClanahan.<br>
 <br>
That could also mean deadly consequences for the endangered Houston Toad.  <br>
 <br>
"The difficult thing now around these pools which are breeding sites, they need tree canopy which has been lost," explained McClanahan. "We just don't know the impact."<br>
 <br>
The Houston Toad is only found in small numbers in nine Texas counties. The largest population is located in Bastrop State Park. The toad has already been stressed by the drought.<br>
 <br>
During the past 10 days, McClanahan has gone through a range of emotions.  <br>
 <br>
"It's hard," he said. "We're doing our best to try to bring it back as best we can. There are so many unknowns at this time."<br>
 <br>
He believes that over time, the park will rebound and bring families back to a scenic and special place. <br>
 <br>
The park will remain close through October so officials can assess the damage p<br>

I fell in love with the park, the trails, the CCC buildings and especially the night songs of Houston Toads at the lake in the park! I have been worried sick about that beautiful park and the surrounding homes and community, and the wonderful wildlife who make that their home. One night while we were there, we hiked down to the Wildlife Viewing Area, and although we didn't see anything too much out of the ordinary that evening, it was so peaceful. Although I rank Mission Tejas as my favorite "event park" so far, Bastrop is a very, very close second, and will be anxious to return.<br>

> Bastrop was where the first TALE was.  We arrived late Friday night and got set up late and planned to sleep in a bit, but we quickly realized something BIG was going on there in the park (and at that time, it was definitely NOT letterboxing!).  Hearing a bunch of noise, we peeked out of our tent before sunup and realized we were camped next to a big commercial style lunch truck!  Surely that wasn't what Silver Eagle and Baby Bear brought for the gathering?  They seemed more like slip-through-the-woods quietly kind of guys than make-a-huge-production guys, but then - I only knew them from email at that point.  We covered our heads and went back to sleep - for a short while.  As the sun rose, we heard a lot (and I mean a LOT) of foot traffic right by our campsite - turns out we were at a trailhead, and the start of a series of O-rings.  We emerged to see these young people running like crazy around the woods, and although it seemed like there was some sort of organization to it, we couldn't for the lives of us figure out what it was.  We finally managed to stop someone and ask what was going on and they explained orienteering to us - like we should have certainly known what it was since we were, after all, in Bastrop State Park, which is known for its O-courses.  After it was explained to us, we were fascinated to watch the orienteering teams work together to get through the courses.  Apparently schools in the area have Orienteering teams and they travel around to meets of sorts competing.  It was pretty cool!<br>

That first gathering was memorable and the subsequent gatherings in and near the park have been like "going home" in a letterboxing sense.  It was there that letterboxing really sank in for me, when I quit feeling like someone who wanted to letterbox but couldn't get it off the ground (so few boxes in my area way back then!), when I realized my family could be a part of the letterboxing community. Little did we know back then how much it would grow!  I hope that we do as PuddleSplasher suggested, and make plans for a gathering in the future so we can go and re-establish the park for letterboxing.<br>

Unfortunately the O-Knots series is in Bastrop state park and may not have survived.  Even if the boxes did, the clues are all based on the orienteering markers which may be gone.  <br>

The only other way I know to see the old clues (besides getting them from PI Joe) is to do a search for Eoghan in the LBNA Yahoo Talklist.

I was shocked at how much burned and how high up those trees it is totally charred.  Just chimneys left of many houses along 21.  Looks like the park burned badly close to the ground (all ground cover gone).  Doubt any box in areas burned survived.  Fire was so bad, the railings along the road were on the ground (wood supports burned up).   I am glad they saved the buildings!<br>

I have been worried sick about that beautiful park and the surrounding homes and community, and the wonderful wildlife who make that their home. One night while we were there, we hiked down to the Wildlife Viewing Area, and although we didn't see anything too much out of the ordinary that evening, it was so peaceful. Although I rank Mission Tejas as my favorite "event park" so far, Bastrop is a very, very close second, and will be anxious to return.<br>

We arrived late Friday night and got set up late and planned to sleep in a bit, but we quickly realized something BIG was going on there in the park (and at that time, it was definitely NOT letterboxing!). Hearing a bunch of noise, we peeked out of our tent before sunup and realized we were camped next to a big commercial style lunch truck! Surely that wasn't what Silver Eagle and Baby Bear brought for the gathering? They seemed more like slip-through-the-woods quietly kind of guys than make-a-huge-production guys, but then - I only knew them from email at that point. We covered our heads and went back to sleep - for a short while. As the sun rose, we heard a lot (and I mean a LOT) of foot traffic right by our campsite - turns out we were at a trailhead, and the start of a series of O-rings. We emerged to see these young people running like crazy around the woods, and although it seemed like there was some sort of organization to it, we couldn't for the lives of us figure out what it was. We finally managed to stop someone and ask what was going on and they explained orienteering to us - like we should have certainly known what it was since we were, after all, in Bastrop State Park, which is known for its O-courses. After it was explained to us, we were fascinated to watch the orienteering teams work together to get through the courses. Apparently schools in the area have Orienteering teams and they travel around to meets of sorts competing. It was pretty cool!<br>

That first gathering was memorable and the subsequent gatherings in and near the park have been like "going home" in a letterboxing sense. It was there that letterboxing really sank in for me, when I quit feeling like someone who wanted to letterbox but couldn't get it off the ground (so few boxes in my area way back then!), when I realized my family could be a part of the letterboxing community. Little did we know back then how much it would grow! I hope that we do as PuddleSplasher suggested, and make plans for a gathering in the future so we can go and re-establish the park for letterboxing.<br>

Just back from Canyon Lake area and came through Bastrop on Hwy 21 to Hwy<br>
290.  WOW.  The lost pines took a beating.  I was shocked at how much burned<br>
and how high up those trees it is totally charred.  Just chimneys left of<br>
many houses along 21.  Looks like the park burned badly close to the ground<br>
(all ground cover gone).  Doubt any box in areas burned survived.  Fire was<br>
so bad, the railings along the road were on the ground (wood supports burned<br>
up).   I am glad they saved the buildings!<br>
