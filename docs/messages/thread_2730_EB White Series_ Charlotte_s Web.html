<div>Since it's so hot in Texas in the summer, a lot of letterboxing activity takes place in the cooler winter months when the poison ivy is dormant and is not so noticeable. In April when people are out looking for letterboxes, the area is where a box may be hidden is often knee high with weeds, vines and saplings that weren't there when the box was planted in January. I've run into that a lot and sometimes I just have to wait and return later in the year when the weeds are gone. It's just part of nature. I'm extremely allergic to poison ivy, so I can't just wade in and get a box that's surrounded with p.i. - very disappointing.</div>

                    <html><body><div>LOL Lois, I don't think it is that nobody else worries, but probably more like it wasn't there when they planted!   It's time to get out and go check boxes to see where they stand PI-wise, because even if boxes weren't exposed last year doesn't mean they aren't exposed this year.  I went and checked one of my boxes two weeks ago and it was clear (and it has been in a good clean spot for a couple of years), then happened back by this past weekend and it was surrounded by PI.  I swear that stuff is taking over!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The other thing that happens this time of year is that folks who have planted boxes over the winter relied on leaves and other winter cover to hide their boxes and suddenly their well-hidden boxes disappear.  Folks have gotten out and started Spring cleaning and have cleaned the cover right away.  I found a box a few weeks ago that was probably well-hidden until Spring cleaning started, and then on top of having its covered raked away, the weedeater hit it a few dozen times and it was nothing but shredded plastic!  Cemeteries are notorious for this particular problem because caretakers put out a lot of effort in the Springtime to shape things up before homecomings and family days.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've always kind of operated on the theory that a box isn't in a good hiding spot until it's been in place over a year - through all seasons and theoretically all traffic.<br/><br/>And while I was out at Camp Pirtle yesterday?  We made friends with two snakes.  Y'all shoulda seen Fearless Fox jump when he rounded the corner and found himself nose to nose with one!  I TOLD him it was harmless, but he insisted it wasn't harmless if it gave him a heart attack...

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL!  There are some folks who probably think I LOOK for poison ivy <br/>
when planting my boxes.  You see, I am one of the fortunate few who is <br/>
not allergic... and therefore, don't always pay attention as well as I <br/>
should.  Of course I'd heard the old adage "leaves of three, leave it <br/>
be" and when planting during growing season, I really DO try to avoid <br/>
it.  But I planted this box in the winter - and hung it from a big fat <br/>
hairy vine!  Mother of Five quickly educated me on the other PI <br/>
adage, "if it's hairy, it's scary", and I promised I would move it <br/>
before the dormant vine started to sprout.  I was a little late and the <br/>
vine was already growing like crazy, so I had to break some leaves to <br/>
remove the hanging pouch.  So for those who are really, really <br/>
allergic - beware, there may be oil residue on the box still.<br/>
