   Forgive me as I lapse into 3rd person for a minute.<br/>
<br/>
The other day MonkeyToes decided to check on one of his local <br/>
letterboxes.  The Riverside Duck Pond Box was a crowd favorite and <br/>
he wanted to make sure it was okay for the summer vacation season.  <br/>
There was a small family at the pond, but they were busy pestering <br/>
the ducks with stale bread.<br/>
<br/>
He hopped onto the rail and reached into the eaves to grasp <br/>
nothing.  His eyes widened as his head screeched, "what the hell!"  <br/>
Peering into the eave, all he saw was old mud-dauber nests and <br/>
nature lint.  "Nonononono how could this happen? That was such a <br/>
good box" he says.  <br/>
Trying not panic, he looks into the next section of rafters and <br/>
there it lies!  MonkeyToes quickly grabs it and hops back down to <br/>
the cement floor.  A quick glance around shows him that no one is <br/>
around.  The ducks, having tired of moldy hot dog buns, must have <br/>
eaten the small family that was there.  He opens up the box and <br/>
inspects its contents.  <br/>
<br/>
What's this?  A folded sheet of notebook paper is lying in the <br/>
bottom.  "Read if you want.  I was bored," is written on one side.  <br/>
He opens it up to what appears to be an essay on his frustrations <br/>
with capitalism.  It's written by a kid named Corey Something.  <br/>
MonkeyToes cannot decipher the last name.  He reads the letter and <br/>
sees that it's pretty good and can tell the kid was trying to work <br/>
out some important issues.  He writes "Thank you, Corey," on the <br/>
note and puts it back.<br/>
<br/>
     The logbook had several entries by people who obviously have no <br/>
idea what letterboxing is.  The first odd entrant has no signature <br/>
stamp, just a little bible verse and a date.  Then follows another, <br/>
similar entry offering words of wisdom.  There are now at least four <br/>
or five encouraging phrases or words of advice mixed in with the <br/>
stamps of the letterboxing public.<br/>
     "Interesting," thinks MonkeyToes.  "My box has turned into a <br/>
support group for teenagers.  That's kind of neat as long as they <br/>
don't mess anything up.  I should probably check on this one more <br/>
often.  I wonder if anyone else has had this happen?"  He then puts <br/>
the box back in it's correct place and carefully returns to his <br/>
car.  He goes around the long way to avoid the carnivorous ducks.<br/>
<br/>
*end third person*<br/>
<br/>
Well?  Has anything like this happened to anyone else?  It's a <br/>
little bizarre, but it's kind of nice.  I wonder how they found it <br/>
in the first place since it's invisible from the ground and the <br/>
rail.  You really have to stick your head up in there to see it.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Well that is indeed verrrry interesting!<br/>
<br/>
1) How did they find it?  Teenagers can find anything,<br/>
anywhere because they literally HANG around. <br/>
Sometimes upside down, sometimes sideways, sometimes<br/>
even hanging by their eyeballs you would think.  They<br/>
are a curious lot with a constant need to learn more<br/>
AND the means to go exploring on their own.  Spaces<br/>
that most folks would never notice are considered to<br/>
be alternate universes to teenagers (hehe...and<br/>
letterboxers).  I know all of this because I am the<br/>
proud owner of a teenager.<br/>
<br/>
2) Will they mess it up?  Most of them won't,<br/>
especially if they've adopted it as a forum for<br/>
philosophical discourse.  Of course, there will be the<br/>
occasional one who MIGHT make a mess of it, but if the<br/>
rest of them respect it as a safe place to write their<br/>
thoughts, they will police themselves.  And actually,<br/>
they probably won't tell troublemakers about it,<br/>
because they don't want to expose their thoughts to<br/>
folks who will take it lightly.  I would, if I were in<br/>
your shoes, check it more often and make sure it is<br/>
amply supplied with paper and perhaps write occasional<br/>
notes of encouragement back to them, as you did.  I<br/>
might leave a letterboxing information sheet in it for<br/>
them, but frankly, it doesn't sound as if it is your<br/>
box any more - it sounds like it has taken on a life<br/>
of its own.<br/>
<br/>
I think it's really neat that has happened with your<br/>
box.  I spend a lot of time with and around teenagers<br/>
(remember, I have one of my very own and I also work<br/>
with them in scouts and formerly in soccer).  I have a<br/>
great deal of respect for them.  They are taking a<br/>
world that has become all too small and working out<br/>
how they will fit into it.  They are actively<br/>
examining themselves and the world around them and, I<br/>
think, digging deep to find a way to make themselves<br/>
meaningful in ways recent generations haven't had to<br/>
do.  I attended my daughter's baccalaureate (yeesh - I<br/>
KNOW that's spelled wrong!) a couple weeks ago, and<br/>
one of the speakers pointed out that these graduating<br/>
seniors were freshmen at the time of 9/11.  They were<br/>
pretty much fully cognizant of what was going on at<br/>
the time, and they are old enough to remember pre-9/11<br/>
and understand how things are changing in post-9/11.<br/>
<br/>
As with any generation, there are the good, the bad,<br/>
and the ugly, but I believe today's teenagers will<br/>
make great leaders of the future and I believe that if<br/>
they are taking an opportunity to express themselves<br/>
in your letterbox, you are honored.<br/>
<br/>
It reminds me of the fact that we started getting our<br/>
boats out and ready for the summer last weekend, and<br/>
when we uncovered one of them, we found a very large<br/>
hatch of baby ducks staring up at us.  We realized<br/>
that for the moment at least, we don't have a boat, we<br/>
have a big metal duck nest.<br/>

P.S.  I guess we will just hope they aren't<br/>
carnivorous ducks!<br/>
