                    <div class="plaintext-content">As most of you know, there has been an ongoing problem with placing letterboxes in Texas State Parks.  Part of the problem has been the growth of letterboxing and the corresponding larger number of boxes being both found and placed in the parks.  I know of letterboxes that were placed in State Parks 7 or 8 years ago and that are still there and have never had a problem.  Others seem to be found soon after placing, prompting an email from the Park Ranger asking that the box be permitted or removed.  Some people think that some Rangers find their way onto LbNA and seek out the boxes, simply not wanting them in their particular park.  This could be true in some cases, as each Ranger seems to interpret the rules differently.  Yesterday I got an email from the Ranger at South Llano River State Park about my letterbox there called "Mr. TexasTexas Governor Series".  He was very nice and understanding and asked if I would mind filling out the permit application so that the box would be properly registered.  I thanked him and  told him how much we enjoyed spending time in his beautiful park, promised to fill out the required form and asked, out of curiosity, how he happened to find my box, since I thought I had placed it in a safe place.  Here is his reply:<br>
<br>
"Your letterbox was brought to my attention from one of our campers who was looking for the letterbox and wasn't able to find it.  She asked me if I knew it was still there or not and I went and found it to confirm it was still there.<br>
 <br>
Your letterbox was in a great place and is causing no problems at all.  I wish that we had more letterboxes like it in the park.  I think that letterboxing is a great way for people to get out and enjoy the outdoors and with the history that you provided with the letterbox it makes it even better."<br>
<br>
There are a couple of lessons to be learned here, in my opinion.  Number one is that you should never jeopardize someone else's box by asking the park staff about it.  Number two is that, maybe some parks are okay with letterboxes and might even, under the right circumstances, embrace them.  This Ranger would probably have never found this letterbox if it hadn't been brought to his attention, so maybe he's not actively searching for boxes.  One thing is becoming obvious to me, based on contact that I have had and that Barefoot Lucy has had with state park Rangers in the past month or so:  there are rules in place, originated for geocaches, but now adapted to include letterboxes, in our Texas State Parks and the Rangers are becoming aware of them.  Consistency is still a problem, as each Ranger is apparently free to interpret the rules as he sees fit.  My intention is to ask for a permit application when I go into a park to place a letterbox.  You need to decide what you will do, but, please, never do anything to put an existing box in danger. I feel sure that the camper mentioned by the Ranger was not an experienced letterboxer or they would have first, found the box (it isn't difficult to find) and, they wouldn't have brought it to the attention of the Ranger. <br>

That's too funny!   You know, when we were getting ready to leave there, he told us that they had a stamp at the ranger station that I should get.  So I did.  Wouldn't count it as a find or anything, but it's in my logbook!   :)<br/><br/><br/><br/> <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know this is like preaching to the choir since most offenders are probably not on this List, but this is a great point, and is more important than ever now that officials are starting to crack down on boxes.  Never assume Rangers know about boxes unless it is explicitly stated in the clues, and even then you should exercise caution since things change and future Rangers might not be as sanguine.  Another tactic that can endanger boxes is referencing other boxes in your clues.  This can cause extra boxes being found by Rangers when they happen to find one box.  I have been guilty of this in the distant past, mostly in parks where Baby Bear and I had the only boxes for a long time, but I have been removing the references as I find them.  I must admit it goes against my nature to not advertise boxes and the parks they reside in, especially since I'm so used to doing that from the early days when I was trying to recruit more letterboxers, but we live in a new world now, and maybe it's time to be as stealthy with clues as we are with the boxes themselves.<br>

The Ranger there at Mission Tejas, whom we all know and love, saw my stamp in GG's logbook and asked if GG would mind sharing the clues with him because he liked the stamp. With my blessings, GG did and the ranger was able to get the image for himself and also told GG he was going into town to get some carving stuff and make his own stamps for the park too! Now there's a Ranger conversion if I've ever heard of one. I can't wait to get back there and check at the ranger station to see if he has planted his boxes yet! Some rangers are just TOO COOL!<br>

Part of the problem has been the growth of letterboxing and the corresponding larger number of boxes being both found and placed in the parks. I know of letterboxes that were placed in State Parks 7 or 8 years ago and that are still there and have never had a problem.

He was very nice and understanding and asked if I would mind filling out the permit application so that the box would be properly registered. I thanked him and told him how much we enjoyed spending time in his beautiful park, promised to fill out the required form and asked, out of curiosity, how he happened to find my box, since I thought I had placed it in a safe place. Here is his reply:<br>

This Ranger would probably have never found this letterbox if it hadn't been brought to his attention, so maybe he's not actively searching for boxes. One thing is becoming obvious to me, based on contact that I have had and that Barefoot Lucy has had with state park Rangers in the past month or so: there are rules in place, originated for geocaches, but now adapted to include letterboxes, in our Texas State Parks and the Rangers are becoming aware of them. Consistency is still a problem, as each Ranger is apparently free to interpret the rules as he sees fit. My intention is to ask for a permit application when I go into a park to place a letterbox. You need to decide what you will do, but, please, never do anything to put an existing box in danger. I feel sure that the camper mentioned by the Ranger was not an experienced letterboxer or they would have first, found the box (it isn't difficult to find) and, they wouldn't have brought it to the attention of the Ranger. <br>

<br/>In my opinion, Enchanted Rock is not a real good choice of location for boxes. Certains parts of the area are ecologically sensitive, and other parts are just too well traveled to host a box there for long without discovery. There are a few there and they are well placed, but the park just doesn't have a good history for keeping boxes.<br/>

    Letterboxing in State Parks</div>
<div><br/></div>
<div>
<p>As most of you know, there has been an ongoing problem with placing 
    letterboxes in Texas State Parks. Part of the problem has been the growth of 
    letterboxing and the corresponding larger number of boxes being both found 
    and placed in the parks. I know of letterboxes that were placed in State 
    Parks 7 or 8 years ago and that are still there and have never had a 
    problem. Others seem to be found soon after placing, prompting an email from 
    the Park Ranger asking that the box be permitted or removed. Some people 
    think that some Rangers find their way onto LbNA and seek out the boxes, 
    simply not wanting them in their particular park. This could be true in some 
    cases, as each Ranger seems to interpret the rules differently. Yesterday I 
    got an email from the Ranger at South Llano River State Park about my 
    letterbox there called "Mr. TexasTexas Governor Series". He was very nice 
    and understanding and asked if I would mind filling out the permit 
    application so that the box would be properly registered. I thanked him and 
    told him how much we enjoyed spending time in his beautiful park, promised 
    to fill out the required form and asked, out of curiosity, how he happened 
    to find my box, since I thought I had placed it in a safe place. Here is his 
    reply:<br/><br/>"Your letterbox was brought to my attention from one of our 
    campers who was looking for the letterbox and wasn't able to find it. She 
    asked me if I knew it was still there or not and I went and found it to 
    confirm it was still there.<br/><br/>Your letterbox was in a great place and 
    is causing no problems at all. I wish that we had more letterboxes like it 
    in the park. I think that letterboxing is a great way for people to get out 
    and enjoy the outdoors and with the history that you provided with the 
    letterbox it makes it even better."<br/><br/>There are a couple of lessons to 
    be learned here, in my opinion. Number one is that you should never 
    jeopardize someone else's box by asking the park staff about it. Number two 
    is that, maybe some parks are okay with letterboxes and might even, under 
    the right circumstances, embrace them. This Ranger would probably have never 
    found this letterbox if it hadn't been brought to his attention, so maybe 
    he's not actively searching for boxes. One thing is becoming obvious to me, 
    based on contact that I have had and that Barefoot Lucy has had with state 
    park Rangers in the past month or so: there are rules in place, originated 
    for geocaches, but now adapted to include letterboxes, in our Texas State 
    Parks and the Rangers are becoming aware of them. Consistency is still a 
    problem, as each Ranger is apparently free to interpret the rules as he sees 
    fit. My intention is to ask for a permit application when I go into a park 
    to place a letterbox. You need to decide what you will do, but, please, 
    never do anything to put an existing box in danger. I feel sure that the 
    camper mentioned by the Ranger was not an experienced letterboxer or they 
    would have first, found the box (it isn't difficult to find) and, they 
    wouldn't have brought it to the attention of the Ranger. <br/><br/>Boots

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was a box there for several years placed by Eoghan, but we couldn't find it last year when we were there.  Texas Parks and Wildlife has a policy for geocaches and letterboxes, so it would seem that, as long as you followed their rules, you could place a box in any state park.  I don't know how much flexibility the ranger has in interpreting the policy, but I'm sure it's considerable. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I respectfully disagree. I agree that parts of the park are ecologically sensitive, but those areas aren't any more susceptible to the traffic of an occasional letterboxer than they are from the hoards of careless hikers that frequent the park every day.  In fact, I would say that your average letterboxer would be more apt to find a sensible spot.  I started climbing, rappelling, and hiking that park when I was 12 and I know of several wonderful spots for a box, especially an extreme box or two.  Discovery is no more likely there than at the Botanic Gardens in Fort Worth, or any other public area in the state, for that matter.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was doing a search for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department policies in regard to geocaching and came across an article in the Dallas Morning News about geocaching in state parks.  It ended with the following note:  <br>
<br>
"If you don't own a GPS but want to join the search? Texas Parks and Wildlife is developing a non-GPS version of the game for people who want to follow clues the old-fashioned way. Clues are provided on the TPWD Web site."<br>
<br>
Huh?!  Finding out about this will be my next project for sure.<br>
<br>
I also found a Q/A section on the TPWD website:<br>
Q: Is geocaching allowed in Texas State Parks?<br>
A: Yes, geocaching can be a great way to enjoy parks and geocaches can also add to the educational experience of site visits.<br>
Q: What should I do if I want to place a geocache in a Texas State Park or Historic Site? <br>
A: First, visit with the park or historic site superintendent and discuss the location where you intend to place the cache. Some parks or historic sites may be entirely off-limits to geocaching due to the sensitive resources contained within the sites. The superintendent may limit placement of caches in some areas due to archeological or historical resources, endangered species or concerns for visitor safety. If the placement is approved, obtain a copy of a geocache permit in order to complete the contact and placement information.<br>
<br>
Here is basically what I have found to be true about letterboxing in Texas State Parks:<br>
<br>
First of all, you have a right to place a letterbox in a state park.  The policy is in place, thank to our friends, the geocachers.  The rules that apply for geocaching also apply to letterboxing.  Here is a link to the geocaching policy and application for a permit:<br>
<br>
http://www.geocachingadmin.com/info/Texas_State_Parks.pdf<br>
<br>
I have found that virtually none of the park personnel have ever heard of letterboxing, so I have adopted the following procedure:<br>
<br>
I take a letterbox with me that I want to place in the park and I walk into the office and ask for a permit application to place a letterbox in the park.  After the blank look, I say, "It's a treasure hunting game similar to geocaching, except that you don't have to use a gps."  Then, I show them the letterbox, opening it up and taking out the stamp and the logbook.  Almost invariably, the reaction is something like "Wow, that's neat!  So what is it that you wanted?"  I explain that if they would give me a geocache permit application, I could use that.  When they find it and hand it to me, I ask them if there are certain areas that I should stay away from because of park rules."   If there are any, they'll let you know.  After I place the box, I write the clues down on the permit application and fill out the other blanks.  I leave the place for gps coordinates blank and at the heading, I mark out "geocaching" and write in "letterboxing".  I take it back to the office and they look it over and approve it.  I haven't had one disapproved yet.  Getting my existing boxes at Huntsville SP did take a long time, but I think one park employee was responsible for that because he "just didn't have the time" to go find the boxes and approve the location.  He's not there anymore. The permit is good for one year and can be renewed by email.  If you don't renew it and they happen to notice, you'll receive an email request to renew it.  One park, Cedar Hill SP, renewed my permit automatically and sent me a confirmation.  I don't believe a letterbox will ever be confiscated and disposed of without some effort to contact the placer and try to get it permitted or, if it's in a bad location, moved.   In short, Texas State Parks are not "anti-lettetboxing" and a few have even expressed the opinion that they were good for the park because they bring in visitors.  I think the big problem is that we are "below the radar" in contrast to geocaching, but that's not necessarily and bad thing.  The more parks we approach, in a respectful manner, the more they'll get to know us as a legitimate recreational activity.  Even though there is a policy in place on the state level, each park manager has the authority to manage our hobby as he sees fit, so we just have to educate them, one park at a time.  I encourage you to follow this procedure the next time you visit a Texas State Park and report your experience to us.<br>

follow clues the old-fashioned way. Clues are provided on the TPWD Web
site."<br/>
<br/>
Huh?! Finding out about this will be my next project for sure.<br/>
<br/>
I also found a Q/A section on the TPWD website:<br/>
Q: Is geocaching allowed in Texas State Parks?<br/>
A: Yes, geocaching can be a great way to enjoy parks and geocaches can also add
to the educational experience of site visits.<br/>
Q: What should I do if I want to place a geocache in a Texas State Park or
Historic Site? <br/>
A: First, visit with the park or historic site superintendent and discuss the
location where you intend to place the cache. Some parks or historic sites may
be entirely off-limits to geocaching due to the sensitive resources contained
within the sites. The superintendent may limit placement of caches in some
areas due to archeological or historical resources, endangered species or
concerns for visitor safety. If the placement is approved, obtain a copy of a
geocache permit in order to complete the contact and placement information.<br/>
<br/>
Here is basically what I have found to be true about letterboxing in Texas
State Parks:<br/>
<br/>
First of all, you have a right to place a letterbox in a state park. The policy
is in place, thank to our friends, the geocachers. The rules that apply for
geocaching also apply to letterboxing. Here is a link to the geocaching policy
and application for a permit:<br/>
<br/>
<a href="http://www.geocachingadmin.com/info/Texas_State_Parks.pdf">http://www.geocachingadmin.com/info/Texas_State_Parks.pdf</a><br/>
<br/>
I have found that virtually none of the park personnel have ever heard of
letterboxing, so I have adopted the following procedure:<br/>
<br/>
I take a letterbox with me that I want to place in the park and I walk into the
office and ask for a permit application to place a letterbox in the park. After
the blank look, I say, "It's a treasure hunting game similar to
geocaching, except that you don't have to use a gps." Then, I show them
the letterbox, opening it up and taking out the stamp and the logbook. Almost
invariably, the reaction is something like "Wow, that's neat! So what is
it that you wanted?" I explain that if they would give me a geocache
permit application, I could use that. When they find it and hand it to me, I
ask them if there are certain areas that I should stay away from because of
park rules." If there are any, they'll let you know. After I place the
box, I write the clues down on the permit application and fill out the other
blanks. I leave the place for gps coordinates blank and at the heading, I mark
out "geocaching" and write in "letterboxing". I take it
back to the office and they look it over and approve it. I haven't had one
disapproved yet. Getting my existing boxes at Huntsville SP did take a long
time, but I think one park employee was responsible for that because he
"just didn't have the time" to go find the boxes and approve the
location. He's not there anymore. The permit is good for one year and can be
renewed by email. If you don't renew it and they happen to notice, you'll
receive an email request to renew it. One park, Cedar Hill SP, renewed my
permit automatically and sent me a confirmation. I don't believe a letterbox
will ever be confiscated and disposed of without some effort to contact the
placer and try to get it permitted or, if it's in a bad location, moved. In
short, Texas State Parks are not "anti-lettetboxing" and a few have
even expressed the opinion that they were good for the park because they bring
in visitors. I think the big problem is that we are "below the radar"
in contrast to geocaching, but that's not necessarily and bad thing. The more
parks we approach, in a respectful manner, the more they'll get to know us as a
legitimate recreational activity. Even though there is a policy in place on the
state level, each park manager has the authority to manage our hobby as he sees
fit, so we just have to educate them, one park at a time. I encourage you to
follow this procedure the next time you visit a Texas State Park and report
your experience to us.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Baby Bear.  When it comes to the annual TALE event, you and Silver Eagle should decide how to approach the permitting issue and everyone, I'm sure, will respect your decision.  As far as "a park that does not allow", all Texas State Parks (excluding, perhaps, Wildlife Management Areas) allow letterboxing and geocaching; it's a matter of policy, as long as you follow their regulations.  If you are willing to fill out the application and place the box in an area approved by the park management, you have the right to place a letterbox.  As I said before, chances are that the staff is likely to be unaware of letterboxing and in need of education, but with the policy in place, they can't refuse permission, they can only control WHERE you place the box in the park. I'm not saying that you might not run into a park manager who is unaware of the policy, but I don't think that will happen once you explain letterboxing to them.  I'm not sure what the reaction would be if we held an event and asked for permission to place 30 letterboxes.  I would be willing to talk to the lady at Huntsville and ask her that question. When you pick a place for the event, I'd be willing to test it for you by placing a box there, but I don't want to do anything that you think might jeopardize the event or placing boxes during the event.  We need to think about that and have some discussion about what would be appropriate.  <br>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">Thanks, Baby Bear. When it comes to the annual
TALE event, you and Silver Eagle should decide how to approach the permitting
issue and everyone, I'm sure, will respect your decision. As far as "a
park that does not allow", all Texas State Parks (excluding, perhaps,
Wildlife Management Areas) allow letterboxing and geocaching; it's a matter of
policy, as long as you follow their regulations. If you are willing to fill out
the application and place the box in an area approved by the park management,
you have the right to place a letterbox. As I said before, chances are that the
staff is likely to be unaware of letterboxing and in need of education, but
with the policy in place, they can't refuse permission, they can only control
WHERE you place the box in the park. I'm not saying that you might not run into
a park manager who is unaware of the policy, but I don't think that will happen
once you explain letterboxing to them. I'm not sure what the reaction would be
if we held an event and asked for permission to place 30 letterboxes. I would
be willing to talk to the lady at Huntsville and ask her that question. When
you pick a place for the event, I'd be willing to test it for you by placing a
box there, but I don't want to do anything that you think might jeopardize the
event or placing boxes during the event. We need to think about that and have
some discussion about what would be appropriate. <br/>

&gt; Wow. Great info!!! My permit for Huntsville has been approved, so easy for
that one. I will give this a try next time I decide to hide a box at a state
park, and will report the outcome. Which leads me to my next concern/topic. If
we decide to have 2011 Event at State Park, it may be a good idea to go to the
park ahead of time and make sure this system works there. If so, then we
provide the information and permits to all attending the event so they can
permit their boxes and know where they can not hide them. It is worth a try,
and at least we will not pick a park that does not allow from the beginning. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thanks Boots!!! <br/>

&gt; &gt; I was doing a search for the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department
policies in regard to geocaching and came across an article in the Dallas
Morning News about geocaching in state parks. It ended with the following note:
<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; "If you don't own a GPS but want to join the search? Texas Parks
and Wildlife is developing a non-GPS version of the game for people who want to
follow clues the old-fashioned way. Clues are provided on the TPWD Web
site."<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Huh?! Finding out about this will be my next project for sure.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I also found a Q/A section on the TPWD website:<br/>
&gt; &gt; Q: Is geocaching allowed in Texas State Parks?<br/>
&gt; &gt; A: Yes, geocaching can be a great way to enjoy parks and geocaches
can also add to the educational experience of site visits.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Q: What should I do if I want to place a geocache in a Texas State
Park or Historic Site? <br/>
&gt; &gt; A: First, visit with the park or historic site superintendent and
discuss the location where you intend to place the cache. Some parks or
historic sites may be entirely off-limits to geocaching due to the sensitive
resources contained within the sites. The superintendent may limit placement of
caches in some areas due to archeological or historical resources, endangered
species or concerns for visitor safety. If the placement is approved, obtain a
copy of a geocache permit in order to complete the contact and placement
information.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; Here is basically what I have found to be true about letterboxing in
Texas State Parks:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; First of all, you have a right to place a letterbox in a state park.
The policy is in place, thank to our friends, the geocachers. The rules that
apply for geocaching also apply to letterboxing. Here is a link to the
geocaching policy and application for a permit:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <a href="http://www.geocachingadmin.com/info/Texas_State_Parks.pdf">http://www.geocachingadmin.com/info/Texas_State_Parks.pdf</a><br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I have found that virtually none of the park personnel have ever
heard of letterboxing, so I have adopted the following procedure:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I take a letterbox with me that I want to place in the park and I
walk into the office and ask for a permit application to place a letterbox in
the park. After the blank look, I say, "It's a treasure hunting game
similar to geocaching, except that you don't have to use a gps." Then, I
show them the letterbox, opening it up and taking out the stamp and the
logbook. Almost invariably, the reaction is something like "Wow, that's
neat! So what is it that you wanted?" I explain that if they would give me
a geocache permit application, I could use that. When they find it and hand it
to me, I ask them if there are certain areas that I should stay away from
because of park rules." If there are any, they'll let you know. After I
place the box, I write the clues down on the permit application and fill out
the other blanks. I leave the place for gps coordinates blank and at the
heading, I mark out "geocaching" and write in
"letterboxing". I take it back to the office and they look it over and
approve it. I haven't had one disapproved yet. Getting my existing boxes at
Huntsville SP did take a long time, but I think one park employee was
responsible for that because he "just didn't have the time" to go
find the boxes and approve the location. He's not there anymore. The permit is
good for one year and can be renewed by email. If you don't renew it and they
happen to notice, you'll receive an email request to renew it. One park, Cedar
Hill SP, renewed my permit automatically and sent me a confirmation. I don't
believe a letterbox will ever be confiscated and disposed of without some
effort to contact the placer and try to get it permitted or, if it's in a bad
location, moved. In short, Texas State Parks are not
"anti-lettetboxing" and a few have even expressed the opinion that
they were good for the park because they bring in visitors. I think the big
problem is that we are "below the radar" in contrast to geocaching,
but that's not necessarily and bad thing. The more parks we approach, in a
respectful manner, the more they'll get to know us as a legitimate recreational
activity. Even though there is a policy in place on the state level, each park
manager has the authority to manage our hobby as he sees fit, so we just have
to educate them, one park at a time. I encourage you to follow this procedure
the next time you visit a Texas State Park and report your experience to us.<br/>
