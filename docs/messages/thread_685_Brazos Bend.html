Hi everyone,<br>
I took a trip to Brazos Bend today. Seems that I just missed Hawk by <br>
one day and the Dewberry group by maybe only a few minutes. I <br>
planted 2 boxes for the event and I confirmed that Cattail Marsh is <br>
for sure missing. I did not have a stamp carved to replace it so it <br>
will not be there for the event. It was a beautiful day today and <br>
the park was PACKED! A word of advice would be to get to the park as <br>
early as you can to get your campsite. They are first-come-first-<br>
serve. This week is spring break for lots of folks too. <br>
I am off to write my clues for the new boxes I planted...<br>
See you all Friday.<br>
DrooP<br>

<div><font face="Book Antiqua">Hi guys!</font></div>
<div><font face="Book Antiqua"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Book Antiqua">My Cub Scout Pack is going to be camping at 
Brazos Bend park next weekend, and a quick check of letterboxing.org shows about 
15 boxes out there, which seems about right from the gathering last year.  
I am wondering if anyone knows of any specifically that have gone missing?  
I am going to be introducing some more people to letterboxing and taking my 
Tiger Scouts out for a few, so I figured I would see if anyone has an 
info!  Thanks!</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Semalee's post reminded me that I am just finishing<br>
something up with my Webelos (4th graders) that has<br>
turned out to be really cool.  <br>
<br>
One of the Webelos requirements is to explore various<br>
forms of Art by creating art in different genre.  I<br>
decided to let them carve stamps - xacto knives and<br>
all!  We've been working on them for about three<br>
weeks, and I've even had some boys from the older<br>
Webelos den come in to see what we were doing and beg<br>
to make their own stamps, so I've been staying late<br>
with them to help them out.  It has been a lot of fun<br>
teaching them to carve and they've done surprisingly<br>
well at handling the xactos and gouges.  While they've<br>
been carving their own very rough stamps, I copied and<br>
carved our den emblem, dragons, and it has turned out<br>
great!<br>
<br>
Of course, this is the last piece of the puzzle in<br>
preparation for doing our scout training series, which<br>
is about to happen.  They will be working with me on<br>
that, and I'm so excited.  They may even carve some of<br>
the stamps for it.  Hopefully in January we will begin<br>
placing the series in Jim Hogg Historical Site in<br>
Rusk.  It will definitely be in place by March 18th!<br>

<div><font face="Book Antiqua" size="2">that stamp, as I have said before, was my 
very first find, and is special to many other people as well, so I am glad to 
hear it is safe.  And for a first carve (and on an eraser, no less!) it has 
an awful lot of letters....I think it is a great stamp!  Every time I look 
at it I am reminded of the thrill of reading about this strange thing called 
"letterboxing", hauling the kids down the trail reading clues and counting 
steps, and then lo and behold....the box was right there!  What a great day 
that was, and I have that stamp to remind me of it.  Mother of

at Brazos Bend SP and had the place almost all to myself.  I found my <br>

I also found Wish Upon A Star letterbox, the first one placed by <br>
SoccerChik.  It was a good first effort and had several visits, <br>

brush and left notes in the log.  Glad to see they did not confiscate <br>
it or mistake it for trash.<br>

Though it was too cold for alligators to be out, the birds were <br>
plentiful and it was very peaceful.  As I ambled along I couldn't <br>
help but think of the second TX LB Event held here in 2005.  I <br>
chuckled to myself as I thought of BOXDN and Wanda getting caught by <br>
Rangers while they looked for letterboxes at midnight.  As I looked <br>
with regret at the many trees blown down by Ike, I remembered the big <br>
storm we had the night of that Event.  All in all, it was a fun day!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">That sounds like a good way to spend a dreary day.  We lived in Sugar <br>
Land for about 14 years (pre-letterboxing) and Brazos Bend was a <br>
favorite place to go, just to hike the trails and get away from the <br>
bustle of the city. I'm glad the boxes are surviving.  It sounds like <br>
there's room for more letterboxes out there.<br>
