Poop. It is pretty darn neat to look at though. Do we know (or <br/>

<div>Yep! Temporary Inversion was a blast!  I took my camera along and got 
some great shots of Frye Team.  They have grown so much since then!  
That was my first outing with them and we had lots of fun.  And yes, it 
took both of us to hurry the kids along and distract them from reading the words 
on the sidewalk!  :)</div><br/><br/><br/><div><hr/>AOL now offers free email to everyone.
