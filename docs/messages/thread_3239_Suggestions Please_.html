                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi!<br/>
<br/>
On a whim, we've decided to spend this weekend letterboxing in the <br/>
DFW area.  We'll actually be staying in Lewisville and it seems there <br/>
are quite a few boxes in Flower Mound, Denton, Grapevine, etc.<br/>
<br/>
We like to hike and prefer to spend time on the trails and in parks <br/>
rather than drive-bys or urban boxing.  Of course we'll be doing our <br/>
research over the next couple of days, but we'd appreciate any <br/>
suggestions or tips from the locals.  For example, I know there was <br/>
flooding down there, but don't recall exactly what areas may have <br/>
been affected.<br/>
<br/>
We'll be arriving late on Friday and departing mid-afternoon on <br/>
Tuesday JAN 1.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for any info you can provide and feel free to contact me off-<br/>
list if you'd prefer.  My email address is kotlarek@wi.rr.com<br/>
<br/>
Happy Holidays!<br/>

<div>Hi! I'm going to have to give the restaurant query a little thought, but there is a good BBQ place we went to recently in Coppell on Bass Pro Road just east of Grapevine Mills Mall. I'll have to get the name and address for you later today. Also, if you like Mexican, Uncle Julios on Hwy. 114 and Tate in Grapevine is excellent. You might check the internet to see if Sneaky Pete's is open at the marina at Lake Grapevine... good place for breakfast.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last I heard, all my boxes were still in place on the northern side of Lake Grapevine (Flower Mound, Grapevine area). The Moose series is a pretty good hike, so take plenty of water: <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=14115">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=14115</a>. I am planning to go up there next week to do maintenance on my boxes, but like I said, I've been told they are all still there after the flood receded. All four boxes in my Artist Series Two <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=30263">http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=30263</a> was also found last week. It's a short walk (about a mile round trip on a cement sidewalk), but it's a pretty walk on the south side of the lake in Grapevine. I haven't checked on Rather Be Paddlin or Three Blind Moose (on the north side of the lake closer to the Moose Series), but both were found since the flood so I'm assuming they're still there too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'll get back to you on the restaurant suggestions. Oh, there is a Colter's BBQ over by Grapevine Mills too. </div>

<div>The name of the BBQ restaurant in Coppell is Hard Eight, but I'm still working on the address. Of course to me, any Dickeys BBQ is good, and I'm pretty sure there must be one in that area (I know there's one on Denton Tap Rd between Hwy 121 and Bass Pro Rd.). I've got a call in to my son-in-law for the address of Hard Eight. I'll get back with you.</div>

<div>The name of the BBQ restaurant in Coppell is Hard Eight, but I'm still working on the address. Of course to me, any Dickeys BBQ is good, and I'm pretty sure there must be one in that area (I know there's one on Denton Tap Rd between Hwy 121 and Bass Pro Rd.). I've got a call in to my son-in-law for the address of Hard Eight. I'll get back with you.</div>

our <br/>

&gt; suggestions or tips from the locals.  For example, I know there was <br/>
&gt; flooding down there, but don't recall exactly what areas may have <br/>
&gt; been affected.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We'll be arriving late on Friday and departing mid-afternoon on <br/>

<div>Good barbecue in Lewisville/Flower Mound, hmmm.... anything with Spring 
Creek on the sign is good, in my opinion - hard to beat their ribs.  And 
they're pretty much all over the area - one is in Grapevine on Hwy 114 in the 
middle of a restaurant row, just north of the airport.  Of course, if you 
get down to the FW Stockyards area, the options are even better - try Riscky's 
in the Stockyards (heck, try anything in the stockyards!  All good!).</div>
<div>    One of my boxes along the Lake Grapevine trail is 
gone with the flood:  The Lost Moose (now permanently a lost little 
moose!). However, White Sail is still in place, happily, as is Merlin the 
Mooseterious.  Both are accessible from Rockledge Park, about a mile hike 
from the trailhead through some pretty wooded areas above the lakeshore.  
Also on this same trail is PuddleSplasher's Three Blind Meese.  It's a good 
little hike with nice lakeviews, too.</div>
<div>    Of course, there are lots and lots of others in the 
Grapevine, Keller, Southlake areas, most of which involve fairly short hikes in 
some natural areas.  Batty Girl has several in old historic country 
cemeteries mostly south of Denton and roughly along I35W (the branch that goes 
to FW, not I35E, the branch between Denton and Dallas).  And there are a 
number of interesting boxes in Denton, too.  And there's a really pretty 
Audubon Society nature preserve just southwest of Dallas near Cedar Hill. where 
both PuddleSplasher and I have some boxes - lots of good hiking trails through 
that area along a limestone fossil ridge above a lake.  Look up clues for 
PS's Wren box and my Ludwig's Letterbox and Swing! (two of my music box series) 
if you plan to go to that area.   The boxes along the Campion Trail in 
Irving are all gone, washed away in the flooded Trinity, but I think they've all 
been marked as unavailable. </div>
<div>    Whereever you go, you're sure to find lots of good, 
interesting places tucked away with good hiking possibilities, good scenic 
views, and good letterboxes!  Have a good time!</div>

<div><span class="218443220-27122007">Thanks!  I have most of those boxes on my list, but hadn't gone as 
far south as the Cedar Ridge Nature Preserve.  That area looks interesting, 
so I'll add more clues to our pile.  It does seem like everyone has done a 
very good job of keeping their clues updated re: status.  That's very much 
appreciated!</span></div>

now have a list of BBQ places that would keep us busy for much longer than the 
3.5 days we'll be there!  We were in the Austin/San Antonia/Hill Country

Hoping we can find something similar this time...</span></div>

know that someone had been at the same boxes on the same day.  Wish I <br/>

<div>I just wish you had mentioned that you'd like to meet some of the local boxers, and we would have certainly have tried to get together with you! I almost suggested it, but since you hadn't mentioned anything about wanting to meet and do any exchanges, I figured it was a quick trip and you didn't want to have to stop and try to meet up with anyone (which would be understandable). In fact, I would have had no trouble getting my non-boxing husband to accompany me to North Main BBQ, which is definitely one of his favorites. Heck! Next time!</div>
