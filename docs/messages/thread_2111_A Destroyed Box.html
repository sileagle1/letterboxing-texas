<div>I wonder if we couldn't just make an "Unofficial List of Missing Texas Boxes" and place it on the Texas LB site. Although we can't seem to change the clues to indicate a box is missing on the LBNA or Atlas site without the owners input, we might at least have a list on our site of ones that we KNOW with a fair amount of certainty are in fact missing. That way, we could at least check that list before heading out if we don't want to try for boxes that have been repeatedly reported missing (who's owners are no longer participating).</div>

<div>
<div>All good questions, Lucy. I think if the placer is still in the game, it really is up to them to declare a box as missing. In a perfect letterboxing world, when a placer gets a report of a missing box, the placer would check on the box personally and as quickly as possible, because they would certainly be the one to verify that it missing. However, there are often reasons why the placer is unable to check their box, so we do have to depend on our friends in the letterboxing community to sometimes help us out. I think if there were an <u>unofficial</u> a list of missing boxes, it should be a short list. I don't think it's necessary to be redundant and include the ones that are officially declared as missing on the LBNA or Atlas sites. The purpose of this list would only be to list those boxes which have been placed by someone who isn't still in the game (is no longer communicating) and whose boxes have been attempted several times in a row without a find, or like the box Lucy just described that is obviously torn up. If a letterboxer finds one of her boxes on the list and checks on it and verifies it is not missing, she could request that it be removed from the list. This list wouldn't have any connection or link to the regular list of clues. It would just be an informal list of boxes that are obviously gone and the placer is not communicating with the list anymore. Perhaps if five people "nominate" a box for the missing list, that would qualify them to be placed on that list until the placer or another finder verifies they aren't missing. Mystery boxes should not be eligible for the unofficial missing list - too hard to verify!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Active letterboxers should, as a matter of etiquette, keep up with their boxes to the best of their ability, list them as missing as quickly as they can be verified, and as Dewberry suggested, move them to the archives if they are not going to be replaced.</div>

<div>My thought on that is that you have to try to contact that person by whatever contact method is mentioned in the clues (and I very nearly wrote in the box - and I'm just SURE Mike would've caught me on that and roasted me!), and to try to use Contact Placer functions in LBNA and AQ, and to post a general message on the regional list and on the Big List asking for the placer to contact the poster.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Is calling them on the phone going too far?  I mean, I know how to get in touch with one local placer, but I've never been invited to give her a call - I just know her real name and can look it up in the phone book.  Not rocket science.  BUT - that just FEELS like an invasion of privacy to me.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unless the placer has personally given me their phone number and we have "that kind" of relationship, I think calling them is a bit too much.   I think the definition of "trying to contact" should be limited to using standard letterboxing communication tools.

                    <html><body><div>While I agree to a certain degree with that, I think what makes me feel a phone call is off-limits is because we've all only met through the internet - that's the long and short of it.  Many of us have met in real life and many more of us will meet at a later time in real life.  But we still control what people know about us through the internet.  While I might go and find someone's boxes, that doesn't give me the right to intrude on their private lives.  If they choose to withdraw from the game, that IS their prerogative and their privacy shouldn't be invaded because of that, even if it does irritate me sometimes that they left their boxes untended.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the other hand, if another letterboxer gives me their phone number, I would expect that to be an invitation to contact them.  And in fact, several letterboxers have MY cell phone and if I were to drop out I wouldn't be at all surprised or alarmed to receive a phone call from them asking me what was going on.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You do have a point though about being able to look up a phone number in the phone book, but then, you wouldn't find BarefootLucy in the book, although you would find my legal name (or Fearless Fox's).  However, if you make your name known and you have your number listed, maybe it wouldn't be going too far.
<br/><br/>But one point to know that would help you know where I'm coming from - I'm a little freakish about internet safety.  As safe as this list seems, and I believe that for the most part it is, I actually had someone come onto this list in the very early days because they tracked me down here from another interest I have.  I had begun avoiding them because they became too personal.  They wanted to prove to me they meant me no harm, so they did a few internet searches on my trail name, made a couple of good guesses, and joined up here.   And as far as I know, they are still here.  Does that sound harmless?  It doesn't make me FEEL safe, although admittedly no harm has come of it.  But anyway, that experience colors my opinion about this sort of thing, so I admit I may be a little skewed.

<div>Here's what I wonder - how do you declare someone as not playing any more?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My thought on that is that you have to try to contact that person by whatever contact method is mentioned in the clues (and I very nearly wrote in the box - and I'm just SURE Mike would've caught me on that and roasted me!), and to try to use Contact Placer functions in LBNA and AQ, and to post a general message on the regional list and on the Big List asking for the placer to contact the poster. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Is calling them on the phone going too far?  I mean, I know how to get in touch with one local placer, but I've never been invited to give her a call - I just know her real name and can look it up in the phone book.  Not rocket science.  BUT - that just FEELS like an invasion of privacy to me.   
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unless the placer has personally given me their phone number and we have "that kind" of relationship, I think calling them is a bit too much.   I think the definition of "trying to contact" should be limited to using standard letterboxing communication tools.

<div>What do you think?</div>

As a matter of fact, I only started "talking" to people at the begining of the year. So, as I'm learning letterboxing, I'm learning how to converse online at the same time.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Bedford<br/><br/><b><i>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div> <div>While I agree to a certain degree with that, I think what makes me feel a phone call is off-limits is because we've all only met through
 the internet - that's the long and short of it.  Many of us have met in real life and many more of us will meet at a later time in real life.  But we still control what people know about us through the internet.  While I might go and find someone's boxes, that doesn't give me the right to intrude on their private lives.  If they choose to withdraw from the game, that IS their prerogative and their privacy shouldn't be invaded because of that, even if it does irritate me sometimes that they left their boxes untended. </div> <div> </div> <div>On the other hand, if another letterboxer gives me their phone number, I would expect that to be an invitation to contact them.  And in fact, several letterboxers have MY cell phone and if I were to drop out I wouldn't be at all surprised or alarmed to receive a phone call from them asking me what was going on. </div> <div> </div> <div>You do have a point though about being able to look
 up a phone number in the phone book, but then, you wouldn't find BarefootLucy in the book, although you would find my legal name (or Fearless Fox's).  However, if you make your name known and you have your number listed, maybe it wouldn't be going too far. <br/><br/>But one point to know that would help you know where I'm coming from - I'm a little freakish about internet safety.  As safe as this list seems, and I believe that for the most part it is, I actually had someone come onto this list in the very early days because they tracked me down here from another interest I have.  I had begun avoiding them because they became too personal.  They wanted to prove to me they meant me no harm, so they did a few internet searches on my trail name, made a couple of good guesses, and joined up here.   And as far as I know, they are still here.  Does that sound harmless?  It doesn't make me FEEL safe, although admittedly no harm has come of
 it.  But anyway, that experience colors my opinion about this sort of thing, so I admit I may be a little skewed. </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 8/31/06, <b>janet clark</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:jayceeinbedford@yahoo.com">jayceeinbedford@<wbr/>yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div><strong>I know I'm new, but I need to put my 2 cents worth in. </strong></div> <div><strong></strong> </div> <div><strong>If someone has their number listed in the phone book, they've got to expect people to look their number up in the book and use it.
