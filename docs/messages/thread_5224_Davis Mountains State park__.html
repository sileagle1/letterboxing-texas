                    <div class="plaintext-content">The cable box is located by the picnic table slab, which is on the opposite side of the trailer from the electric, water and sewer, so you need a long coax cable, unless you want to put the tv on the picnic table and plug directly into it.  You just plug it in and it should work, but it didn't work for me, although it worked in my brother's motorhome.  I was okay with that, because we didn't want the kids to be stuck inside watching tv anyway.  Only the sites with full hookups have cable.  You get whatever cable channels are available and the local channels from the stations in Midland and Odessa.<br>

We struggled up that trail from Ft Davis, stopping to catch our breath, and a troop of boy scouts scooted right past us to the top.  Saw them again at the top before they went off along the trail on the ridge back to the campground.  Left us in the dust.  Great trail &amp; views!<br/>Viewfinder<br/><br/>Sent from my HTC Inspire™ 4G on AT&amp;T<br/><br/></div><div id="yiv437712830htc_header">----- Reply message -----<br/>From: "sileagle1" &lt;sileagle@windstream.net&gt;<br/>To: &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt;<br/>Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Davis Mountains State park..<br/>Date: Thu, Jul 11, 2013 5:42 pm<br/><br/></div><br/>

<div>I highly recommend hiking the trail to Fort Davis NHS if you can get someone to pick you up there.  You start at top of Skyline Drive in Davis Mtn SP and it is a great view of the fort as you descend to it.  You can get directions from my Vanguard letterbox, even though it was destroyed by fire.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think it is less than 1.5 miles one way and a little steep at first, but then levels off and goes down.  If you don't have someone to pick you up at the fort, just hike to the overlook and back, which will be about the same distance.  I like to imagine being an Indian in the 1800s and planning to attack the fort.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interestingly enough, Fort Davis was never attacked, probably because the Indians couldn't get their horses to go down that steep trail!  Or, because it was easy to attack the wagons and steal all their possessions and run away before the army could catch them.<br>
