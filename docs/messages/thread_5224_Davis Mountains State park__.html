                    <div class="plaintext-content">The cable box is located by the picnic table slab, which is on the opposite side of the trailer from the electric, water and sewer, so you need a long coax cable, unless you want to put the tv on the picnic table and plug directly into it.  You just plug it in and it should work, but it didn't work for me, although it worked in my brother's motorhome.  I was okay with that, because we didn't want the kids to be stuck inside watching tv anyway.  Only the sites with full hookups have cable.  You get whatever cable channels are available and the local channels from the stations in Midland and Odessa.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Boots.  How does the cable work?  I reserved a site with cable but we've never used cable in our camper (we do have a hook up).  Do you need a box?  Or do you plug the cable in the TV and you get whatever channels are available?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Interestingly enough, Fort Davis was never attacked, probably because the Indians couldn't get their horses to go down that steep trail!  Or, because it was easy to attack the wagons and steal all their possessions and run away before the army could catch them.<br/>
