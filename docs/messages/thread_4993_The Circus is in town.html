A bad night last night, storms took out four poles, and of all places to have an outage, it was my house.  I am normally tied to Rio Grande 15, but because of a re-closer problem we were back-feeding from Rio Grande 13.  The storm took out 4 poles on Rio Grande 13.  This caused the Frontera sub-station to go dark.  My home is on the Frontera Sub.  A few thousand customers were without power for about 2 hours.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway.... I am tired... good night all.<br/>

&gt; Just because I can't make it to events ( I just lost my dad and have 2 young boys one plays baseball and ranked 4th in the country for his age, thus baseball rules my life!) doesn't mean I'm a nobody. I have close to 1000 finds and 89 plants!!  My lb birthday is this week 3 years!  Idk how many times I've deleted what I really wanted to say on this matter, but been lots!! I'm now just happy finding. Rest assured your beloved circus is in good hands by someone you all love!!<br/>
