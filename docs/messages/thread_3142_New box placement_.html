                    <html><body><div>Hi Kristie,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, it's not quite so easy as simply outlining rules and regulations.</div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>City Parks-</strong>Depends on what city, but by and large, city parks seem to be okay.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Private property</strong>-generally probably not a good idea, and definitely not a good idea without permission.  If you get permission and the property is accessible, it would probably work out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>National Parks:  </strong>Not okay.  Used to be absolutely not okay, but even National Parks are a maybe these days.  Most definitely ask permission.  Even if you get permission, you may have to fill out paperwork and maybe even pay a fee.  Don't plant without permission and don't plant with permission if you can't comply with the rules they lay out. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>National Forests:  </strong>National Forests are generally okay (National Forests are operated by USDA and National Parks are operated by National Parks Service - different agencies - different rules).  However, be very responsible in planting in a national forest.  Be careful of fragile growth and sensitive wildlife areas. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>State Forests in Texas-</strong>Generally okay also.  Again though, be responsible in planting - don't damage growth or habitat.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>State Parks in Texas-</strong>State Parks used to be an easy yes, but they are beginning to develop policies.  You can try planting in them without permission and all may be well, but they seem to be going toward wanting to know and actively policing. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Schools, Airports, Hospitals, Government Buildings-</strong>Generally not a good idea.  Any of these sites are very sensitive to odd objects laying about and strange people lurking.  We sure don't want to cause chaos or uproar.  With permission is probably okay. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Cemeteries</strong>-Generally fine, but with respect and good taste.</div>
<div> </div>
<div><strong>Some general rules of thumb include: </strong></div>
<div>1) don't place boxes where damage might be done to plant or animal, </div>
<div>2) don't place boxes where historical or archaeological areas might be compromised.</div>
<div>3) when in doubt, don't</div>
<div>4) or when in doubt, ask the park.  But if you are asking, please don't say "well there are already boxes here..."</div>
<div>5) or better, when in doubt, ask here about a specific location.  Someone here may already have experience there, and even if no one does, we can noodle it out with you and help you figure out a plan of attack.</div>
<div>6) remember that your actions and approaches affect all of us.  Don't do anything that will make it more difficult for other boxers.  Another good reason to talk it out here first.</div>
