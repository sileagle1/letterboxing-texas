                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have an idea for this week's topic:  What is the worst thing that <br>
has happened to you while letterboxing?  Don't think of it as a <br>
depressing subject so much as a learning opportunity that might help <br>
others from suffering the same fate.  If you don't have a "worst" <br>
story, then insert "most interesting" or "strangest".<br>
<br>
I have several, which is probably not a good thing.  My worst has to <br>
be the time my car got broken into while letterboxing.  It was in <br>
Houston at the parking lot for Terry Hershey Bike Trail off <br>
Memorial.  I was with my family and we were only gone for about 15 <br>
minutes, but the crooks had time to break a window and steal my <br>
wife's purse with everything in it.  Not much money, but what a pain <br>
getting new credit cards, drivers license, locks on house doors, <br>
etc.  Getting your car broken into is always bad, but having it done <br>
while enjoying nature is especially galling.  My wife now feels like <br>
she has to take her purse on hikes, which is a pain.  Guys definitely <br>
have it easier with wallets.  I have been back to that trail head <br>
since, but I park near Memorial so my car is less secluded.  I have <br>
to walk a little further, but I feel a little less nervous.<br>
<br>
My worst physical thing is the time I got bit by a scorpion.  Now you <br>
are probably thinking "what a bozo, doesn't he know to wear gloves or <br>
move a box with a stick before grabbing it", and you are right, but I <br>
did do this.  I don't wear gloves, but I always move a box with my <br>
boot or a stick before grabbing it and I did so this time, too.  <br>
However, the incident occurred WHILE PUTTING THE BOX BACK.  I had <br>
never thought of being careful returning the box, but I sure am now!<br>
<br>
My worst fright came while retrieving a large letterbox (the original <br>
TX Tour Bus) from inside a hollow tree.  It was up inside about my <br>
entire arm length, so I couldn't see what was up there.  I used a <br>
stick to try and get it out, but it was stuck too well.  After poking <br>
it for a while, I figured any critter would have moved on by then, so <br>
I reached up and grabbed it.  It finally came loose and as I brought <br>
it out I noticed something big on top of it; a giant snake!  Now I <br>
don't mind admitting I don't like snakes, so I just about had a heart <br>
attack.  Luckily it was winter and the snake was sluggish, so he just <br>
slowly slithered away and I was able to stamp in after awhile.  But <br>
now I had to put the box back!  Putting my hand back up that tree was <br>
probably the hardest thing I have had to do in a long time.  You can <br>
be sure I poked a stick up there for a long time before doing it, <br>
though.<br>
<br>
Luckily, none of these incidents was life-threatening, but I did <br>
learn valuable lessons that made me a safer letterboxer.<br>

many, being new to the sport) is just plain stupid. I was 37 and had never had 
poison ivy despite growing up and living on a farm covered with it. I married a 
wonderful man who is so allergic to poison ivy that he breaks out if we talk 
about it. The result of our union? Three great boys, two of which are allergic 
to poison ivy. So we get to the box, in a cemetary, and I notice that the 
tree/bush around it is covered with poison ivy. My boys are chomping at the bit, 
wanting to get at the box, so I put Stinky Monkey down (sensitivity to P.I. is 
still unknown with him) and say to my older boys...</font></div>

                    <html><body><div>Well - I have to say that because I have heard you tell about that scorpion incident before, I DO always wear gloves when sticking my hand in a hole, and I will only stick my hand into a blind hole if there is no other way to get the box.  I'm just not into stings and bites!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think the car break-in thing is truly a bad thing to have happen and thankfully I can't share a story like that.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The worst thing I've ever had happen - and it IS a lesson to all - was when I went to plant SJZ's birthday box August before last.  I left everyone at the swimming area at Ray Roberts SP and went to quickly hide the box.  I knew where I wanted to hide it and I thought I would only be 15 minutes at most.  I wanted to travel light so I didn't carry anything but the box and a piece of paper and pen with me, not even a bottle of water.  The place I wanted to hide it was a little further down the trail than I remembered, and the place I wanted to hide the box wasn't as good as I remembered it being so I had to find another place, which made me take longer.  I had been in the water all day, so it was hotter than I thought it was, and the return trip to the car was uphill with no shade, so it took a little longer too.  By the time I was halfway back to the car I was feeling the heat a little too much (y'all know my aversion to heat anyway, but this was more than my standard "I hate heat" gripe) and I had to stop pretty often whenever I could find a scratch of shade along the way.  When I got back to the last trail junction, I was literally hoping I could at least make it back to the car.  All of our cell phones were in the car, so even if I reached the car I couldn't call Fearless Fox, and I was not at all sure I could drive.  When I reached the car, I managed to grab a bottle of Gatorade before I cranked the car up and started the A/C.  I sucked down the first bottle and started on a second, being mindful by then not to drink it too fast.  I finally cooled off enough to drive myself back to the swimming area and over to where the rest of my family was, and while I thought I was feeling a little better it was obvious I didn't look good when I saw the alarm on FF's face.  He wanted to take me to the ER and I probably should have gone, but I convinced him to give me an hour or so to rehydrate and cool down, so he went to the concession and got me some popsicles.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Heat exhaustion is nothing to play around with!  Unlike the cold or flu, it isn't a suck-it-up sort of condition.  I never go anywhere without a bottle of water now, even if it's cool.  DRINK!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Before I answer, I'll introduce myself to the group since I just <br>
joined--I'm relatively new to letterboxing, and am absolutely loving <br>
it. I'm the mom of 3 boys (soon to be 4, although it might be a girl <br>
this time...). They letterbox with me on occasion, which is fun--<br>
although sometimes it's nice to take a little break and go <br>
without 'em. :) Oh yeah, I'm in the DFW area. I love the idea of <br>
topic of the week, and reading everyone's experiences helps me learn <br>
a ton! <br>
<br>
I've really only found a handful of boxes so far, and mostly had <br>
great experiences. But one time it was just me and my 3 boys (the <br>
oldest was 4 at the time) and on a muggy day I forgot the bug spray. <br>
Big mistake! It was a very short hike--less than half mile I would <br>
guess--but the boys were whining about the mosquitos the whole time <br>
and were crying and saying they wanted to go back to the car. So <br>
when we finally got to the box, they were almost in hysterics and I <br>
was rushing to stamp in while trying to tune out... um, I mean <br>
comfort :) my boys, and they weren't too excited to stamp in so we <br>
quickly rehid the box and booked it back to the car. I have to say <br>
I've been hesitant to take all the boys without backup since! <br>
Luckily we got away with only one or two mosquito bites, and a <br>
lesson in preparedness! (One that didn't involve any small animals <br>
or snakes, I'm happy to say.)<br>

<div>I guess my worst-thing-while-letterboxing was getting bonked on the head 
hard enough to cut a gash and have blood pouring all over me,  all the 
while trying to remain invisible in the trees just above a very busy Barton 
Creek trail in Austin on a Saturday afternoon.   Like SE, I was 
putting the box back, bending over to get it way back into the hole, and didn't 
see the big sharp stub of a branch sticking out until after I bonked my head 
hard enough to make me see stars.  There I was, leaning back against the 
tree holding my hand to my head, and when I removed it, my hand was covered in 
blood and blood was dripping off my head all over the place.  Of course, 
the only paper I had handy to staunch the bleeding were the pages of clues for 
the rest of that trail, so I crumpled those and pushed them to my bleeding head 
with one hand while scrambling through my backpack with the other, trying 
to find something like tissues or paper towels (which I usually have but 
couldn't find).  I dug out a bottle of Purell antibacterial lotion and 
poured it over my head, all the while worrying about all those joggers, 
strollers, bikers, and families passing below me on the trail - if they saw me 
they'd be sure to think I'd been a mugging victim and I'd be in the ambulance 
before I could say anything, so I was trying to be quiet and 
invisible.   I had no hat, of course, but I managed to pull my hair 
over the bleeding places enough to cover it with my sunglasses on top of my 
head, wipe the worst of the mess off my hands and face with leaves, and 
cautiously made my way back to the restroom at the trailhead and washed up as 
best I could.   I had to throw all the clue sheets away - they looked 
like evidence from a crime scene.   What a headache - for days!  
Probably should have gone for stitches, but the thought of explaining myself was 
worse than a hole in the head.   I learned some lessons, 
too:   look where I'm going, carry extra paper towels and antiseptic, 
and wear a hat!</div>

<div>I was sooo afraid you were going to say the only paper you had was the logbook!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>What a terrible thing to have happen, but when I started reading your story, I realized I've had several near misses with those stumpy protrusions and I guess I'm really lucky, now that I read what happened to you.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I almost always wear sunglasses when I'm outdoors, but I take them off when I'm rehiding a box so I can make sure I'm rehiding correctly.  I don't know if I get so focused on the hiding spot that I don't notice branches sticking out until they are nearly in my eye, or if I'm so used to my sunglasses protecting my eyes that I don't think to watch for them, but I've nearly gotten poked in the eye several times.  It's gotten to where I'm overly cautious when I'm digging around at the base of trees - especially those infernal cedar trees!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems I've made about every letterboxing and hiking mistake known <br>
to man (running out of water, not having bug spray, wearing the wrong <br>
shoes, bonking my head on a branch, reaching into a hole without <br>
checking it first), but I think the worst situation I put myself in <br>
was hiking a very icy trail. It was an unusually beautiful day in <br>
late winter in Connecticut, and I decided to go find a box that was <br>
hidden about 20 miles from my house on the Appalachian Trail. I had <br>
hiked that portion of the trail many times and was quite familiar <br>
with it. In fact I knew a backtrail that would cut through the woods <br>
and get me to the section where the box was hidden faster. So I <br>
decided to take that trail going to the box. It meandered through the <br>
woods and along the back edge of a farm. When I got to the box, I had <br>
to use my hand-shovel to retrieve it since it was buried under a <br>
couple of feet of snow next to a rock fence. No problem. Then I <br>
decided to take the official part of the Appalachian Trail back. The <br>
birds were singing, the sun was shining, there was a gentle breeze, <br>
and I had just found a great letterbox. It was a gorgeous day in New <br>
England and life couldn't be sweeter. This part of the trail hugs the <br>
edge of a cliff, high above the rushing waters of a beautiful river <br>
far below. What I had failed to take into consideration is that it <br>
was winter and the trail is steep, rocky and frozen. There were many <br>
places where I actually had to sit down and scoot along on my rear <br>
end, just to keep from possibly sliding off the side of the mountain <br>
and plunging into the fierce, icy river below. Other places, the <br>
trail was wider and I could "ice skate" in my hiking boots without <br>
fear of sliding off the trail. It took me about 30 minutes to get to <br>
the box, and about two hours to get back. I certainly had visions of <br>
being the lead story on the six o'clock news of the fool-hearted <br>
hiker who plunged off the trail and had been the subject of a massive <br>
rescue operation. I could just see some perfectly coiffed news <br>
anchor, clucking her tongue and shaking her head. However, I arrived <br>
safely back at my Jeep, no worse for the wear. I stopped at the local <br>
general store in Kent for a cup of coffee and there were other hikers <br>
huddled there who asked if I had just come down from the north (far <br>
steeper than the part I had just slid down). It must have been the <br>
muddy stain on my butt that gave it away. Lesson learned? Nothing <br>
really.... but then I'm a slow learner.<br>

I got into letterboxing last year(2007). I decided to get my daughter-<br>
in-law interested. She seemed gun ho. I told her there was a <br>
letterbox somewhere in the Botanical Gardens in Athens that I wanted <br>
to find it and asked her to go with me. It was her first experence <br>
and I think I had found only 2 at the time. I picked her up and we <br>
started out. We got to the Gardens and I said," Ok let me see the <br>
clues." She said," I thought you brought the clues." Neither one of <br>
us had brought the clues. We put our heads together and tried to <br>
remember the clues. We then began to walk the trail. She would say,"I <br>
thought it said pass that bench." I would say," I think we were <br>
suspose to follow that arrow." She said," There was something about a <br>
3 trunked cedar tree." We looked behind and around every 3 trunked <br>
tree in the trail. Do you know how many 3 trunked tree there is at <br>
the Bonical Gardens in Athens? Well, we don't remember but there is a <br>
whole lot. We walked the whole 2 miles of trails and did not find the <br>
box. The next day we drug the whole family out to the Gardens and 2 <br>
copies of the clues and found the box. Lesson...... Allways make sure <br>
YOU have a copy of the clues. Don't depend on the other person to <br>
have them. And....There are a lot of 3 trunked trees in Texas. After <br>
that experence I have noticed the 3 trunked trees. Never did before.<br>

color:maroon'>We were letterboxing in Scottsdale AZ and went after one
interesting box.  There were too many clues to read all at once, so I got
us to the right starting point and my husband and I started off after the
box.  (I’ve made this mistake more than once and now I read all the
way to the end before attempting a box… usually anyway)… We were in
Scottsdale to enjoy one of the great resorts there and also one of us was
having some work done by a plastic surgeon in the area…. And was just a
day post –op.  We started off for the box wearing shorts and tees
and carrying a Big Gulp, our letterboxing backpack and the clues.  We wound
up hiking way into the dessert and up one of those strange mountain things that
jut out of the desert in the area.  We didn’t have water.  We
weren’t wearing the right kind of shoes for mountain climbing (or
anything else really, other than perhaps shopping) and we were so far from our
car I thought we’d never get back.  The “new and improved”
version of one of us – who swore s/he would be fine - was really starting
to break down in the heat and the other wasn’t doing much better. 
The clues started talking about the area being home to snakes, mountain lions,
coyote etc.  We were so far out of our depth.  We were falling down
the mountain more than making progress up it and kept losing our footing in the
scree.  But I could SEE the abandoned mine shaft that hid the box about
150 yards up the mountain and I was determined to get it.  We fell down a
zillion times and scratched ourselves up sliding into cacti.  Finally,
with about 75 yards to go, we gave up – we just couldn’t do it and
I was certain we were going to be eaten by a mountain lion anyway.  It was
a long walk back to the car but we lived to tell – so it was an adventure
and a day to remember – even though we didn’t get the 
box.  The next time we go back we will be more prepared and I definitely want
to try again. –Mama Bee<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Luckily I did have my Camelpac full of water, which I rationed and took the last sip just as I returned to the parking lot. The scree at the top was nearly impossible. It was much easier going up though, than trying to come down. Once you start sliding on that stuff, there's no stopping.

> The scariest thing that has happened to me while letterboxing is <br>
when I went to find the "Jennings Mountain" letterbox in Brownsboro.  <br>
It was a cold and very windy day and for those of you who haven't had <br>
the "pleasure" of finding this box, it's on the very top of a <br>
mountain in a cemetary.  The incline is at about an 80 degree angle.  <br>
Because of the high winds there were a lot of broken tree branches <br>
everywhere, including one on the road that was about 15 feet long and <br>
6-8 inches in diameter.  I stopped the truck and put on the emergency <br>
brake, just in case putting it into park wasn't good enough and I got <br>
out to move the branch.  When I picked it up it broke into several <br>
pieces because it was dead and decayed.  After moving all the pieces <br>
to the side of the road I continued to the top where the cemetary <br>
is.  When I reached the top and parked next to the gate of the <br>
cemetary I noticed a large dog that looked like a husky/retriever but <br>
not being too sure if it was really a<br>
>  dog or a wolf or coyote I decided to stay in the truck to observe <br>
the 4 legged beast for awhile.  I finally decided that it was a <br>
harmless dog just wondering around the parking area so I got out of <br>
my truck and began following the clues to the letterbox.  When I <br>
reached the bush where the box is hidden I squatted down to retrieve <br>
it and something told me to look to my left and when I did I found <br>
myself nose to nose with this dog.  It startled me so bad that I fell <br>
over backwards onto the grave behind me scraping up my right arm and <br>
taking a piece of skin off of the palm of my right hand which I was <br>
using to brace my fall.  There I was flat on my back with my head at <br>
an angle lower than my body and trying to get up and away from this <br>
dog while he's trying to lick me in the face.  <br>
>    <br>
>   I was on my way to meet my daughters (Texas Pokey and Frogkisses) <br>
to do some holiday baking when I stopped to find this letterbox so <br>
when I arrived at Texas Pokey's house I asked her for a bandaid and <br>
Frogkisses asked me if I had been out letterboxing and had gotten <br>
hurt.  I never have been a very good liar or able to make up a good <br>
story so I had to tell them what happened.  They found the whole <br>
situation very funny and they told me that the dog was just trying to <br>
make me feel better by licking me in the face.  Texas Pokey, being a <br>
Girl Scout leader and trained in first aid, took one look at my arm <br>
and said she was going to need a really BIG bandage.<br>

impressed with this jem of a park. The state had gone to some measure to make it 
a nice place to visit. I found the info boards very informative as I hiked 
towards the cache.<br/><br/>Along the way, I spied a big box turtle making his way 
across the path. I briefly thought about picking him up to bring home to my 
kids, but then thought better of it. 1 turtle, and 11 kids equal an instant 
fight. Besides there wouldn't be enough of him to go around. Move along little 
fella...<br/><br/>I get into the general vicinity of the cache, and my GPS starts 
going bonkers due to tree cover. I line up and get cross bearings from a number 
of different compass points, and after marching around a bit, and 45 minutes 
later, I spot the cache and am about to pull the cache when I hear a snap. I 
come out of my cache find euphoria and look in the direction to see what.. a 
dog? No.. RAZORBACK!!<br/><br/>He's about 40ft from me. My first thought is the 
yell ''GIT!'', and I threw my GPS at him (Looking back on that, WHAT was I 
thinking!), then I threw my Cellular at him, then I threw my green cache bag at 
him -all missing the pig.<br/><br/>SNORT!!! He's already mad at me for being in 
his turf, and now he's madder. All I see are tusks, fur, and leaves flying as he 
charges. I back pedaled around a tree behind me, and this sucker's fast, and can 
spin on a dime. As I have nothing left to use, my ''fight'' instincts now 
shifted over to ''flight''. I turned and jumped for this wide tree behind 
me.<br/><br/>(TIME FREEZE)<br/>Have you ever had this happen to you when you did 
something really stupid? This happened at this time. As soon as I made contact 
with the tree, the base of the tree snapped, and down she went. While on the way 
down... I had plenty of time to reflect on the stupidity of this act, as well as 
had the thought that this was going to hurt... Seemed like I was falling for 5 
minutes.<br/><br/>(TIME Continue)<br/>The tree and I hit the ground together, at 
which time I took a shot to the jewels from the trunk. As the tree hits, there's 
a crash, and twigs and sticks are flying. In between the stars and black spots 
I'm seeing, I hear a loud ''Sqweeeeee!!!'' as the Razorback runs off.<br/><br/>I 
extracated myself from the tree, and limped around in a daze for a moment. Ow!! 
I'm mad now, and am about to give out one of those Arnold 
Schwartzenegger/Preditor War yells, but decide better of it, as it'd probably 
come out sounding more like a shrill schoolgirl squeal, given my current 
condition. That'll leave a mark...<br/><br/>I picked up my GPS, Phone, and Bag and 
walked back out to the paved trail and back to my truck. I'm in shock. Once back 
at the truck, I realized that I hadn't opened the cache. Hmmm, I'm not going 
back IN there, not without some Artillary and Heavy Hardware!<br/><br/>A little 
later in the day, I was exhausted and called my wife to let her know I was on my 
way back early. I hadn't told her this story. When I got home, she had my dinner

<br/>A little later in the day, I was exhausted and called my wife to let her know I was on my way back early. I hadn't told her this story. When I got home, she had my dinner ready ..Pork Chops! My wife ...I gotta love her!<br/>
<br/>Took nothing, but left a bunch of small items that flew out of my bag.<br/><br/>--------------------------------------------------------------------------------</span></font></div>
