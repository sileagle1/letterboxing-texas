we were outside letterboxing instead...<br>
<br>
I was just perusing the geocaching site and ran across<br>
something I found interesting:  I have been under the<br>
impression that we didn't really have to get<br>
permission to place boxes in State Parks and State<br>
Forests, but apparently TPWD particularly has a policy<br>
on geocaching:<br>
<br>
http://www.geocachingadmin.com/info/Texas_State_Parks.pdf<br>
<br>
The directive referenced is very clearly for<br>
geocaching and doesn't have any "or other similar"<br>
reference in it.  Unfortunately, the TPWD site is down<br>
at the moment so I couldn't do any further research,<br>
so I'm wondering if we are still flying under the<br>
radar or if we are addressed under a different<br>
operating procedure, or what.  Anyone know anything<br>
more about it and how it relates to letterboxing?<br>
