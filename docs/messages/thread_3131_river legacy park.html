there's probably room there along those 18 miles of trails and woods

are. "<br/>
<br/>
Oh, Viewfinder, you are so sweet!  <br/>
<br/>
I knew RLP was big, so I wondered if it was sort of like the Botanical
Gardens in that it's a kind of "open house" for letterboxes.  I'm still
waiting to get an okay from Kantexan.  If I get it, I'll be planting
next week.<br/>

&gt; I don't know... my "Four Legged Friends" series was launched in August <br/>
&gt; when it was really too hot to do that walk. If you enter Legacy Trails <br/>
&gt; from north Collins (past Green Oaks), you can get my series as well as <br/>
&gt; two other boxes that I know of. One is part of Kantexan's Jazz Quartet <br/>
&gt; series, and the other is (oops) yours. I thought Haunted by Waters was <br/>
&gt; in the original River Legacy section, though I haven't gone to hunt it <br/>
&gt; yet so I could be wrong. I think between the two sides of that mammoth <br/>
&gt; park there is still plenty of room for more boxes.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; .<br/>
I guess I need to go find yours before I plant mine.  I don't want one <br/>
to end up right next to one of yours.  Although, two of mine might <br/>
actually be outside the park.<br/>

<div>Hmmm.... now how did I miss those clues?  Maybe I saw them when they 
were first posted and just haven't been over to look for them, or forgot about 
them.  To my knowledge, there were only the two remaining boxes

<div>I'm still trying to understand how two grown men could actually get so lost in River Legacy Park that they had to be rescued by a helicopter rescue team. However, I've gotten off the trail before in the woods in New England, and it can be totally disorienting trying to find the trail again. I'm looking forward to your boxes too, Stargazer. Should we carry ghost repellent in our backpacks?</div>

</p><div>Hauntings, omg. I wonder if the guy that got lost there with his children and had to be found by helicopter knew about the hauntings. That would freak me out to get lost somewhere and have to be there for a few hours knowing that there might be a story behind the place. Gives me shivers thinking about it.</div>

<div></div>
<div>Along with mosquito and tick and snake repellent, maybe a good idea.  
I do recall that in Kantexan's logbook there were a few references to "the 
biggest copperhead I ever saw!" so I certainly was watchful.  Actually, 
I've seen two snakes recently, both of which were near my own letterboxes 
while I was checking on their status.  I added a little note to the clue of 
the one that's still there (box, not the snake, I hope!) about watching for the 
snake/letterboxguard; the other box  was one that washed away down the 
river and that is now probably in the Gulf of Mexico.  That snake was a big 
one - 5' at least! but not a poison type, just scary.   I think there 
are lots of them out there right now before it gets too chilly, so watch where 
you step and reach! </div>

<div>Speaking of turtles, when I was on the trail at the Houston Arboretum, I met the most gorgeous little turtle I've ever seen. It was just luminous. A golden colored shell and a crimson head. The legs were golden crimson. Just beautiful! He was about six inches long and was as interested in seeing a human as I was in admiring him. Of course, I had left my camera in the car.</div>

Maybe I saw them when they were first posted and just haven't been over to look for them, or forgot about them. To my knowledge, there were onlythetwo remaining boxes in that park, mine (Autumn Gift), which has been there a very long time, and Kantexan's (Haunted by Waters), which was the first box planted there waaaaaay back in summer 2004. I guess that park is getting more crowded than I realized with all those boxes in it. Still there's probably room there along those 18 miles of trails and woods for a few more, especially really good ones like Stargazer's always are. Hope none of them wash into the Trinity River or get picked up by those pesky Letterboxing Ghosts of Legacy Park!</span></div><div><span class="Apple-style-span">Viewfinder</span></div><br/><br/><br/></p><div><hr/><span class="Apple-style-span">See what's new at </span><a href="http://www.aol.com?NCID=AOLCMP00300000001170" target="_blank" title="http://www.aol.com?NCID=AOLCMP00300000001170"><span class="Apple-style-span">AOL.com</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span"> and </span><a href="http://www.aol.com/mksplash.adp?NCID=AOLCMP00300000001169" target="_blank" title="http://www.aol.com/mksplash.adp?NCID=AOLCMP00300000001169"><span class="Apple-style-span">Make AOL Your Homepage</span></a><span class="Apple-style-span">.</span></div><div><br/></div></div><span width="1"><span class="Apple-style-span"></span></span></div><br/></div></span></blockquote></div></div></body></html>
