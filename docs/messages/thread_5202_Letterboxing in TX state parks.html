                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is what is posted in the Help section at LbNA:<br>
<br>
"A cache permit must be completed by the person placing the cache and approved by the Park Superintendent or designee before a cache can be placed on a state park or historic site. The permit must include the exact cache location, including GPS coordinates; name of geocacher placing the cache, a valid address, telephone number, email address (if applicable), driver's license number (if applicable), and the website address on which the cache will be posted." <br>
<br>
I see no mention of letterboxing. The information required clearly refers to a geocache.  Is this an oversight?<br>
