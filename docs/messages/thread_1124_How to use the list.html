                    <div class="plaintext-content">1. The website for the talk list is<br/>
groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas<br/>
There you would find files, links, polls, pictures<br/>
maybe, and you can post directly to the list from<br/>
there.  There is also a chat room there that we've<br/>
used at least once, and maybe we'll start a regular<br/>
chat one of these days.<br/>
<br/>
2. To send an email to the group, the address is:<br/>
letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/>
<br/>
3. If you are having a problem with your email from<br/>
the list, you would email <br/>
letterboxingtexas-owner@yahoogroups.com <br/>
and that will reach both me and Silver Eagle, who is<br/>
also a moderator here (but he, lucky bird that he is,<br/>
has spent most of his summer away from his computer,<br/>
so you're stuck with me!)<br/>
<br/>
As far as initiating an email to an individual, if you<br/>
reply to a message that came through the group, it<br/>
will go back to the group because that is how the<br/>
group is set.  If you want it to go to an individual,<br/>
make sure to take the group address and put their<br/>
address in.  If you can't figure out what their email<br/>
address is, post to the list asking them to email you.<br/>
