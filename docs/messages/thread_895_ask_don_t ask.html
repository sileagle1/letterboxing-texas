<div>I have a box planted at an outdoor folk art extravaganza in 
Houston (The Orange Show) and I asked permission to plant it there, mainly 
because the hiding spot was a little exposed, and also because it is such a 
crazy place that I was just about sure they would say yes.  As well as 
being Mother of Five I also seem to be Mother of Doomed boxes...this one 
actually seems to have survived.  So I guess it just depends a lot on the 
reason for and location of the box.  (What a mighty helpful comment this 
seems to be, sort of like the great, "Because I said so!" answer")  -mother
