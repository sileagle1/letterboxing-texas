                    <div class="plaintext-content">At least you know what happened to that one, although it's never any <br/>
fun to lose a letterbox, especially one in which you have a lot of <br/>
time or travel invested.  Most of the boxes that go missing are <br/>
never heard from again.  One of Lone Star Quilter's Quilt Block <br/>
boxes in Austin, Jacob's Ladder, has been reported missing, and her <br/>
tribute to her Mom in Midland, Guardian of the Record is gone, too.  <br/>
She's a little discouraged about the rash of missing boxes.<br/>

Well, now I don't feel quite as bad about my boxes that go missing <br/>
after hearing all these sad stories. I was really upset when I <br/>
planted one in 7 points park and in a week it was gone so I went to <br/>
the city and asked about planting in their park and they said that it <br/>
was ok. I replanted it and it went missing in less than a week. The <br/>
most amazing thing about it was the place where it was hid was in a <br/>
hole that I dug covered with leaves, sticks and a sorta big rock. The <br/>
leaves were in place. The sticks were in place. It looked like it was <br/>
ok but the rock was missing. When I removed the sticks and the <br/>
leaves, the hole was there but no box. Someone really played a trick <br/>
on me. I looked all around and no rock was in site anywhere. Maybe <br/>
someone needed a rock for their yard decoration. The "Love is in the <br/>

&gt; Sometimes "gone missing" is better than the alternative..."found <br/>
with <br/>
&gt; a human turd in the box", which is the message I got about one of <br/>
my <br/>
&gt; boxes.  YUK!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Well, now I don't feel quite as bad about my boxes that go <br/>
missing <br/>
&gt; &gt; after hearing all these sad stories. I was really upset when I <br/>
&gt; &gt; planted one in 7 points park and in a week it was gone so I went <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; &gt; the city and asked about planting in their park and they said <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; was ok. I replanted it and it went missing in less than a week. <br/>
The <br/>
&gt; &gt; most amazing thing about it was the place where it was hid was <br/>
in a <br/>
&gt; &gt; hole that I dug covered with leaves, sticks and a sorta big <br/>
rock. <br/>
&gt; The <br/>
&gt; &gt; leaves were in place. The sticks were in place. It looked like <br/>
it <br/>
&gt; was <br/>
&gt; &gt; ok but the rock was missing. When I removed the sticks and the <br/>
&gt; &gt; leaves, the hole was there but no box. Someone really played a <br/>
&gt; trick <br/>
&gt; &gt; on me. I looked all around and no rock was in site anywhere. <br/>
Maybe <br/>
&gt; &gt; someone needed a rock for their yard decoration. The "Love is in <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; Air" box is missing, ya'll.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the funniest thing I've have heard in a while.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; LOL...Hang in there!!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most boxers have a few flubs in their first few plants.  My <br/>
&gt; first <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; two?  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planted one in a very well manicured zoo.  Now think about <br/>
it - <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; zoos take<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really, REALLY good care of their facilities, or the good <br/>
ones <br/>
&gt; &gt; do!  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a good zoo... it was probably gone before I had even <br/>
seen <br/>
&gt; the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; monkeys...<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My second one I planted in a historic area and thought that <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planting between<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an old stone cornerpost and the hurricane fence, amongst an <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; accumulation of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaves, would be a great place.  And it was, until they had <br/>
a <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cleanup day<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and the first thing they did was clean the fenceline.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, as a talisman against lawnmowers, you should carve <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; plant a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lawnmower and dare any more lawnmowers to destroy your <br/>
boxes...<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Well, It seems I'm not having very much lucky planting. <br/>
I <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; planted 1<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it was stolen 3 days later so chose not to replace it <br/>
&gt; since <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was not a good place. May try again later at a <br/>
different <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; location.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Then I did a bonus box that decided to play with a local <br/>
lawn-<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; mower and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost. Thank fully the box was found by a letterboxer and <br/>
let <br/>
&gt; me <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he (the stamp/box) was a total loss. My husband the comic <br/>
he <br/>
&gt; is <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; said<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was just another casualty lost to letterboxing.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am placing that one back ASAP since it goes with one <br/>
that <br/>
&gt; &gt; thank<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goodness is hiding in a bush away from sharp objects.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thought you guys would like a little laugh.<br/>
