fun to lose a letterbox, especially one in which you have a lot of <br>
time or travel invested.  Most of the boxes that go missing are <br>
never heard from again.  One of Lone Star Quilter's Quilt Block <br>
boxes in Austin, Jacob's Ladder, has been reported missing, and her <br>
tribute to her Mom in Midland, Guardian of the Record is gone, too.  <br>
She's a little discouraged about the rash of missing boxes.<br>

<div>Most boxers have a few flubs in their first few plants.  My first two?  I planted one in a very well manicured zoo.  Now think about it - zoos take really, REALLY good care of their facilities, or the good ones do!  And this was a good zoo... it was probably gone before I had even seen the monkeys...

Well, now I don't feel quite as bad about my boxes that go missing <br>
after hearing all these sad stories. I was really upset when I <br>
planted one in 7 points park and in a week it was gone so I went to <br>
the city and asked about planting in their park and they said that it <br>
was ok. I replanted it and it went missing in less than a week. The <br>
most amazing thing about it was the place where it was hid was in a <br>
hole that I dug covered with leaves, sticks and a sorta big rock. The <br>
leaves were in place. The sticks were in place. It looked like it was <br>
ok but the rock was missing. When I removed the sticks and the <br>
leaves, the hole was there but no box. Someone really played a trick <br>
on me. I looked all around and no rock was in site anywhere. Maybe <br>
someone needed a rock for their yard decoration. The "Love is in the <br>
Air" box is missing, ya'll.<br>
