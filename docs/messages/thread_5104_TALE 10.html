Thanks to the hosts and all the boxers that gave me and other Event newbies some tips and pointers. The weather was perfect! Seeing cooties being passed around was funny. Since I came by myself, it was nice to be able to hang out with Texas Wench and crew at the tables and on the trails. I was glad to be able to put faces with the names I see on this list and on AQ boards and logs. The only downside was that I didn't win a door prize, but the money was going to a good cause. I'm looking forward to more events.</p>

<p>Yes, it was a fantastic time!  This was our first letterboxing event, and we were completely overwhelmed but had so very much fun!  A heartfelt thank you to everyone who had a hand in the event!  GREAT JOB!  <br/>

<div><font style="background-color: transparent;">I would just echo everything PuddleSplasher said about last weekend and TALE 10, especially the thank-you's to Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, and everyone else involved in planning and organizing the event.  Wonderful event, and especially impressive how you all managed to get such great weather for the weekend, too!  PS and I really enjoyed the hiking trails there and realized that we were passing way too many good boxes in the short time we had to search, so clearly another expedition is called for.  </font></div>
<div><font style="background-color: transparent;"></font> </div>
<div><font style="background-color: transparent;">And I want to add personal thanks to the person (unknown to me) who made those logbooks and donated them to the raffle, which I was lucky enough to win.  I really dread making my own logbooks, which often slows me down when I am inspired to create another letterbox and a new carved stamp, and now I'm set for at least 4 or 5, either new ones or needed maintenance on some oldies-but-goodies!  Thanks, Unknown Logbook Maker Person!  </font></div>
<div><br/>
And I just wish we'd had a little more time to meet more of you face to face.  Maybe next time.  Come on up to the Keller-Ft Worth area and do some boxing and planting anytime!</div>

Pink Cookie and I didn't make it back to DFW until 12:30 last night it was almost dark when we FINALLY left the park and the local cementery lol!  We loved seeing our letterboxing family again and enjoyed our time seeing you and meeting new letterboxers too!  Our box clues are now posted on AQ under the name: Memories of Tall Tales!  We're looking forward to TALE 11 already! Viewfinder I'm glad you like the logbooks! :)<br>

<div>Same here!! Tiger Star and I(Turtlebug) had a great time this being our first event everyone was so helpful and welcoming! The cooties were great and plentiful, if fact my son found 2 in his bag when we got home, please let us know what to do with those?!?! We got so many exchanges and still need to get more so looking forward to the next event! Want to say thanks to BlueButterfly for giving us a run through and getting the ball rolling for us and to Mosaic Butterfly for being so helpful and friendly!! Look forward to getting to know y'all more and more! <br/>Sent from my iPhone</div><div> On Mar 3, 2013, at 11:49 PM, "Dana" &lt;<a href="mailto:danalstokes@yahoo.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" ymailto="mailto:danalstokes@yahoo.com">danalstokes@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><blockquote type="cite"><div>

&gt; To Silver Eagle and Baby Bear and to all the letterboxers who helped make this event so successful: WOW! You've done it again. This is an amazing event and I was so impressed with how organized it was. PERFECTION!<wbr>
&gt; <wbr>
&gt; To All letterboxers in attendance. It was so great seeing you again, and in some cases, meeting boxers I've not had the opportunity to meet before, at least face to face. Thanks for all the wonderful letterboxes and exchanges. It was such a fun, warm group of people. It always amazes me how comfortable letterboxers are with each other!<wbr>
&gt; <wbr>
&gt; To Viewfinder who drove us to the event and put up with me all weekend: Thanks for driving (it's always fun when we have a top-down Miata adventure). I've finally gotten all the tangles out of my hair.  I'm looking forward to the next adventure.<wbr>
&gt; <wbr>
&gt; To all the boxes I didn't have a chance to find yet: Please be safe and take care of yourselves. I WILL RETURN to find you.<wbr>
&gt; <wbr>
&gt; and a special shout out to Baby Bear for keeping me up all night  after I got home, watching the power point presentation disk. What a fantabulous walk down memory lane! I laughed, cryed and laughed again remembering the last eight years I've been a part of this wonderful group. Hats off to you!<wbr>
