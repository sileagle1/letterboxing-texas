<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I think dewberry's 
suggestions are all very good advice when you want to go with kids.  
Especially slowing down and following the kids lead.  My oldest daughter 
enjoys it more than all the other kids, so a letterboxing outing for just the 
two of us is a reward for hard work she has done at school.  And anyone 
from a large family knows what a treat it is to go out with just one kid at a 
time!</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">You are lucky to be 
near Houston, because there is no shortage of boxes to find here! I would 
suggest you look through the clues, and pick boxes that sound interesting to 
your kids.  Telge park is full of Halloween themed boxes which appeal to 
the younger crowd.  The walks are not too long, and there is plenty of 
space to play.  That might be a good place to start.  Mommyaulait, how 
old are your kids?  Dewberry and I might be able to help you out picking 
some boxes around here to start, as we rarely ever go boxing without kids in 
tow.  Have fun!  Mother of Five</font></div></body></html>

But I didn't know it was a veritable hive of letterbox activity. It's neat us and we have gone there to play on many occasions. <br/><br/>My kids are 16,14,4,18 months and a new one in December.  My husband would probably be taking the teenagers and our 4 year old. I'm not interested in my 18 month old traipsing through anything for sometime to come. Growing up further out in the country I can completely understand the warning about spiders, snakes, scorpions and other things crawling around near boxes. So we are hoping to letterbox as a treat with the older kids while I'm out of commission with the younger kids over the next few months. We usually take a lot of walks and what we call Urban Hiking. So all of the kids are used to spending time out doors and enjoying nature.
 <br/>Any help with finding a few good boxes would be appreciated. As I've said in other emails we are investigating the process so that we can do this as respectfully as possible.<br/><br/>Thank you<br/>Mommyaulait<br/><div style="font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 18pt;"><br/><br/><div style="border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin: 5px 0px 5px 5px; padding-left: 5px; font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;">----- Original Message ----<br/>From: the carrascos &lt;a.carrasco@earthlink.net&gt;<br/>To: letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/>Sent: Thursday, November 1, 2007 8:59:31 AM<br/>Subject: [letterboxingtexas] boxing with kids<br/><br/>
