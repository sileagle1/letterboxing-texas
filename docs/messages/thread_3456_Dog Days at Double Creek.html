names and faces together..this is the first meet that i have been to <br>
that is not in my region, and it will not be the last..thank you to <br>
boots tex, lone star quilter for the wonderful cinnamon rolls and <br>
great company...by the way, lucy, i did manage to get him to <br>
sing "take me out to the ballpark" for his cane..sorry you missed it.  <br>
also thanks to dewberry (and of course boots and lone star quilter) <br>
for such a fun event.  i really enjoyed meeting everyone (i don't want <br>
to mention names, because i am afraid of leaving someone out), and <br>
thanks again to pug momma for helping me out with the log book (i <br>
needed a new one and had forgotten to get one out of my car, and she <br>
happened to have a spare one that she gave me).  pug momma, sandibox <br>
and soccerchik, thanks for letting me letterbox with you (and jr says <br>
thanks to mica for the playing)..again thanks to all it was definitely <br>
worth all the drive time today.<br>
