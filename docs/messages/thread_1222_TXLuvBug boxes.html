incredible HAWK had swooped in and planted more boxes in Houston???<br/>
<br/>
Well, East Texas may have its own version of HAWK...the TXLuvBug. A week ago<br/>
Stillwater (LSS) and Vandal( the boxing terrier)took a leisurely drive<br/>
through Jacksonville, Rusk and the surrounding area.<br/>
We couldn't believe how many boxes TxLuvBug has planted in her short career!<br/>
Wow!<br/>
We especially loved the storyline of "A Family Affair" and the delightful<br/>
surprise of "Water from the Rocks" - this is one of those neat spots you'd<br/>
probably drive right by without the promise of a letterbox!<br/>
Unfortunately, (as she already has posted), a couple of her boxes were<br/>
missing, but planted in a park which we really enjoyed anyway.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for adding to the game!<br/>
