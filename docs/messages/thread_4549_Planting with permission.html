They had discovered a letterbox on campus and while they were very courteous about the whole situation (in large part because when the owner found out there was a problem, she was quick to respond and took a conciliatory attitude with the security office), they firmly let us know that letterboxes were NOT welcome on the campus without permission. It seems that when a foreign object like that is found on campus, they don't play around with it - they call out the bomb squad and then stand down later. <br/>
<br/>Since a lot of schools in Texas take their cues on operations from the UT system, I would say that as a general rule schools would like you to ask permission. As far as explaining it to someone, you could take the box itself, your logbook and stamp, and something printed from one of the sites (they both have very good information to help educate about the game). I would think, being a college campus, they may be more attuned to offbeat or avant garde sorts of ideas and might not be as difficult to sway or educate as might be the case in other places.<br/>

<div>About permission for planting a letterbox on campus:  you might contact the campus security office if you want permission (UTA's security office approved a letterbox on that campus after it was found by a landscape worker and turned in as a "suspicious package" and the officer researched letterboxing, contacted the owner, and allowed it to be replanted there).  </div>

<div>But there are a number of letterboxes on campuses without official permission.  They don't always survive long because of high traffic, difficulty in accessible and safe locations, and those overly-enthusiastic and eager landscape workers, but good luck with it.  I've had a box on the SMU campus (Bach's Box) that has been replaced 3 times already, each time because of new construction coming along and moving things -- like lamp posts, bushes, trees, and buildings, and finally it has been retired, or at least temporarily.  </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Yes! I've found both of those boxes, and the key word is PATIENCE! Both boxes were well worth it, but you definitely have to be willing to hang out for awhile waiting for an opportunity. Those campuses are so busy, if not with students walking by, then with maintenance carts or weedwackers nearby. I remember having to wait for the UTA box for what seemed like hours before getting a chance to "flip over a rock". Honestly, by the number of boxes I've had go missing recently in high traffic area (which had been safe for years), I doubt patience and stealth is a priority with all letterboxers today. Also, parking is a problem with most campus boxes. Very few campuses have much available visitor parking, so you nearly always have to plan to go for those boxes on a weekend.<br/>
But... Elwood Fan, if you hide it, we will come!<br/>

As that placer, and an employee or former employee of several universities, I suspect that if you did ask for permission (at least from any of the schools I've been familiar with) the answer would probably be "no".  Universities are very bureaucratic, and overly cautious of lawsuits and safety issues. <br/>
<br/>
I also placed two letterboxes, with permission, in another university's library where I used to work.  But even there, after I left the school the people who had given permsission forgot that they had.  So when one of the boxes was discovered by a student worker it was treated as a potential bomb, even though it was first brought to the attention of the very staff member who had told me it would be fine to hide it!  <br/>
<br/>
At this point I wouldn't place a letterbox on a university campus, even with permission.  Schools are just too touchy about security, institutional memory is too short.  At worst your box may be treated as a safety risk.  At best you'll probably lose it to a cleanup crew.  Instead I would look for a park near the university, and hide it there.  <br/>

Universities are very bureaucratic, and overly cautious of lawsuits and safety issues. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also placed two letterboxes, with permission, in another university's library where I used to work.  But even there, after I left the school the people who had given permsission forgot that they had.  So when one of the boxes was discovered by a student worker it was treated as a potential bomb, even though it was first brought to the attention of the very staff member who had told me it would be fine to hide it!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At this point I wouldn't place a letterbox on a university campus, even with permission.  Schools are just too touchy about security, institutional memory is too short.  At worst your box may be treated as a safety risk.  At best you'll probably lose it to a cleanup crew.  Instead I would look for a park near the university, and hide it there.  <br/>

I still need to get some carving material, so it will be a while before I plant, but hopefully not too long.  My husband attends school at the campus I was considering planting at, so I should have plenty of opportunity to scout out decent areas.<br/>

&gt; About permission for planting a letterbox on campus:  you might contact the campus security office if you want permission (UTA's security office approved a letterbox on that campus after it was found by a landscape worker and turned in as a "suspicious package" and the officer researched letterboxing, contacted the owner, and allowed it to be replanted there).  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; But there are a number of letterboxes on campuses without official permission.  They don't always survive long because of high traffic, difficulty in accessible and safe locations, and those overly-enthusiastic and eager landscape workers, but good luck with it.  I've had a box on the SMU campus (Bach's Box) that has been replaced 3 times already, each time because of new construction coming along and moving things -- like lamp posts, bushes, trees, and buildings, and finally it has been retired, or at least temporarily.  <br/>
