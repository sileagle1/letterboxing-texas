                    <html><body><div>I thought I would let y'all know - after all the discussion about abandoned boxes and so forth, I finally got most of TLB's boxes archived on LBNA (they were already marked as unavailable on AQ).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Quite awhile back, I personally confirmed as missing seven of her boxes and those are the ones I had archived.  I left two here in Jacksonville which continue to get reports of being found, so they appear to be active.  I also left alone her boxes in Missouri, which I had tried to confirm in some way but was unable to.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SO - for anyone who has clues printed out for the Jacksonville area, don't look for any of hers except Big Bass Bonanza and A Family Affair - those are the only two that are active anymore.  One of these days, I'll get out to check on those also, but since they continue to get reports of being found, I figure they're fine for the time being.
