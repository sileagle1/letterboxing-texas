This is a lengthy report - covering my FMSP hike with Writer Joe-Nick Patoski<br/>
and Photographer Laurence Parent of Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine, and their<br/>
hike on the Franklin Mountains Ridgeline.  The mission was to gather information<br/>
and photographs for an article in Texas Parks and Wildlife Magazine.  This<br/>
mission has been successfully completed.<br/>
<br/>
Let me first express my thanks to my boss Joe Russell and my employer El Paso<br/>
Electric Co., for allowing me to take 1-1/2 days off during our busy overhaul<br/>
season.  Thank you boss.  You don't need to read beyond the hours - unless you<br/>
wish to.<br/>
<br/>
Volunteer Hours.<br/>
<br/>
15 Dec 2008.  Mike - 6 hours.  Monika - 3 hours.<br/>
16 Dec 2008.  Mike - 14 hours.  Monika - 4 hours.<br/>
<br/>
15 Dec.  <br/>
<br/>
I took 4 hours off to meet Joe-Nick and Laurence at the airport and guide them<br/>
to meet John Moses at the TPWD HQ on Clark St.  After a false start due to an<br/>
aircraft delay it all worked out.  I linked up with them just outside El Paso<br/>
International Airport.  I led them to the TPWD HQ where the meeting with John<br/>
Moses lasted about 90 minutes, covering the proposed hike route, safety and<br/>
other information.  It was decided to take the trail from south to north as I<br/>
had recommended.  This later proved to be a good idea.<br/>
<br/>
After meeting with John Moses we left TPWD HQ and I led them to the trailhead at<br/>
the Thousand Steps Trail / North Stanton St. for photographs.  We hiked part-way<br/>
up Thousand steps trail and made use of the daylight and the low sun-angle to<br/>
photograph the mountains with dramatic shadows showing the rugged spurs and<br/>
arroyos.  We got back to our vehicles in the dark - which turned out to be good<br/>
practice as the following day the hike was extended far longer than was<br/>
anticipated.<br/>
<br/>
I next led them to their motel.  We made plans to meet for dinner after they got<br/>
checked in.  Moni and I had a fine dinner With Joe-Nick and Laurence at the<br/>
State Line restaurant in Sunland Park NM.  We discussed final plans for the hike<br/>
the following morning.  All was ready.<br/>
<br/>
16 Dec.<br/>
<br/>
I took the whole 8-hour day off to guide the hike.  Moni was our safety and<br/>
ground contact for this hike.  She was also our transportation to the trailhead,<br/>
and our pick-up when we were finished in Fussleman Canyon.  Thanks Moni.<br/>
<br/>
Shortly before sunrise Moni and I were on the way to pick up Joe-Nick and<br/>
Laurence at the motel.  All the gear was loaded up in the dog-show van, and we<br/>
were on our way to the Thousand Steps trailhead again.  After unloading a quick<br/>
combat pack-check and a quick radio check, we were on the trail just after<br/>
sunrise.  Moni went home, but she was monitoring the ham radio either at the<br/>
house or from the dog-show van all day for any needs or emergencies we might<br/>
have had.  Several other ham operators were also monitoring - just in case.<br/>
Fortunately, our regular contacts were nothing but progress reports.  At<br/>
important points along the route Joe-Nick would ask for information from my GPS.<br/>
Distance, present elevation, elevation gain, Lat/Lon location, time moving and<br/>
time stopped, etc.  So the GPS was initialized, cleared and checked just before<br/>
departing the trailhead.<br/>
<br/>
The morning started out just perfect for a hike.  I had a sweatshirt on, but I<br/>
soon discovered I was over-dressed and I pulled it off.  Even so, we were<br/>
actually warm during the climb-portion of the Thousand Steps trail.  There were<br/>
frequent pauses for photography.  Otherwise the climb was mostly un-eventful,<br/>
reaching the WATSP Ridgeline Trail #1 junction in a little over an hour.  There<br/>
was a gentle breeze of about 10 mph on the west side of the ridge which helped<br/>
to keep us somewhat cooled during the climb.  At the intersection of Ridgeline<br/>
Trail #1 and the Directissimo Trail we got behind the bluff on the east side of<br/>
the ridge.  This is where we left the official trail and took the trail to the<br/>
MRE site.  Soon jackets were taken off as we were very warm from the 1300 ft<br/>
climb.  But just a 1/4 mile along the trail we climbed up the cut and again got<br/>
on to the ridgeline.  The wind-chill soon had the jackets back on.  It was like<br/>
that all day long, chilled on the west side and warm on the east side.  <br/>
<br/>
Just 1/2 mile later and with permission from Roger O'Dell of MRE, we entered the<br/>
TV-station fence through the gate.  Joe-Nick and Laurence were instructed that<br/>
the story must state that the station area be bypassed to the left around the<br/>
fence.  This was fully understood.  I checked the MRE doors and locks as we<br/>
passed by.  All was secure Roger, and Thanks.  <br/>
<br/>
Since I had the keys to the ham radio room along, we went inside for our one and<br/>
only chance to sit and rest out of the sun and wind.  We had a short snack and<br/>
topped off our water supply from the bottled water I had pre-positioned there<br/>
ahead of time.  After a short rest and a quick inspection of our radio gear it<br/>
was lights-out and door-locked, then back on the trail.  Once outside the MRE<br/>
fence to the north we were totally off-trail for the next few miles.<br/>
<br/>
The hike continued with lots of scrambling, rock-hopping and cactus-dodging.  It<br/>
is a rugged trail - if it can be called a "trail" at all.  More of a "suggested<br/>
path" to follow.  My 4 previous exploration trips paid off well as we were able<br/>
to traverse the more dangerous areas without difficulty.  We were moving slower<br/>
than I had anticipated.  However, this was not a normal hike, and I was not<br/>
really guiding "tourists".  The mission was to gather information leading to a<br/>
magazine article.  Photographs are an important part of that mission.  Joe-Nick<br/>
and Laurence are both experienced hikers, I was not really concerned.  So we<br/>
moved a bit slower.  The two really rough areas just before the Government Radio<br/>
Site slowed us down significantly.  During that climb we noticed a helicopter<br/>
circling the area.  Although out of sight to our north I recognized the sound of<br/>
rotor blades unloading - meaning they were landing.  Upon clearing the final<br/>
climb to the Government Radio Site we saw the helicopter was landing on the<br/>
Government Radio Site Helipad.  It was the USBP MD-500 (Loach).  The winds were<br/>
picking up, and the pilot was doing a very good job of landing and taking off in<br/>
the winds.  This is a guy to remember should you ever need a rescue.  I have<br/>
seen lots of chopper-pilots.  This guy was as good as I have seen in the wind.<br/>
I signaled them with my rescue mirror, and we all waved.  They did not appear to<br/>
see us.  Glad we didn't need a "rescue"!  This was the point where I had the<br/>
Gatorade previously cached, so we picked it up and had a seat on the Government<br/>
Radio Site foundation for a short rest.  After the difficult climb the Gatorade<br/>
tasted great.  And it was even well-chilled from the cool nights under the<br/>
rocks!<br/>
<br/>
Mike-6, nothing has changed at the Government Radio Site since my previous<br/>
report to you and Ft. Bliss.<br/>
<br/>
After a short rest, we continued north.  There were two more peaks to pass<br/>
before we started the long descent into the McKelligon Canyon saddle.  It was<br/>
during this part of the hike that the winds increased.  Once again my<br/>
exploration trips paid off well as we were able to get to the McKelligon Canyon<br/>
saddle easily.  By the time we hit the saddle I estimate that the wind speeds<br/>
were 35-40 mph sustained and 50+ gusts.  We stopped in the saddle and discussed<br/>
the trail ahead, the weather situation, the incoming cloud cover, and the time.<br/>
It was unanimously decided that we would continue along the Ron Coleman Trail to<br/>
finish the hike as planned.  At this point we saw a few rangers at the<br/>
McKelligon Canyon Trailhead.  We waved, but did not see an answering wave.  We<br/>
pressed on.<br/>
<br/>
The climb up the southern end of the Ron Coleman Trail is mostly on the eastern<br/>
side of the crest, so the winds were not very bothersome.  By this time and with<br/>
the worst mostly behind us - we were a bit tired.  But the cloud cover was<br/>
making it difficult for Laurence to take the kind of photographs he needed.  He<br/>
did his best and we pressed on.  I must say Mother Nature did her best to<br/>
accommodate the hike.  At places where there were significant features to<br/>
photograph, the sun peeked out enough to give the grass a nice golden glow or to<br/>
put stark shadows into the deep arroyos while highlighting the spurs.  Then the<br/>
sun would disappear behind the clouds and we would hustle along the trail again.<br/>
<br/>
The Window was every bit as difficult as I expected it to be.  With the wind<br/>
blowing it was quite difficult indeed.  John Moses, perhaps I was wrong.  This<br/>
time I wish there had been a safety-chain at the Window.  Also, at the next two<br/>
climbs above the Window it would have also been nice.  I was not really<br/>
frightened.  But I was certainly glad it was behind us.  We stopped above the<br/>
worst of the climbs, and Joe-Nick and Laurence both said they were glad we<br/>
followed my suggested path starting south instead of north.  Going down at the<br/>
Window in that wind would have been really difficult.<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; From above the Window to the highest point along the trail just <br/>
below the FAA<br/>
&gt; towers we were again sheltered from the wind.  As we reached the <br/>
highest point<br/>
&gt; of the hike, Mother Nature once again co-operated by allowing the <br/>
sun to come<br/>
&gt; out.  Laurence was almost frantically shooting in every direction <br/>
trying to<br/>
&gt; capture the beauty that surrounded us in the golden light of the <br/>
setting sun.  I<br/>
&gt; would guess we spent 30-45 minutes in this one spot.  It was <br/>
magnificent.  As<br/>
&gt; the clouds took away the sun, we started the descent into Upper <br/>
Fussleman<br/>
&gt; Canyon.  We moved slowly as the trail was quite loose here.  At the <br/>
junction<br/>
&gt; Laurence and I took the short detour to the Mammoth's Trunk while <br/>
Joe-Nick<br/>
&gt; continued slowly down the path to Smuggler's Pass.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Laurence and I were rewarded with a final burst of sunlight at the <br/>
Mammoth's<br/>
&gt; Trunk.  Laurence was again frantically shooting at every angle.  <br/>
Snow-capped<br/>
&gt; Sierra Blanca Mountain was clearly visible at 21 and 111.5 miles <br/>
away.  But<br/>
&gt; again the sun departed, and left us with a cloudy sunset.  We <br/>
hustled down the<br/>
&gt; trail in an attempt to catch Joe-Nick.  Laurence was trying to <br/>
shoot more photos<br/>
&gt; in the failing light.  We all met on the final ridge before <br/>
dropping into<br/>
&gt; Fussleman Canyon.  It was past sunset now.  This was the point <br/>
where I was to<br/>
&gt; call Moni on the radio and alert her to the fact we were going to <br/>
lose radio<br/>
&gt; contact in the canyon and she should start out to make the pick-up. <br/>
She<br/>
&gt; surprised me by answering immediately and stating that she was at <br/>
the pick-up<br/>
&gt; point and waiting for us.  She said she was worried that we didn't <br/>
call her, so<br/>
&gt; she wanted to be there before sunset.  I have such a thoughtful <br/>
wife.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We began our descent in the failing light.  We negotiated the <br/>
switchbacks, but<br/>
&gt; upon reaching the canyon floor I suggested we break out our <br/>
headband lamps.<br/>
&gt; There was no reason for an injury with over 90-% of the hike safely <br/>
completed.<br/>
&gt; Moni swung the dog-show van around to put the head-lamps on as much <br/>
of the trail<br/>
&gt; as she could light for us.  We completed the hike in the darkness, <br/>
1 hour past<br/>
&gt; sunset.  Tired but well-pleased at out accomplishment, we loaded <br/>
into the<br/>
&gt; dog-show van for the trip down and some rest.  Van seats never felt <br/>
so good.<br/>

&gt; Joe-Nick and Laurence, please go to the site and write a trail <br/>
review.  I don't<br/>
&gt; expect there will be many hikers on this trail to write reviews.  <br/>
THANKS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We drove Joe-Nick and Laurence to the motel, then Moni and I went <br/>
home.  I<br/>
&gt; needed to clean up, as did Joe-Nick and Laurence.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; About two hours later we met at the Jackson's restaurant at Mesa <br/>
and Remcon<br/>
&gt; Circle for a well-earned dinner.  A few of my hiking and ham-radio <br/>
friends were<br/>
&gt; invited, and we had a great time.  Unfortunately, it had to end.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Joe-Nick and Laurence - I had a great time.  Thanks.  Come back <br/>
when you can<br/>
&gt; stay a while.  Better yet - why not move to El Paso?  I could use a <br/>
few good<br/>
&gt; hiking friends.  Boss - thanks for allowing me the time to do <br/>
this.  Roger<br/>
&gt; O'Dell, thanks for allowing us a nice place to rest.  John Moses, <br/>
thanks for he<br/>
&gt; help in getting this put together.  Moni - thanks for your support, <br/>
on the<br/>
&gt; exploratory hikes as well as the big day.  It would have been much <br/>
more<br/>
&gt; difficult without you.  And thanks to my friends Larry K, Doug-9 <br/>
and Jeff-5 for<br/>
&gt; helping me explore the trails, as well as the other hams who <br/>
monitored our<br/>
&gt; progress and stood by ready to help.  And last, thanks to the <br/>
Rangers at FMSP<br/>
&gt; and WATSP for your support.  We make a great team!  I have a lot of <br/>
good<br/>
&gt; friends.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Merry Christmas to all.<br/>

<p>That's very impressive, Mike. I'm familiar with Laurence Parent's 
  <br/>reputation as a world-class photographer. I'll look forward to <br/>seeing 
  the article in the TPWD magazine. I'm sure you discussed <br/>letterboxing with
