be excited once we start this.  We will decide on a name soon.  We <br/>
often head to Austin and San Antonio, so it looks like we are in for <br/>

boxing. I don't think you'll be dissapointed. If you have any <br/>
questions, don't be shy. Also, I've made a postal letterbox that is <br/>
only available to letterboxers in Texas, and I'll be sending it out <br/>
next week.  If you'd like it, just email me your mailing address off <br/>
list and I'll add you to the list.  If you don't know what a postal <br/>
letterbox is, try this <br/>
