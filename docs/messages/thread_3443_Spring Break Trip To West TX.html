                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm back from my family's Spring Break trip to West TX and wanted to <br>
give some of the highlights to entice you to visit this part of our <br>
state.  I managed to place 15 boxes, 8 in new counties, to serve as <br>
a "breadcrumb trail" leading you there and back.  I also moved my <br>
Displaced Donkey microbox to Balmorhea SP, which was crying for a <br>
box, and placed Paisano Pete in Fort Stockton where the Donkey used <br>
to be.<br>
<br>
We left Saturday, 3/15/08, about 12:30 after my son's merit badge <br>
class and headed for Junction, where we camped at South Llano River <br>
SP.  I was impressed by this park and it looked like a fun place to <br>
tube in the summer, so  I placed Junction Boys microbox there.  The <br>
next day we headed for the Davis Mountains area of TX where we stayed <br>
2 nights at the Limpia hotel in Fort Davis.  On the way I placed <br>
Sonora Butterfly at a rest area off I10 near Sonora and Paisano Pete <br>
in Fort Stockton.  I picked up Displaced Donkey and moved it to <br>
Balmorhea SP, a great place to cool off in the summer.  For those of <br>
you who already visited the Paisano Pete statue to stamp the Donkey <br>
box, you can visit again to stamp the new box dedicated to it.<br>
<br>
While in Fort Davis I placed another box (Vanguard 1) in Davis Mts <br>
SP, but on a different trail than my McDonald Observatory microbox.  <br>
Normally I don't like to place more than 1 box at a site, but I <br>
needed to place this box on March 17 and that is where I found myself <br>
on that date.  The date marks the 50th anniversary of the launch of <br>
Vanguard 1 satellite, the oldest human-made object still in space.  <br>
Not many people remember it, including several amateur astronomers at <br>
McDonald Observatory, but I think it is quite an accomplishment and <br>
deserves to be remembered at least through letterboxing.  <br>
<br>
Speaking of McDonald Observatory, that is still one of my favorite <br>
places to go see objects in space at one of their Star Parties.  I <br>
always see or learn something new, and this time was no different.  <br>
As we sat listening to the astronomer talk, he casually mentioned <br>
that in a few minutes we would be able to see an Iridium Flare.  I <br>
had never heard of it before and he explained that it is one of <br>
several telecommunication satellites in low Earth orbit operated by <br>
the Iridium Corporation.  Each has antennas with highly reflective <br>
surfaces that can be seen by ground observers when the angle with the <br>
Sun is just right, and it just so happened that it was going to <br>
happen that night.  At the appointed time we saw the satellite grow <br>
brighter until it made a flash almost like a camera.  It was awesome!<br>
<br>
The next day was cold and cloudy as we headed through the mountains <br>
on our way to El Paso.  The temperature was about 34 degrees and we <br>
actually came across snow on the ground!  Of course I stopped and we <br>
had a great snowball fight, then we built a small snowman on the hood <br>
of the car against the windshield that lasted quite a ways down I10.  <br>
Once in El Paso, I talked the family into letting me letterbox at <br>
Franklin Mountains SP and I managed to find a few, including my first <br>
one by Desert Warrior.  I also left him a new box called Glory Road, <br>
near UTEP campus.<br>
<br>
The next morning we headed to Hueco Tanks SP for our 10:30 rock art <br>
tour.  We got there early so I was able to find the Hueco Tanks <br>
letterbox that Mike just placed.  Both the box and the tour were <br>
great, and I highly recommend going to this park.  I see why Mike has <br>
so much fun climbing around on all those rocks!<br>
<br>
Now we started heading back home, but via a different route.  We went <br>
past Guadalupe Mountains NP, where I found Mike's box at the rest <br>
area.  I was the first letterboxer to find it, but surprisingly a <br>
group of kids had accidentally found it several months earlier, even <br>
though the box is under several large rocks.  We then drove to Pecos, <br>
where I placed my Pecos Cantaloupe microbox, and on to Monahans <br>
Sandhills SP where we camped for the night.  The next morning I <br>
placed my Sand Surfing microbox, then we rented disks and surfed the <br>
dunes.  It was a lot of fun, but hard work climbing back up the giant <br>
dunes.<br>
<br>
Next we headed to Odessa and Midland, where I found a few boxes and <br>
placed my Friday Night Lights minibox.  I did not have the time to <br>
find all the boxes in that area so will have to come back some day.  <br>
I was able to go to the Meteor Crater, though, and it was very <br>
interesting.<br>
<br>
We continued east through Glasscock & Sterling counties, where I <br>
placed Gone To Texas and Windmill City microboxes.  The next stop was <br>
San Angelo SP where I planned to camp, but the family was anxious to <br>
get home so I just placed my Fort Concho minibox and we drove on.  We <br>
drove through Eden, where I placed Cow Patty Bingo, then found a <br>
motel in Brady for the night.  <br>
<br>
It turned out to be a good thing that we stayed in Brady instead of <br>
camping at San Angelo, because I found a great little BBQ place that <br>
I would never have gone to.  It is called Hard 8 BBQ, and they have <br>
all kinds of meat that you order outside where the cook removes it <br>
right from the grill onto your plate.  Now this town is known for its <br>
Goat Cook-Off every year, and in fact that is the name of the <br>
microbox I placed there the next morning, so you can also order <br>
Cabrito.  Unfortunately, they only offer it on Fri-Sun, and it was a <br>
Thursday when I was there.  Oh well, I got brisket and sausage and <br>
headed inside to pay and eat.  The lady told us there was a <br>
complimentary pot of beans, along with pickles, onions and sauce by <br>
the tables, then asked what we wanted to drink.  I asked what they <br>
had and she rattled off several soft drinks, then said "and <br>
complimentary beer".  I did a double-take and asked if she just said <br>
FREE beer?  She said yes and explained that the owner feels so <br>
strongly about having beer available for BBQ eaters that he offers it <br>
free since he can't sell it in that city.  She then said in an <br>
apologetic tone that all they had that night was Shiner Bock.  I <br>
thought of Mother Of Five, smiled to myself, and said "that'll be <br>
fine".<br>
<br>
The next morning we drove through Mason, home of Fred Gipson, the <br>
author of Old Yeller, and I placed a box dedicated to him.  Then it <br>
was on to Inks Lake SP where I found a couple of boxes and placed <br>
Devil's Waterhole microbox on a nice hike.  It was here that I first <br>
saw that JB Kokopelli was nearby since she had stamped in that very <br>
day.  I ended up following her to Longhorn Cavern SP to find the <br>
boxes there but never ran into her.<br>
<br>
After that we went straight home and started getting ready for Easter <br>
company.  It was a lot of driving (almost 2000 miles) but also a lot <br>
of fun and I highly recommend a similar trip.  I hope y'all had a <br>
great Easter!<br>
