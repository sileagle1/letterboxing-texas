                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello everyone. Took advantage of the fair weather here in southeast <br>
Texas to search for a few letterboxes. <br>
Found Silver Eagles Anahuac Anhinga Microbox without trouble. It is <br>
in great shape and has been unvisited since he placed it (except for <br>
me finding it today). Also located Baby Bears Coastal Night Light <br>
without trouble. Was in great shape also and I was the first to <br>
stamp since the letterbox was placed. Looked for Janis Joplin <br>
Microbox in Port Arthur but had no luck. All in all a pretty good 4 <br>
hours of letterboxing. Drove about 200 miles to get to those 3 boxes <br>
but it is kind of a circle back to my house. <br>
If you have never been to Anahuac you would not believe that there <br>
is a place there. I had never been there and was amazed that there <br>
was such a community. Saw some nice birds but it was too chilly for <br>
alligators. If you like coastal wetlands you will definately enjoy <br>
this trip. I do plan on going back when the gators will be sunning. <br>
Happy Boxing<br>

PS: made reservations to camp at Bastrop Park. Will be there for the <br>
gathering. <br>
