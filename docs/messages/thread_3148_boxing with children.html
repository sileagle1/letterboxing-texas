                    <div class="plaintext-content">In response to Mommyaulait's question, I thought I'd post some of my<br>
thoughts about boxing with children.  Everyone, feel free to add on!<br>
<br>
1.  I've found it's best to set up the outing so that it's a success<br>
whether the box is there or not.  If you focus solely on retrieving<br>
the box, you may be disappointed, either because it's not there or<br>
because you couldn't find it.  So...find some trees to climb, some<br>
tadpoles to watch, some stones to skip if you're out in the woods.  If<br>
you're in the city, choose a park with an unusual playground or<br>
something nearby that will spark their interest.  Some people want to<br>
"prefind" to make sure the box is there so their kids won't be<br>
disappointed.  I personally think that they're missing a life lesson.<br>
 Sometimes you just can't find the box--that's part of it.<br>
<br>
2.  Snacks.  I cannot emphasize this enough.  Cool snacks they can<br>
only get when hiking.<br>
<br>
3.  You will want to do more boxes than they will.  Stop when they're<br>
finished or you'll have a harder time getting them out there the next<br>
time.<br>
<br>
4.  It's fun for them to retrieve the box, but you need to supervise.<br>
 And you should probably be the one to open it.  Not all box images<br>
are suitable for children, although the vast majority of them are.<br>
<br>
5.  Teach them not to scream, "WE FOUND IT" at the top of their lungs.<br>
 Some families use another code word which to them means the same<br>
thing, but no one else would understand.<br>
<br>
6.  You should reseal.  And you should rehide, at least at first.  If<br>
you let your kids do it, check their work.  Look at the box from all<br>
angles to make sure it's securely hidden. <br>
<br>
7.  Most of all, have fun.  This is a great opportunity to be outside<br>
with your kids and your family.  Letterboxing has been a great vehicle<br>
for us to share our love of hiking and being outdoors with our kids.  <br>
<br>
<br>
I think of our logbook as the scrapbook of our times together.  In the<br>
beginning, I focused on getting more finds (of course it was harder to<br>
rack up finds then), but we've found that it works better for us to<br>
focus on quality instead of quantity.  We'll never find them all, so I<br>
give up on that as our goal.  Instead, we try to enjoy each box as it<br>
comes, on its own terms.  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">These are great suggestions and I can only add a word of safety to this <br>
one.  Make sure whoever retrieves the box uses a stick or something <br>
else to warn any critters that might be lurking around the box.  I <br>
don't want to scare you off, but snakes, scorpions, spiders, etc. <br>
sometimes like the same places boxes do.  If you are careful, you can <br>
turn a potentially scary situation into a "cool" nature lesson.  Have <br>
fun!<br>
