                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, I've almost recovered.....What fun we had!   From starting out Friday morning at 6am to pick up Silver Eagle and visit painted churches, cemeteries, and getting old boxes... to a night at the Texas Grill, who served us well and the set up was great (Thanks Mosaic B!), then back to campground to find cub scouts had parked trailer in our site, then finally to be at 11pm.   Sat. started early with trying to find some boxes at 7am, then picking up the keys, visiting with friends, the finding a hord at the pavillion waiting to get in at 9am.   All helped with set up, and the rest of the day is a blur for me (setup, presentation, raffle, lunch, exchanges, meeting new boxers, dinner, cleanup, snacks, night boxing), but no letterboxing on the trails.  Sunday, hit the trails early to find over 50 boxes (some took us awhile, and still did not find one).  Did not make it to Bastrop, so will get those in a few week.   <br>
<br>
To all that came, I hope I got a chance to thank you in person for coming, but if not...THANK YOU!   To those who contributed to the raffle, I hope you had fun and we appreciate the funds to help pay for the event and prizes.   This year's pavillion was our most expensive (but worth it!), and we collected enough to pay for all the costs and all the prizes.  I still think this is a fun way to share the costs, but if anyone has better idea please share.   To those that helped with setup, copies, equipment, food, clean up, etc, thanks!  Your efforts are always appreciated.  This group is what is good about this country.   Many great stamps, cooties, and food.   Thank you Open Spaces for the log book, it will be put to good use.  For our out of state guests, please come again, and bring friends.   Texas is a great place, and I hope you felt that.  Boots & LSQ - I alway value our time together, and our conversations.  Y'all are the Statesmen (& Stateswoman if that is more appropriate) of Texas Letterboxing.  And if I forgot anything, please know I values the time spent with all of you, thus why we chose not to go find boxes on Saturday to spend more time talking to multiple people. <br>
<br>
Now on to next year......Plan is for Huntsville State Park (but can not reserve until next month, so that is not locked in yet).   Theme is under construction and will be released at time we book the pavillion.  <br>

Last item.  If for some reason you did not get a disk with the TALE of Tales Presentation, please email me offline (babybearlb2002@yahoo.com) and I can email you the PDF or Powerpoint file (let me know which you want.  <br>

Finally adding my ditto to all the comments and kudos and thank you's. Each year gets better and better. I'm still logging in my finds, and Bird Dog is catching up on sleep. We have scheduled tomorrow night to sit and watch the video together. Thank you BB! We had a wonderful time seeing familiar faces and meeting new ones. This is indeed a wonderful group of people. We are blessed to be a part.<br>
Thank you, everyone! Looking forward to 2014!<br>
Bloomin Gramma Jo with Bird Dog<br>
