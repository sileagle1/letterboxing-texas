                    <html><body><p>As y'all recall, the Tyler State Park park superintendent took my permit request by email, based on information I gave him from the website. I promised him I would go last Sunday to check the boxes and correct anything deficient. I learned in the meantime that I am going to camp at the same park this coming weekend and I thought about putting off my trip, but since I had committed, I decided I didn't need to tempt the ranger's goodwill. So off I went on a coolish overcast afternoon, shorts and sweatshirt weather for me - couldn't be better! <br/>
<br/>I went first for my own box, and found it gone. Bummer! It had been in place for nearly five years. Some sign movement made me understand why at least one person had had a really hard time finding it and I was preparing to rewrite the clues to make it a little better, but since it was gone, there was no need. It had been long enough since I had been to check it that I had to hike the trail both ways to finally find the hiding spot. I've no doubt I was in the right spot and frankly, I think it may have been one of my worst hides in retrospect. I hid it in a hole at the base of a tree - not a standard old hole like you can neatly tuck a box away and hide it with sticks and rocks, but a HOLE. Maybe a foot deep way back then. The hole had eroded quite a lot and ran deep into the roots of the tree, deep enough that my box may have been down there somewhere, but I couldn't reach deep enough to find it. I fear I may have contributed to its erosion by directing people there to poke around. Or it may have been Ike, or flooding, or any number of things. But it pains me to think it might have been my box. Note for the next hide...<br/>
<br/>I went on to find Northstar's two boxes, catching a light rain once I got far enough down the trail to make it impractical to turn back. As I followed the first set of clues, I stopped to take a few pictures with my phone on the dam of the lake. A ranger drove across one way, then came back the other and stopped and asked me if I was geocaching. I told him, no, I was letterboxing. He was perplexed and I was inclined to explain since I was there to get honest anyway. I pulled out my stamp and logbook and he caught on real quickly. He then told me he had a cache in the park - deep in. He commiserated about the paperwork being a pain in the neck. <br/>
<br/>I went on and found the two boxes that belong to NorthStars. One of them was on the very edge of a recent burn and was in fact, melted closed by its proximity to the fire. The content had gotten wet because of the compromised box and the fact that the last finders had left the baggies completely unsealed. The stamp was carved from MasterCarve and it had begun to break down because it sat in standing water. I didn't know that would happen. I was prepared to go as far as to replace the container on the spot, but I decided the only salvageable part of the box was the stamp, and that was going to have to have some serious drying. <br/>
<br/>I found the second box well hidden and safe, but I went ahead and pulled it also to do a thorough cleaning. <br/><br/>Now I had emailed NorthStars the middle of last week, but hadn't heard back from them before I left. I had offered to adopt their boxes, but I really didn't want to be presumptuous. Still though, I decided it might be safe to treat them as my own since it had been a few days and they needed some work - AND since I knew I would be back in the park this coming weekend. As it turns out, they wrote me back Sunday afternoon while I was gone to the park! It was good to hear from them, and they said it would be okay for me to take their boxes on. I emailed them up and updated them on what I had found and to make sure they really didn't mind if I adopt their boxes.<br/>
<br/>I emailed the superintendent with my findings, but I haven't heard back from him. Tyler State Park is a pretty hardy park, so I don't think there is much area that could be damaged with reasonable placement of boxes. I think that if we were to plant the area up like Easter eggs, it wouldn't be too cool, but the park has lots of trail that could take a box or two. <br/>
<br/>A few things struck me on this trip out: <br/><br/>1) holes look better than they are - there are lots of ways for them to go wrong, the least of which is boxes floating up and out and the most of which might be contributing to erosion. <br/>
<br/>2) Good containers are a good investment. The two boxes I found weren't in top-notch boxes, but they weren't in disposable containers either. They were in reasonably good condition, but I could tell they were starting to break down (or melt). <br/>
<br/>3) Inner baggies are still valuable, even in LnL's which could melt too. Forests and parks seem to be doing burns more regularly, so that's a consideration we need to take into account. <br/><br/>4) and finally, I found myself looking at boxes and hiding places as a ranger would since I knew I would be reporting back where the boxes were. I think that was a good thing. I took a harder look at the details than I have before.<br/>
<br/>And so - I think it was a good trip out. Still waiting for the final response from the ranger. I'll be planting at least one new box this next weekend, so I'll see how it goes taking the process from start to finish in the right order.<br/>

1) holes look better than they are - there are lots of ways for them to go wrong, the least of which is boxes floating up and out and the most of which might be contributing to erosion.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I concur!  We once went looking for a box in a cemetery in Louisiana.  I guess it was supposed to be a manage-able size hole (he mentioned bringing a stick to fetch out the box), but that hole had deepened and widened so that it was three feet deep when we were there looking at it.  No how, no way I'm getting a box out of a hole like that, stick or no stick...and this was just a few months after the box had been found. <br/>
<br/>
Conversely, today on our way home from Bastrop, we found a box that had been hidden in a rock cairn more than 8 years ago.  Dry and toasty and found from time to time over that period.  It really makes you think about your placements and how to ensure the longevity of your boxes, doesn't it?<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, here in Houston, we have no rocks.  I sometimes import a piece of concrete, but there are no rocks to be had around, only matter that will eventually degrade.<br/>
