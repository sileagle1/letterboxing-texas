</p><div>Stargazer announced a new series this morning which will only be available temporarily. One of which was hidden in the same cemetery where I have my Tombs and Tees box so I <strong>had</strong> to detour by there on my way to workout this morning! It's been awhile since I've beat GG to a box, so that was additional incentive! So... as always.... great stamp by Stargazer! After locating the box, I carried it down to a little patio table to stamp in. Just as I was taking it back to it's hiding place, the "manager" of the cemetery was showing an extremely older gentleman some "available locations" and they went right up to the spot where it was hidden and stood there talking. I passed by them, carrying the camo box, and we nodded and spoke. I was hoping if they noticed what I was carrying, they would just think it was my camouflaged family Bible!  I took the box back to my Jeep and waited.... and waited.... and waited....   I thought I might have to take the box to the gym to exercise with me and then bring it back after, but I figured GG was probably in hot pursuit, so I had to use up some of my reserve patience (of which I have little) and continue to wait until the two gentlemen finally started to walk on down the path to the back of the cemetery. Finally I was able to slip back over there and rehid the box. I can't wait to go find the other two boxes in this fun series!<br/>Puddle Splasher</div></body></html>

<div> </div>
<div>How do you account for sitting in a parked car in a cemetery?  For quite a long time, the only way I could think of is to break into tears and blubber about "oh how I miss ..."  Unfortunately, while SJZ can break into very convincing tears on command, I can't!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I did finally figure out that I can work on a perpetual genealogy project.  If I find myself having to sit it out in a cemetery, I scribble notes incessantly and throw in a couple of names from nearby tombstones.  This also works for getting close to the target point.  Tougher though to work around someone who is selecting a plot.  The only problem with this idea is if I am examining graves that belong to the family of the person who approaches me - not uncommon in a country cemetery!  I'm always afraid I'm going to have to give some "long lost family member" a hug and make plans to attend the next family reunion...

<div>I'm betting you weren't dressed in your camo workout gear, or you could've more easily passed off the box as your camo'd family Bible.<br/> </div>

<div>You know, you could always do a gravestone rubbing - you'll certainly have 
a clue sheet with you, won't you?  You may have to carry a piece of chalk 
or charcoal or at least a soft pencil; put that paper against a stone, and rub 
away.  That could work as subterfuge, I'd think.  Or just take 
pictures of the unusual headstones, historic markers, etc.  Or sit and 
contemplate.</div></body></html>

<div>It's a very small cemetery and you park outside the gate and walk in, so I wasn't exactly sitting there in my Jeep blasting my Bob Dylan CD in the middle of the cemetery at the time. When I saw my opportunity to rush back and hide the box, all kinds of excuses started running through my mind - in case anyone were to ask me who I was there to "see". I quickly attached myself to the "Taylor" family. Their gravestones looked nice... and I knew some Taylors once and they were nice folks. But then.... what if this Taylor family wasn't so nice? What if they never fully paid for their burial and they've been looking for their next of kin for years. What if they called the police? Obviously I shouldn't be allowed out by myself - my mind has a tendency to take trips to very strange places - and I was NOT at Woodstock!</div>

<div>I wish you had been at the cemetery too! I could have passed the camo box off to you and made a run for it! When I first saw the two gentlemen coming towards where the box was hidden, my first thought was.... "that's not the Gryzzled Gryphon - what are they doing here?" Then the thought crossed my mind, "would the older gentleman be interested in buying a space in that cemetery if he realized the letterboxing activity going on?"  (I started to say, "underground activity" but decided that was a poor choice of words). I sized up the elderly gentleman and decided he would certainly enjoy our fun.</div>

I feel so blessed that they have embraced Letterboxing as much as my husband and youngest (who, by the way, has collected rocks and shells from every spot we've gone. Even the gravel rocks, she's making a collection. She thinks she can glue them all in the scrapbook. I just don't have the heart to tell her).</div> <div> </div> <div>I

I wish I had come to the cemetery this morning. Since neither of us know what the other looks like, it would've been fun trying to 'hide' from each other. What I like about the cemetery, is when you are driving in, they have a sign that says, 'spaces available'. That just cracks me up for some reason. Of all the cemeteries I've been to in my life (besides the ones in England and Scotland), that is my favorite. It's old and new. I can't wait to find a few moments to go find the stamp there. There is also a new one in Ft. Worth by a new family: <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/lboxes/showboxinfo.html?gBoxId=21413">http://www.atlasque<wbr/>st.com/lboxes/<wbr/>showboxinfo.<wbr/>html?gBoxId=<wbr/>21413</a></div> <div> </div> <div>I really wanted to get there first, but it looks like Monarch B beat me to that
 one.

When I saw my opportunity to rush back and hide the box, all kinds of excuses started running through my mind - in case anyone were to ask me who I was there to "see". I quickly attached myself to the "Taylor" family. Their gravestones looked nice... and I knew some Taylors once and they were nice folks. But then.... what if this Taylor family wasn't so nice? What if they never fully paid for
 their burial and they've been looking for their next of kin for years. What if they called the police? Obviously I shouldn't be allowed out by myself - my mind has a tendency to take trips to very strange places - and I was NOT at Woodstock!</div> <div>Puddle Splasher</div> <div> </div> <div></div></div> <div> </div> <blockquote> <div>----- Original Message ----- </div> <div><b>From:</b> <a href="mailto:barefootlucy@gmail.com" title="barefootlucy@gmail.com">Barefoot Lucy</a> </div> <div><b>To: </b><a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com" title="letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a></div> <div><b>Sent:</b> 9/6/2006 7:31:56 PM </div> <div><b>Subject:</b> Re: [letterboxingtexas] fun series</div>

 uncommon in a country cemetery!  I'm always afraid I'm going to have to give some "long lost family member" a hug and make plans to attend the next family reunion... <br/> </div> <div>I'm betting you weren't dressed in your camo workout gear, or you could've more easily passed off the box as your camo'd family Bible.<br/> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 9/6/06, <b>Maribeth Jagger</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:cjagger405@earthlink.net">cjagger405@earthlin<wbr/>k.net</a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div>Stargazer announced a new series this morning which will only be available temporarily. One of which was hidden in the same cemetery where I have my Tombs and Tees box so I <strong>had</strong> to detour by there on my way to workout this morning! It's been awhile since I've beat GG to a box,
 so that was additional incentive! So... as always.... great stamp by Stargazer! After locating the box, I carried it down to a little patio table to stamp in. Just as I was taking it back to it's hiding place, the "manager" of the cemetery was showing an extremely older gentleman some "available locations" and they went right up to the spot where it was hidden and stood there talking. I passed by them, carrying the camo box, and we nodded and spoke. I was hoping if they noticed what I was carrying, they would just think it was my camouflaged family Bible!  I took the box back to my Jeep and waited.... and waited.... and waited....   I thought I might have to take the box to the gym to exercise with me and then bring it back after, but I figured GG was probably in hot pursuit, so I had to use up some of my reserve patience (of which I have little) and continue to wait until the two gentlemen finally started to walk on down the
 path to the back of the cemetery. Finally I was able to slip back over there and rehid the box. I can't wait to go find the other two boxes in this fun series! <br/>Puddle Splasher</div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div> <div></div></div><span width="1"></span></div></div></div></div></div></div></blockquote></div><br/><br clear="all"/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"   <div></div></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote> <div></div></div><!--End group email --></div></blockquote><br/> <div> <hr size="1"/>  Talk is cheap.
