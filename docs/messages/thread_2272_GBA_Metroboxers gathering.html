<br>
I'm sorry to be so late in posting this message but I<br>
just wanted to let everyone know that the girls and I<br>
had a  a blast at the Great Book Adventure Saturday!! <br>
 It was wonderful getting to meet everyone and putting<br>
names to faces..or rather stamps to faces.  A great<br>
big Thank You!! to Dewberry and TeamKing for all their<br>
hard work in getting everything ready.<br>
<br>
We are sorry we missed out on the fun at Memorial<br>
Park.  We got lost (imagine that, coming from a small<br>
town in the Piney Woods of East Texas and getting lost<br>
in Houston)  and by the time we found where ya'll were<br>
going to be at it was around 3pm.  We did plant a box<br>
in the butterfly garden so it wasn't a wasted trip. <br>
Monday we went to Galveston and planted one at the<br>
girls' favorite resturant on the island, Rain Forest<br>
Cafe.<br>
<br>
We can't wait to go to the next one.  We will be in<br>
Arlington this weekend for FrightFest at Six Flags,<br>
planning to plant one somewhere there and four or five<br>
more along the way.  The weekend of November 12th we<br>
will be in Dallas again for SnowFest at Market Hall. <br>
The weekend of November 18th is already booked solid<br>
there is a homeschool convention in Shreveport that I<br>
want to go to so we will already be missing the<br>
Dickens on the Strand parade but I will discuss it<br>
with the girls and see which they would prefer to go,<br>
if all the chatter on the way home from Houston Monday<br>
evening is any indication...it looks like we will be<br>
seeing all of you again the 18th :-)<br>
<br>
