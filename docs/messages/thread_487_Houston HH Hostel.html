Problem Houston Hitchhiker Hostel".  I have decided on Memorial Park as <br/>
the best central location as we obviously want out of state/town <br/>
visitors to pick up and drop off as easily as possible. I have gotten <br/>
numerous people to send HHs for this, but instead of waiting for all of <br/>
them to get here, I am going to get it started and then drop them off <br/>
as they come. So, check it out for new 'finds' whether coming or going <br/>
out of the city and keep those travellers moving.<br/>
<br/>
Just a side note. . .if you read about the Monster Mash they had up in <br/>
Connecticut in October (I know we had a Texan or two send some monster <br/>
stamps on for that). . .anyway, about 2 of those monsters are being <br/>
turned in HHs and they will be starting their travels out our hostel! <br/>
Yea!<br/>
<br/>
Hopefully this will keep some of our HHs moving about instead of stuck <br/>
in backpacks or at home because of the large number of microboxes we <br/>
have in Houston.<br/>
<br/>
Will post the clue/direction on LBNA on Saturday or Sunday after <br/>
placing, so check it out.<br/>

Sounds great, I have one to put in already.  Do you have<br/>
a set of guidelines for how we should use the HH Hostel<br/>
(e.g. must put one in before taking one out, how many<br/>
can be taken out at one time, can a person stamp all<br/>
of them but leave them in the Hostel)?<br/>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Yea!<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Hopefully this will keep some of our HHs moving<br/>
&gt;&gt; about instead of<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;  stuck<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; in backpacks or at home because of the large<br/>
&gt;&gt; number of microboxes<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;  we<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; have in Houston.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Will post the clue/direction on LBNA on<br/>
&gt;&gt; Saturday or Sunday after<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; placing, so check it out.<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;<br/>
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Enjoy!<br/>
