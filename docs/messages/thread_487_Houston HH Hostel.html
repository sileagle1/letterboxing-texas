                    <div class="plaintext-content">This weekend I will be placing Texas' 2nd HH Hostel. It's called "No <br>
Problem Houston Hitchhiker Hostel".  I have decided on Memorial Park as <br>
the best central location as we obviously want out of state/town <br>
visitors to pick up and drop off as easily as possible. I have gotten <br>
numerous people to send HHs for this, but instead of waiting for all of <br>
them to get here, I am going to get it started and then drop them off <br>
as they come. So, check it out for new 'finds' whether coming or going <br>
out of the city and keep those travellers moving.<br>
<br>
Just a side note. . .if you read about the Monster Mash they had up in <br>
Connecticut in October (I know we had a Texan or two send some monster <br>
stamps on for that). . .anyway, about 2 of those monsters are being <br>
turned in HHs and they will be starting their travels out our hostel! <br>
Yea!<br>
<br>
Hopefully this will keep some of our HHs moving about instead of stuck <br>
in backpacks or at home because of the large number of microboxes we <br>
have in Houston.<br>
<br>
Will post the clue/direction on LBNA on Saturday or Sunday after <br>
placing, so check it out.<br>

Enjoy!<br>

Sounds great, I have one to put in already.  Do you have<br>
a set of guidelines for how we should use the HH Hostel<br>
(e.g. must put one in before taking one out, how many<br>
can be taken out at one time, can a person stamp all<br>
of them but leave them in the Hostel)?<br>

I think that's it. :)<br>
