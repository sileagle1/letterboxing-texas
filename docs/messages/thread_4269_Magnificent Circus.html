<div>Dear Bozo,</div>
<div>A lot of beautiful, thoughtful work is going into the carving 
of images, and creating of pages for your logbook, and that takes 
time.  Even though you are impatient, you are travelling with one of the 
most magnificent circuses ever to tour.  Please savor the experience, 
even if the tour is slow!  -- Bell Motel</div>

&gt; &gt;                   Well, there are some of us up in the northern parts of Texas that would enjoy seeing some of that "beautiful and thoughtful carving of images and creative pages in the logbook", so get a move on it, sistah, and get that show on the road. (Not that I'm impatient or anything!)<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Bozo,<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of beautiful, thoughtful work is going into the carving of images, and creating of pages for your logbook, and that takes time.  Even though you are impatient, you are travelling with one of the most magnificent circuses ever to tour.  Please savor the experience, even if the tour is slow!  -- Bell Motel<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;     Ok, I have now been stuck in Austin for over 4 months and I'm going stir crazy! I would threaten to run away and join a circus, but I've already done that. Please release me so I can see other parts of TX, or even other parts of Austin!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt;   &gt; Calm down, Bozo. You know the Train can't leave Austin at least until after the football party on Sat. All the circus folks are so excited to watch the shootout on that new wide screen those high wire walkers brought in. Even the bear won't think of hybernating until after the Shoot Out.<br/>
