                    <html><body><div>I went camping with our Boy Scout troop Friday night - think 30 degrees and pouring rain - with the intention of getting to go letterboxing while they were doing their Boy Scout thing.  I showed up at Mission Tejas equipped with my clues, and I also took with me several coordinates because the geocaches in that park are also said to be very good.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Back to Friday, it rained and sleeted and snowed off and on all day and my co-workers would walk by my desk and ask me if I was really going camping in "this weather", to which I said "Unless it gets called off."  (Meanwhile, chanting - Please call it off, Please call it off).  I got off work and it was still raining and sleeting and Fearless Fox had already called the Scoutmaster to see if we were still going.  Yep.  Still going.  "The boys NEED a cold weather campout."  Need is a strong word.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So Fearless Fox loaded his truck up and went on down to Mission Tejas to start a fire and Lightning and I met the troop at the church that sponsors them.  As I stood there listening to the Assistant Scoutmaster repeatedly tell (and think grinchlike grin here) calling parents "Yes, we are still going.  The boys NEED a cold weather campout.", I tried to remember if I had ever camped in cold AND raining conditions.  There WAS the Brazos Bend gathering, very wet but not terribly cold.  There was the summer I spent camping in Canada and the Northwest, and that got down into the 30's, but I don't remember it raining that summer.  And then camping in the Florida Everglades for nearly three weeks - it rained every day, but again, it wasn't cold.  There was the one and only girl scout campout I ever went on when it started raining after we got set up and I had to show the other girls (newbie campers that they were) how you should NOT touch the sides of the tent, so we all touched the sides of the tent and the tent flooded from the inside out, but that was relatively warm too - just horribly messy.  I just don't remember putting cold AND wet together on a campout, but maybe NacTrailCat can remember something along those lines from my growing up years.  So anyway, after 2/3 of the expected participants cancelled at parental insistence, I started to wonder if I was being a good parent by not also keeping my son home.  SJZ called me one last time to say "Are y'all really going camping?" to which I replied "The only way to have an adventure is to go on an adventure" - I only wished I felt so cavalier.  I just felt the impending cold and wet feeling starting to seep in before we ever got a start. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had so many cancellations that we didn't have to haul a trailer and there was even room for me and my gear on the van, so I parked the car, grabbed my gear and piled into the van, settling into the front seat next to the Scoutmaster and made up my mind to make the best of things.  We spent the next hour tring to ignore the rain, talking about scouting, and me generally picking his brain as I like to do whenever I have a Scoutmaster held captive. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got to camp and thanks to the dismal weather it got much darker even earlier than usual, so we set camp up in the drenching dark.  Thankfully, Fearless Fox had arrived and gotten a fire blazing and it was going well enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier rain, so we alternated setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until finally the kitchen was in place, the tents were erected, and everything was settled.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he wound up with a tent by himself.  I was a little worried about that because his last rainy camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend gathering and he still doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how he would fare by himself on a rainy night.  And I wondered if he would stay warm without a tentmate to help warm the tent.  He never asked to bunk in with Fearless Fox and me, so we didn't offer either.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire looking at each other.  It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program when it's raining and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying sitting around the fire swapping stories when it's raining and cold too.  Finally I suggested we go on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we had a few takers.  We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra batteries and set my GPS.  The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat of the van and headed out - I navigated while he drove.  We finally got to the jumping off point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but we figured we had enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had to.  We jumped out and set our flashlights into action because the idea was that we had to find the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the day, thus finding the path that would lead us to the cache that would give us the coords to the next leg of the cache.  Funny thing about rain on trees is that everything reflects!  After roaming around for twenty minutes, spreading out and scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical path, we decided there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed distinctive enough to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back into the nice white church van and headed back to camp.  We were gone a total of almost an hour, and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated the erection of a tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all gather around the fire and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit under the tarp, then warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for a bit as we took our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under the tarp.  Finally, one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our tents and settle in.  Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never thought I would like a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta say - it felt pretty darned good Friday night!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that I had been shoving back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - what if this DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which was the whole reason I came on this trip anyway???  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely perfect - cold, mind you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling.  I thought I was being funny when I went to join the guys already at the campfire with my wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you have an extra scrunchy, do you?".  Two of the men headed to their trucks and came back with scrunchies.  Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their leaders, especially the ones that have sisters and daughters. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your breakfast, you need to be patient, at least in our troop.  I'm almost always up before them, but the name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do everything and leaders should not do anything.  Different than Cub Scouts, where I know that on a campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go to bed again, so I may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.  Consequently, I found myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I could at least orient myself to the park.  Although I've been to Mission Tejas many times, I've never been in a position of having to walk to wherever I wanted to be, so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to anywhere.  The state park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better.  Between walking the main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on the trees, I felt like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how close some things are to each other.  Amazing!  While out, I noted in my mind where I would have to be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and roughly located where the various caches were.  I was ready - all except breakfast. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were firing up and eggs were being cracked.  It was starting to look like we might have breakfast before noon, er, I mean nine.  They had brought far more food than we needed because there were supposed to be three times more people on the campout than there were.  I got a kick out of the boys debating exactly how much of everything to cook because they normally cook it all.  They are very exact in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy and they are not very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the scout law), so when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a loop.  It's sorely tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort them out quickly, so it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let them reach their own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the sames ones a sane adult would come to.  Thankfully, we had our sausage patties crumbled into tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more time before setting out.  The boys were getting ready to work on advancement but Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl before they got started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, then headed out to go boxing/caching.  Now I had not gone far from the campsite when I realized that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you arrange your clothes.  I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I had put the pair of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so every time I went to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the waistband of my top pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the under pair, or everything would go straight to the ground.  This proved to be a problem eventually.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my letterboxing journey.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some boxes.  After sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little stove up, so I deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as tall as I could.  I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking in that glorious winter air.  Perfect.  Just perfect.  It really was.  My legs and back were stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my clues (I do much better if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize where the clues are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first checking on Baby Bear's box.  Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view of the pond that I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it on my way back around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's Indian Trails box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in Mission Tejas, I would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like a new park.  Maybe I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I don't know,  but I got really caught up in the views.  This time though, I remembered to stop and look for the box.  I really do have an aversion to sticking my hand into a blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there should be no cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself down the incline to look in to where my hand was going to go.  I pulled my glove on just in case, removed the cover and there was the box, just as planned.  There wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would just return and sit in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I slid back down - I had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and the ground off the trail was slick.  So I rolled around a bit in the wet leaves, got slightly damp, but no big deal.  I tried again and made it, logged in, and went to return it.  This time I slid down the hill almost to the water, and the stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on down between my two pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what was happening I saw my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my water bottle.  Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since it sank like lead weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my water.  In summer, the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a green sort of way, but in the winter, they are just intensely green.  I wasn't real excited about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was pretty sure was also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice.  I really couldn't tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, you know), but I knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get my GPS.  Knowing my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching out to get the stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the cold green water.  I got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling squishy for the second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS without any further incident.  I was feeling especially pleased with myself and got back to the trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in a hurry because the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile of scat.  Ewwwww...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt would be quite a way along the trail.  I stopped briefly to get a drink of water, and I realized the smell wasn't any better.  I went to wipe the top of my water bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't any better.  Big ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, and it was on my top pair of pants too.  It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was smelling, it was a newly reopened one - by me.  In one of my two slides down the hill.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've been, so I resolved to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit.  I managed to rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my pants, but at that point I was really wet again.  I shed the top shirt and carried it and tried not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was cold.  I reminded myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the night before with some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do it in the daylight too.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail it back to fresh water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing?  I gave it a minute or two of thought, but I finally opted to box on.  I mean really, by then I had sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing and I didn't expect to run into anyone I knew on the trail.  It wasn't like Walmart where you run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and good clothes before you go.  This was the stinking woods, emphasis on stinking in my case!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So on I went - boxing on.  I reached the area where the next boxes were to be and I began working the clues with no luck.  I decided I had gone through so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily.  I tried the clues every which way I could, to no avail.  Well I say that, but I do think I know the general area where one was - squarely in the middle of a blocked off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge.  Eventually I had to concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took myself back to the trailhead.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I decided to head back to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem.  I looked like a bedraggled rat.  And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat.  Somehow it finally occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I could rinse all my clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave off one pair of pants and one shirt and return to camp.  As a bonus, I had also already loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could arrange the vehicle doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into clean dry clothes.  This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my experience as they only first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in with a light step, carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks.  That struck them as odd, but they were busy so they never thought again about it.  That is, until a half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and said "Okay.  What happened to you?"  I don't know if he noticed I wasn't wearing the same clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him off or what, but he had figured it out.  When I told him what had happened, I thought he would never stop laughing at me!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We ate lunch and started packing to head home.  I ran out of time to hunt the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I ran out of energy too.  I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I was Saturday.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an email from Jim (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas the same day.  Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to reach 300+ and to get seven boxes and several caches.  I wound up getting my 299th - and it was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are!  But I think I had as satisfying and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was pretty fun) finding that one little box as I could've had if I had found every box there (not that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!).  And I promise you - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails in my logbook.  Thank you, LSQ, for the experience!  Wish you'da been there so I could've shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) (well yeah, I wouldn't wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just kidding) (sort of).

 and they are not very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the scout law), so when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a loop.  It's sorely tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort them out quickly, so it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let them reach their own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the sames ones a sane adult would come to.  Thankfully, we had our sausage patties crumbled into tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers..<wbr>. </wbr></div> <div> </div> <div>Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more time before setting out.  The boys were getting ready to work on advancement but Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl before they got started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, then headed out to go boxing/caching.  Now I had not gone far from the campsite when I realized that when boxing in the cold, it is very
 important how you arrange your clothes.  I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I had put the pair of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so every time I went to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the waistband of my top pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the under pair, or everything would go straight to the ground.  This proved to be a problem eventually. </div> <div> </div> <div>So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my letterboxing journey.</div> <div> </div> <div>I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some boxes.  After sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little stove up, so I deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as tall as I could.  I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking in that glorious winter air.  Perfect.  Just perfect.  It really was.  My legs and back were stretched and my
 lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD! </div> <div> </div> <div>I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my clues (I do much better if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize where the clues are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first checking on Baby Bear's box.  Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view of the pond that I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it on my way back around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's Indian Trails box.   </div> <div> </div> <div>Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in Mission Tejas, I would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like a new park.  Maybe I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I don't know,  but I got really caught up in the views.  This time though, I remembered to stop and look for the box.  I really do have an aversion to sticking my hand into a
 blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there should be no cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself down the incline to look in to where my hand was going to go.  I pulled my glove on just in case, removed the cover and there was the box, just as planned.  There wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would just return and sit in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I slid back down - I had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and the ground off the trail was slick.  So I rolled around a bit in the wet leaves, got slightly damp, but no big deal.  I tried again and made it, logged in, and went to return it.  This time I slid down the hill almost to the water, and the stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on down between my two pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what was happening I saw my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my water bottle. 
 Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since it sank like lead weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my water.  In summer, the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a green sort of way, but in the winter, they are just intensely green.  I wasn't real excited about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was pretty sure was also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice.  I really couldn't tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, you know), but I knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get my GPS.  Knowing my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching out to get the stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the cold green water.  I got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling squishy for the second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS without any further incident.  I was feeling especially pleased with myself and got
 back to the trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in a hurry because the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile of scat.  Ewwwww... </div> <div> </div> <div>So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt would be quite a way along the trail.  I stopped briefly to get a drink of water, and I realized the smell wasn't any better.  I went to wipe the top of my water bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't any better.  Big ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, and it was on my top pair of pants too.  It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was smelling, it was a newly reopened one - by me.  In one of my two slides down the hill. </div> <div> </div> <div>Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've been, so I resolved to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit.  I managed to rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my
 pants, but at that point I was really wet again.  I shed the top shirt and carried it and tried not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was cold.  I reminded myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the night before with some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do it in the daylight too. </div> <div> </div> <div>I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail it back to fresh water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing?  I gave it a minute or two of thought, but I finally opted to box on.  I mean really, by then I had sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing and I didn't expect to run into anyone I knew on the trail.  It wasn't like Walmart where you run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and good clothes before you go.  This was the stinking woods, emphasis on stinking in my case! </div> <div> </div> <div>So on I went - boxing on.  I reached
 the area where the next boxes were to be and I began working the clues with no luck.  I decided I had gone through so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily.  I tried the clues every which way I could, to no avail.  Well I say that, but I do think I know the general area where one was - squarely in the middle of a blocked off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge.  Eventually I had to concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took myself back to the trailhead. </div> <div> </div> <div>By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I decided to head back to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem.  I looked like a bedraggled rat.  And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat.  Somehow it finally occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I could rinse all my clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave off one pair of pants and one shirt and return to
 camp.  As a bonus, I had also already loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could arrange the vehicle doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into clean dry clothes.  This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my experience as they only first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in with a light step, carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks.  That struck them as odd, but they were busy so they never thought again about it.  That is, until a half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and said "Okay.  What happened to you?"  I don't know if he noticed I wasn't wearing the same clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him off or what, but he had figured it out.  When I told him what had happened, I thought he would never stop laughing at me! </div> <div> </div> <div>We ate lunch and started packing to head home.  I ran out of time to hunt the other boxes, and quite
 frankly, after all of that, I ran out of energy too.  I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I was Saturday. </div> <div> </div> <div>The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an email from Jim (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas the same day.  Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!</div> <div> </div> <div>So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to reach 300+ and to get seven boxes and several caches.  I wound up getting my 299th - and it was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are!  But I think I had as satisfying and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was pretty fun) finding that one little box as I could've had if I had found every box there (not that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!).  And I promise you - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails in my logbook.  Thank you, LSQ, for the experience!  Wish you'da been
 there so I could've shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) (well yeah, I wouldn't wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just kidding) (sort of). </div> <div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div> <div></div></div><!--End group email

<div>
<div>I went camping with our Boy Scout troop Friday night - think 30 degrees and pouring rain - with the intention of getting to go letterboxing while they were doing their Boy Scout thing.  I showed up at Mission Tejas equipped with my clues, and I also took with me several coordinates because the geocaches in that park are also said to be very good. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Back to Friday, it rained and sleeted and snowed off and on all day and my co-workers would walk by my desk and ask me if I was really going camping in "this weather", to which I said "Unless it gets called off."  (Meanwhile, chanting - Please call it off, Please call it off).  I got off work and it was still raining and sleeting and Fearless Fox had already called the Scoutmaster to see if we were still going.  Yep.  Still going.  "The boys NEED a cold weather campout."  Need is a strong word.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So Fearless Fox loaded his truck up and went on down to Mission Tejas to start a fire and Lightning and I met the troop at the church that sponsors them.  As I stood there listening to the Assistant Scoutmaster repeatedly tell (and think grinchlike grin here) calling parents "Yes, we are still going.  The boys NEED a cold weather campout.", I tried to remember if I had ever camped in cold AND raining conditions.  There WAS the Brazos Bend gathering, very wet but not terribly cold.  There was the summer I spent camping in Canada and the Northwest, and that got down into the 30's, but I don't remember it raining that summer.  And then camping in the Florida Everglades for nearly three weeks - it rained every day, but again, it wasn't cold.  There was the one and only girl scout campout I ever went on when it started raining after we got set up and I had to show the other girls (newbie campers that they were) how you should NOT touch the sides of the tent, so we all touched the sides of the tent and the tent flooded from the inside out, but that was relatively warm too - just horribly messy.  I just don't remember putting cold AND wet together on a campout, but maybe NacTrailCat can remember something along those lines from my growing up years.  So anyway, after 2/3 of the expected participants cancelled at parental insistence, I started to wonder if I was being a good parent by not also keeping my son home.  SJZ called me one last time to say "Are y'all really going camping?" to which I replied "The only way to have an adventure is to go on an adventure" - I only wished I felt so cavalier.  I just felt the impending cold and wet feeling starting to seep in before we ever got a start. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had so many cancellations that we didn't have to haul a trailer and there was even room for me and my gear on the van, so I parked the car, grabbed my gear and piled into the van, settling into the front seat next to the Scoutmaster and made up my mind to make the best of things.  We spent the next hour tring to ignore the rain, talking about scouting, and me generally picking his brain as I like to do whenever I have a Scoutmaster held captive. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got to camp and thanks to the dismal weather it got much darker even earlier than usual, so we set camp up in the drenching dark.  Thankfully, Fearless Fox had arrived and gotten a fire blazing and it was going well enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier rain, so we alternated setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until finally the kitchen was in place, the tents were erected, and everything was settled.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he wound up with a tent by himself.  I was a little worried about that because his last rainy camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend gathering and he still doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how he would fare by himself on a rainy night.  And I wondered if he would stay warm without a tentmate to help warm the tent.  He never asked to bunk in with Fearless Fox and me, so we didn't offer either.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire looking at each other.  It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program when it's raining and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying sitting around the fire swapping stories when it's raining and cold too.  Finally I suggested we go on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we had a few takers.  We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra batteries and set my GPS.  The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat of the van and headed out - I navigated while he drove.  We finally got to the jumping off point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but we figured we had enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had to.  We jumped out and set our flashlights into action because the idea was that we had to find the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the day, thus finding the path that would lead us to the cache that would give us the coords to the next leg of the cache.  Funny thing about rain on trees is that everything reflects!  After roaming around for twenty minutes, spreading out and scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical path, we decided there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed distinctive enough to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back into the nice white church van and headed back to camp.  We were gone a total of almost an hour, and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated the erection of a tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all gather around the fire and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit under the tarp, then warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for a bit as we took our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under the tarp.  Finally, one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our tents and settle in.  Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never thought I would like a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta say - it felt pretty darned good Friday night!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that I had been shoving back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - what if this DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which was the whole reason I came on this trip anyway???  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely perfect - cold, mind you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling.  I thought I was being funny when I went to join the guys already at the campfire with my wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you have an extra scrunchy, do you?".  Two of the men headed to their trucks and came back with scrunchies.  Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their leaders, especially the ones that have sisters and daughters. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your breakfast, you need to be patient, at least in our troop.  I'm almost always up before them, but the name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do everything and leaders should not do anything.  Different than Cub Scouts, where I know that on a campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go to bed again, so I may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.  Consequently, I found myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I could at least orient myself to the park.  Although I've been to Mission Tejas many times, I've never been in a position of having to walk to wherever I wanted to be, so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to anywhere.  The state park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better.  Between walking the main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on the trees, I felt like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how close some things are to each other.  Amazing!  While out, I noted in my mind where I would have to be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and roughly located where the various caches were.  I was ready - all except breakfast. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were firing up and eggs were being cracked.  It was starting to look like we might have breakfast before noon, er, I mean nine.  They had brought far more food than we needed because there were supposed to be three times more people on the campout than there were.  I got a kick out of the boys debating exactly how much of everything to cook because they normally cook it all.  They are very exact in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy and they are not very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the scout law), so when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a loop.  It's sorely tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort them out quickly, so it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let them reach their own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the sames ones a sane adult would come to.  Thankfully, we had our sausage patties crumbled into tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more time before setting out.  The boys were getting ready to work on advancement but Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl before they got started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, then headed out to go boxing/caching.  Now I had not gone far from the campsite when I realized that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you arrange your clothes.  I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I had put the pair of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so every time I went to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the waistband of my top pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the under pair, or everything would go straight to the ground.  This proved to be a problem eventually. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my letterboxing journey.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some boxes.  After sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little stove up, so I deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as tall as I could.  I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking in that glorious winter air.  Perfect.  Just perfect.  It really was.  My legs and back were stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my clues (I do much better if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize where the clues are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first checking on Baby Bear's box.  Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view of the pond that I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it on my way back around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's Indian Trails box.   
</div>

</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt would be quite a way along the trail.  I stopped briefly to get a drink of water, and I realized the smell wasn't any better.  I went to wipe the top of my water bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't any better.  Big ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, and it was on my top pair of pants too.  It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was smelling, it was a newly reopened one - by me.  In one of my two slides down the hill. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've been, so I resolved to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit.  I managed to rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my pants, but at that point I was really wet again.  I shed the top shirt and carried it and tried not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was cold.  I reminded myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the night before with some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do it in the daylight too. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail it back to fresh water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing?  I gave it a minute or two of thought, but I finally opted to box on.  I mean really, by then I had sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing and I didn't expect to run into anyone I knew on the trail.  It wasn't like Walmart where you run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and good clothes before you go.  This was the stinking woods, emphasis on stinking in my case! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So on I went - boxing on.  I reached the area where the next boxes were to be and I began working the clues with no luck.  I decided I had gone through so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily.  I tried the clues every which way I could, to no avail.  Well I say that, but I do think I know the general area where one was - squarely in the middle of a blocked off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge.  Eventually I had to concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took myself back to the trailhead. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I decided to head back to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem.  I looked like a bedraggled rat.  And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat.  Somehow it finally occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I could rinse all my clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave off one pair of pants and one shirt and return to camp.  As a bonus, I had also already loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could arrange the vehicle doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into clean dry clothes.  This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my experience as they only first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in with a light step, carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks.  That struck them as odd, but they were busy so they never thought again about it.  That is, until a half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and said "Okay.  What happened to you?"  I don't know if he noticed I wasn't wearing the same clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him off or what, but he had figured it out.  When I told him what had happened, I thought he would never stop laughing at me! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We ate lunch and started packing to head home.  I ran out of time to hunt the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I ran out of energy too.  I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I was Saturday. 
</div>

<div>The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an email from Jim (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas the same day.  Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to reach 300+ and to get seven boxes and several caches.  I wound up getting my 299th - and it was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are!  But I think I had as satisfying and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was pretty fun) finding that one little box as I could've had if I had found every box there (not that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!).  And I promise you - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails in my logbook.  Thank you, LSQ, for the experience!  Wish you'da been there so I could've shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) (well yeah, I wouldn't wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just kidding) (sort of).

 if I was really going camping in "this weather", to which I said "Unless it gets called off."  (Meanwhile, chanting - Please call it off, Please call it off).  I got off work and it was still raining and sleeting and Fearless Fox had already called the Scoutmaster to see if we were still going.  Yep.  Still going.  "The boys NEED a cold weather campout."  Need is a strong word.  </div> <div> </div> <div>So Fearless Fox loaded his truck up and went on down to Mission Tejas to start a fire and Lightning and I met the troop at the church that sponsors them.  As I stood there listening to the Assistant Scoutmaster repeatedly tell (and think grinchlike grin here) calling parents "Yes, we are still going.  The boys NEED a cold weather campout.", I tried to remember if I had ever camped in cold AND raining conditions.  There WAS the Brazos Bend gathering, very wet but not terribly cold.  There was the summer I
 spent camping in Canada and the Northwest, and that got down into the 30's, but I don't remember it raining that summer.  And then camping in the Florida Everglades for nearly three weeks - it rained every day, but again, it wasn't cold.  There was the one and only girl scout campout I ever went on when it started raining after we got set up and I had to show the other girls (newbie campers that they were) how you should NOT touch the sides of the tent, so we all touched the sides of the tent and the tent flooded from the inside out, but that was relatively warm too - just horribly messy.  I just don't remember putting cold AND wet together on a campout, but maybe NacTrailCat can remember something along those lines from my growing up years.  So anyway, after 2/3 of the expected participants cancelled at parental insistence, I started to wonder if I was being a good parent by not also keeping my son home.  SJZ called me one last
 time to say "Are y'all really going camping?" to which I replied "The only way to have an adventure is to go on an adventure" - I only wished I felt so cavalier.  I just felt the impending cold and wet feeling starting to seep in before we ever got a start. </div> <div> </div> <div>We had so many cancellations that we didn't have to haul a trailer and there was even room for me and my gear on the van, so I parked the car, grabbed my gear and piled into the van, settling into the front seat next to the Scoutmaster and made up my mind to make the best of things.  We spent the next hour tring to ignore the rain, talking about scouting, and me generally picking his brain as I like to do whenever I have a Scoutmaster held captive. </div> <div> </div> <div>We got to camp and thanks to the dismal weather it got much darker even earlier than usual, so we set camp up in the drenching dark.  Thankfully, Fearless Fox had arrived and gotten a
 fire blazing and it was going well enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier rain, so we alternated setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until finally the kitchen was in place, the tents were erected, and everything was settled.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he wound up with a tent by himself.  I was a little worried about that because his last rainy camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend gathering and he still doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how he would fare by himself on a rainy night.  And I wondered if he would stay warm without a tentmate to help warm the tent.  He never asked to bunk in with Fearless Fox and me, so we didn't offer either.  </div> <div> </div> <div>Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire looking at each other.  It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program when it's
 raining and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying sitting around the fire swapping stories when it's raining and cold too.  Finally I suggested we go on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we had a few takers.  We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra batteries and set my GPS.  The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat of the van and headed out - I navigated while he drove.  We finally got to the jumping off point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but we figured we had enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had to.  We jumped out and set our flashlights into action because the idea was that we had to find the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the day, thus finding the path that would lead us to the cache that would give us the coords to the next leg of the cache.  Funny thing about rain on trees is that everything reflects!  After roaming around for
 twenty minutes, spreading out and scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical path, we decided there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed distinctive enough to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back into the nice white church van and headed back to camp.  We were gone a total of almost an hour, and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated the erection of a tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all gather around the fire and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit under the tarp, then warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for a bit as we took our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under the tarp.  Finally, one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our tents and settle in.  Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never thought I would like a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta say - it felt pretty darned good Friday
 night!  </div> <div> </div> <div>As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that I had been shoving back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - what if this DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which was the whole reason I came on this trip anyway???  </div> <div> </div> <div>But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely perfect - cold, mind you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling.  I thought I was being funny when I went to join the guys already at the campfire with my wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you have an extra scrunchy, do you?".  Two of the men headed to their trucks and came back with scrunchies.  Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their leaders, especially the ones that have sisters and daughters. </div> <div> </div> <div>When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your breakfast, you need to be patient, at least in our troop. 
 I'm almost always up before them, but the name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do everything and leaders should not do anything.  Different than Cub Scouts, where I know that on a campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go to bed again, so I may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.  Consequently, I found myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I could at least orient myself to the park.  Although I've been to Mission Tejas many times, I've never been in a position of having to walk to wherever I wanted to be, so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to anywhere.  The state park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better.  Between walking the main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on the trees, I felt like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how close some things are to each other.  Amazing!  While out, I noted in my mind where I would have to
 be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and roughly located where the various caches were.  I was ready - all except breakfast. </div> <div> </div> <div>I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were firing up and eggs were being cracked.  It was starting to look like we might have breakfast before noon, er, I mean nine.  They had brought far more food than we needed because there were supposed to be three times more people on the campout than there were.  I got a kick out of the boys debating exactly how much of everything to cook because they normally cook it all.  They are very exact in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy and they are not very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the scout law), so when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a loop.  It's sorely tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort them out quickly, so it's hard sometimes for me to stand
 quietly aside and let them reach their own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the sames ones a sane adult would come to.  Thankfully, we had our sausage patties crumbled into tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers..<wbr>. </wbr></div> <div> </div> <div>Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more time before setting out.  The boys were getting ready to work on advancement but Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl before they got started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, then headed out to go boxing/caching.  Now I had not gone far from the campsite when I realized that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you arrange your clothes.  I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I had put the pair of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so every time I went to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the waistband of my top pair and had to be very
 careful to hit the pocket of the under pair, or everything would go straight to the ground.  This proved to be a problem eventually. </div> <div> </div> <div>So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my letterboxing journey.</div> <div> </div> <div>I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some boxes.  After sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little stove up, so I deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as tall as I could.  I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking in that glorious winter air.  Perfect.  Just perfect.  It really was.  My legs and back were stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD! </div> <div> </div> <div>I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my clues (I do much better if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize where the clues are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first checking
 on Baby Bear's box.  Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view of the pond that I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it on my way back around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's Indian Trails box.   </div> <div> </div> <div>Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in Mission Tejas, I would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like a new park.  Maybe I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I don't know,  but I got really caught up in the views.  This time though, I remembered to stop and look for the box.  I really do have an aversion to sticking my hand into a blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there should be no cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself down the incline to look in to where my hand was going to go.  I pulled my glove on just in case, removed the cover and there was the box, just as planned. 
 There wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would just return and sit in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I slid back down - I had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and the ground off the trail was slick.  So I rolled around a bit in the wet leaves, got slightly damp, but no big deal.  I tried again and made it, logged in, and went to return it.  This time I slid down the hill almost to the water, and the stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on down between my two pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what was happening I saw my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my water bottle.  Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since it sank like lead weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my water.  In summer, the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a green sort of way, but in the winter, they are just intensely green.  I
 wasn't real excited about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was pretty sure was also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice.  I really couldn't tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, you know), but I knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get my GPS.  Knowing my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching out to get the stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the cold green water.  I got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling squishy for the second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS without any further incident.  I was feeling especially pleased with myself and got back to the trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in a hurry because the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile of scat.  Ewwwww... </div> <div> </div> <div>So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt would be quite a way along the
 trail.  I stopped briefly to get a drink of water, and I realized the smell wasn't any better.  I went to wipe the top of my water bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't any better.  Big ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, and it was on my top pair of pants too.  It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was smelling, it was a newly reopened one - by me.  In one of my two slides down the hill. </div> <div> </div> <div>Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've been, so I resolved to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit.  I managed to rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my pants, but at that point I was really wet again.  I shed the top shirt and carried it and tried not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was cold.  I reminded myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the night before with some modicum of my sense of humor, and
 I could certain do it in the daylight too. </div> <div> </div> <div>I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail it back to fresh water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing?  I gave it a minute or two of thought, but I finally opted to box on.  I mean really, by then I had sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing and I didn't expect to run into anyone I knew on the trail.  It wasn't like Walmart where you run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and good clothes before you go.  This was the stinking woods, emphasis on stinking in my case! </div> <div> </div> <div>So on I went - boxing on.  I reached the area where the next boxes were to be and I began working the clues with no luck.  I decided I had gone through so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily.  I tried the clues every which way I could, to no avail.  Well I say that, but I do think I know the
 general area where one was - squarely in the middle of a blocked off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge.  Eventually I had to concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took myself back to the trailhead. </div> <div> </div> <div>By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I decided to head back to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem.  I looked like a bedraggled rat.  And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat.  Somehow it finally occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I could rinse all my clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave off one pair of pants and one shirt and return to camp.  As a bonus, I had also already loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could arrange the vehicle doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into clean dry clothes.  This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my experience as they only first noticed I was back
 in camp when I bopped in with a light step, carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks.  That struck them as odd, but they were busy so they never thought again about it.  That is, until a half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and said "Okay.  What happened to you?"  I don't know if he noticed I wasn't wearing the same clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him off or what, but he had figured it out.  When I told him what had happened, I thought he would never stop laughing at me! </div> <div> </div> <div>We ate lunch and started packing to head home.  I ran out of time to hunt the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I ran out of energy too.  I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I was Saturday. </div> <div> </div> <div>The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an email from Jim (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas the same
 day.  Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!</div> <div> </div> <div>So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to reach 300+ and to get seven boxes and several caches.  I wound up getting my 299th - and it was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are!  But I think I had as satisfying and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was pretty fun) finding that one little box as I could've had if I had found every box there (not that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!).  And I promise you - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails in my logbook.  Thank you, LSQ, for the experience!  Wish you'da been there so I could've shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) (well yeah, I wouldn't wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just kidding) (sort of). </div> <div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>

<div>I went camping with our Boy Scout troop Friday night - think 30 degrees and pouring rain - with the intention of getting to go letterboxing while they were doing their Boy Scout thing.  I showed up at Mission Tejas equipped with my clues, and I also took with me several coordinates because the geocaches in that park are also said to be very good.

<div>Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he wound up with a tent by himself.  I was a little worried about that because his last rainy camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend gathering and he still doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how he would fare by himself on a rainy night.  And I wondered if he would stay warm without a tentmate to help warm the tent.  He never asked to bunk in with Fearless Fox and me, so we didn't offer either.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire looking at each other.  It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program when it's raining and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying sitting around the fire swapping stories when it's raining and cold too.  Finally I suggested we go on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we had a few takers.  We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra batteries and set my GPS.  The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat of the van and headed out - I navigated while he drove.  We finally got to the jumping off point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but we figured we had enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had to.  We jumped out and set our flashlights into action because the idea was that we had to find the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the day, thus finding the path that would lead us to the cache that would give us the coords to the next leg of the cache.  Funny thing about rain on trees is that everything reflects!  After roaming around for twenty minutes, spreading out and scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical path, we decided there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed distinctive enough to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back into the nice white church van and headed back to camp.  We were gone a total of almost an hour, and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated the erection of a tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all gather around the fire and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit under the tarp, then warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for a bit as we took our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under the tarp.  Finally, one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our tents and settle in.  Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never thought I would like a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta say - it felt pretty darned good Friday night!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that I had been shoving back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - what if this DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which was the whole reason I came on this trip anyway???  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely perfect - cold, mind you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling.  I thought I was being funny when I went to join the guys already at the campfire with my wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you have an extra scrunchy, do you?".  Two of the men headed to their trucks and came back with scrunchies.  Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their leaders, especially the ones that have sisters and daughters. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your breakfast, you need to be patient, at least in our troop.  I'm almost always up before them, but the name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do everything and leaders should not do anything.  Different than Cub Scouts, where I know that on a campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go to bed again, so I may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.  Consequently, I found myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I could at least orient myself to the park.  Although I've been to Mission Tejas many times, I've never been in a position of having to walk to wherever I wanted to be, so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to anywhere.  The state park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better.  Between walking the main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on the trees, I felt like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how close some things are to each other.  Amazing!  While out, I noted in my mind where I would have to be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and roughly located where the various caches were.  I was ready - all except breakfast. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were firing up and eggs were being cracked.  It was starting to look like we might have breakfast before noon, er, I mean nine.  They had brought far more food than we needed because there were supposed to be three times more people on the campout than there were.  I got a kick out of the boys debating exactly how much of everything to cook because they normally cook it all.  They are very exact in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy and they are not very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the scout law), so when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a loop.  It's sorely tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort them out quickly, so it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let them reach their own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the sames ones a sane adult would come to.  Thankfully, we had our sausage patties crumbled into tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more time before setting out.  The boys were getting ready to work on advancement but Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl before they got started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, then headed out to go boxing/caching.  Now I had not gone far from the campsite when I realized that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you arrange your clothes.  I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I had put the pair of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so every time I went to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the waistband of my top pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the under pair, or everything would go straight to the ground.  This proved to be a problem eventually. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my letterboxing journey.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some boxes.  After sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little stove up, so I deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as tall as I could.  I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking in that glorious winter air.  Perfect.  Just perfect.  It really was.  My legs and back were stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my clues (I do much better if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize where the clues are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first checking on Baby Bear's box.  Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view of the pond that I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it on my way back around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's Indian Trails box.   
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in Mission Tejas, I would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like a new park.  Maybe I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I don't know,  but I got really caught up in the views.  This time though, I remembered to stop and look for the box.  I really do have an aversion to sticking my hand into a blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there should be no cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself down the incline to look in to where my hand was going to go.  I pulled my glove on just in case, removed the cover and there was the box, just as planned.  There wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would just return and sit in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I slid back down - I had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and the ground off the trail was slick.  So I rolled around a bit in the wet leaves, got slightly damp, but no big deal.  I tried again and made it, logged in, and went to return it.  This time I slid down the hill almost to the water, and the stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on down between my two pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what was happening I saw my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my water bottle.  Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since it sank like lead weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my water.  In summer, the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a green sort of way, but in the winter, they are just intensely green.  I wasn't real excited about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was pretty sure was also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice.  I really couldn't tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, you know), but I knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get my GPS.  Knowing my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching out to get the stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the cold green water.  I got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling squishy for the second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS without any further incident.  I was feeling especially pleased with myself and got back to the trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in a hurry because the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile of scat.  Ewwwww... 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt would be quite a way along the trail.  I stopped briefly to get a drink of water, and I realized the smell wasn't any better.  I went to wipe the top of my water bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't any better.  Big ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, and it was on my top pair of pants too.  It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was smelling, it was a newly reopened one - by me.  In one of my two slides down the hill. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've been, so I resolved to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit.  I managed to rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my pants, but at that point I was really wet again.  I shed the top shirt and carried it and tried not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was cold.  I reminded myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the night before with some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do it in the daylight too. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail it back to fresh water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing?  I gave it a minute or two of thought, but I finally opted to box on.  I mean really, by then I had sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing and I didn't expect to run into anyone I knew on the trail.  It wasn't like Walmart where you run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and good clothes before you go.  This was the stinking woods, emphasis on stinking in my case! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So on I went - boxing on.  I reached the area where the next boxes were to be and I began working the clues with no luck.  I decided I had gone through so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily.  I tried the clues every which way I could, to no avail.  Well I say that, but I do think I know the general area where one was - squarely in the middle of a blocked off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge.  Eventually I had to concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took myself back to the trailhead. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I decided to head back to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem.  I looked like a bedraggled rat.  And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat.  Somehow it finally occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I could rinse all my clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave off one pair of pants and one shirt and return to camp.  As a bonus, I had also already loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could arrange the vehicle doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into clean dry clothes.  This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my experience as they only first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in with a light step, carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks.  That struck them as odd, but they were busy so they never thought again about it.  That is, until a half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and said "Okay.  What happened to you?"  I don't know if he noticed I wasn't wearing the same clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him off or what, but he had figured it out.  When I told him what had happened, I thought he would never stop laughing at me! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We ate lunch and started packing to head home.  I ran out of time to hunt the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I ran out of energy too.  I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I was Saturday. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an email from Jim (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas the same day.  Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to reach 300+ and to get seven boxes and several caches.  I wound up getting my 299th - and it was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are!  But I think I had as satisfying and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was pretty fun) finding that one little box as I could've had if I had found every box there (not that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!).  And I promise you - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails in my logbook.  Thank you, LSQ, for the experience!  Wish you'da been there so I could've shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) (well yeah, I wouldn't wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just kidding) (sort of).

, "Barefoot Lucy" <br/>&gt; &lt;barefootlucy@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I went camping with our Boy Scout troop Friday night - think 30 <br/>&gt; degrees and<br/>&gt; &gt; pouring rain - with the intention of getting to go letterboxing 
<br/>&gt; while they<br/>&gt; &gt; were doing their Boy Scout thing. I showed up at Mission Tejas <br/>&gt; equipped<br/>&gt; &gt; with my clues, and I also took with me several coordinates <br/>because <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; geocaches in that park are also said to be very good.
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Back to Friday, it rained and sleeted and snowed off and on all <br/>day <br/>&gt; and my<br/>&gt; &gt; co-workers would walk by my desk and ask me if I was really going <br/>&gt; camping in<br/>&gt; &gt; "this weather", to which I said "Unless it gets called off." 
<br/>&gt; (Meanwhile,<br/>&gt; &gt; chanting - Please call it off, Please call it off). I got off <br/>work <br/>&gt; and it<br/>&gt; &gt; was still raining and sleeting and Fearless Fox had already <br/>called <br/>&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; Scoutmaster to see if we were still going. Yep. Still <br/>&gt; going. "The boys<br/>&gt; &gt; NEED a cold weather campout." Need is a strong word.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; So Fearless Fox loaded his truck up and went on down to Mission 
<br/>&gt; Tejas to<br/>&gt; &gt; start a fire and Lightning and I met the troop at the church that <br/>&gt; sponsors<br/>&gt; &gt; them. As I stood there listening to the Assistant Scoutmaster <br/>&gt; repeatedly<br/>&gt; &gt; tell (and think grinchlike grin here) calling parents "Yes, we 
<br/>are <br/>&gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; going. The boys NEED a cold weather campout.", I tried to <br/>remember <br/>&gt; if I had<br/>&gt; &gt; ever camped in cold AND raining conditions. There WAS the Brazos <br/>&gt; Bend
<br/>&gt; &gt; gathering, very wet but not terribly cold. There was the summer <br/>I <br/>&gt; spent<br/>&gt; &gt; camping in Canada and the Northwest, and that got down into the <br/>&gt; 30's, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; don't remember it raining that summer. And then camping in the 
<br/>&gt; Florida<br/>&gt; &gt; Everglades for nearly three weeks - it rained every day, but <br/>again, <br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; wasn't cold. There was the one and only girl scout campout I <br/>ever <br/>&gt; went on<br/>
&gt; &gt; when it started raining after we got set up and I had to show the <br/>&gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; girls (newbie campers that they were) how you should NOT touch <br/>the <br/>&gt; sides of<br/>&gt; &gt; the tent, so we all touched the sides of the tent and the tent 
<br/>&gt; flooded from<br/>&gt; &gt; the inside out, but that was relatively warm too - just horribly <br/>&gt; messy. I<br/>&gt; &gt; just don't remember putting cold AND wet together on a campout, <br/>but <br/>&gt; maybe
<br/>&gt; &gt; NacTrailCat can remember something along those lines from my <br/>&gt; growing up<br/>&gt; &gt; years. So anyway, after 2/3 of the expected participants <br/>cancelled <br/>&gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; parental insistence, I started to wonder if I was being a good 
<br/>&gt; parent by not<br/>&gt; &gt; also keeping my son home. SJZ called me one last time to <br/>say "Are <br/>&gt; y'all<br/>&gt; &gt; really going camping?" to which I replied "The only way to have <br/>
an <br/>&gt; adventure<br/>&gt; &gt; is to go on an adventure" - I only wished I felt so cavalier. I <br/>&gt; just<br/>&gt; &gt; felt the impending cold and wet feeling starting to seep in <br/>before <br/>&gt; we ever<br/>
&gt; &gt; got a start.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; We had so many cancellations that we didn't have to haul a <br/>trailer <br/>&gt; and there<br/>&gt; &gt; was even room for me and my gear on the van, so I parked the car, 
<br/>&gt; grabbed my<br/>&gt; &gt; gear and piled into the van, settling into the front seat next to <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; Scoutmaster and made up my mind to make the best of things. We <br/>&gt; spent the<br/>&gt; &gt; next hour tring to ignore the rain, talking about scouting, and 
<br/>me <br/>&gt; generally<br/>&gt; &gt; picking his brain as I like to do whenever I have a Scoutmaster <br/>held<br/>&gt; &gt; captive.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; We got to camp and thanks to the dismal weather it got much 
<br/>darker <br/>&gt; even<br/>&gt; &gt; earlier than usual, so we set camp up in the drenching dark. <br/>&gt; Thankfully,<br/>&gt; &gt; Fearless Fox had arrived and gotten a fire blazing and it was <br/>going <br/>&gt; well<br/>
&gt; &gt; enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier rain, so we <br/>&gt; alternated<br/>&gt; &gt; setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until finally the <br/>&gt; kitchen was in<br/>&gt; &gt; place, the tents were erected, and everything was settled.
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he wound up <br/>with <br/>&gt; a tent<br/>&gt; &gt; by himself. I was a little worried about that because his last <br/>&gt; rainy<br/>&gt; &gt; camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend gathering and 
<br/>he <br/>&gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how he would <br/>&gt; fare by<br/>&gt; &gt; himself on a rainy night. And I wondered if he would stay warm <br/>&gt; without a<br/>&gt; &gt; tentmate to help warm the tent. He never asked to bunk in with 
<br/>&gt; Fearless Fox<br/>&gt; &gt; and me, so we didn't offer either.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire looking at <br/>each <br/>&gt; other.<br/>&gt; &gt; It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program when 
<br/>it's <br/>&gt; raining<br/>&gt; &gt; and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying sitting <br/>around <br/>&gt; the fire<br/>&gt; &gt; swapping stories when it's raining and cold too. Finally I <br/>&gt; suggested we go
<br/>&gt; &gt; on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we had a <br/>few <br/>&gt; takers.<br/>&gt; &gt; We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra batteries <br/>and <br/>&gt; set my<br/>&gt; &gt; GPS. The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat of the 
<br/>&gt; van and<br/>&gt; &gt; headed out - I navigated while he drove. We finally got to the <br/>&gt; jumping off<br/>&gt; &gt; point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but we <br/>&gt; figured we had<br/>&gt; &gt; enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had to. We 
<br/>&gt; jumped out<br/>&gt; &gt; and set our flashlights into action because the idea was that we <br/>&gt; had to find<br/>&gt; &gt; the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the day, thus <br/>&gt; finding the<br/>
&gt; &gt; path that would lead us to the cache that would give us the <br/>coords <br/>&gt; to the<br/>&gt; &gt; next leg of the cache. Funny thing about rain on trees is that <br/>&gt; everything<br/>&gt; &gt; reflects! After roaming around for twenty minutes, spreading out 
<br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical path, <br/>we <br/>&gt; decided<br/>&gt; &gt; there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed <br/>&gt; distinctive enough<br/>&gt; &gt; to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back into the 
<br/>nice <br/>&gt; white<br/>&gt; &gt; church van and headed back to camp. We were gone a total of <br/>almost <br/>&gt; an hour,<br/>&gt; &gt; and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated the <br/>&gt; erection of a
<br/>&gt; &gt; tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all gather around <br/>&gt; the fire<br/>&gt; &gt; and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit under the <br/>&gt; tarp, then<br/>&gt; &gt; warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for a bit 
<br/>as <br/>&gt; we took<br/>&gt; &gt; our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under the <br/>tarp. <br/>&gt; Finally,<br/>&gt; &gt; one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our tents and <br/>&gt; settle in.
<br/>&gt; &gt; Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never thought I <br/>&gt; would like<br/>&gt; &gt; a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta say - <br/>it <br/>&gt; felt<br/>&gt; &gt; pretty darned good Friday night!
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that I had <br/>been <br/>&gt; shoving<br/>&gt; &gt; back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - what if <br/>&gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which was the 
<br/>&gt; whole<br/>&gt; &gt; reason I came on this trip anyway???<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely perfect - <br/>&gt; cold, mind<br/>&gt; &gt; you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling. I 
<br/>thought <br/>&gt; I was<br/>&gt; &gt; being funny when I went to join the guys already at the campfire <br/>&gt; with my<br/>&gt; &gt; wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you have an <br/>&gt; extra
<br/>&gt; &gt; scrunchy, do you?". Two of the men headed to their trucks and <br/>came <br/>&gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; with scrunchies. Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their <br/>leaders,<br/>&gt; &gt; especially the ones that have sisters and daughters.
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your breakfast, you <br/>&gt; need to be<br/>&gt; &gt; patient, at least in our troop. I'm almost always up before <br/>them, <br/>&gt; but the<br/>&gt; &gt; name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do everything and 
<br/>&gt; leaders<br/>&gt; &gt; should not do anything. Different than Cub Scouts, where I know <br/>&gt; that on a<br/>&gt; &gt; campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go to bed <br/>&gt; again, so I<br/>&gt; &gt; may as well jump in and start breakfast right away. 
<br/>Consequently, <br/>&gt; I found<br/>&gt; &gt; myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I could <br/>at <br/>&gt; least<br/>&gt; &gt; orient myself to the park. Although I've been to Mission Tejas <br/>&gt; many times,
<br/>&gt; &gt; I've never been in a position of having to walk to wherever I <br/>&gt; wanted to be,<br/>&gt; &gt; so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to anywhere. <br/>&gt; The state<br/>&gt; &gt; park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better. Between 
<br/>&gt; walking the<br/>&gt; &gt; main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on the <br/>trees, <br/>&gt; I felt<br/>&gt; &gt; like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how close some <br/>&gt; things are to<br/>
&gt; &gt; each other. Amazing! While out, I noted in my mind where I <br/>would <br/>&gt; have to<br/>&gt; &gt; be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and roughly <br/>&gt; located where<br/>&gt; &gt; the various caches were. I was ready - all except breakfast.
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were firing up and <br/>&gt; eggs were<br/>&gt; &gt; being cracked. It was starting to look like we might have <br/>&gt; breakfast before<br/>&gt; &gt; noon, er, I mean nine. They had brought far more food than we 
<br/>&gt; needed<br/>&gt; &gt; because there were supposed to be three times more people on the <br/>&gt; campout<br/>&gt; &gt; than there were. I got a kick out of the boys debating exactly <br/>how <br/>&gt; much of<br/>&gt; &gt; everything to cook because they normally cook it all. They are 
<br/>&gt; very exact<br/>&gt; &gt; in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy and they <br/>&gt; are not<br/>&gt; &gt; very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the scout <br/>&gt; law), so<br/>&gt; &gt; when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a loop. 
<br/>&gt; It's sorely<br/>&gt; &gt; tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort them out <br/>&gt; quickly, so<br/>&gt; &gt; it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let them <br/>&gt; reach their
<br/>&gt; &gt; own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the sames <br/>ones <br/>&gt; a sane<br/>&gt; &gt; adult would come to. Thankfully, we had our sausage patties <br/>&gt; crumbled into<br/>&gt; &gt; tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers...
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more time <br/>&gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; setting out. The boys were getting ready to work on advancement <br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl before 
<br/>&gt; they got<br/>&gt; &gt; started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, then <br/>&gt; headed out to<br/>&gt; &gt; go boxing/caching. Now I had not gone far from the campsite when <br/>I <br/>&gt; realized<br/>
&gt; &gt; that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you <br/>arrange <br/>&gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; clothes. I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I had <br/>put <br/>&gt; the pair<br/>&gt; &gt; of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so every 
<br/>&gt; time I went<br/>&gt; &gt; to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the waistband <br/>of <br/>&gt; my top<br/>&gt; &gt; pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the under <br/>&gt; pair, or<br/>&gt; &gt; everything would go straight to the ground. This proved to be a 
<br/>&gt; problem<br/>&gt; &gt; eventually.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my letterboxing <br/>&gt; journey.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some 
<br/>&gt; boxes. After<br/>&gt; &gt; sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little stove <br/>up, <br/>&gt; so I<br/>&gt; &gt; deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as tall <br/>as <br/>&gt; I could.
<br/>&gt; &gt; I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking in that <br/>&gt; glorious<br/>&gt; &gt; winter air. Perfect. Just perfect. It really was. My legs and <br/>&gt; back were<br/>&gt; &gt; stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD!
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my clues (I do <br/>&gt; much better<br/>&gt; &gt; if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize where <br/>&gt; the clues<br/>&gt; &gt; are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first checking 
<br/>on <br/>&gt; Baby<br/>&gt; &gt; Bear's box. Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view of the <br/>&gt; pond that<br/>&gt; &gt; I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it on my <br/>way <br/>&gt; back<br/>
&gt; &gt; around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's Indian <br/>&gt; Trails<br/>&gt; &gt; box.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in Mission <br/>&gt; Tejas, I
<br/>&gt; &gt; would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like a new <br/>&gt; park. Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I don't know, <br/>&gt; but I got<br/>&gt; &gt; really caught up in the views. This time though, I remembered to 
<br/>&gt; stop and<br/>&gt; &gt; look for the box. I really do have an aversion to sticking my <br/>hand <br/>&gt; into a<br/>&gt; &gt; blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there should be no<br/>&gt; &gt; cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself down the 
<br/>&gt; incline to<br/>&gt; &gt; look in to where my hand was going to go. I pulled my glove on <br/>&gt; just in<br/>&gt; &gt; case, removed the cover and there was the box, just as planned. <br/>&gt; There<br/>&gt; &gt; wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would just 
<br/>return <br/>&gt; and sit<br/>&gt; &gt; in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I slid <br/>back <br/>&gt; down - I<br/>&gt; &gt; had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and the <br/>ground <br/>&gt; off the
<br/>&gt; &gt; trail was slick. So I rolled around a bit in the wet leaves, got <br/>&gt; slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; damp, but no big deal. I tried again and made it, logged in, and <br/>&gt; went to<br/>&gt; &gt; return it. This time I slid down the hill almost to the water, 
<br/>and <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on down between <br/>my <br/>&gt; two<br/>&gt; &gt; pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what was <br/>&gt; happening I saw<br/>&gt; &gt; my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my water bottle.
<br/>&gt; &gt; Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since it sank <br/>&gt; like lead<br/>&gt; &gt; weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my water. <br/>&gt; In summer,<br/>&gt; &gt; the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a green 
<br/>sort <br/>&gt; of way,<br/>&gt; &gt; but in the winter, they are just intensely green. I wasn't real <br/>&gt; excited<br/>&gt; &gt; about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was pretty <br/>&gt; sure was<br/>
&gt; &gt; also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice. I <br/>really <br/>&gt; couldn't<br/>&gt; &gt; tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, you <br/>know), <br/>&gt; but I<br/>&gt; &gt; knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get my 
<br/>GPS. <br/>&gt; Knowing<br/>&gt; &gt; my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching out to <br/>get <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the cold green <br/>&gt; water. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling squishy <br/>for <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS without any <br/>&gt; further<br/>&gt; &gt; incident. I was feeling especially pleased with myself and got 
<br/>&gt; back to the<br/>&gt; &gt; trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in a hurry <br/>&gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile of scat. <br/>&gt; Ewwwww...<br/>&gt; &gt; 
<br/>&gt; &gt; So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt <br/>would <br/>&gt; be quite<br/>&gt; &gt; a way along the trail. I stopped briefly to get a drink of <br/>water, <br/>&gt; and I<br/>&gt; &gt; realized the smell wasn't any better. I went to wipe the top of 
<br/>my <br/>&gt; water<br/>&gt; &gt; bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't any <br/>&gt; better. Big<br/>&gt; &gt; ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, and it <br/>was <br/>&gt; on my
<br/>&gt; &gt; top pair of pants too. It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was <br/>&gt; smelling, it<br/>&gt; &gt; was a newly reopened one - by me. In one of my two slides down <br/>the <br/>&gt; hill.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've been, so I 
<br/>&gt; resolved<br/>&gt; &gt; to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit. I <br/>&gt; managed to<br/>&gt; &gt; rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my pants, <br/>&gt; but at that<br/>&gt; &gt; point I was really wet again. I shed the top shirt and carried 
<br/>it <br/>&gt; and tried<br/>&gt; &gt; not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was cold. I <br/>&gt; reminded<br/>&gt; &gt; myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the night <br/>&gt; before with<br/>&gt; &gt; some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do it in 
<br/>the <br/>&gt; daylight<br/>&gt; &gt; too.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail it back <br/>&gt; to fresh<br/>&gt; &gt; water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing? I gave it a 
<br/>&gt; minute or<br/>&gt; &gt; two of thought, but I finally opted to box on. I mean really, by <br/>&gt; then I had<br/>&gt; &gt; sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing and I <br/>&gt; didn't expect<br/>
&gt; &gt; to run into anyone I knew on the trail. It wasn't like Walmart <br/>&gt; where you<br/>&gt; &gt; run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and good <br/>&gt; clothes<br/>&gt; &gt; before you go. This was the stinking woods, emphasis on stinking 
<br/>&gt; in my<br/>&gt; &gt; case!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; So on I went - boxing on. I reached the area where the next <br/>boxes <br/>&gt; were to<br/>&gt; &gt; be and I began working the clues with no luck. I decided I had 
<br/>&gt; gone through<br/>&gt; &gt; so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily. I <br/>&gt; tried the<br/>&gt; &gt; clues every which way I could, to no avail. Well I say that, but <br/>I <br/>&gt; do think
<br/>&gt; &gt; I know the general area where one was - squarely in the middle of <br/>a <br/>&gt; blocked<br/>&gt; &gt; off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge. Eventually I <br/>had <br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took 
<br/>myself <br/>&gt; back to<br/>&gt; &gt; the trailhead.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I decided to <br/>&gt; head back<br/>&gt; &gt; to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem. I 
<br/>looked <br/>&gt; like a<br/>&gt; &gt; bedraggled rat. And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat. Somehow <br/>&gt; it finally<br/>&gt; &gt; occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I could <br/>rinse <br/>&gt; all my
<br/>&gt; &gt; clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave off <br/>one <br/>&gt; pair of<br/>&gt; &gt; pants and one shirt and return to camp. As a bonus, I had also <br/>&gt; already<br/>&gt; &gt; loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could arrange the 
<br/>&gt; vehicle<br/>&gt; &gt; doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into clean dry <br/>&gt; clothes.<br/>&gt; &gt; This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my experience as <br/>&gt; they only<br/>&gt; &gt; first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in with a light 
<br/>step,<br/>&gt; &gt; carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks. That struck them <br/>&gt; as odd,<br/>&gt; &gt; but they were busy so they never thought again about it. That <br/>is, <br/>&gt; until a<br/>&gt; &gt; half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and 
<br/>&gt; said "Okay. What<br/>&gt; &gt; happened to you?" I don't know if he noticed I wasn't wearing <br/>the <br/>&gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him off <br/>
or <br/>&gt; what, but<br/>&gt; &gt; he had figured it out. When I told him what had happened, I <br/>&gt; thought he<br/>&gt; &gt; would never stop laughing at me!<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; We ate lunch and started packing to head home. I ran out of time 
<br/>&gt; to hunt<br/>&gt; &gt; the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I ran out <br/>of <br/>&gt; energy<br/>&gt; &gt; too. I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I was <br/>&gt; Saturday.<br/>&gt; &gt; 
<br/>&gt; &gt; The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an email <br/>from <br/>&gt; Jim<br/>&gt; &gt; (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas the <br/>same <br/>&gt; day.<br/>&gt; &gt; Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!
<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to reach <br/>300+ <br/>&gt; and to<br/>&gt; &gt; get seven boxes and several caches. I wound up getting my 299th -<br/><br/>&gt; and it<br/>&gt; &gt; was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are! But I think I had as 
<br/>&gt; satisfying<br/>&gt; &gt; and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was pretty fun) <br/>&gt; finding<br/>&gt; &gt; that one little box as I could've had if I had found every box <br/>&gt; there (not<br/>&gt; &gt; that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!). And I 
<br/>&gt; promise you<br/>&gt; &gt; - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails in my <br/>&gt; logbook.<br/>&gt; &gt; Thank you, LSQ, for the experience! Wish you'da been there so I <br/>&gt; could've<br/>
&gt; &gt; shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) (well yeah, <br/>I <br/>&gt; wouldn't<br/>&gt; &gt; wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just kidding) <br/>&gt; (sort of).<br/>&gt; &gt; -- <br/>&gt; &gt; Barefoot Lucy

                    <div class="plaintext-content">During the depression years of the 1930's, the CCC (Civilian <br>
Conservation Corps) was formed to provide work for young men.  These <br>
young men built many of the buildings and roads that form the state <br>
parks in Texas.  At Mission Tejas State Park, they built a series of <br>
3 stone catch basins downstream from a spring to catch water in which <br>
they bathed.  These "bathtubs" still exist in the park and there is a <br>
trail which leads to them.  No need to avoid them, they're pretty <br>
interesting.  I doubt they ever had a septic system in the park in <br>
those days.<br>

 Tejas State Park, they built a series of <br/>3 stone catch basins downstream from a spring to catch water in which <br/>they bathed.

I showed up at Mission <br/>Tejas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equipped<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my clues, and I also took with me several coordinates<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; geocaches in that park are also
 said to be very good.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Back to Friday, it rained and sleeted and snowed off and on <br/>&gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; day<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co-workers would walk by my desk and ask me if I was really <br/>&gt; going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "this weather", to which I said "Unless it gets called off."<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Meanwhile,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chanting - Please call it off, Please call it off). I got <br/>off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; work<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was still raining and sleeting and Fearless Fox had already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; called<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scoutmaster to see if we were still going. Yep. Still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going. "The boys<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEED a cold weather campout." Need is a strong word.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Fearless Fox loaded his truck up and went on down to <br/>&gt; Mission<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tejas to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start a fire and Lightning and I met the troop at the <br/>church <br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sponsors<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them. As I stood there listening to the Assistant <br/>Scoutmaster<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell (and think grinchlike grin here) calling parents "Yes, <br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going. The boys NEED a cold weather campout.", I tried to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; remember<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever camped in cold AND raining conditions. There WAS the <br/>&gt; Brazos<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bend<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering, very wet but not terribly cold. There was the <br/>&gt; summer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spent<br/>&gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping in Canada and the Northwest, and that got down into <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 30's, but I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't remember it raining that summer. And then camping in <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Florida<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everglades for nearly three weeks - it rained every day, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; again,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't cold. There was the one and only girl scout campout I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when it started raining after we got set up and I had to <br/>show <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girls (newbie campers that they were) how you should NOT <br/>touch<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sides of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tent, so we all touched the sides of the tent and the <br/>tent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flooded from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
 inside out, but that was relatively warm too - just <br/>&gt; horribly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messy. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just don't remember putting cold AND wet together on a <br/>&gt; campout,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NacTrailCat can remember something along those lines from my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; growing up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years. So anyway, after 2/3 of the expected participants<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cancelled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parental insistence, I started to wonder if I was being a <br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parent by not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also keeping my son home. SJZ called me one last time to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; say "Are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; y'all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really going camping?" to which I replied "The only way to <br/>&gt; have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adventure<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to go on an
 adventure" - I only wished I felt so <br/>cavalier. <br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt the impending cold and wet feeling starting to seep in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we ever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got a start.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We had so many cancellations that we didn't have to haul a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; trailer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and there<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was even room for me and my gear on the van, so I parked <br/>the <br/>&gt; car,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grabbed my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gear and piled into the van, settling into the front seat <br/>&gt; next to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scoutmaster and made up my mind to make the best of things. <br/>We<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spent the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next hour tring to ignore the rain, talking about scouting, <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; generally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picking his brain as I like to do whenever I have a <br/>&gt; Scoutmaster<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; held<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captive.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got to camp and thanks to the dismal weather it got much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; darker<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earlier than usual, so we set camp up in the drenching dark.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thankfully,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox had arrived and gotten a fire blazing and it <br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier rain, <br/>so <br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternated<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until finally <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kitchen was in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place, the tents were erected, and everything was settled.<br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he wound <br/>up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a tent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by himself. I was a little worried about that because his <br/>last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rainy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend gathering <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how he <br/>&gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fare by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself on a rainy night. And I wondered if he would stay <br/>warm<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tentmate to help warm the tent. He never asked to bunk in <br/>with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and me, so we didn't offer either.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once camp was set, we all gathered
 around the fire looking <br/>at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; each<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program <br/>when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it's<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raining<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying sitting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; swapping stories when it's raining and cold too. Finally I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested we go<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we <br/>had a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; takers.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra <br/>batteries<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GPS. The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat of <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; van and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headed out - I navigated
 while he drove. We finally got to <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumping off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figured we had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had to. <br/>We<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumped out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and set our flashlights into action because the idea was <br/>that <br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had to find<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the day, <br/>&gt; thus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; path that would lead us to the cache that would give us the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; coords<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next leg of the cache. Funny thing about rain on trees is <br/>that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflects! After roaming around for twenty minutes, <br/>spreading <br/>&gt;
 out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical <br/>&gt; path,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctive enough<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back into <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; nice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; church van and headed back to camp. We were gone a total of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; almost<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an hour,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; erection of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all gather <br/>&gt; around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit under <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; tarp, then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for a <br/>&gt; bit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we took<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; tarp.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our tents <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; settle in.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never <br/>&gt; thought I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta <br/>&gt; say -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty darned good Friday night!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that I <br/>had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shoving<br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - <br/>&gt; what if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which <br/>was <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason I came on this trip anyway???<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely <br/>&gt; perfect -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold, mind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thought<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being funny when I went to join the guys already at the <br/>&gt; campfire<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you <br/>&gt; have an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrunchy, do you?". Two of the men headed to their trucks
 <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; came<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with scrunchies. Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; leaders,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially the ones that have sisters and daughters.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your breakfast, <br/>&gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patient, at least in our troop. I'm almost always up before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; them,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do everything <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not do anything. Different than Cub Scouts, where I <br/>&gt; know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that on a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go to <br/>&gt; bed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again, so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I found<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I <br/>&gt; could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orient myself to the park. Although I've been to Mission <br/>Tejas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many times,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've never been in a position of having to walk to wherever <br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to be,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to <br/>&gt; anywhere.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The state<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better. <br/>Between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; trees,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I felt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like I had suddenly
 turned the key and realized how close <br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things are to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each other. Amazing! While out, I noted in my mind where I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and <br/>roughly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; located where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the various caches were. I was ready - all except breakfast.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were firing <br/>up <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eggs were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being cracked. It was starting to look like we might have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breakfast before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noon, er, I mean nine. They had brought far more food than <br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because there were supposed to be three times more people <br/>on <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; campout<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than there were. I got a kick out of the boys debating <br/>exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything to cook because they normally cook it all. They <br/>are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very exact<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy and <br/>&gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the <br/>&gt; scout<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; law), so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a <br/>loop.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's sorely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort <br/>them <br/>&gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly, so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let <br/>them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach their<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the <br/>sames<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ones<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a sane<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adult would come to. Thankfully, we had our sausage patties<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crumbled into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers..<wbr>.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more <br/>time<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setting out. The boys were getting ready to work on <br/>&gt; advancement<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of Pteredactyl <br/>&gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, <br/>then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headed out to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go boxing/caching. Now I had not gone far from the campsite <br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; arrange<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes. I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but I <br/>had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; put<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pair<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, so <br/>&gt; every<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time I went<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the <br/>&gt; waistband<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my top<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the <br/>under<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair, or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything would go straight to the ground. This proved to <br/>be <br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So
 anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my <br/>letterboxing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; journey.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes. After<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little <br/>stove<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; up,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up as <br/>&gt; tall<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking <br/>in <br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glorious<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; winter air. Perfect. Just perfect. It really was. My legs <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I got to the pond area and once
 again coordinated my clues <br/>(I <br/>&gt; do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much better<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I can get myself into close proximity and then visualize <br/>&gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the clues<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first <br/>&gt; checking<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bear's box. Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view <br/>of <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pond that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it <br/>on <br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; way<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's <br/>&gt; Indian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trails<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in <br/>Mission<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tejas, I<br/>&gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like a <br/>new<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park. Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I don't <br/>&gt; know,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really caught up in the views. This time though, I <br/>remembered <br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stop and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look for the box. I really do have an aversion to sticking <br/>my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hand<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there should <br/>&gt; be no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself <br/>down <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incline to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look in to where my hand was going to go. I pulled my glove <br/>on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, removed the cover and there was the box,
 just as <br/>&gt; planned.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; return<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I <br/>slid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down - I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ground<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trail was slick. So I rolled around a bit in the wet <br/>leaves, <br/>&gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; damp, but no big deal. I tried again and made it, logged <br/>in, <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return it. This time I slid down the hill almost to the <br/>water,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff that was supposedly in my pocket
 skittered on down <br/>&gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happening I saw<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my water <br/>&gt; bottle.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since <br/>it <br/>&gt; sank<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like lead<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my <br/>&gt; water.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summer,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a <br/>green<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; sort<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of way,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but in the winter, they are just intensely green. I wasn't <br/>&gt; real<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excited<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was <br/>&gt; pretty<br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; sure was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; know),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; GPS.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching out <br/>to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; get<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the cold <br/>&gt; green<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling <br/>squishy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS <br/>without <br/>&gt; any<br/>&gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; further<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incident. I was feeling especially pleased with myself and <br/>got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in a <br/>&gt; hurry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile of <br/>&gt; scat.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ewwwww...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I felt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be quite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way along the trail. I stopped briefly to get a drink of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; water,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized the smell wasn't any better. I went to wipe the <br/>top <br/>&gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't
 <br/>any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better. Big<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, <br/>and <br/>&gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top pair of pants too. It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smelling, it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a newly reopened one - by me. In one of my two slides <br/>down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hill.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've <br/>been, <br/>&gt; so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resolved<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my <br/>&gt; pants,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but at that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point I was really wet again. I shed the top shirt and
 <br/>carried<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tried<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was <br/>cold. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reminded<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the <br/>night<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do <br/>it <br/>&gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daylight<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail <br/>it <br/>&gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to fresh<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing? I gave <br/>it <br/>&gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minute or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two of thought, but I finally opted to box on. I mean <br/>really, <br/>&gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then I had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing <br/>and I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't expect<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to run into anyone I knew on the trail. It wasn't like <br/>Walmart<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and <br/>good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you go. This was the stinking woods, emphasis on <br/>&gt; stinking<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So on I went - boxing on. I reached the area where the next<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be and I began working the clues with no luck. I decided I <br/>had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gone through<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up easily. <br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clues
 every which way I could, to no avail. Well I say <br/>that, <br/>&gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do think<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know the general area where one was - squarely in the <br/>&gt; middle of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocked<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge. <br/>Eventually I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I took<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; myself<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trailhead.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I <br/>&gt; decided to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; looked<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bedraggled rat. And smelled like a
 bedraggled dead rat. <br/>&gt; Somehow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it finally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I <br/>could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rinse<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then leave <br/>off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pants and one shirt and return to camp. As a bonus, I had <br/>also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could <br/>arrange <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vehicle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into <br/>clean <br/>&gt; dry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my <br/>experience <br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in
 with a <br/>light<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; step,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks. That struck <br/>&gt; them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as odd,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but they were busy so they never thought again about it. <br/>That<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; is,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said "Okay. What<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened to you?" I don't know if he noticed I wasn't <br/>wearing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped him <br/>&gt; off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; or<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he had figured it out. When I told him what had happened, I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would never stop laughing at me!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We
 ate lunch and started packing to head home. I ran out of <br/>&gt; time<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hunt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I <br/>ran <br/>&gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too. I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I <br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an <br/>email<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jim<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; day.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to <br/>reach<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 300+<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get seven
 boxes and several caches. I wound up getting my <br/>&gt; 299th -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are! But I think I had <br/>as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfying<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was <br/>pretty <br/>&gt; fun)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one little box as I could've had if I had found every <br/>box<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there (not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!). <br/>And <br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; promise you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - I will always remember that day when I see Indian Trails <br/>in <br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logbook.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, LSQ, for the experience! Wish you'da been there <br/>so <br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could've<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shared the wealth...(just kidding)
 (well not really) (well <br/>&gt; yeah,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just <br/>kidding)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (sort of).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; -- <br/>&gt; &gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; &gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></div></div><!--End group email

<p>That sounds like a letterbox waiting to happen if there isn't one <br/>already in that area. I will have to look into where that is at and <br/>drag Frogkisses and our broods down there for a weekend. Of course I <br/>
will send Frogkisses down the hill where BFL went will I watch the <br/>baby :)<br/><br/>Texas Pokey<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Boots Tex and Lone Star

<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I went camping with our Boy Scout troop Friday night - <br/>&gt; think <br/>&gt; &gt; 30<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; degrees and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pouring rain - with the intention of getting to go 
<br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were doing their Boy Scout thing. I showed up at Mission <br/>&gt; Tejas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equipped<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my clues, and I also took with me several coordinates
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; geocaches in that park are also said to be very good.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Back to Friday, it rained and sleeted and snowed off and 
<br/>on <br/>&gt; &gt; all<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; day<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; co-workers would walk by my desk and ask me if I was <br/>really <br/>&gt; &gt; going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping in
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; "this weather", to which I said "Unless it gets called <br/>off."<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Meanwhile,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; chanting - Please call it off, Please call it off). I got 
<br/>&gt; off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was still raining and sleeting and Fearless Fox had <br/>already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; called<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scoutmaster to see if we were still going. Yep. Still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going. "The boys<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NEED a cold weather campout." Need is a strong word.
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So Fearless Fox loaded his truck up and went on down to <br/>&gt; &gt; Mission<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tejas to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; start a fire and Lightning and I met the troop at the 
<br/>&gt; church <br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sponsors<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them. As I stood there listening to the Assistant <br/>&gt; Scoutmaster<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repeatedly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell (and think grinchlike grin here) calling 
<br/>parents "Yes, <br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going. The boys NEED a cold weather campout.", I tried to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever camped in cold AND raining conditions. There WAS the <br/>&gt; &gt; Brazos<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bend<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering, very wet but not terribly cold. There was the 
<br/>&gt; &gt; summer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping in Canada and the Northwest, and that got down <br/>into <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 30's, but I
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't remember it raining that summer. And then camping <br/>in <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Florida<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everglades for nearly three weeks - it rained every day, 
<br/>but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't cold. There was the one and only girl scout <br/>campout I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ever<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went on
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when it started raining after we got set up and I had to <br/>&gt; show <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; girls (newbie campers that they were) how you should NOT 
<br/>&gt; touch<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sides of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the tent, so we all touched the sides of the tent and the <br/>&gt; tent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; flooded from
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the inside out, but that was relatively warm too - just <br/>&gt; &gt; horribly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messy. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just don't remember putting cold AND wet together on a 
<br/>&gt; &gt; campout,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; NacTrailCat can remember something along those lines from <br/>my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; growing up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years. So anyway, after 2/3 of the expected participants<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cancelled<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parental insistence, I started to wonder if I was being a 
<br/>&gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parent by not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also keeping my son home. SJZ called me one last time to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say "Are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; y'all<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really going camping?" to which I replied "The only way <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adventure<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to go on an adventure" - I only wished I felt so 
<br/>&gt; cavalier. <br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt the impending cold and wet feeling starting to seep <br/>in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we ever
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got a start.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We had so many cancellations that we didn't have to haul a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trailer<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and there
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was even room for me and my gear on the van, so I parked <br/>&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; car,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grabbed my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gear and piled into the van, settling into the front seat 
<br/>&gt; &gt; next to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Scoutmaster and made up my mind to make the best of <br/>things. <br/>&gt; We<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spent the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next hour tring to ignore the rain, talking about 
<br/>scouting, <br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picking his brain as I like to do whenever I have a <br/>&gt; &gt; Scoutmaster<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; held
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; captive.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We got to camp and thanks to the dismal weather it got <br/>much<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; darker<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; earlier than usual, so we set camp up in the drenching <br/>dark.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thankfully,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox had arrived and gotten a fire blazing and it 
<br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; going<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; well<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier rain, <br/>&gt; so <br/>&gt; &gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternated
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until finally <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kitchen was in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place, the tents were erected, and everything was settled.
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so he <br/>wound <br/>&gt; up<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a tent<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by himself. I was a little worried about that because his 
<br/>&gt; last<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rainy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend <br/>gathering <br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I wondered how <br/>he <br/>&gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fare by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself on a rainy night. And I wondered if he would stay 
<br/>&gt; warm<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tentmate to help warm the tent. He never asked to bunk in <br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and me, so we didn't offer either.
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire <br/>looking <br/>&gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire program 
<br/>&gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raining<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying <br/>sitting<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; swapping stories when it's raining and cold too. Finally I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested we go<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, so we 
<br/>&gt; had a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; takers.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra <br/>&gt; batteries<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set my
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GPS. The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front seat <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; van and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headed out - I navigated while he drove. We finally got 
<br/>to <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumping off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point for the cache and parked on not so firm ground, but <br/>we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figured we had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we had 
<br/>to. <br/>&gt; We<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumped out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and set our flashlights into action because the idea was <br/>&gt; that <br/>&gt; &gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had to find<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during the <br/>day, <br/>&gt; &gt; thus<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; path that would lead us to the cache that would give us 
<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coords<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next leg of the cache. Funny thing about rain on trees is <br/>&gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflects! After roaming around for twenty minutes, 
<br/>&gt; spreading <br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the magical <br/>&gt; &gt; path,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was just too much reflection and none of it seemed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctive enough<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right back 
<br/>into <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; church van and headed back to camp. We were gone a total <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an hour,
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had orchestrated <br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; erection of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all 
<br/>gather <br/>&gt; &gt; around<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a bit <br/>under <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp, then
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and wet for <br/>a <br/>&gt; &gt; bit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we took<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't under 
<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to our <br/>tents <br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; settle in.
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I never <br/>&gt; &gt; thought I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I gotta 
<br/>&gt; &gt; say -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty darned good Friday night!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought that 
<br/>I <br/>&gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shoving<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back into the recesses of my mind came into full vision - <br/>&gt; &gt; what if<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go letterboxing, which <br/>&gt; was <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason I came on this trip anyway???
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was absolutely <br/>&gt; &gt; perfect -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold, mind<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean feeling. I
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being funny when I went to join the guys already at the <br/>&gt; &gt; campfire<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wild morning hair and quipped "I don't suppose any of you 
<br/>&gt; &gt; have an<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrunchy, do you?". Two of the men headed to their trucks <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with scrunchies. Never underestimate Boy Scouts and their<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially the ones that have sisters and daughters.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your <br/>breakfast, <br/>&gt; &gt; you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to be<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patient, at least in our troop. I'm almost always up 
<br/>before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do <br/>everything <br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not do anything. Different than Cub Scouts, where <br/>I <br/>&gt; &gt; know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that on a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; campout once I get up I'm going to be working until I go 
<br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; bed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again, so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I found
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself standing around for awhile and finally I decided I <br/>&gt; &gt; could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orient myself to the park. Although I've been to Mission 
<br/>&gt; Tejas<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many times,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've never been in a position of having to walk to <br/>wherever <br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to be,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route to 
<br/>&gt; &gt; anywhere.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The state<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park maps are okay, but a walking view is much better. <br/>&gt; Between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; main loop before breakfast and there not being leaves on 
<br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trees,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I felt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how close <br/>&gt; some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things are to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each other. Amazing! While out, I noted in my mind where I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along and 
<br/>&gt; roughly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; located where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the various caches were. I was ready - all except <br/>breakfast.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were 
<br/>firing <br/>&gt; up <br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eggs were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being cracked. It was starting to look like we might have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breakfast before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noon, er, I mean nine. They had brought far more food 
<br/>than <br/>&gt; we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needed<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because there were supposed to be three times more people <br/>&gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; campout<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than there were. I got a kick out of the boys debating 
<br/>&gt; exactly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything to cook because they normally cook it all. <br/>They <br/>&gt; are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very exact
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in how much to allot to each person and how much to buy <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point of the 
<br/>&gt; &gt; scout<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; law), so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when suddenly they had all that food it threw them for a <br/>&gt; loop.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's sorely<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and sort 
<br/>&gt; them <br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly, so<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside and let <br/>&gt; them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually the <br/>&gt; sames<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ones<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a sane<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adult would come to. Thankfully, we had our sausage 
<br/>patties<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crumbled into<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book one more 
<br/>&gt; time<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setting out. The boys were getting ready to work on <br/>&gt; &gt; advancement<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of 
<br/>Pteredactyl <br/>&gt; &gt; before<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with them, <br/>&gt; then<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headed out to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go boxing/caching. Now I had not gone far from the <br/>campsite <br/>&gt; &gt; when<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that when boxing in the cold, it is very important how you
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrange<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes. I had two shirts and two pairs of pants on, but <br/>I <br/>&gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pair
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of pants with the pockets on underneath the other pair, <br/>so <br/>&gt; &gt; every<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time I went<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into the 
<br/>&gt; &gt; waistband<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my top<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket of the <br/>&gt; under<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair, or
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything would go straight to the ground. This proved <br/>to <br/>&gt; be <br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my <br/>&gt; letterboxing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; journey.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I walked toward the pond where there were rumored to be 
<br/>some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes. After<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a little <br/>&gt; stove<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deliberately stretched out my step and pulled myself up 
<br/>as <br/>&gt; &gt; tall<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started feeling better right away, so I started sucking <br/>&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glorious
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; winter air. Perfect. Just perfect. It really was. My legs <br/>&gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt GOOD!
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my <br/>clues <br/>&gt; (I <br/>&gt; &gt; do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much better<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I can get myself into close proximity and then 
<br/>visualize <br/>&gt; &gt; where<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the clues<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are sending me) and I set off with the intent of first <br/>&gt; &gt; checking<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bear's box. Unfortunately, I got so caught up in the view <br/>&gt; of <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pond that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly check it 
<br/>&gt; on <br/>&gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the loop. So off I went in the direction of LSQ's <br/>&gt; &gt; Indian<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trails
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now you would think that as much time as I've spent in <br/>&gt; Mission<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tejas, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt like <br/>a <br/>&gt; new<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park. Maybe<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I 
<br/>don't <br/>&gt; &gt; know,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really caught up in the views. This time though, I <br/>&gt; remembered <br/>&gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stop and
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look for the box. I really do have an aversion to <br/>sticking <br/>&gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there 
<br/>should <br/>&gt; &gt; be no<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed myself <br/>&gt; down <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incline to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look in to where my hand was going to go. I pulled my 
<br/>glove <br/>&gt; on<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, removed the cover and there was the box, just as <br/>&gt; &gt; planned.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I would 
<br/>just<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying back up I <br/>&gt; slid<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down - I
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, and <br/>the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ground<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trail was slick. So I rolled around a bit in the wet 
<br/>&gt; leaves, <br/>&gt; &gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; damp, but no big deal. I tried again and made it, logged <br/>&gt; in, <br/>&gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return it. This time I slid down the hill almost to the <br/>&gt; water,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on down 
<br/>&gt; &gt; between<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized what <br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happening I saw<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my <br/>water <br/>&gt; &gt; bottle.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially since <br/>&gt; it <br/>
&gt; &gt; sank<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like lead<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS and my <br/>&gt; &gt; water.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summer,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming in a 
<br/>&gt; green<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sort<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of way,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but in the winter, they are just intensely green. I <br/>wasn't <br/>&gt; &gt; real<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excited
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about sticking my hand into that green water, which I was <br/>&gt; &gt; pretty<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sure was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a choice. 
<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and all, <br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know),<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew I had to get close to the water to reach out and get <br/>my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GPS.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my own luck, I fully expected to find myself stretching 
<br/>out <br/>&gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid thing, only to fall full out on my side in the <br/>cold <br/>&gt; &gt; green<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water. I
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got close enough about the time I felt my toes feeling <br/>&gt; squishy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my GPS 
<br/>&gt; without <br/>&gt; &gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incident. I was feeling especially pleased with myself <br/>and <br/>&gt; got<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, especially in <br/>a <br/>&gt; &gt; hurry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the area was really starting to smell like a fresh pile 
<br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; scat.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ewwwww...<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So off I went in the direction of the next box, which I <br/>felt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be quite<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way along the trail. I stopped briefly to get a drink of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized the smell wasn't any better. I went to wipe the 
<br/>&gt; top <br/>&gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell wasn't <br/>&gt; any<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better. Big
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH shirts, <br/>&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top pair of pants too. It wasn't a fresh pile of scat I 
<br/>was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smelling, it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a newly reopened one - by me. In one of my two slides <br/>&gt; down<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hill.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I was about as far from fresh water as I could've <br/>&gt; been, <br/>&gt; &gt; so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resolved<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use the green water to at least clean up a little bit. 
<br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it off my <br/>&gt; &gt; pants,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but at that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point I was really wet again. I shed the top shirt and 
<br/>&gt; carried<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tried<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I was <br/>&gt; cold. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reminded
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable the <br/>&gt; night<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could certain do 
<br/>&gt; it <br/>&gt; &gt; in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daylight<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I came to the decision-making trail split - do I hightail 
<br/>&gt; it <br/>&gt; &gt; back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to fresh<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing? I <br/>gave <br/>&gt; it <br/>&gt; &gt; a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minute or
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two of thought, but I finally opted to box on. I mean <br/>&gt; really, <br/>&gt; &gt; by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then I had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was numbing 
<br/>&gt; and I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't expect<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to run into anyone I knew on the trail. It wasn't like <br/>&gt; Walmart<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run into everyone you know if you don't put on makeup and 
<br/>&gt; good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you go. This was the stinking woods, emphasis on <br/>&gt; &gt; stinking<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case!
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So on I went - boxing on. I reached the area where the <br/>next<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be and I began working the clues with no luck. I decided 
<br/>I <br/>&gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gone through<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up <br/>easily. <br/>&gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clues every which way I could, to no avail. Well I say 
<br/>&gt; that, <br/>&gt; &gt; but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do think<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know the general area where one was - squarely in the <br/>&gt; &gt; middle of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocked<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge. <br/>&gt; Eventually I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, and I 
<br/>took<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trailhead.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime so I 
<br/>&gt; &gt; decided to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head back<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a problem. <br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like a
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bedraggled rat. And smelled like a bedraggled dead rat. <br/>&gt; &gt; Somehow<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it finally<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, so I 
<br/>&gt; could<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rinse<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then <br/>leave <br/>&gt; off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair of
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pants and one shirt and return to camp. As a bonus, I had <br/>&gt; also<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I could 
<br/>&gt; arrange <br/>&gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vehicle<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doors to create a dressing room at camp and change into <br/>&gt; clean <br/>&gt; &gt; dry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes.
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my <br/>&gt; experience <br/>&gt; &gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in with a 
<br/>&gt; light<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks. That <br/>struck <br/>&gt; &gt; them<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as odd,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but they were busy so they never thought again about it. 
<br/>&gt; That<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me alone and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said "Okay. What<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened to you?" I don't know if he noticed I wasn't 
<br/>&gt; wearing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry tipped <br/>him <br/>&gt; &gt; off<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he had figured it out. When I told him what had happened, <br/>I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought he<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would never stop laughing at me!
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We ate lunch and started packing to head home. I ran out <br/>of <br/>&gt; &gt; time<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hunt<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of that, I 
<br/>&gt; ran <br/>&gt; &gt; out<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too. I have never been so happy to see my own shower as I <br/>&gt; was<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday.
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I got an <br/>&gt; email<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jim<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission Tejas 
<br/>&gt; the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; day.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the intent to 
<br/>&gt; reach<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 300+<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get seven boxes and several caches. I wound up getting my <br/>&gt; &gt; 299th -<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are! But I think I <br/>had <br/>&gt; as<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfying<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff was 
<br/>&gt; pretty <br/>&gt; &gt; fun)<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one little box as I could've had if I had found <br/>every <br/>&gt; box<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there (not
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them all!). <br/>&gt; And <br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; promise you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - I will always remember that day when I see Indian 
<br/>Trails <br/>&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logbook.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, LSQ, for the experience! Wish you'da been <br/>there <br/>&gt; so <br/>&gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could've
<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shared the wealth...(just kidding) (well not really) <br/>(well <br/>&gt; &gt; yeah,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wouldn't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wish some of that on anyone) (well, but nahhhh...just

 &gt; well<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough that it could withstand the waves of heavier <br/> &gt; rain,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alternated<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setting up camp and warming up by the fire, until <br/> &gt; finally<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kitchen was in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; place, the tents were erected, and everything was <br/> &gt; settled.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lightning's tentmate was one of the cancellors, so <br/> he<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; wound<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a tent<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by himself. I was a little worried about that <br/> because <br/> &gt;
 his<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rainy<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camping experience was with me at the Brazos Bend<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doesn't speak fondly of that occasion, so I <br/> wondered <br/> &gt; how<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; he<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fare by<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself on a rainy night. And I wondered if he <br/> would <br/> &gt; stay<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warm<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tentmate to help warm the tent. He never asked to <br/> &gt; bunk in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and me, so we didn't offer either.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once camp was set, we all gathered around the fire<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; looking<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's really hard to have a fun energetic campfire <br/> &gt; program<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raining<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and cold, and it's hard to pretend you are enjoying<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; sitting<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; swapping stories when it's raining and cold too. <br/> &gt; Finally I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested we go<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on a night geocache someone had recommended to me, <br/> so <br/> &gt; we<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; few<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; takers.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We all got our navigation gear together, I got extra<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; batteries<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GPS. The Scoutmaster and I jumped back in the front <br/> &gt; seat<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; van and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headed out - I navigated while he drove. We finally <br/> &gt; got<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumping off<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; point for the cache and parked on not so firm <br/> ground, <br/> &gt; but<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; figured we had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough bodies that we could get ourselves out if we <br/> &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; to.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jumped out<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and set our flashlights into action because the <br/> idea <br/> &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had to find<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the reflective paint that couldn't be seen during <br/> the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; day,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thus<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; path that would lead us to the cache that would <br/> give <br/> &gt; us<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt;
 the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coords<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; next leg of the cache. Funny thing about rain on <br/> &gt; trees is<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflects! After roaming around for twenty minutes,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spreading<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scouring the woods for what we hoped would be the <br/> &gt; magical<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; path,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there was just too much reflection and none of it <br/> &gt; seemed<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distinctive enough<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; to warrant calling it a path, so we bailed right <br/> back<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; into<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nice<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; white<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; church van and headed back to camp. We were gone a <br/> &gt; total<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; almost<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an hour,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and by the time we got back Fearless Fox had <br/> &gt; orchestrated<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; erection of a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp shelter next to the fire, so that we could all<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; gather<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and rotate, taking turns being dry but cold for a <br/> bit<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; under<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp, then<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warm but wet for a bit by the fire, then cold and <br/> wet <br/> &gt; for<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we took<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our turns on the dark side of the fire that wasn't <br/> &gt; under<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tarp.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one by one we felt warm and dry enough to head to <br/> our<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; tents<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; settle in.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Being warm natured and a little claustrophobic, I <br/> &gt; never<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I<br/>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would like<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a zero degree sleeping bag with a head cover, but I <br/> &gt; gotta<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say -<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; felt<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty darned good Friday night!<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I was drifting off to sleep, the nagging thought <br/> &gt; that<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shoving<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back into the recesses of my mind came into full <br/> &gt; vision -<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what if<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; DOESN'T let up and I don't get to go
 letterboxing, <br/> &gt; which<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whole<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason I came on this trip anyway???<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But alas, Saturday morning dawned and it was <br/> &gt; absolutely<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect -<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold, mind<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you, but sunny and beautifully crisp and clean <br/> &gt; feeling. I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being funny when I went to join the guys already at <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; campfire<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wild morning hair and quipped "I
 don't suppose any <br/> of <br/> &gt; you<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have an<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extra<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scrunchy, do you?". Two of the men headed to their <br/> &gt; trucks<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; came<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with scrunchies. Never underestimate Boy Scouts and <br/> &gt; their<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially the ones that have sisters and daughters.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you have to wait on Boy Scouts to cook your<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; breakfast,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to be<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patient, at least in our troop. I'm
 almost always up<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; name of the game with Boy Scouts is that they do<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; everything<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaders<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should not do anything. Different than Cub Scouts, <br/> &gt; where<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that on a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; campout once I get up I'm going to be working until <br/> I <br/> &gt; go<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bed<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again, so I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may as well jump in and start breakfast right away.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Consequently,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I found<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself standing around for awhile and finally I <br/> &gt; decided I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; least<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; orient myself to the park. Although I've been to <br/> &gt; Mission<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tejas<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many times,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've never been in a position of having to walk to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; wherever<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wanted to be,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I wanted to make sure I knew the shortest route <br/> to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; anywhere.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The state<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park maps are okay, but a walking view is much <br/>
 better.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Between<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; main loop before breakfast and there not being <br/> leaves <br/> &gt; on<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trees,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I felt<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like I had suddenly turned the key and realized how <br/> &gt; close<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things are to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each other. Amazing! While out, I noted in my mind <br/> &gt; where I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be to find each box, and I also took my GPS along <br/> and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; roughly<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; located where<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; the various caches were. I was ready - all except<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; breakfast.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I headed back to camp to find that dutch ovens were<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; firing<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eggs were<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being cracked. It was starting to look like we <br/> might <br/> &gt; have<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; breakfast before<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noon, er, I mean nine. They had brought far more <br/> food<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; than<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needed<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because there were supposed to be three times more <br/> &gt; people<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; campout<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than there were. I got a kick out of the boys <br/> debating<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exactly<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything to cook because they normally cook it <br/> all.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; They<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very exact<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in how much to allot to each person and how much to <br/> &gt; buy<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are not<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very wasteful (after all, Thrifty is the 9th point <br/> of <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scout<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; law), so<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when suddenly they had all
 that food it threw them <br/> &gt; for a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loop.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It's sorely<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tempting to jump in the middle of such debates and <br/> &gt; sort<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly, so<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it's hard sometimes for me to stand quietly aside <br/> and <br/> &gt; let<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach their<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own conclusions which, I'm glad to say, are usually <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sames<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ones<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a sane<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adult would come to. Thankfully, we had our sausage<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; patties<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; crumbled
 into<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tortillas instead of served up like hamburgers..<wbr>.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Right after breakfast I sat down with my LB book <br/> one <br/> &gt; more<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; setting out. The boys were getting ready to work on<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advancement<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fearless Fox wanted to play one quick round of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; Pteredactyl<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they got<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; started, so I jumped up and played Pteredactyl with <br/> &gt; them,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; headed out to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go boxing/caching. Now I had not gone far from the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; campsite<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that when boxing in the cold, it is very important <br/> &gt; how you<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrange<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes. I had two shirts and two pairs of pants <br/> on, <br/> &gt; but<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; put<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the pair<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of pants with the pockets on underneath the other <br/> &gt; pair,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; so<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time I went<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; to put something in my pocket, I had to reach into <br/> the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waistband<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my top<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair and had to be very careful to hit the pocket <br/> of <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; under<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair, or<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything would go straight to the ground. This <br/> &gt; proved<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eventually.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, all of this is to set the stage for my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; journey.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I walked toward the pond where there were rumored <br/> to <br/> &gt; be<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; some<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes. After<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sleeping on the cold hard ground, I was feeling a <br/> &gt; little<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stove<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deliberately stretched out my step and pulled <br/> myself <br/> &gt; up<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tall<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I could.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I started feeling better right away, so I started <br/> &gt; sucking<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; glorious<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; winter air. Perfect. Just perfect. It really was. <br/> My <br/> &gt; legs<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back were<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stretched and my lungs were stretched and I felt <br/> GOOD!<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I got to the pond area and once again coordinated my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; clues<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much better<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if I can get myself into close proximity and then<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; visualize<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the clues<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are sending me) and I set off with the intent of <br/> first<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checking<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Baby<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bear's box. Unfortunately, I got so caught up in <br/> the <br/> &gt; view<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pond that<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I walked right by it, but I knew I could quickly <br/> &gt; check it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; way<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around the loop. So off I went in the direction of <br/> &gt; LSQ's<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Indian<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trails<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now you would think that as much time as I've spent <br/> in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 Mission<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tejas, I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would know it very well by now, but somehow it felt <br/> &gt; like<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park. Maybe<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I've just never been there in the dead of winter - I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; don't<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I got<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really caught up in the views. This time though, I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remembered<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stop and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look for the box. I really do have an aversion to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; sticking<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hand<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blind hole, even in the wintertime when I know there<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; should<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be no<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold-blooded creatures to greet me, so I traipsed <br/> &gt; myself<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incline to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; look in to where my hand was going to go. I pulled <br/> my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; glove<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; just in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case, removed the cover and there was the box, just <br/> as<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; planned.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't a soul to be seen or heard, so I thought I <br/> &gt; would<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; just<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sit<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the path to stamp in, but as I was scurrying <br/> back <br/> &gt; up I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slid<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down - I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had already forgotten the torrential rains I guess, <br/> &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ground<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trail was slick. So I rolled around a bit in the wet<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leaves,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slightly<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; damp, but no big deal. I tried again and made it, <br/> &gt; logged<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return it. This time I slid down the hill almost to <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stuff that was supposedly in my pocket skittered on <br/> &gt; down<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; between<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pairs of pants to the water and just as I realized <br/> &gt; what<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happening I saw<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my GPS bob under and return to the top along with my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; water<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottle.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Everything else was somewhat disposable (especially <br/> &gt; since<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; sank<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like lead<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weights), but I really did need to retrieve my GPS <br/> &gt; and my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summer,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the brackish tones of the pond at MTSP are charming <br/> &gt; in a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; green<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sort<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of way,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but in the winter, they are just intensely green. I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; wasn't<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; real<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; excited<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about sticking my hand into that green water, which <br/> I <br/> &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sure was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; also very COLD water, but I didn't seem to have a <br/> &gt; choice.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; couldn't<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tell where the edge of the water began (leaves and <br/> &gt; all,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; you<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; know),<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knew I had to get close to the water to reach out <br/> and <br/> &gt; get<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; GPS.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my own luck, I fully expected to find myself <br/> &gt; stretching<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stupid
 thing, only to fall full out on my side in <br/> the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; cold<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; green<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water. I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got close enough about the time I felt my toes <br/> feeling<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; squishy<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; second time in 24 hours, but I was able to get my <br/> GPS<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incident. I was feeling especially pleased with <br/> myself<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; got<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trail and gathered my stuff up to head out, <br/> &gt; especially in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/> &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hurry<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the area was really starting to smell like a fresh <br/> &gt; pile<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scat.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ewwwww...<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So off I went in the direction of the next box, <br/> which <br/> &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; felt<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be quite<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a way along the trail. I stopped briefly to get a <br/> &gt; drink of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized the smell wasn't any better. I went to <br/> wipe <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; water<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bottle off on my shirt, only to find WHY the smell <br/> &gt; wasn't<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better. Big<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ewwww....somehow I had managed to get it on BOTH <br/> &gt; shirts,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; top pair of pants too. It wasn't a fresh pile of <br/> scat <br/> &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; smelling, it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a newly reopened one - by me. In one of my two <br/> &gt; slides<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; down<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; hill.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well I was about as far from fresh water as I <br/> could've<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resolved<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to use the green water to at least clean up a <br/> little <br/> &gt; bit.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; managed to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rinse the scat out of my shirts and get most of it <br/> &gt; off my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pants,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but at that<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point I was really wet again. I shed the top shirt <br/> and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carried<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tried<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not
 to breathe too deeply, and I tried to forget I <br/> was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cold. I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reminded<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself that I had survived cold, wet, and miserable <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; night<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before with<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some modicum of my sense of humor, and I could <br/> &gt; certain do<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; daylight<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I came to the decision-making trail split - do I <br/> &gt; hightail<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to fresh<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; water and fresh clothes, or do I keep letterboxing? <br/> I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; gave<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; minute or<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; two of thought, but I finally opted to box on. I <br/> mean<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; really,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then I had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sort of gotten used to the smell and my skin was <br/> &gt; numbing<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; didn't expect<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to run into anyone I knew on the trail. It wasn't <br/> like<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Walmart<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where you<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; run into everyone you know if you don't put on <br/> makeup <br/> &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good<br/>
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you go. This was the stinking woods, <br/> emphasis <br/> &gt; on<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stinking<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; case!<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So on I went - boxing on. I reached the area where <br/> the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; next<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be and I began working the clues with no luck. I <br/> &gt; decided<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gone through<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so much to get there that I wasn't going to give up<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; easily.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clues every which way I could, to no avail. Well I <br/> say<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do think<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know the general area where one was - squarely in <br/> &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; middle of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blocked<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off area where a tree had fallen across a bridge.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eventually I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concede that I wasn't going to find those boxes, <br/> and I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; took<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; myself<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; back to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the trailhead.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By this time, I knew it was approaching lunchtime <br/> so I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decided to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; head back<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the scout site to eat, but I realized I had a <br/> &gt; problem.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looked<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bedraggled rat. And smelled like a bedraggled dead <br/> &gt; rat.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Somehow<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it finally<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; occurred to me that I was right at a water faucet, <br/> so <br/> &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; could<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rinse<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes one piece at a time and wring them out, then<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; leave<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pair of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pants and one shirt and return to camp. As a bonus, <br/> I <br/> &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; already<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loaded my camping backpack into the truck, so I <br/> could<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; arrange<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vehicle<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doors to create a dressing room at camp and change <br/> &gt; into<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clean<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dry<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; This I did and no one in camp was the wiser to my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they only<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first noticed I was back in camp when I bopped in <br/> &gt; with a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; light<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; step,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying my boots and walking in my wool socks. That<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; struck<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as odd,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but they were busy so they never thought again <br/> about <br/> &gt; it.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; until a<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; half hour later or so when Fearless Fox got me <br/> alone <br/> &gt; and<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; said "Okay. What<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happened to you?" I don't know if he noticed I <br/> wasn't<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wearing<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clothes as when I left, or if my silent re-entry <br/> &gt; tipped<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; him<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; off<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what, but<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he had figured it out. When I told him what had <br/> &gt; happened,<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought he<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would never stop laughing at me!<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We ate lunch and started packing to head home. I <br/> ran <br/> &gt; out<br/> &gt; &gt;
 &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to hunt<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other boxes, and quite frankly, after all of <br/> &gt; that, I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ran<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too. I have never been so happy to see my own <br/> shower <br/> &gt; as I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saturday.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The kicker of the story is - a day or so later I <br/> got <br/> &gt; an<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; email<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jim<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Palestine) and he and his crew had been in Mission <br/> &gt; Tejas<br/> &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; day.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boy, am I ever glad I didn't run into him!<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So anyway, I headed to Mission Tejas with the <br/> intent <br/> &gt; to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 300+<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and to<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get seven boxes and several caches. I wound up <br/> &gt; getting my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 299th -<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and it<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was a good one - LSQ's boxes always are! But I <br/> think I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; had<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; satisfying<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;
 &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and enjoyable a weekend (even the miserable stuff <br/> was<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pretty<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fun)<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one little box as I could've had if I had found<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; every<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; box<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there (not<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that I wouldn't have had a great time finding them <br/> &gt; all!).<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; promise you<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; - I will always remember that day when I see Indian<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; Trails<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; logbook.<br/> &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you, LSQ, for the experience!
