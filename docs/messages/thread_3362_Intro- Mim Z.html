Thanks for the welcome, Mike. <br/>
Read your son's info. Sad that so many are already on their third
tour. Hubby was in the first Gulf War with the Big Red One, but
fortunately retired before this one. <br/>
Spent 6 months in your area back in '83. Attended S.F. Austin H.S.
while my dad was stationed at Ft. Bliss for the Sergeant Majors'
Academy. Haven't been to El Paso since then. Left there for Ft. Hood,
where dad retired. Met hubby at Ft. Hood, traveled the States to
various posts... and then retired... back to Ft. Hood area, too, where
I said I'd never come back to. Grows on one after a while. <br/>
Thanks again for the welcome!<br/>

Thanks, Puddle Splasher.  I am
having a lot of fun with letterboxing... and zturtle is encouraging me
to be a bit more bold.  I've been known to locate the precise area of a
box and just take a picture of the area if I find it too challenging
(poison ivy, etc.) Did a 10K volksmarch at McKinney Roughs yesterday,
and if I were on my own, I probably would've passed on two of the four
boxes that were there... down too steep of a hill while stepping
through fallen tree... up too steep of another hill, with nothin' to
grab but clumps of grass.  zturtle had already found all 4 prior to the
volksmarch, so she 'shadowed' me while I sought them out.  She
patiently stood there, while silently encouraging me to get my tush
up/down the hills.  Had she not been there, I would've just taken a
picture of where I thought the boxes were and called 'em an attempt...
although a poor attempt.LOL.  She said that I can't give up so easily. 
I'm learnin'.  <br/>
Not sure about the TALE next week.  You people are way out of my league
with your hand carved stamps, etc. LOL.  <br/>
Thanks so much for the welcome and invite though.<br/>

<p><span>Thanks, Puddle Splasher.  I am having a lot of
fun with letterboxing.<wbr/>.. and zturtle is encouraging me to be a bit more
bold.  I've been known to locate the precise area of a box and just take a
picture of the area if I find it too challenging (poison ivy, etc.) Did a 10K
volksmarch at McKinney Roughs yesterday, and if I were on my own, I probably
would've passed on two of the four boxes that were there... down too steep of a
hill while stepping through fallen tree... up too steep of another hill, with
nothin' to grab but clumps of grass.  zturtle had already found all 4
prior to the volksmarch, so she 'shadowed' me while I sought them out. 
She patiently stood there, while silently encouraging me to get my tush up/down
the hills.  Had she not been there, I would've just taken a picture of
where I thought the boxes were and called 'em an attempt... although a poor
attempt.LOL.  She said that I can't give up so easily.  I'm
learnin'.  <br/>
Not sure about the TALE next week.  You people are way out of my league
with your hand carved stamps, etc. LOL.  <br/>
Thanks so much for the welcome and invite though.<br/>

<p><span>Welcome Mim Z! Sounds like you're off and running and
having a lot of fun letterboxing. I think you'll really enjoy this group:
friendly and helpful. You should come to the TALE (Texas Annual Letterboxing
Event) next Saturday at </span><span>Bastrop</span><span>. There will be a lot of friendly boxers
there from all over the state. Lots of fun.</span></p>

<p><span>42 yr old empty-nester realizes that now that both

that this is my year to try new things.... thus, letterboxing.<wbr/>.. among
other ventures.<br/>

Army, so have lived various places in the </span><span>US</span><span> and </span><span>Germany</span><span>.  Just
kinda ended up here and built a home on 40 acres in the arm pit of Texas Hill
Country.<br/>
Heard about letterboxing from Grammy Pat, whom I know from another group. 
Passed on the info to zturtle, who then got involved in it.  By the time
zturtle had over 50 boxes under her belt, I decided to give it a try.  I've
been at it since the beginning of February.  Finds in Hamilton, Belton,
Temple, Florence, Salado, Jarrell, Georgetown, Austin, and Bastrop.  I go
to </span><span>Austin</span><span> once a week for 10K training, which
gives me the opportunity to hunt for boxes while there.  Need to print!
off some directions for tomorrow.  Looks like its going to be a nice day
for letterboxing!<br/>

p.s. Just passed this group's info on to another friend who does letterboxing,
so hopefully she'll sign up, too.</span></p>

<p>Thanks for the welcome, Mike.  <br/>Read 
  your son's info.  Sad that so many are already on their third tour.  
  Hubby was in the first Gulf War with the Big Red One, but fortunately retired 
  before this one.  <br/>Spent 6 months in your area back in '83.  
  Attended S.F. Austin H.S. while my dad was stationed at Ft. Bliss for the 
  Sergeant Majors' Academy.  Haven't been to El Paso since then. Left there 
  for Ft. Hood, where dad retired.  Met hubby at Ft. Hood, traveled the 
  States to various posts... and then retired... back to Ft. Hood area, too, 
  where I said I'd never come back to. Grows on one after a while.

<p><span>Corazon – Thanks for saying that.  I am relatively new
– found about 50 boxes – just planted my first series – and the
single thing I worry about is the quality of my stamps… My sig stamp was
purchased when I first started letterboxing, and it suits me so well I don’t
really want to replace it – and it is too difficult for my carving skills
to replicate…  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I have seen so many really spectacular hand carved stamps while
letterboxing and it just makes me cringe when I think of my own crudely carved
ones.   I just got my first postal LB that had a log book and stamp
that were so beautiful I was absolutely amazed.  But OTOH, I’ve
never found a letterbox – whether the stamp was a hand carved masterpiece,
a very simple stamp,  or a whimsical store-bought stamp, that I wasn’t
thrilled to get and add to my log book.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Still, I’ve purchased so much carving medium and thrown
away so many unsatisfactory attempts – I am about making myself crazy
trying to carve something decent for next weekend and my PT stamp – which
at this point is a great idea in my head, a little better on paper – but
still a mess in MasterCarve.  So thanks for reminding me that we all have
to start somewhere.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p><span>Thanks,
Puddle Splasher.  I am having a lot of fun with letterboxing... and zturtle
is encouraging me to be a bit more bold.  I've been known to locate the
precise area of a box and just take a picture of the area if I find it too
challenging (poison ivy, etc.) Did a 10K volksmarch at McKinney Roughs
yesterday, and if I were on my own, I probably would've passed on two of the
four boxes that were there... down too steep of a hill while stepping through
fallen tree... up too steep of another hill, with nothin' to grab but clumps of
grass.  zturtle had already found all 4 prior to the volksmarch, so she
'shadowed' me while I sought them out.  She patiently stood there, while
silently encouraging me to get my tush up/down the hills.  Had she not
been there, I would've just taken a picture of where I thought the boxes were
and called 'em an attempt... although a poor attempt.LOL.  She said that I
can't give up so easily.  I'm learnin'.  <br/>
Not sure about the TALE next week.  You people are way out of my league
with your hand carved stamps, etc. LOL.  <br/>
Thanks so much for the welcome and invite though.<br/>

friendly and helpful. You should come to the TALE (Texas Annual Letterboxing

from all over the state. Lots of fun.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

<div class="gmail_quote">While I've never been one to sit around and keep my fingernails clean, I haven't been one in my adult life to really go out on a limb either.  I think the turning point for me was a few years ago when I really wanted to go letterboxing in the summer (I hate heat) and my husband said "well let's go".  I whined a bit about the heat but he was tired of hearing about not being able to go letterboxing so he didn't let up until I got my rear end up and went.  I made a plan of attack and we headed out early one Saturday morning and stayed out all day finding boxes.  We were standing in the middle of some forest somewhere and I was drenched in sweat and stinky and I finally realized it wasn't killing me to get hot because I was having fun.  Being drenched just means cooling off and stinking of sweat was no big deal where we were.  It was all a matter of perspective.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Somehow that was a change in my mentality and I realized I could probably step out a little further on the limb and push myself in other areas as well.  Steep hills, rough trails, heavy brush, long walks, water - while I try to be smart about where I go, I've realized I can go a lot more places than I originally thought.  I've also learned that I bounce pretty well and I dry off nicely and just about anything that might happen to me can be fixed.  I've yet to have a serious injury, but bruises and scratches and sore muscles are temporary souvenirs of the journey that I can handle.  It's a lot more fun to just go than to stand on the trail wondering if I should.  If I can do it, so can you!</div>

<div>There are a lot of carvers out there that are far better than me too, but I keep plugging away and slowly improving. The first stamp I carved was a hitchhiker "chick" I placed in La Jolla, CA. It was so unrecognizable that you would have to read the name on the logbook to know it was <em>supposed</em> to be a chick! Whoever found it probably screamed and threw it off the cliff. But let me tell you... I was so proud of that mangled, ugly chick that I had a hard time walking away from the box. I felt like I was abandoning a child! I still remember sitting in my hotel room carving that stamp (several times before I produced the one I thought was slightly recognizable). The joy of launching that HH will be with me forever. I still get a "high" whenever I plant a new box. You just can't worry about how skillful some of the other carvers are. Just realized you're offering a gift to all those who choose to look for your boxes. My personal preference is not so much the quality of the stamp (although believe me... I really appreciate the work and artistry of a great stamp), but rather a great hike or location is more important to me. I think most of us agree that having been taken to wonderful new locations where we've never been before is one of the most enjoyable aspects of letterboxing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just have fun Mama Bee, and thank you for hiding boxes for us to find!</div>

<p><span>Corazon  Thanks for saying that.  I am relatively new  found about 50 boxes  just planted my first series  and the single thing I worry about is the quality of my stamps My sig stamp was purchased when I first started letterboxing, and it suits me so well I dont really want to replace it  and it is too difficult for my carving skills to replicate  <o></o></span></p>
<p><span><o></o></span></p>
<p><span>I have seen so many really spectacular hand carved stamps while letterboxing and it just makes me cringe when I think of my own crudely carved ones.   I just got my first postal LB that had a log book and stamp that were so beautiful I was absolutely amazed.  But OTOH, Ive never found a letterbox  whether the stamp was a hand carved masterpiece, a very simple stamp,  or a whimsical store-bought stamp, that I wasnt thrilled to get and add to my log book.  <o></o></span></p>
<p><span><o></o></span></p>
<p><span>Still, Ive purchased so much carving medium and thrown away so many unsatisfactory attempts  I am about making myself crazy trying to carve something decent for next weekend and my PT stamp  which at this point is a great idea in my head, a little better on paper  but still a mess in MasterCarve.  So thanks for reminding me that we all have to start somewhere.<o></o></span></p>

<p><span>Thanks, Puddle Splasher.  I am having a lot of fun with letterboxing.<wbr/>.. and zturtle is encouraging me to be a bit more bold.  I've been known to locate the precise area of a box and just take a picture of the area if I find it too challenging (poison ivy, etc.) Did a 10K volksmarch at McKinney Roughs yesterday, and if I were on my own, I probably would've passed on two of the four boxes that were there... down too steep of a hill while stepping through fallen tree... up too steep of another hill, with nothin' to grab but clumps of grass.  zturtle had already found all 4 prior to the volksmarch, so she 'shadowed' me while I sought them out.  She patiently stood there, while silently encouraging me to get my tush up/down the hills.  Had she not been there, I would've just taken a picture of where I thought the boxes were and called 'em an attempt... although a poor attempt.LOL.  She said that I can't give up so easily.  I'm learnin'.  <br/>Not sure about the TALE next week.  You people are way out of my league with your hand carved stamps, etc. LOL.  <br/>Thanks so much for the welcome and invite though.<br/>Janet (Mim Z)<br/></span><br/>Maribeth Jagger wrote: <o></o></p>

<div> </div>
<div>Years ago when we lived in San Diego, he did stucco work all over San Diego County and I worked in an office.  He worked on scaffolding quite a lot and I always worried (needlessly I might add - he's like a goat).  He called me one day and told me to come pick him up at the hospital.  When I asked him why he was at the hospital, he said "Just come get me."  He told me which hospital and I jumped in the car to go get him - about 30 minutes away.  When I got there (in a panic mind you), he was standing outside the hospital, smiling and happy.  What he had failed to mention is that he had been reassigned to a new site that day - the hospital - and they had finished up a little early.  He wanted me to come play with him at the beach and knew I wouldn't just take off from work.  I was soooo mad at him for scaring me, not so much so for making me take the afternoon off.  Still though, I had to explain "the emergency" at work the next day.<br/>

<div>Welcome Mim Z! Sounds like you're off and running and having a lot of fun letterboxing. I think you'll really enjoy this group: friendly and helpful. You should come to the TALE (Texas Annual Letterboxing Event) next Saturday at Bastrop. There will be a lot of friendly boxers there from all over the state. Lots of fun.</div>

 don't let the carving scare you away. I had only carved my sig stamp when I went to my first gathering. It looked like something a child would carve. I had so much fun.

<div>Well how about this!  Tell him you're meeting ME there!  I am, after all, going with only my son...so it's like meeting another mom on her own.   That way, only the trip there is by yourself, and that's kind of like driving the full length of LBJ  about 6 times.  Now you see - that doesn't sound so bad!</div>

 to a new site that day - the hospital - and they had finished up a little early.  He wanted me to come play with him at the beach and knew I wouldn't just take off from work.  I was soooo mad at him for scaring me, not so much so for making me take the afternoon off.  Still though, I had to explain "the emergency" at work the next day.<br/><br/></div> <div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Feb 25, 2008 at 11:42 PM, janet clark &lt;<a href="mailto:jayceeinbedford@yahoo.com" target="_blank">jayceeinbedford@<wbr/>yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/> <blockquote> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div></div> <div>OMG, is anyone else imaging a woman climbing up a hill using clumps of grass.

My 10K training is near the Run-Tex store/Auditoreum Shores area.  We
meet our trainer near the 1st St. bridge.  I drive in from Lampasas
County once a week, train until about 11:45 and then letterbox for a
couple of hours.  Would love to meet up to letterbox sometime.  Still
lots that I haven't looked for in Austin area.<br/>
