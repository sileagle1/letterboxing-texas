Hi,<br/>
<br/>
I am thinking of doing a new box to commemorate the life of our dear <br/>
cat Fluffy.  We have had her for 8 years.  Yesterday morning as my 3 <br/>
year old and I were leaving to go to mother's day out I ran over her.  <br/>
I am so very distraught over the whole incident, especially with my <br/>
husband being out of town on business.  My little boy saw her as she <br/>
was dying and hopefully he is resillent as I think he is.  This cat <br/>
slept with him every night and he used her as a pillow.  Anyway if <br/>
anyone is interested in receiving this type of letterbox please email <br/>
me.  I could also use any words of advice or encouragement that you can <br/>
offer.<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<div>That is so sad. I think it would be very fitting for you to place a LB as a tribute to Fluffy. I'm sure your son would love getting to participate. My husband is retired from the Air Force, but he traveled quite a bit while he was on active duty. I could pretty well plan on something going wrong while he was away, but now I realize that it certainly made me stronger and helped form me into the independent woman I am now. I am very sorry that you and your young son had such a sad experience.</div>

It’s actually becoming a tradition of sorts.  Hawk planted “Topaz Memorial Box” in honor of my greyhound that passed away in December, and Team King has a memorial box to one of their dogs down, I think, in the Millie Bush park in Houston.<br/>
<br/>
It’s a heartbreaking thing to lose a pet, and even more so with the circumstances of your loss in particular.  Making a memorial for Fluffy could be a good thing for you to do.<br/>

As Krohm already pointed out, we did a box in memory of a dachshund we <br/>
had to put to sleep. (If you have never put a beloved pet to sleep, <br/>
well, let's just say it's definately as bad as your circumstance). So, <br/>
in memory of Fluffy, you should do a box! It will make you and your son <br/>
feel better to do something and you can take your time and make it as <br/>
personal as you want.  Plus you could do a postal letterbox if you <br/>
don't feel comfortable placing it out in the 'wild'.<br/>
<br/>
Count us in if you decide to do it!<br/>

<div>My son did see our next door neighbor's kitten get run over. I think he was about 5 at the time. There was nothing to be done for the kitten, and I didn't want to move her, as that might have caused her more pain. It was raining, and I let him hold an umbrella over her. We talked about it after, and he felt sad about the kitten, but proud that he had been able to help her.</div>

<div> Most kids are very resilient, but I think it's very important to talk about things. Your son might like to make some kind of memory book, with photos of him with his cat, and he could also draw pictures illustrating his memories of her....... The Lb is also a very nice idea, especially if he can help plan the stamp, where to plant the box, etc., so that he can let everyone know what a wonderful cat Fluffy was.</div>

                    <html><body><div><p>HI,</p>
<p>Thank you so much for your kind words.  Everyone has been so great and it has really helped me so much.  My son is doing well but he still asks about Fluffy.  We do however have 2 other cats that are 4 and 6 that Fluffy had before we got her fixed.  The 4 year old, Magellan, actually looks so much like her that over the last day or so I find myself doing a double take when he walks by.  Anyway thank you so much for your words of encouragement, and I definitely will be doing a Tribute to Fluffy Box.  I am going to try and start working on it in the next couple of weeks <br/>Once again thank you so much.</p>

I think it would be very fitting for you to place a LB as a tribute to Fluffy. I'm sure your son would love getting to participate. My husband is retired from the Air Force, but he traveled quite a bit while he was on active duty. I could pretty well plan on something going wrong while he was away, but now I realize that it certainly made me stronger and helped form me into the independent woman I am now. I am very sorry that you and your young son had such a sad experience. &gt; &gt;Maribeth (Puddle-Splasher) 
&gt; &gt; &gt;----- Original Message ----- &gt;From: texasluvbug1 &gt;To: letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com &gt;Sent: 4/6/2005 2:22:46 PM &gt;Subject: [letterboxingtexas] possible new box &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Hi, &gt; &gt;I am thinking of doing a new box to commemorate the life of our dear &gt;cat Fluffy. We have had her for 8 years. Yesterday morning as my 3 &gt;year old and I were leaving to go to mother's day out I ran over her. &gt;I am so very distraught over the whole incident, especially with my &gt;husband being out of town on business. My little boy saw her as she &gt;was dying and hopefully he is resillent as I think he is. This cat &gt;slept with him every night and he used her as a pillow. Anyway if &gt;anyone is interested in receiving this type of letterbox please email &gt;me. I could also use any words of advice or encouragement that you can &gt;offer. &gt;Thanks &gt;
