<div>Yesterday WAS a beautiful day for a drive east to look at dogwoods in bloom 
in East TX and to search for a few good LBs!  We first visited Fairfield 
Lake SP, which I'd never have known about except for searching for Oh Deer, 
which we found alive and well.  Because it was midday while we were there 
we saw no deer other than the excellent stamp, thanks, Barefoot Lucy, but 
we enjoyed our nature trail walk.   (We left a cool HH there. It began 
its journey some time ago in VT, was found in CA and made its way to 
TX.  That LB seemed an appropriate place for this particular HH)).  
Then we visited Jacksonville and found 3 of Txluvbug's LB's in good shape:  
Dragonfly Springs (first we looked all over the WRONG place, but finally 
redirected our search to the RIGHT spot and found it!); Life is a Picnic (very 
nice park and beautiful dogwoods in bloom); and finally, Water From a Rock, 
which took us to a natural spring that we would never ever have noticed without 
looking for that LB - another wonderful little spot!  We also looked for 
Barefoot Lucy's Spring Hope but didn't find it, but driving home and still 
thinking about it, I think I may have an idea about it and will try to return to 
look again (I think I probably DID find it and didn't realize it at the time, 
but we were getting pretty hungry by this time and had to find food.)  
A very happy Friday!  </div></font></body></html>
