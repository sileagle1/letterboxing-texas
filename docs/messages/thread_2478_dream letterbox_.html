That sums it up for me also. I love them all no matter what. Just <br/>
being out there boxing and learning about all aspects is reward for <br/>
me. What a great way to look at LBing. <br/>

                    <html><body><p>I agree PS. Never know what treasures the next box will hold.  The thrill of finding it and then then seeing what the stamp looks like. You can tell the people that are true LB'ers.  We just can't wait to find or plant that next box. Went out for a little while today. I had a few in Arlington that I needed to find to finish up some of the series that I had. Luckily for me, I was able to find all of them. Some of these had been replaced by Kantexan and I wanted to get them before they ended up disappearing again! It was a nice little outing and I got 6 new stamps in 2 hours!!<br/><br/><b><i>hancockkim &lt;purpleintex@aol.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:  </p><blockquote><!-- Network content --> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/>&lt;cjagger405@<wbr/>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; There was a saying in the Air Force that the "best two assignments <br/>were the one you were coming from and the one you are going to."
