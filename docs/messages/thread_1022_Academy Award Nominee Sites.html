<div> </div>
<div>I want it all!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to find teeny tiny hand carved stamps placed in film canisters in places where literally 1 million people will pass in a couple weeks' time.  I want to find store bought stamps next to water flowing freely from a stream in the middle of nowhere.  I want boxes I have to sneak up on, and boxes I could walk to naked.  I want boxes that are in areas which demand a photograph because of their lovely scenery, and boxes where I have to pretend I'm taking pictures, with my fake camera that used to hold candy, simply as a diversion.  I want the hazards and surprises of "extreme letterboxing": bugs, rough terrain, 105 degree Texas heat, rocky climbs, and hikes of more than the distance of my driveway.  I want boxes where I can sit on a shaded bench and reach under vines, without straining a muscle.  I want boxes that reflect bits of history or culture that I would never have discovered otherwise, and boxes that are whimsical and
 make me laugh.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I want to carve stamps that may look clumsy but plant them anyway, because other letterboxers will just be glad there's another box in East Texas (or anywhere else), that fulfills some quirk in our individual and collective spirit.  I'm thrilled I can purchase and plant commercially made stamps and not feel guilty that this week, when I barely had time to wash dishes or feed the cats, I made time to letterbox.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Why do I want these things?  I want the stories.  Everyone of them.  I'm currently swathed in Benadryl cream because I itch horribly from something I got into yesterday.  My shirt ripped, I have big scratches from thorns, we smelled kind of ripe, and were totally exhausted at the end of our day.  We found 10 boxes, a personal record for 1 day.  Tonight, when I call my elderly parents, I'll have stories to tell them, and I'll share them at work tomorrow.  My parents will shake their heads, and chuckle, but I know they'll tell their friends about the adventures I'm having, just like Mother of Five, Dewberry, and TeamKing  (et. al.) are building memories around the adventures with their children.  And next time we show my parents the log book, my mom will appreciate the artistry of each stamp, no matter who carved it, and my dad will want to hear about the trails and trials of each find, just as if we had climbed K2.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Isn't it terrific that we can make our own "rules" for what we want letterboxing to be for us, yet share many common experiences?  I'm very grateful for what this hobby, as well as the people who make it happen, have done for us.  Like Tall Texan, we have high stress jobs and work far too many hours, doing emotionally draining work wih others who need support to live their lives.  Now, instead of sitting in front of a screen for mind-numbing quais-entertainment, and calling that "rest",  we have become (at least in our circle...) those through whom others live vicariously.  We are healthier and happier for our--and your--efforts.</div>

YES!  You made me just want to jump up and run out the<br>
door and box - 100 degrees, muggy and everything!  In<br>
fact, I did - at least until I got out the door and<br>
realized both cars are gone at the moment!<br>

 make me laugh.  </div>

<div>Why do I want these things?  I want the stories.  Everyone of them.  I'm currently swathed in Benadryl cream because I itch horribly from something I got into yesterday.  My shirt ripped, I have big scratches from thorns, we smelled kind of ripe, and were totally exhausted at the end of our day.  We found 10 boxes, a personal record for 1 day.  Tonight, when I call my elderly parents, I'll have stories to tell them, and I'll share them at work tomorrow.  My parents will shake their heads, and chuckle, but I know they'll tell their friends about the adventures I'm having, just like Mother of Five, Dewberry, and TeamKing  (et. al.) are building memories around the adventures with their children.  And next time we show my parents the log book, my mom will appreciate the artistry of each stamp, no matter who carved it, and my dad will want to hear about the trails and trials of each find, just as if we had climbed K2.</div>

<div>Isn't it terrific that we can make our own "rules" for what we want letterboxing to be for us, yet share many common experiences?  I'm very grateful for what this hobby, as well as the people who make it happen, have done for us.  Like Tall Texan, we have high stress jobs and work far too many hours, doing emotionally draining work wih others who need support to live their lives.  Now, instead of sitting in front of a screen for mind-numbing quais-entertainment, and calling that "rest",  we have become (at least in our circle...) those through whom others live vicariously.  We are healthier and happier for our--and your--efforts.</div>
