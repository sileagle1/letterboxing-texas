                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got an email from Bayou Grits, who I think lives<br>
in Baton Rouge.  She and her family are ok, but devastated.<br>
She says even in Baton Rouge there is widespread robbing<br>
and gunfire.  People are afraid to go out alone and are<br>
carrying guns everywhere.  It sounds like a bad movie<br>
and I feel really sad for everyone over there.  Still<br>
no word on BOXDN or some of the other New Orleans area<br>
boxers.  I guess it's possible they are here in TX with<br>
many of the other refugees.  Here's hoping they are safe.<br>
