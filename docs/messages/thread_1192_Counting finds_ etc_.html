along the lines of Finds/Attempts/Exchanges.<br/>
<br/>
Obviously 'Finds' are boxes that you have found and 'attempts' would be <br/>
boxes that you couldn't find.  But I have a few other questions.<br/>
<br/>
1) what exactly is an exchange?  would that be when me and a fellow lb <br/>
exchange our personal stamps?<br/>
2) how do you classify those special stamps that people do for series? <br/>
(liek the passport series stamp)<br/>
3) where do you put HHs?<br/>
<br/>
Maybe I am making too much out of this??  Probably but I have been meaning <br/>
to ask for a while as I think we may have passed the 100 mark while doing <br/>
so die-hard boxing with runsforchocolate this summer :)<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

<div>There is no "proper" way to track.  LBNA's FAQ and Silent Doug's website give some guidelines.  Quoting from one of Silent Doug's articles on PFX Counts: "There is a general consensus of how to manage your counts, but you're on the honor system, so feel free to modify your personal recordkeeping to fit your own desires. The overriding rule of thumb is that you shouldn't try to deceive anyone with your PFX count."<br/></div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) I think Silent Doug's website has a good definition: <a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000003.php"></a></div>
<div><a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/glossary/term.php?term=exchange">http://www.letterboxing.info/glossary/term.php?term=exchange</a></div>
<div>So that would include Personal Stamps as well as Personal Travelers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Catpawz is doing a Texas Passport Series.<a href="http://www.letterboxing.info/articles/00000003.php"></a> The actual series stamps I would count as Finds as they are hidden letterboxes.  The souvenir stamp I would not count as a find.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) At this point, I have just been including Hitchhikers under my Finds.  I have been considering putting them into a separate category.  Whether to include hitchhikers in the F or use a separate count designated with an H or an HH is your choice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently, I track the following categories: Placed, Found, Exchange, Event, Postal, Virtual, and Other for everything else.</div>
