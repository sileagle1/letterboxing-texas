We finally had time to run out to White Rock Lake this afternoon and<br>
check on our two Missing Key boxes. <br>
We owe apologies and thanks to the Turtle girls & Katzen for calling our<br>
attention to the clues for Missing Keys#3. I was not very sympathetic<br>
(please insert the word "grumpy" here!) about their comments on our<br>
clues, because I knew other folks had found the box easily, and because<br>
neither one of them were able to start at the specified point - what I<br>
didn't realize is that starting at the bar-b-q we specified is very<br>
tricky on a busy weekend, and from there the rest of the clues unravel!<br>
Soooo, from now on I'll take a deep breath and not get quite so<br>
defensive! <br>
<br>
The box is in great shape and now has the added attraction of an<br>
enticing HH, so I'll try to re-write the clues slightly and get them<br>
posted asap.<br>
