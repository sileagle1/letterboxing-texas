&gt; I hope to plant my  next box sometime soon; I'm a little <br/>
&gt; intimidated because the stamps that I've found so far <br/>
&gt; have been so advanced compared to my first stamp.<br/>

Here is my two cents (on a soapbox) re: the subject of advanced <br/>
stamps.<br/>
<br/>
If you are like some here there is joy in the journey and there is <br/>
excitement in the discovery.  Don't worry if your stamps aren't a <br/>
work of art to you.  You made the, it is a creation and there is <br/>
reason behind the creation.<br/>
<br/>
How exciting it must have been for the four teenagers who accidently <br/>
found the cave paintings at Lascaux in France.  <br/>
<br/>
I'm sure the artist who painted the dead man was criticized that the <br/>
head on the stick body was not just like a human. The picture is a <br/>
representation and this scene has an emotional impact even these many <br/>
years later.<br/>
<br/>
Though most of the pictures and engravings are of animals it is the <br/>
only human figure mentioned that is in the cave.  Thank goodness this <br/>
inclusion was made - Otherwise we'd have people saying aliens planted <br/>
the paintings and engravings.  <br/>
<br/>
If you explore the site you will also see "quadrangular signs", <br/>
or "blazons".  Very much like a nine patch quilt block that early <br/>
americans used.  Not much to them other than a 3 x 3 block pattern. <br/>
The beauty was created when they were patterend and repated and <br/>
colored.  The early American quilters repeated this pattern of a much <br/>
earlier era, with great impact, particulary the Amish quilters.  Just <br/>
maybe this pattern is a part of the collected unconcious that lies <br/>
whitin all of us.<br/>
<br/>
So my advice is carve and don't worry about critics,  someone will be <br/>
just as excited to find your stamp as the scientists were glad the <br/>
teenages shared their discovery with the rest of the world. <br/>
<br/>
To see the Lascaux cave painting of the dead man: Cut and paste the <br/>
following link to your web browser.<br/>

<br/>
As far as Art Critics - An early scene in Mel Brooks "History of the <br/>
World Part 1" - I'm sure the same result will not happen to your <br/>
stamp creation.  I hope we a more advanced than that!<br/>

Thank you, that is exactly how I feel about looking for a box.  I<br/>
have a place in mind here in Houston so I will try to get a stamp <br/>
carved this weekend.  (Has everyone else had an extremely busy <br/>
summer, <br/>
or is it just me?)<br/>
<br/>
And no, my husband is definitely not the mysterious GG!  The trip we <br/>
took to Garner State Park was the first time he had been<br/>
letterboxing. When I first started this hobby I could tell he <br/>
thought <br/>
it was a little <br/>
silly and I had to practically beg him to leave the beautiful Frio <br/>
River for a couple of hours to come look for a couple of boxes with <br/>
me at Garner. <br/>
But, he ended up racing to beat me to find CalicoRose's Cowboy Sunset<br/>
stamp so we may have another convert.<br/>
