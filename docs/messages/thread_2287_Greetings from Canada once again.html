travelling to Texas next month to spend time with family near<br>
Huntsville and Houston.  Our last visit was 2 years ago and I left<br>
behind a couple of visitors, "Bear on a Tear" and "Moose on the<br>
Loose".  This time I'm bringing some interesting creatures for you and<br>
of course we hope to find lots as well!<br>
Guitarzan's mom is 86 but likes to go boxing with us if the walk isn't<br>
too long.  If you have any suggestions of places we might take her<br>
(near Huntsville or Houston)please let me know.  <br>
Looking forward to heading south!<br>
