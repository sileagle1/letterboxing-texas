out other sources of information on this list.  If you <br>
look to the left column while on this list you will see<br>
several clickable links.  The Files section contains <br>
various things from a letterboxing article to directions<br>
on how to make fake rocks.  The Photos section contains <br>
various pictures, including some from the first 2 Events.<br>
The Links section contains links to various websites,<br>
including one to Silent Doug's very informative site.  I<br>
also just added a link to the TX Boxcar LB Event site <br>
within the TX Events folder, which will give information<br>
on our upcoming Event on March 18 in Rusk SP.  Enjoy!<br>
