<div>We are here and safe, 
albeit with a heavy heart for all those who suffered and continue to suffer 
because of Ike.  Now I have been through a hurricane, I say give me a good 
old blizzard any old day.  That being said, I saw again during this storm 
why I would never want to live any place else on earth than right here in 
Houston.  The way people have come together to help each 
other is amazing.  My heart breaks when I see what has happened to 
Galveston and most especially Bolivar, which I consider to be the most peaceful 
spot on earth.  My neighbors have a woman who has spent her entire life on 
Bolivar staying with them right now, she has lost her home, her business, the 
ability to visit her parents' graves, everything.  I continue to feel 
guilty every time I flush the toilet or turn on the lights in my house.  
The devastation this storm has left behind is unbelievable, and I think we are 
just beginning to see the effects.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A big thank you to Lucy 
Lockett for checking on us, it made me so happy to see your text message!  
If I had any idea how to use my phone (or any battery left) I would have 
answered you right away.  I hope you are all safe and sound right 
now.  I am so thankful to be a part of such a kind group of people.

  &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Update...the lights are on in Baytown home!! School still 
  off <br/>this <br/>&gt; week. Meeting will be held of the teachers on Friday and 
  assess <br/>what <br/>&gt; can be done. Anyone out there on the State School 
  board that has <br/>an <br/>&gt; idea how this will all shake out. Up here we 
  have so many snow <br/>days <br/>&gt; that we can get away with but TX I guess 
  had Calamity Days.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Granny<br/>&gt;
