<br/>
I just learned of letter boxing this past November, quite by accident.  My sister-in-law and I decided to go on a camping trip to Lake Arrowhead (Clay county) which is very close to where we live (we leave the men at home, they're no fun)!  While I love to camp, I thought I would see what else one could do at Lake Arrowhead, and stumbled upon clues left by SilverEagle.  I thought, now that sounds like FUN!!!  We both just happened to have some blank books we picked up, and hadn't used for anything, and I happened to have stamp pad....so off we went, spirits high!  We took picturs of stuff we saw along the way (butterflies, yep!  even in November).  But alas, there was no box to be found.  But we talked about what fun it was just looking all the way back to camp.<br/>
<br/>
So, while I haven't actually found a box yet, I am already hooked!  LOL  I am really looking foreward to hitting the local areas and finding those boxes!  I see that SilverEagle has been very thorough up in here in North Texas, so I will just thank you now.  *grin*<br/>

just happened to have a blank book AND an ink pad!!!!!<br/>
Wow. It looks as though you were just waiting to<br/>
discover letterboxing so you could use those items!<br/>
<br/>
I searched for three letterboxes while in Florida this<br/>
past week, and two were missing, but I had a great<br/>
time exploring the parks and was able to see things<br/>
that all the other conference-goers missed by staying<br/>
at the hotel. It's going to be a great experience when<br/>
you find your first box!<br/>
<br/>
Glad to have you join us!<br/>
