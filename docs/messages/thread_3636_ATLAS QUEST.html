even have my co-workers trying to figure out this brain teaser. We all <br>
go to our seperate desks and I come up with what I think is the answer <br>
and not 15 seconds later a co-worker at the next desk says try **** <br>
which is exactly what I got and then about that time my phone rings <br>
and the other co-worker says try **** which is exactly what we got. I <br>
go to Atlas quest to see if we are right and it is not working for me.<br>
