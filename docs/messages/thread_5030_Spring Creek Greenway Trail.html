                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went out yesterday morning to Humble to find one of Silver Eagle's boxes on the new Spring Creek Greenway Trail that goes from Jesse Jones Park in Humble to Pundt Park in Spring, a distance of about 7.5 miles so far.  The plan is to continue the trail so that it eventually spans from the San Jacinto River bridge at Hwy. 59 to Spring Creek Park in Tomball, a distance of between 33 and 40 miles and encompass some 15,00 acres of wooded preserve and will also include facilities for canoeing and kayaking.  I also planted a new box along the way.  I see this as a destination for a lot of letterboxes in the future.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There is another Greenway Trail that is being planned along Cypress Creek, which joins Spring Creek near where you just hid your box.  It will eventually go west from there through several parks, including Telge, and beyond.  Many of the parks are not developed yet, but when they are I plan to do another series along the Cypress Creek Greenway.<br>
