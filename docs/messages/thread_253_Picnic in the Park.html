tried, because it wasn't there.  I will mark it as "missing" on the <br>
LBNA website until I can get it replaced.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, I'm sorry to hear that Picnic in the Park is missing! That was <br>
one of the ones I was going to find while I was down in San Antonio a <br>
couple of weekends ago- but we just never made it out of San Antonio! <br>
It was so hot, we were lucky to hit the ones we DID find without <br>
dying of heat stroke. <br>
<br>
I'll make note of that... next time I'm headed down that way, I will <br>
check to see if it's 'back in action'. I like Landa Park (New <br>
Braunfels)- it's a really pretty area, especially when there's water <br>
flowing through the park.. aahhhhh I could lay there by the water and <br>
just listen to it for hours.<br>
<br>
Fall is coming... perfect letterboxing weather!<br>
