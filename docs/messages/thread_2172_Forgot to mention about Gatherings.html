                    <html><body><div>Gatherings are a great opportunity to meet other boxers face to face and to box in a box-rich area for a day or two.  Great time for new boxers to really step up their knowledge and understanding of the game.  To date, I don't think we've actually scared anyone away after they've met us at a gathering, have we?

<div>In Texas, we have one main gathering in the Spring that Silver Eagle and his brother Baby Bear put together each year.  It has been in March each year so far, and moves around from region to region, or at least from area to area.
</div>

<div>We've also had several other gatherings - I hesitate to call them "smaller" because the upcoming one is shaping up to be pretty big! - that happen on less of a set schedule.  Check AQ under toolbox and events for dewberry's and TeamKing's upcoming event on October 21st - it's going to be awesome!
