                    <html><body><p>Hi y'all. Still recuperating from surgery. I'm recovering well even if it is my stomach and not boxes. Is this ever going to end?<br/><br/>And, when I'm home, I just don't spend enough time at the computer. But, I made it through all the posts, deleted some spam, caught up with a couple friends and family and got lucky to have just received an email from Cassie's camp to sign up for the last week. Having her home for a week, would not have been fun. Me trying to sleep and her bouncing off the walls, eeek the thought scares me to death. I'm to old to go through a week like that.<br/><br/>Welcome to all the many newbie's (well, when they posted they were new). Sounds like a lot of fun people. Can't wait to meet y'all.<br/><br/>Loved Ira Boxer's post about the TTB2. Would love to get my hands on that box.<br/><br/>I'm going to go a little crazy here and pull up a clue for my neighborhood and go find a box. <br/><br/>Have a wonderful Monday,<br/>Janet<br/>Blooming

<div>Yep - get the kid out of there as much as you can.  Mine is home for the remainder of the summer, unless I can find someone to take him.  Any takers?  Not that he's a bouncer really - far more laid back than that.  It's just nice to get him gone for a few days at a time...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Believe it or not - I've ventured out a couple of times this summer - once to go grave-hunting with JBK and once to make a run up to Van to see Frog Kisses and Texas Pokey this past Saturday...and it didn't kill me!  Actually, I guess I've made a couple of other forays too - a couple days to Boy Scout camp the week that include the 4th of July and a couple of weekends ago to San Marcos, but that particular weekend just about did me in!  Somehow if letterboxing is involved, it doesn't seem quite so bad!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Boy Scout camp wasn't so bad either - my job was to be on hand if any of the boys in the troop needed me, so I mainly wandered from place to place (translate that from breezy shady place to breezy shady place), very slowly and deliberately, as though being the thoughtful scoutmaster.</div>

<div>Summer, summer - go away!</div>
