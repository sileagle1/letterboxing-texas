                    <div class="plaintext-content">Silver Eagle, that's an amazing tree and the letterbox placement sounds really intriguing. I've never seen the redwoods in person, but that's a good reason to go!  I guess the most unique place we've found a letterbox was in Italy, the Tuscany area.  It was placed in the ruins of a centuries-old castle.  It was really pretty scary.  You had to make your way to the top of a mountain, climb up (no stairs) into the castle and make your way through rubble to a certain room, negotiating around a bottomless hole in the floor, and the box was in a niche in the stone wall.  We came out of the castle right at sunset and were rewarded with a spectacular view of a small village in the valley with the setting sun as a backdrop.  We posted some pictures here under "Italian Letterboxes".  I also placed a box in Pompeii, but it was never found.<br>
