I was delighted to play a very small role in pulling off Lucy's<br/>
surprise.  To all other Texas letterboxers out there, it is an amazing<br/>
stamp and well worth seeking out.  I didn't stamp it in my boys'<br/>
books, because I know this is one they'll want to find out in the wild!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again to Silver Eagle, Baby Bear and others, some of whom have<br/>
left the sport, but all of whose efforts paved the way for this great<br/>
community we have today.  And not just for Texas letterboxers, but for<br/>
many others as well!<br/>
<br/>
I hope letterboxing was a legitimate being-late-to-work excuse!  <br/>
