image my delight to see one (If You Plant Them) in my<br>
hometown of Sugar Land at a park I visit all the time<br>
for my daughter's soccer practices.  Then imagine my<br>
surprise to realize it is a box dedicated to me!  It<br>
evidently was the brainchild of Barefoot Lucy and was<br>
placed by her accomplice Dewberry.  All I can say is I<br>
am deeply touched and honored by this ultimate recognition,<br>
and I thank you very much.  I was so anxious to find it<br>
that I was late to work after going for it this morning.<br>
Great stamp and logbook, with a nice sentiment written<br>
within.  I guess it was appropriate for me to be first finder!<br>
A little over 3 years ago when I first started this crazy<br>
pasttime of ours, I never could have imagined something like<br>
this would someday happen to me.  Shucks, I would have been<br>
amazed and pleased just to have a tenth of the great TX<br>
letterboxers we have today looking for my boxes and placing<br>
their own.  Back then, finding boxes and having others find<br>
mine was the greatest feeling.  However, as time wore on,<br>
that feeling grew less and less intense, just as most new<br>
things do.  But happily, the warm feelings I get for being <br>
a part of this group and the obvious appreciation I sense from<br>
all of you just continues to get better and better.  Thanks<br>
to everyone, and may the Letterboxing Force be with you!<br>

I was delighted to play a very small role in pulling off Lucy's<br>
surprise.  To all other Texas letterboxers out there, it is an amazing<br>
stamp and well worth seeking out.  I didn't stamp it in my boys'<br>
books, because I know this is one they'll want to find out in the wild!<br>
<br>
Thanks again to Silver Eagle, Baby Bear and others, some of whom have<br>
left the sport, but all of whose efforts paved the way for this great<br>
community we have today.  And not just for Texas letterboxers, but for<br>
many others as well!<br>
<br>
I hope letterboxing was a legitimate being-late-to-work excuse!  <br>
