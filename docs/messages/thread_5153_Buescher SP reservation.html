<div>I just got a call from Open Space, who is on the road to 
Buescher SP now.  She said that the State Park office people would like to 
speak with whoever made the reservation for the group shelter.  They had a 
few questions.  So, could Silver Eagle or Baby Bear (or maybe Boots Tex, 
since he is already there) please contact the State Park HQ at  <span>(512) 237-2241.  They thank you.  -- Bell
