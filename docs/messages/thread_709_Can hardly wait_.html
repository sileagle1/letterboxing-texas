Hi everyone!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that the BusyBeesFamily can hardly wait <br/>
for the 2nd annual event!  We are busy getting supplies together and <br/>
printing out clues like crazy..LOL!  ;-)<br/>
<br/>
For this very special occasion, we have created our very first <br/>
Personal Traveler.  It is listed on both LbNA and AtlasQuest, but as <br/>
a "heads up" for our Letterboxing Texas friends, here's the scoop...<br/>
<br/>
To get our personal traveler, you have to first answer a simple <br/>
riddle...  "If a bee's in my hand, what's in my eye?"<br/>
<br/>
Please do feel free to email me if you need a hint, and we look <br/>
forward to seeing everyone on Saturday!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
Batty "B" of BusyBeesFamily<br/>
