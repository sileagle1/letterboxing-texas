I had posted a few weeks ago that we were planning to box in the DFW <br/>
area this weekend.  Thanks to those that responded with ideas.<br/>
<br/>
We'll probably do some boxing with my children and some without.  <br/>
Are there any that would be more or less interesting to them (ages 5 <br/>
and 9)?<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the help.<br/>
Any word on the weather for Saturday and Sunday?<br/>

<div>If you want to take a bit of a drive go to Dinosaur Valley 
State Park, there are several boxes there, and you cant beat it for kid 
appeal.  It is located in Glen Rose.  The riverbed is full of huge 
dinosaur footprints perserved in the limestone, and they are so clear that even 
my 3 year old knew what they were and was "wowed" by them.  -Mother of
