I personally don't care how many people find my boxes.  My biggest<br/>
hope is that the ones who do are respectful--of the work the box<br/>
represents and its contents and more importantly in my eyes, the<br/>
overall environment (avoid social trails, please--that's how I find<br/>
all my geocaches without a GPS).  FOR ME, quality beats quantity.  I<br/>
love to carve a great stamp, find the perfect spot for a box, write a<br/>
challenging clue, or whatever.  That motivates me more than the people<br/>
who find it (although there are times I plant boxes with specific<br/>
finders in mind).<br/>
<br/>
That said, we have planted boxes appropriate for all kinds of<br/>
letterboxers.  Some people are very casual boxers, and that's okay. <br/>
They tend toward the easier boxes and there's nothing wrong with that.<br/>
 I personally like it when people take an extra effort and solve the<br/>
more mysterious ones--you'd be surprised how few that is.  And, for<br/>
those of you who have enjoyed some of our boxes, I am hoping to plant<br/>
some that are past difficult into downright diabolical.  And, as the<br/>
kids get a little older, we hope to plant some on much longer hikes<br/>
than we have in the past--again, that won't be for everyone.<br/>
<br/>
Does that make us elitist?  I don't think so.  It's more about how we<br/>
personally choose to play this game.  <br/>
<br/>
I think you'll find some homeschoolers will be great boxers, some will<br/>
be horrible.  It's hard to know what's really going to spark the love<br/>
in someone.  But it's great to find others who enjoy the same<br/>
hobby/sport/craft/activity/whatever--I am not in general a joiner, so<br/>
joining this forum was a real departure for me.  However, I have<br/>
gotten tons out of it, including some very rewarding friendships. <br/>
That has been a true surprise bonus beyond my log book full of memories.<br/>

<div>Well said!  Nothing is more discouraging that knowing that someone who 
carved a great stamp, wrote clever or intriguing clues, and located a great 
placement has had their work destroyed by careless or casual finders!  And 
there are particular boxes I'll make a real effort to seek out, knowing that 
they will be special (again, Kantexan and Celtic Lions come immediately to 
mind!  That Ruby Tuesday with her wicked sense of humor, devilish clues, 
and those incredible stamps that CactusLicker creates are worth any amount of 
searching!) I'm inspired to do better by their creations!   --
