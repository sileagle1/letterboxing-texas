<div>Ok, that is the 
funniest thing I have read in a long, long time.  If I had an extra $142 
dollars, I would bid on the cards simply because the woman has more kids than I 
do.  Actually, as I spit my coffee on the computer screen, I wondered if 
she really only has one child of her own and had taken mine along to the grocery 
store just to make an even 6.  Thanks for sharing BT!

                    <html><body><div>OH MY!  I thought I would never stop laughing!  I'm so glad I never had six kids because I'm afraid things would happen JUST like that!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wonder - did I share my non-letterboxing Walmart story of about a week ago?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox and I went to Walmart on the Friday of No Tax Weekend.  We went about 10 p.m. (I only go to Walmart after 10 pm or before 6 am) , not realizing the weekend was THE weekend.  We did our grocery shopping and finished about 11:30 
p.m., only to find that there were three checkouts open and about six people in each line.  No express lane, no self-check - just three lines, three checkers and many, many people.  We left our cart there and walked out.  
<br/> </div>
<div>So Saturday night we absolutely HAD to have groceries (our house wasn't down to catsup and italian dressing, but we were to the point of considering pickles to be equivalent to meat) so I steeled myself for the crowds, dug my patience out of the back of my closet, and went BACK to Walmart.  I went an hour later for good measure so that maybe the crowds would be fewer by the time I got to the check out.  To make things a little better, I took a list and vowed to shop only from the list.  It goes faster that way.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got done and headed to the checkout.  It was worse - YES WORSE - than the night before.  Three lanes, three checkers, even more people, and my family had told me not to come home without food. I got in line and proceeded to wait and glad I had found my patience before I left home.  As I stood there, I began to get bored.  I'm not a tabloid sort of person, but I read every headline there.  I'm tired of hearing about Britney, Lindsay, Paris, Tom, Katie, Brad, Angelina, and even Jennifer.  After reading the headlines, I was truly bored and then I realized I was also hungry.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also realized that Sonic was right in front of Walmart and more, that I was pretty sure I remembered Sonic's phone number, and I could call them and get them to have something ready for when I got out of the store.  The risk was that I might not remember Sonic's number after all and might wake some poor frail little lady from a deep sleep and cause her to have to stagger to the phone on her walker, only for a cheeseburger order.  I wondered idly if she would cook me a cheeseburger if I asked her nicely?  I started working on making sure I knew Sonic's number for sure, when suddenly I remembered that the two numbers I always confuse are Sonic's number and Walmart's number, so if I remembered the wrong number for Sonic, I wouldn't get some poor frail little lady, but I would get - WALMART!  I figured what the heck - I would either get a cheeseburger or a chance to vent about the long line.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sure enough, I wasn't remembering Sonic's number, but Walmart's, so I took the opportunity to ask for the manager.  I had been standing silent all this time, so when I started talking, the folks around me took notice and also heard me ask for the manager.  They were obviously puzzled, but they were bored too and I wasn't interesting enough to tune into, so they turned back to the headlines, or so I thought.  After waiting a long time and hearing them page her overhead several times, the manager came to the phone.  She was quite courteous, so I decided I would be equally courteous, yet firm.  I politely asked her if she would please open another checkout line.  She replied that she would like to, but that she didn't have any other checkers available.  I mentioned to her that we had been there the night before and run into the same problem and wound up leaving our basket of perishables and other miscellaneous items behind.  She acknowledged that it had indeed been a problem the night before, to which I suggested they might have learned from their experience and staffed up for that night.  She lamented that she had told the manager during their daily meeting and he didn't see it as a big problem.  We had both been very polite through our whole conversation, so in the same spirit, I suggested to her that she could either lodge my complaint herself with the manager, or she could take my name and phone number and I would gladly express my opinion about the situation directly to him.  I no sooner had that out of my mouth than a loud cheer went up around me and almost immediately other customers began asking for my phone so they could also give her their names and phone numbers.  It was suddenly as if the lines of tired shoppers came to life!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It didn't do much good for getting lines open, but it sure did kill the boredom.  But you know - the manager never did call me!</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

<div>That is not her first item to sell. She 
had a purse pattern to sell once. Her description was hilarious, about how 
she bought the pattern as a purse addict, with the intent of making all these 
purses/bags, and without letting the fact that she can't sew get into her 
way. So she was auctioning off this brand new, unopened pattern. 
</div>
<div>Like making almost $150 for a bag of pokemon 
cards...she is definitely using her talent to make a buck! The purse pattern 
went for quite a bit as well.</div>

                    <html><body><div>We have a new refrigerator.  Our old one went out earlier this year, so we went and bought a brand new refrigerator - the first time in nearly 24 years that we actually BOUGHT a brand new refrigerator!  This one was our dream refrigerator - freezer on the bottom with french doors on top and good lighting inside so you can really see the "interesting" things that turn up, and a working icemaker and no ice and water dispenser on the front.  I've been working like a mad woman to keep it clean inside and so far, we've done pretty well.  The only real problem is the front of the doors - they are brushed stainless steel.  They show every last fingerprint, to the point that if I clean it before I go to bed at night I can tell if someone was up during the night raiding the refrigerator, and for the time being I can even tell which of the two guys I live with it was.  It's even making Fearless Fox a little nuts trying to keep the front clean (probably because he is the usual midnight raider).  And the worst part is?  It doesn't take magnets!  We tried to talk them into ordering one in a standard color so we could have magnets and not fingerprints, but they would only give us "the deal" on the stainless.  I wonder why.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And what did we do with the old one?  It sits in my study.  I tried to get rid of it on Freecycle, but even there it is hard to get rid of marginally operational appliances.  I tried, with the help of Nac Trail Cat (my mother), to convince my mother-in-law (trailname-less) that she needed it for worm beds.  My mother-in-law is the woman who has semi trailers sitting on her land to hold all her junk, and even she refused my old refrigerator.  So it STILL sits in my study.  Fearless Fox says I should use it for bookshelves.  I may not be the most sophisticated member on this list, but I'm also not QUITE that much of a redneck either.  Anybody want an old fridge?

<div>When we lived on the coast in Florida, it was always easy to give away our old appliances. Fishermen were always happy to take them off our hands and haul them out to their "secret" fishing spot in the ocean where they were building their artificial fishing reefs. I guess it must have to do with GPS and underwater sonar something or the other, but I always wondered how they marked their spot? You can't exactly go past the third large cedar tree and take the small dirt path to the left of anything....</div>
<div>Anyway... just a thought...</div>

</p><div>We have a new refrigerator.  Our old one went out earlier this year, so we went and bought a brand new refrigerator - the first time in nearly 24 years that we actually BOUGHT a brand new refrigerator!  This one was our dream refrigerator - freezer on the bottom with french doors on top and good lighting inside so you can really see the "interesting" things that turn up, and a working icemaker and no ice and water dispenser on the front.  I've been working like a mad woman to keep it clean inside and so far, we've done pretty well.  The only real problem is the front of the doors - they are brushed stainless steel.  They show every last fingerprint, to the point that if I clean it before I go to bed at night I can tell if someone was up during the night raiding the refrigerator, and for the time being I can even tell which of the two guys I live with it was.  It's even making Fearless Fox a little nuts trying to keep the front clean (probably because he is the usual midnight raider).  And the worst part is?  It doesn't take magnets!  We tried to talk them into ordering one in a standard color so we could have magnets and not fingerprints, but they would only give us "the deal" on the stainless.  I wonder why. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And what did we do with the old one?  It sits in my study.  I tried to get rid of it on Freecycle, but even there it is hard to get rid of marginally operational appliances.  I tried, with the help of Nac Trail Cat (my mother), to convince my mother-in-law (trailname-less) that she needed it for worm beds.  My mother-in-law is the woman who has semi trailers sitting on her land to hold all her junk, and even she refused my old refrigerator.  So it STILL sits in my study.  Fearless Fox says I should use it for bookshelves.  I may not be the most sophisticated member on this list, but I'm also not QUITE that much of a redneck either.  Anybody want an old fridge? <br/><br/> </div>

</p><div>That is not her first item to sell. She had a purse pattern to sell once. Her description was hilarious, about how she bought the pattern as a purse addict, with the intent of making all these purses/bags, and without letting the fact that she can't sew get into her way. So she was auctioning off this brand new, unopened pattern. </div>
<div>Like making almost $150 for a bag of pokemon cards...she is definitely using her talent to make a buck! The purse pattern went for quite a bit as well.</div>

&gt; &gt; I know someone that has a chest freezer and they use it to store <br/>

&gt; &gt; It keeps the material dry and moth free. Maybe you can store some <br/>

&gt; &gt;  We have a new refrigerator.  Our old one went out earlier this <br/>
year, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; we went and bought a brand new refrigerator - the first time in <br/>
nearly 24<br/>
&gt; &gt; years that we actually BOUGHT a brand new refrigerator!  This one <br/>
was our<br/>
&gt; &gt; dream refrigerator - freezer on the bottom with french doors on <br/>
top and good<br/>
&gt; &gt; lighting inside so you can really see the "interesting" things <br/>
that turn up,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and a working icemaker and no ice and water dispenser on the <br/>
front.  I've<br/>
&gt; &gt; been working like a mad woman to keep it clean inside and so far, <br/>
we've done<br/>
&gt; &gt; pretty well.  The only real problem is the front of the doors - <br/>
they are<br/>
&gt; &gt; brushed stainless steel.  They show every last fingerprint, to <br/>
the point<br/>
&gt; &gt; that if I clean it before I go to bed at night I can tell if <br/>
someone was up<br/>
&gt; &gt; during the night raiding the refrigerator, and for the time being <br/>
I can even<br/>
&gt; &gt; tell which of the two guys I live with it was.  It's even making <br/>
Fearless<br/>
&gt; &gt; Fox a little nuts trying to keep the front clean (probably <br/>
because he is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; usual midnight raider).  And the worst part is?  It doesn't take <br/>
magnets!<br/>
&gt; &gt; We tried to talk them into ordering one in a standard color so we <br/>
could have<br/>
&gt; &gt; magnets and not fingerprints, but they would only give us "the <br/>
deal" on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; stainless.  I wonder why.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And what did we do with the old one?  It sits in my study.  I <br/>
tried to get<br/>
&gt; &gt; rid of it on Freecycle, but even there it is hard to get rid of <br/>
marginally<br/>
&gt; &gt; operational appliances.  I tried, with the help of Nac Trail Cat <br/>
(my<br/>
&gt; &gt; mother), to convince my mother-in-law (trailname-less) that she <br/>
needed it<br/>
&gt; &gt; for worm beds.  My mother-in-law is the woman who has semi <br/>
trailers sitting<br/>
&gt; &gt; on her land to hold all her junk, and even she refused my old <br/>
refrigerator.<br/>
&gt; &gt;  So it STILL sits in my study.  Fearless Fox says I should use it <br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; bookshelves.  I may not be the most sophisticated member on this <br/>
list, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm also not QUITE that much of a redneck either.  Anybody want <br/>
an old<br/>
&gt; &gt; fridge?<br/>

<div>When we left Connecticut, I took my paint cans to the recycle center, and the guy told me they were only allowed to accept them a few times a year and only on certain dates. I told him I was moving and asked what he recommended I do with them. He told me to leave them on the side of the road. I was so furious with that attitude, especially from the recycle attendant. I told him I had a better idea - I'd leave them on his desk and turned and walked out. He yelled at my back to tell me I couldn't leave them there because he didn't have room, so I told him to just leave them on the side of the road... and kept walking. I didn't see any buzz by my head, so I guess he decided I wasn't worth the battle.</div>

Our old one went out earlier this <br/>year, so<br/>&gt; &gt; we went and bought a brand new refrigerator - the first time in <br/>nearly 24<br/>&gt; &gt; years that we actually BOUGHT a brand new refrigerator! This one <br/>was our<br/>&gt; &gt; dream refrigerator - freezer on the bottom with french doors on <br/>top and good<br/>&gt; &gt; lighting inside so you can really see the "interesting" things <br/>that turn up,<br/>&gt; &gt; and a working icemaker and no ice and water dispenser on the <br/>front. I've<br/>&gt; &gt; been working like a mad woman to keep it clean inside and so far, <br/>we've done<br/>&gt; &gt; pretty well. The only real problem is the front of the doors - <br/>they are<br/>&gt; &gt; brushed stainless steel. They show every last fingerprint, to <br/>the point<br/>&gt; &gt; that if I clean it before I go to bed at night I can tell if <br/>someone was up<br/>&gt; &gt; during the night raiding the refrigerator, and for the time being <br/>I can even<br/>&gt; &gt; tell which of the two guys I live with it was. It's even making <br/>Fearless<br/>&gt; &gt; Fox a little nuts trying to keep the front clean (probably <br/>because he is the<br/>&gt; &gt; usual midnight raider). And the worst part is? It doesn't take <br/>magnets!<br/>&gt; &gt; We tried to talk them into ordering one in a standard color so we <br/>could have<br/>&gt; &gt; magnets and not fingerprints, but they would only give us "the <br/>deal" on the<br/>&gt; &gt; stainless. I wonder why. <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And what did we do with the old one? It sits in my study. I <br/>tried to get<br/>&gt; &gt; rid of it on Freecycle, but even there it is hard to get rid of <br/>marginally<br/>&gt; &gt; operational appliances. I tried, with the help of Nac Trail Cat <br/>(my<br/>&gt; &gt; mother), to convince my mother-in-law (trailname-less) that she <br/>needed it<br/>&gt; &gt; for worm beds. My mother-in-law is the woman who has semi <br/>trailers sitting<br/>&gt; &gt; on her land to hold all her junk, and even she refused my old <br/>refrigerator.<br/>&gt; &gt; So it STILL sits in my study. Fearless Fox says I should use it <br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; bookshelves. I may not be the most sophisticated member on this <br/>list, but<br/>&gt; &gt; I'm also not QUITE that much of a redneck either.

<div>When we left Connecticut, I took my paint cans to the recycle center, and the guy told me they were only allowed to accept them a few times a year and only on certain dates. I told him I was moving and asked what he recommended I do with them. He told me to leave them on the side of the road. I was so furious with that attitude, especially from the recycle attendant. I told him I had a better idea - I'd leave them on his desk and turned and walked out. He yelled at my back to tell me I couldn't leave them there because he didn't have room, so I told him to just leave them on the side of the road... and kept walking. I didn't see any buzz by my head, so I guess he decided I wasn't worth the battle.

<div>When we left Connecticut, I took my paint cans to the 
  recycle center, and the guy told me they were only allowed to accept them 
  a few times a year and only on certain dates. I told him I was moving and 
  asked what he recommended I do with them. He told me to leave them on the side 
  of the road. I was so furious with that attitude, especially from the recycle 
  attendant. I told him I had a better idea - I'd leave them on his desk and 
  turned and walked out. He yelled at my back to tell me I couldn't leave 
  them there because he didn't have room, so I told him to just leave them on 
  the side of the road... and kept walking. I didn't see any buzz by my head, so 
  I guess he decided I wasn't worth the battle.</div>

      &gt; we went and bought a brand new refrigerator - the first time in 
      <br/>nearly 24<br/>&gt; &gt; years that we actually BOUGHT a brand new 
      refrigerator! This one <br/>was our<br/>&gt; &gt; dream refrigerator - 
      freezer on the bottom with french doors on <br/>top and good<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      lighting inside so you can really see the "interesting" things <br/>that 
      turn up,<br/>&gt; &gt; and a working icemaker and no ice and water 
      dispenser on the <br/>front. I've<br/>&gt; &gt; been working like a mad 
      woman to keep it clean inside and so far, <br/>we've done<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      pretty well. The only real problem is the front of the doors - <br/>they 
      are<br/>&gt; &gt; brushed stainless steel. They show every last 
      fingerprint, to <br/>the point<br/>&gt; &gt; that if I clean it before I go 
      to bed at night I can tell if <br/>someone was up<br/>&gt; &gt; during the 
      night raiding the refrigerator, and for the time being <br/>I can 
      even<br/>&gt; &gt; tell which of the two guys I live with it was. It's even 
      making <br/>Fearless<br/>&gt; &gt; Fox a little nuts trying to keep the 
      front clean (probably <br/>because he is the<br/>&gt; &gt; usual midnight 
      raider). And the worst part is? It doesn't take <br/>magnets!<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      We tried to talk them into ordering one in a standard color so we 
      <br/>could have<br/>&gt; &gt; magnets and not fingerprints, but they would 
      only give us "the <br/>deal" on the<br/>&gt; &gt; stainless. I wonder why. 
      <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And what did we do with the old one? It sits in 
      my study. I <br/>tried to get<br/>&gt; &gt; rid of it on Freecycle, but even 
      there it is hard to get rid of <br/>marginally<br/>&gt; &gt; operational 
      appliances. I tried, with the help of Nac Trail Cat <br/>(my<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      mother), to convince my mother-in-law (trailname-less) that she <br/>needed 
      it<br/>&gt; &gt; for worm beds. My mother-in-law is the woman who has semi 
      <br/>trailers sitting<br/>&gt; &gt; on her land to hold all her junk, and 
      even she refused my old <br/>refrigerator.<br/>&gt; &gt; So it STILL sits in 
      my study. Fearless Fox says I should use it <br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; 
      bookshelves. I may not be the most sophisticated member on this <br/>list, 
      but<br/>&gt; &gt; I'm also not QUITE that much of a redneck either. Anybody 
      want <br/>an old<br/>&gt; &gt; fridge?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;

They show every last fingerprint, to <br/>the point<br/>&gt; &gt; that if I clean it before I go to bed at night I can tell if <br/>someone was up<br/>&gt; &gt; during the night raiding the refrigerator, and for the time being <br/>I can even<br/>&gt; &gt; tell which of the two guys I live with it was. It's even making <br/>Fearless<br/>&gt; &gt; Fox a little nuts trying to keep the front clean (probably <br/>because he is the<br/>&gt; &gt; usual midnight raider). And the worst part is? It doesn't take <br/>magnets!<br/>&gt; &gt; We tried to talk them into ordering one in a standard color so we <br/>could have<br/>&gt; &gt; magnets and not fingerprints, but they would only give us "the <br/>deal" on the<br/>&gt; &gt; stainless. I wonder why. <br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; And what did we do with the old one? It sits in my study. I <br/>tried to get<br/>&gt; &gt; rid of it on Freecycle, but even there it is hard to get rid of <br/>marginally<br/>&gt; &gt; operational appliances. I tried, with the help of Nac Trail Cat <br/>(my<br/>&gt; &gt; mother), to convince my mother-in-law (trailname-less) that she <br/>needed it<br/>&gt; &gt; for worm beds. My mother-in-law is the woman who has semi <br/>trailers sitting<br/>&gt; &gt; on her land to hold all her junk, and even she refused my old <br/>refrigerator.<br/>&gt; &gt; So it STILL sits in my study. Fearless Fox says I should use it <br/>for<br/>&gt; &gt; bookshelves. I may not be the most sophisticated member on this <br/>list, but<br/>&gt; &gt; I'm also not QUITE that much of a redneck either. Anybody want <br/>an old<br/>&gt; &gt; fridge?<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/></span></div><span class="q">&gt; &gt; On 8/29/07, the carrascos &lt;a.carrasco@.<wbr/>..&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I have found very similar things in my fridge from time to <br/>time.
