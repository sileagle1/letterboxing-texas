Apparently this boxer is a member of letterboxingtexas (hello, whoever you are).She revealed my trailname to the group, and she revealed my real identity to several letteroboxers, which I felt was in very poor taste. Since it has become a personal attack on me...I'm at a loss. I'm actually afraid of retaliation on my boxes! Ike! I'm sorry I ever tried. I really was just trying to make sure they knew the Code of Conduct. What is wrong with people?</span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span"><br/></span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span">Sandy,</span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span">Since we are warning people about letterboxing spies it is only fair to let the HSSG letterboxing people know that they may have spies watching them. Below is your comment to a letterboxing group. I didnt realize that Letterboxing was created by you and that we needed your permission to participate. Thank you for your understanding with new letterboxers. I am sure your advice when given in a constructive way is appreciated.</span></p><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"></span><br/></span></div><p><span class="Apple-style-span">Quote from Sandy.</span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span">Anyhow, they'll be there on November 7th at 11:30, if y'all want to go spy on them. ;-) You won't be able to miss them, that's for sure!</span></p><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"></span><br/></span></div><p><span class="Apple-style-span">You are really mad at ME and THEA. I was the one who posted a picture of your Fossil Creek letterbox notebook to our private forum for no one else to see but THEA members. Non-Renewing members were also able to see these photo albums for a short period but is no longer possible.</span></p><p><span class="Apple-style-span">That was my bad and was removed when I was notified by someone on another group who didnt know me. It was funny how she could reach me but you couldnt seem to.</span></p><div><span class="Apple-style-span"><span class="Apple-style-span"></span><br/></span></div><p><span class="Apple-style-span">Thank you for your understanding and respect.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm apparently expected to issue a public apology for revealing the  <br/>
time and date of the letterboxing field trip. I won't.  (I will say  <br/>
that I'm sorry I used the word "spy".  That was tacky.) I don't  <br/>
understand why they don't want anyone to know when they'll be there,  <br/>
really.<br/>
<br/>
So, now I'm seriously thinking about pulling my boxes and starting  <br/>
from scratch with a new identity!  (How's that for over-reacting?)   <br/>
There is obviously some serious anger and resentment out there, and  <br/>
since my trail name and "true identity" have been revealed with  <br/>
malice to several new letterboxers, I don't have much recourse.   <br/>
Geeze.  I guess I could wait and see if there is some rebound effect  <br/>
from all of this.  If my boxes get vandalized or some-such, at least  <br/>
I'll have an idea of who did it.<br/>
<br/>
At the very least, I'm done worrying about new boxers, missing boxes,  <br/>
fostering good habits and conduct, blah, blah, blah.  It's so not  <br/>
worth it!<br/>
