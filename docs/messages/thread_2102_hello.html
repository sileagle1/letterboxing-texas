pointed me over here when I kept pestering her about the goings on in<br/>
the group. Anyway I'm not much of a poster, but I am here reading away<br/>
and taking it all in.<br/>
<br/>
We planted the Texas Tour Bus this morning and I'll soon post clues to<br/>
its location. <br/>

Take care all,<br/>
