                    <div class="plaintext-content">After loitering at my house for several weeks, those crazy passengers <br/>
of the Texas Tour Bus 2 took off this morning in a big ole hurry!  I <br/>
thought I heard the bus driver say something about going to Austin, <br/>
but wasn't sure I heard correctly.  MeMa of 7 is still visiting from <br/>
Baltimore, so she, SoccerChik and I jumped in my car to to give chase.<br/>
<br/>
They headed west on I-10 for 40 miles or so, and made a quick side <br/>
trip to San Felipe.  I think the Ghost of Davy Crockett wanted to say <br/>
hello to some Old friends of his.  Next, they veered back onto I-10 <br/>
and continued west to Columbus where they stopped at a regional LCRA <br/>
park to feed the kitties.  <br/>
<br/>
We chased the bus as it turned northwest on Hwy 71, but lost it when <br/>
we stopped in Ellinger for some to-die-for kolaches at Hruska's Store <br/>
&amp; Bakery, then swung into Rosemary's Vineyard (MeMa's first name is <br/>
Rosemary and thought it would be cool to take home a bottle of Merlot <br/>
with "her" label). <br/>
<br/>
We thought we'd lost them for good, but as we neared LaGrange, we <br/>
heard the unmistakable sounds of a home-grown Texas band <br/>
(Uh...huh..huh..huh) and caught a glimps of the passengers downing <br/>
some brewskies.  Before we could even park the car, the were off <br/>
again!  I thought they made a wrong turn when they stopped at another <br/>
LCRA park just outside LaGrange to whistle at some scantily dressed <br/>
ladies, but they only tossed something out the window and made their <br/>
way back onto Hwy 71.<br/>
<br/>
We didn't know where in the heck that bus driver was headed!  About <br/>
35 miles southeast of Austin, they stopped at Kendra Macon's <br/>
Roadhouse for some of the best burgers in the county.  Between bites <br/>
of a HUGE bacon cheeseburger, Willie mumbled something about Houston <br/>
Toads. I think that boy's been smokin' some funny stuff!  After our <br/>
long chase we were hungry too, so we rested for a spell on the patio <br/>
and enjoyed our grub.<br/>
<br/>
Next thing we knew, those crazy passengers ran out and jumped back <br/>
onto the bus, zipping across the road into a park, and leaving me <br/>
stuck with their tab! After settling up with Kendra, we tried to <br/>
follow their path of destruction. Seems they almost mowed down some <br/>
guys in a golf cart and ran through the entrance gate.  The ranger <br/>
was still shaking his fist at them as we came through. The way I hear <br/>
it, only two wheels of that bus were touching the ground as they made <br/>
a quick left onto Park Road 1A. <br/>
<br/>
As we made the corner, we saw some kids on bicycles pointing up the <br/>
road toward an overlook in the northeast corner of the park.  We <br/>
followed - always keeping right on Park Road 1A.  We parked at the <br/>
overlook, and although we enjoyed the view, we didn't see that darned <br/>
bus anywhere!  <br/>
<br/>
As we returned to our car, SoccerChik noticed a sign across the road <br/>
indicating that this park was the largest remaining habitat of the <br/>
Houston Toad.  Maybe Willie was onto to something after all.  And <br/>
guess what?!!  There were tire tracks heading east past the sign, and <br/>
down the trail.  We hurried down the trail ourselves, and soon came <br/>
to a trail post declaring no fires or bikes allowed... it didn't <br/>
forbid buses, which is good, cause those tire tracks were still going <br/>
east on the trail, down a hill.  We continued for another 58 steps, <br/>
passing two reflective trail markers nailed to trees.  We were nearly <br/>
at the bottom of the hill and saw another of those reflective trail <br/>
markers nailed to a tall pine tree on the left. We stopped there to <br/>
catch our breath for a second. That's when we noticed the tire tracks <br/>
veered left into the forest.  They seemed headed straight toward a <br/>
pair of pine trees about 15 steps from the trail, but the tracks <br/>
disappeared at the pine on the right, under the boughs of a large <br/>
fallen pine tree that rested against it.<br/>
<br/>
I fear that crazy TTB2 has gotten lost in the loblolly pines!  We <br/>
were exhausted and decided that someone else would have to rescue the <br/>
passengers from their folly.  We returned to our car and headed home <br/>
to Houston.<br/>
<br/>
Hope ya'll had a festive New Year's too!<br/>

to go with her.  We all had a great time today, but I'm afraid we've <br/>
worn her out.  We probably hiked 4-5 miles today.  Not bad for a 67-<br/>

<br/>
She could probably put up with SoccerChik and I being night owls and <br/>
keeping her up until midnight or later, if it weren't for early-bird <br/>
hubby who wakes her up at 6am every day.  She's leaving Sunday and <br/>
looking forward to getting some rest at home.  ;)<br/>
