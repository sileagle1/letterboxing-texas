                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just have to share with everyone what happened to me the other <br>
day.  As a rule I always take my children lbing with me.  However, <br>
when planting boxes I sometimes go alone due to having to <br>
concentrate on writing clues.  Anyway, my kids had gone to mother's <br>
day out and I had 5 boxes itching for a home so out I went.  I went <br>
to Nichols Green, a superb park in our area.  I managed to find <br>
absolutely awesome spots to plant 2 boxes.  After getting them <br>
planted I started walking towards the other side of the park to <br>
check on a box that was one of my very first plants.  As I rounded a <br>
corner I saw something scurrying across the grass.  I quickly ran to <br>
where I saw it and to my surprise it was a young armadillo.  Now as <br>
I child I had seen many of these out in the country from the safe <br>
distance of the back of a truck.  I walked up pretty close and <br>
discovered that it was oblivious to me.  I followed it around for a <br>
while as it rooted around.  Eventually it noticed me and walked up <br>
to me.  I of course had on flip flops and suddenly was worried about <br>
my toes.  He sniffed at my feet and toes and looked me up and down, <br>
walked around me a couple of times the continued rooting around.  I <br>
watched him until he finally went back into the woods.  The entire <br>
time I was wishing I had my children with me because they would have <br>
thought that this was just too cool.  Just wanted to share this <br>
awesome experience.  Like so many have said before, it isn't about <br>
the prize at the end but rather the experiences you have journeying <br>
there.  When boxing at Nichols Green, if you see my little friend, <br>
say Hello for me!<br>

<div>That's great. What a wonderful experience. The two of you just sort of co-existed in the world for a little bit. Really, really cool. </div>
