                    <div class="plaintext-content">I imagine that for many of us, a Silver Eagle or Baby Bear box was the <br/>
first that we found.  For us, it was Baby Bear's Houston Texans box, <br/>
found almost exactly a year ago (I can't even remember what stamp we <br/>
used to stamp in).  We didn't really know anything; there was a HH in <br/>
the box and we had no idea what it was, so we left it.  The next one <br/>
was also Baby Bear's, Star Buck, at the beginning of a road trip to <br/>
Colorado in July where our enchantment really began.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, it seems that where ever we road trip in Texas, there's a SE or <br/>
BB box to be found--in some great places we might not otherwise visit.<br/>
<br/>
So a big thanks from us!<br/>
