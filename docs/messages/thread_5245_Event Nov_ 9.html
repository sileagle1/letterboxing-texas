 performers, vendors, etc, and we are hoping it's going to be a great thing and get bigger each year.</div><div><br/></div><div>here's a link for the Big Thicket Ren Faire</div><div><br/></div><div><a href="http://bigthicketrenfaire.org/">http://bigthicketrenfaire.org/</a><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>I am letting you know because I will be there for sure, and I am planning to host a booth for people who like to play Hide &amp; Seek so we can all have a place to hang out and meet each other comfortably.  So, if you enjoy playing "Hide &amp; Seek," I hope you'll want to come by the booth and say hello and swap some stories and stamps and that sort of thing.  I expect we'll have an event stamp of some sort (not made quite yet), and of course you can bring your personals and that type of thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>LetterBoxers?</div><div><br/></div><div>GeoCachers?</div><div><br/></div><div>BookCrossers?</div><div><br/></div><div>PathTaggers?</div><div><br/></div><div>Where'sGeorgers?</div><div><br/></div><div>And all our other "hide &amp;
 seek" cousins out there!  </div><div><br/></div><div>Whatever game you play, feel welcome.</div><div><br/></div><div>hope to see you there!</div><div><br/></div><div>Thanks,</div><div><br/></div><div>Ashby</div><div><br/></div></div></body></html>
