yesterday at a box that TexasLuvBug had planted wayyyy<br>
off the beaten path.  But I didn't tell y'all how nice<br>
that little trek was.<br>
<br>
I had posted a few days ago about how much I liked the<br>
way she had written the clues, and sure enough it was<br>
a great journey to the box!  There are parts of<br>
Cherokee County (like many rural counties in Texas)<br>
where folks still live a pretty simple life.  The road<br>
she leads the finder out to find A Family Affair box<br>
is typical of that life.  It was so easy to envision<br>
what she described had happened at certain given spots<br>
because little has changed in many, many years (not<br>
saying that TLB is many, many years old!)  We passed<br>
several old country homesteads and at one house<br>
everyone was gathered outside because it was cooler<br>
outdoors than indoors.  When we passed by the first<br>
time, they were clearly just finished up dinner and<br>
putting away the dishes.  As the sun was setting on<br>
our way back, the dominoes game was gearing up!   The<br>
countryside was deep thicket alternating with rolling<br>
hills and farmland.  Made me appreciate being a Texan.<br>
 No one lives like we do!<br>
<br>
The box itself is in an old cemetery - and I'm with<br>
Wanda, I love old cemeteries!  We lingered there about<br>
20 minutes, long enough to be checked out several<br>
times by the nearby residents wondering what we were<br>
doing in "their" cemetery.  <br>
<br>
Aside from GG's distinctive stamp, I found another HH<br>
- A Little Boys Ball Cap.  I'll be heading out to box<br>
a little this weekend, so the little boy will have to<br>
look for his cap in yet another place.  <br>

<br>
P.S.  No sign of any animals around THIS box of TLB's<br>
- unless you count GG.<br>

Ruby's computer messing up, so I guess this week it'll<br>
be mine!<br>
