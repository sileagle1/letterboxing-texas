                    <html><body><div>Deb was kind enough to let me know that my box in Henderson had all but swum away, so now I need to get over there and fix it back up I guess.  It's one of my older boxes that, if memory serves, is in a disposable container still with an index card book, both of which I've moved away from in more recent boxes.  I've had the worst luck checking that box because every time we are in Henderson and swing by there, there is someone parked close by who prevents my pulling it and checking it out.  Frankly, I'm surprised it is still there for the same reason - but folks keep finding it and rehiding it well apparently!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My parents-in-law both grew up in Henderson and we still have a lot of family over there. I've had another box planned for Henderson based on one of my mother-in-law's childhood stories that has always drawn me to a specific location there in Henderson.  I've also been thinking I need to put a box at the Depot Museum, and specifically somewhere near the dog-run house, which used to belong to my father-in-law's family.</div>

<div>My nose is pointed toward Palestine at the moment, but maybe now that we've got some new boxers over toward Henderson, I'll get those two done over the summer.</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
