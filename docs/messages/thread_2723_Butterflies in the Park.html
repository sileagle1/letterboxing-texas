<br/>
It's odd that you were at Fun Forest Park Saturday,<br/>
the girls and I finally got around to replacing<br/>
Butterflies in the Park at Fun Forest Park Saturday<br/>
evening.  We must have just missed ya'll.  We put it<br/>
back in the same place it was planted before.  Too bad<br/>
we didn't make that our first stop of the day, then<br/>
ya'll could have found it again.  We headed to Bullard<br/>
first thing and it's a good thing we did.  We went to<br/>
a garage sale and found a bunch of bargains but best<br/>
of all we were given a piano for free!  So now, I<br/>
awake to a morning recital by McKayla (aka Pretty<br/>
Kitty) We were planning on taking piano lessons this<br/>
summer after Hearts In Bloom, 4H and Girl Scouts were<br/>
all over but we may have to start taking them alot<br/>
sooner, little Libaracee (sp?) as her daddy calls<br/>
needs lessons desparately!! :-)<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails,<br/>
<br/>

mom to Atoy Adventurers<br/>

<div>Nice about the piano - definitely doesn't pay to have a piano around without knowing how to play it though.  Wayyyy to noisy!<br/><br/> </div>
