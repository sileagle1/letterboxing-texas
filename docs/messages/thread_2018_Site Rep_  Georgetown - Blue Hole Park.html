<br>
Just thought I'd post a little note for anyone who may be passing <br>
through Georgetown and hoping to box a little.<br>
<br>
Back on July 22nd, Georgetown had a brief but ferocious storm that <br>
left much of the city without electricity for over 12 hours.  This <br>
same storm damaged many of the very old trees in town...either <br>
downing them completely, damaging them with high winds or with <br>
lightning strikes.<br>
<br>
Pickett Trail in Blue Hole Park is almost impassable due to the many <br>
downed trees on the trail.  We went this morning and found Boots <br>
Tex's Three Legged Willie (AWESOME box, btw!) and had to actually <br>
crawl THROUGH a huge downed tree on the path.  Once at the rock <br>
ledge described in the clue, we had to work our way AROUND (and off <br>
the path) another downed tree to get to the actual ledge.  <br>
Anyhoo...Three Legged Willie is in great shape, especially <br>
considering the damage to the area.  I highly recommend this <br>
box...it's really cool!<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, this means that some of the boxes on the trail are <br>
going to be difficult to reach.  When we were climbing through the <br>
first tree, we lost count of our steps, so just kept going until we <br>
reached the correct area.  If you're not familiar with the trail, <br>
however, it might be difficult to find.  <br>
<br>
Also, immediately after the correct rock ledge there is ANOTHER tree <br>
blocking the path.  This one, too, can be passed, but it requires <br>
literally CRAWLING through the tree!  The kiddos could get through, <br>
but I was totally stuck and had to have them yank me backwards out <br>
of the tree!  So...I was not able to check on the status of Batty <br>
Bat.<br>
<br>
I am going to email the city's Parks Dept today and let them know of <br>
the status of the trail.  Hopefully they will clear it off pretty <br>
quickly.<br>
<br>
Boxes that ARE still accessible include:  Silver Eagle's Pocket <br>
Wocket (in another area of the park), Baby Bear's Jiminy Cricket <br>
(clear spot on trail) and Three-Legged Willie (with a couple of tree <br>
obstacles).  Also close by is Lone Star Quilter's Georgetown Quilt <br>
Square (different area of the park).<br>
<br>
Good luck!  Batty B<br>
