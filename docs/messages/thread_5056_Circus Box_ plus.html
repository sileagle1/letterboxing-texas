<div>I never log attempts because, when I first started letterboxing it was widely believed that an attempt on a box was a "death sentence" and that box would be considered as missing. I do, however, contact the placer and explain that I couldn't find the box, even though I believed that I was looking in the right place. If I am uncertain whether I am following the clues correctly, or if I'm just plain confused, I just don't log anything. When I receive a first "attempt" report on one of my boxes, I generally ignore it, unless it's from someone I know and trust, like Wry Me. At the second attempt, I'll mark the box as unavailable and place a note on the clue page that the box has been reported as missing. If I have no intention of checking on it, I may just retire it. I have one box which, in the last four notices was: attempted, attempted, found and attempted. I put those boxes on a "check list" and whenever we make a trip in that direction, I'll go by
 and check on them, sometimes even bringing a new stamp and box just in case it's really missing. As often as not, the box is intact and right where it should be. Fifty percent is enough to make me skeptical of "attempted" reports. If anyone ever has a reported problem with a box that is anywhere near Coldpspring, Texas, let me know and I'll try to check on it for you. Last week I was down in the Beaumont area to place a box and I noticed a box by a prominent letterbox in a state park that was nearby. It was placed in 2008 before Hurricane Ike and had never been found. There was one attempt report and the box was assumed missing. I had no problem finding the box by following the simple clues. Unfortunately, the lid and the stamp were missing and the logbook slightly water damaged, but it was there. I think most people still believe that "attempts" means the same as "missing".<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" ymailto="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com</a>, Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Wry Me,<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If everyone viewed attempts as you do, I think there wouldn't be a<br/>&gt; problem.

                    <html><body><p>Interesting reading your take on various comments Wry Me! In the "olden" days, there WAS no online logging so Attempts weren't an issue. But at that point, there so few boxes that I dont think a bad report would've mattered - most of us would've gone for it in hopes we might find it anyway. To give you perspective, the day I went to find my first box, there were only three boxes within a two hour drive. </p>
<p>Also, because we didn't have online logging we really looked forward to reading notes from finders because we.didn't know IF we had finders or who they might have been. Finders sometimes wrote to say thanks, but the only time they would for sure write was if there was a problem with the box. A personal note is nice now, but I'm surprised it's such a dogmatic thing since it is so easy to log AND write at the same time. Funny how niceties become expectations...</p>
<p>I've been in a leadership conference yesterday and today and one guy talked about standing on the shoulders or those that came before you and reaching out a hand to those that follow you...</p>

After reading the comments from Wry Me and Barefoot Lucy about writing notes in the logbook, it enlightened me! I remember how I used to love to check on my plants, because I couldn't wait to see who all had visited my boxes and read their notes. I would occasionally get an offsite email that fire ants, bees or poison ivy had occupied the area around one of my boxes, which was a helpful email since I could place a warning in my clues. By the same token, I would always enjoy reading all the comments in the log books of boxes I found to see who had visited them before me. It was always fun to see who had been there and what their comments were - something that had differentiated letterboxing and geocaching! I've certainly been remiss in leaving notes in the log books recently, but now that you've reminded me how much I used to enjoy that aspect of boxing, I'll do better!<br/>Puddle Splasher<br/><br/><br/></font></font></font><blockquote style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #0000ff 2px solid">-----Original Message-----

<p></p><p>Interesting reading your take on various comments Wry Me!  In the "olden" days, there WAS no online logging so Attempts weren't an issue.  But at that point, there so few boxes that I dont think a bad report would've mattered - most of us would've gone for it in hopes we might find it anyway.   To give you perspective, the day I went to find my first box, there were only three boxes within a two hour drive.  </p>
<p>Also,  because we didn't have online logging we really looked forward to reading notes from finders because we.didn't know IF we had finders or who they might have been.  Finders sometimes wrote to say thanks, but the only time they would for sure write was if there was a problem with the box.  A personal note is nice now, but I'm surprised it's such a dogmatic thing since it is so easy to log AND write at the same time.  Funny how niceties become expectations...</p>

<p></p><div style="font-size:12pt;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;"><div><span>There is an interesting difference of perceptions between long-timers and relative newbies like me.  I can understand when boxes were few and far between perhaps that it would be tempting not to pursue a box w/ an attempt on it and how disappointing that would be for the planter who has to check on it! I'm spoiled by the current state of affairs and surplus of boxes, so thanks for that!  It never occurred to me just to skip it altogether, but when I first started I was always surprised at someone finding one after I'd logged an attempt, so I know better now! I learned things from the AQ forums; it never occurred to me to leave notes in logbooks until others mentioned how much they liked reading them and how in the early days, it was considered as much fun to look
 through them as it was to get the stamp.  Now they seem viewed by some as a necessary evil, so I may rethink "wasting space" in someone's logbook with comments, which is how I used to think of it. I think it's desireable to be having local events like the ones Open Space has started, because it gives newbies a chance to learn.  I'm fairly sure people aren't reading the guidelines much, but there are also gray areas that need to be discussed, little finesse things like box maintenance and protocols for unusual situations.  I've been behind boxers who have made their passing VERY obvious, as one example.  When that happens, I'm always grateful that though I had been boxing for awhile, it took hanging out with Sandibox &amp; Beach Bum at my first event to really teach me some things that wouldn't have occurred to me otherwise. Then Mosaic Butterfly furthered my education, especially with all the history in
 Texas.  I think events and mini-gatherings are indispensible in this regard.  I hope the ones down here continue.  Which brings me to the real reason I'm online this afternoon:  I HAVE THE CIRCUS BOX.  Thank you, Puddle Splasher, for a wonderful morning!  I so enjoyed finally meeting you!</span></div>

<div>I never log attempts because, when I first started letterboxing it was widely believed that an attempt on a box was a "death sentence" and that box would be considered as missing. I do, however, contact the placer and explain that I couldn't find the box, even though I believed that I was looking in the right place. If I am uncertain whether I am following the clues correctly, or if I'm just plain confused, I just don't log anything. When I receive a first "attempt" report on one of my boxes, I generally ignore it, unless it's from someone I know and trust, like Wry Me. At the second attempt, I'll mark the box as unavailable and place a note on the clue page that the box has been reported as missing. If I have no intention of checking on it, I may just retire it. I have one box which, in the last four notices was: attempted, attempted, found and attempted. I put those boxes on a "check list" and whenever we make a trip in that direction, I'll go by
 and check on them, sometimes even bringing a new stamp and box just in case it's really missing. As often as not, the box is intact and right where it should be. Fifty percent is enough to make me skeptical of "attempted" reports. If anyone ever has a reported problem with a box that is anywhere near Coldpspring, Texas, let me know and I'll try to check on it for you. Last week I was down in the Beaumont area to place a box and I noticed a box by a prominent letterbox in a state park that was nearby. It was placed in 2008 before Hurricane Ike and had never been found. There was one attempt report and the box was assumed missing. I had no problem finding the box by following the simple clues. Unfortunately, the lid and the stamp were missing and the logbook slightly water damaged, but it was there. I think most people still believe that "attempts" means the same as "missing".<br/>

&gt; If everyone viewed attempts as you do, I think there wouldn't be a<br/>&gt; problem. In fact, I love that you see one Attempt as a challenge!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; However, there are many letterboxers who want a sure thing and one attempt<br/>
&gt; waves them off that box. Frankly, I don't think those folks are cut out<br/>&gt; for letterboxing, but whatever. You would be amazed at the numbers of<br/>&gt; people that write to the webmasters on LBNA (and AQ, I'm sure) to ask which<br/>
&gt; boxes are guaranteed to be there. Thankfully Jay Drew and Choi are much<br/>&gt; more patient than I am, and they write a nice note to those folks saying<br/>&gt; there are no guarantees but you can still have fun, blah blah blah. My<br/>
&gt; inclination is to say "None of them are
 guaranteed to be there, so go take<br/>&gt; up knitting!"<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Lucy<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; On Tue, Aug 7, 2012 at 10:41 PM, Wry Me &lt;wry_me@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; And I always log attempts, because to me, it just means I didn't find it<br/>&gt; &gt; after I looked thoroughly, but not necessarily that it's missing. I don't<br/>&gt; &gt; do that if I just gave up, though. Maybe I shouldn't be doing that. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wonder if I'm the only one. Then again, I don't take it seriously when<br/>&gt; &gt; someone else logs one, either, unless I see several in a row. To me a<br/>&gt; &gt; single attempt on a box reads more like a challenge, or an alert to spend<br/>
&gt; &gt; a little more time looking and perhaps to expect the unexpected. So I<br/>&gt; &gt; appreciate it when people log attempts as well. I think you're missing the<br/>&gt; &gt; boat when you assume a single attempt means the box is gone.
 And several<br/>&gt; &gt; attempts in an area where I already plan to box means taking coup if I find<br/>&gt; &gt; it.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; *From:* michael ridout &lt;michael_ridout@...&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; *To:* <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com</a><br/>

&gt; &gt; this for a few years and love letterboxing, but my counts are low because<br/>&gt; &gt; time is generally tight.)<br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt; It's always a question for me. I just looked back at my attempts on AQ,<br/>
&gt; &gt; and for the most part, the box was dead when I attempted it. Most have
 not<br/>&gt; &gt; been found again after my attempt. There are a couple of Boots Tex's boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; that he shows maintenance on and then they were revived, *but* there are<br/>&gt; &gt; also a couple that were attempted by one or two people after me and then<br/>
&gt; &gt; they suddenly started getting found again. I don't know if the planter<br/>&gt; &gt; stepped in or we just missed it.<br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt; I've gotten now to the point that I'm very hesitant to list an attempt. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't want to assume that I'm 100% accurate in my search and the only<br/>&gt; &gt; conclusion is that the box is no longer there. I don't want to be the guy<br/>&gt; &gt; that keeps others from seeking a box because I botched the clues. Then<br/>
&gt; &gt; again, I don't want to be the guy that doesn't report and lets others waste<br/>&gt; &gt; time going out seeking a box that is gone...<br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt; phoenix8<br/>&gt; &gt; **<br/>&gt; &gt;
