                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks Puddle Splasher! I am intersested. That would be really neat <br>
to attend the event and view his paintings and drawings. If any of <br>
you have young ones around, Hank the Cowdog's books are fun to read. <br>
The illustrations are outstanding. I especially like Watercolors <br>
anyway. It amazes me how you can take "watercolors" and make such a <br>
beautiful painting out of them. <br>
<br>
Updated clues for Henry's Chapel:<br>
     I have moved this box due to a new fence. They have expanded the <br>
cemetery and my box was exposed, but thankfully, Adams Trails was out <br>
boxing this week-end and rescued it for me. I moved it today and will <br>
post updated clues. <br>
<br>
happy Boxing!<br>

local young artists for the annual Summer Art Exhibition at Copper <br>
Breaks State Park. The unique theme for this year's exhibition <br>
is "Refrigerator Art."<br>
> Gerald Holmes is beloved by many as the illustrator of the wildly <br>
popular children's books Hank the Cow Dog. For more than twenty <br>
years, and with more than 50 books in print, he has introduced ranch <br>
life in Texas to millions with his watercolor and pen and ink <br>
drawings of the ranch where Hank serves as head of security. His <br>
selections in the Copper Breaks art show reflect a range of <br>
experiences from the comical as in the "Hank" prints, to the <br>
practicalities of working cattle on the Texas range, to the park's <br>
own Longhorns ranging through the ruggedly beautiful breaks along the <br>
Pease River.<br>
> Holmes is showing prints and original water colors mounted on the <br>
wooden panels normally used for the art show. Many of his works are <br>
for sale. Holmes is joined by 22 youngsters who are showing their art <br>
mounted with magnets on refrigerators.<br>
> The annual Summer Art Exhibition began in1997 with an exhibit of <br>
Frank Reeves Chuck Wagon Chronicles. Since then, the park has played <br>
host to a wide range of art and artists including the native American <br>
style flat painting of Quanah Parker Tracy, the vivid watercolors of <br>
internationally-known mouth artist Joe Urquizo, the well-known <br>
equestrian images of Anita Palmer and the unique representations of <br>
Indian motifs by archaeologist-turned-artist Stephen Harmon.<br>
> The Summer Art Exhibition has a proud tradition of spotlighting <br>
professional artists as well as amateurs, and while the predominant <br>
theme is western art, a diverse and eclectic group of artists from <br>
throughout the region has responded to the opportunity to reach a new <br>
audience in a unique venue.<br>
> The art exhibition is the annual fund raiser for the Quahadi <br>
Society, Friends of Copper Breaks State Park. The exhibition is <br>
showing every day in the park headquarters/museum through August 25.<br>
