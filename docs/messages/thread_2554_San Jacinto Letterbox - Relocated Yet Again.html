                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I was visiting my Dad in Pasadena today, I decided to take him <br>
to San Jacinto Monument since he had not been in a long time.  While <br>
there I decided to check on my letterbox and it's a good thing I <br>
did.  The area had recently been clear-cut and my box was nowhere to <br>
be found.  As I was looking, a park maintenance man drove up and <br>
asked if I was looking for a Geocache.  I said yes, and he said his <br>
crew had found one there the other day and he had it in the shop if I <br>
wanted it.  So I followed him to the shop and retrieved my box, along <br>
with a real geocache that they had found nearby.  I asked if it was <br>
ok to hide the boxes in the park, and he said it was fine as far as <br>
he knew.  He described the are that the geocache was found, so I <br>
replaced it as best I could, wedging it in a tree crevice out of <br>
site.  As for mine, I did not think its previous spot was good any <br>
more, so I relocated to a more remote spot.  Hopefully it won't be <br>
too hard to get in summer.  This is the 4th hiding place for this box <br>
since I placed it in 2002, but at least it is still alive.  I can't <br>
believe how lucky I was that the box was not thrown away, and that my <br>
timing was perfect to get caught looking for it, which led to getting <br>
it back.  I'm still amazed that this park allows boxes while others <br>
don't, but maybe he did not represent the authorities.  Anyway, I <br>
have updated the clues, so reprint them if you plan to look for this <br>
box.<br>
