I'll bring Bailey's Irish cream again, for adults, and<br>
I'll also bring a seven layer dip and chips.<br>
<br>
Also, there was some talk awhile back about possibly<br>
meeting for supper the night before.  Is there still<br>
interest in that?  I had mentioned a cafe in Maydelle<br>
that serves great all-you-can-eat catfish, or I can<br>
ask some friends in Rusk what's good that's open in<br>
the evenings.  There are other restaurants in<br>
Jacksonville.  We probably need to let them know a<br>
group is coming if we go to the cafe...<br>

<div>I've been trying to figure out what I can bring since we'll be leaving Friday morning and letterboxing along the way all day Friday. So I've decided to bring pickles, olives and that sort of snacky thing so I don't poison anyone with salmonella or whatever.</div>
