I'll bring Bailey's Irish cream again, for adults, and<br/>
I'll also bring a seven layer dip and chips.<br/>
<br/>
Also, there was some talk awhile back about possibly<br/>
meeting for supper the night before.  Is there still<br/>
interest in that?  I had mentioned a cafe in Maydelle<br/>
that serves great all-you-can-eat catfish, or I can<br/>
ask some friends in Rusk what's good that's open in<br/>
the evenings.  There are other restaurants in<br/>
Jacksonville.  We probably need to let them know a<br/>
group is coming if we go to the cafe...<br/>

<div>I've been trying to figure out what I can bring since we'll be leaving Friday morning and letterboxing along the way all day Friday. So I've decided to bring pickles, olives and that sort of snacky thing so I don't poison anyone with salmonella or whatever.</div>
