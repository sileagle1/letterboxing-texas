I recently had an email through LBNA from someone who had found one of my boxes and they were first finder and got the little necklace I had left.  It was just a necklace made from a wine cork and put onto some help string, that's all, but it matched the stamp, so that's why I had made it.  or, more accurately, the stamp matched the wine cork!  anyway, it was fun to hear they got it and enjoyed it - they were the first finders after the box had been in place two full years, wow!<br>
