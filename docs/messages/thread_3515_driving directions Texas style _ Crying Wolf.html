We enjoyed "My Little Knife" that we found while at the T.A.L.E. in <br>
March. It was placed by WowMom and was in the same idea that Mark wrote <br>
about his lost coin. It however was listed on LBNA and Atlas Quest as a <br>
clue and not in a talk list. I guess that was the difference. If you go <br>
to the clue section of either of these sites, you expect a clue and not <br>
a real plea for help. We thought it was a clever clue and very detailed <br>
clue also. Thanks WowMom for doing this.<br>

</p><div>So clues and wolf cries aside, I really, really did lose one highly prized and dearly held lapiz earring last week while Amazin Racer and I were looking for Heaven Box 1 and Box 2. We were well on the road home when I realized it was gone. Amazin quickly pulled out her camera, remembering we had taken a photo in the bluebonnets between box finds. And sure enough there it was in the photo, which helped establish when I'd lost it. Knowing I was driving back in the area in a few days, we opted not to drive back that night. And I was also wondering how I could put out an alert without being mistaken for a hidden clue....(One of our greater l'boxing conundrums, she puzzled.) </div>
<div>But lo and behold, two days later, stopping at the sight, there was the lost jewel, clinging to a leaf awaiting rescue.</div>
<div>Just glad I didn't have to sing I'm a Little Teapot to get it back...</div>
