                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are exactly right.  My point was that if the box is not a Mystery <br/>
box and the clues are straight-forward, then having no directions <br/>
just seems lazy to me.  It doesn't mean I think every box should have <br/>
explicit directions, but it can sure ruin an outing if I spend all my <br/>
time driving around looking for a park I thought I had mapped out but <br/>
isn't where I thought it was.<br/>
<br/>
As MOF said, most of my clues give detailed directions, and that is <br/>
because in the early days when there were few boxers I wanted to make <br/>
sure any new boxer would have no trouble finding my boxes.  Now that <br/>
there are plenty of boxers and boxes, other types of clues work great <br/>
because there is something for everyone.  But old habits die hard and <br/>
I still usually give details.<br/>
<br/>
I do have to say that I'm all for hidden clues, like the one Mark <br/>
just did on the Big List.  But you have to be careful, as Mark found <br/>
out, because if you ask for help as part of your clues, some people <br/>
will take you literally and want to help.  It is the nature of <br/>
letterboxers to help and I wouldn't want to jeopardize this by <br/>
appearing to Cry Wolf.  The next person that really needs help might <br/>
not get it.<br/>

&gt; Ya know, what was really getting me about all those comments is <br/>
they were<br/>
&gt; responding as though the lack of direction was someone being <br/>
clever, and<br/>
&gt; that wasn't at all what Silver Eagle was referring to (or I don't <br/>
think it<br/>
&gt; was).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I still agree with Silver Eagle that the fun of letterboxing <br/>
happens once<br/>
&gt; your feet hit the ground in most cases (although I agree with Mark <br/>
and Randy<br/>
&gt; and all those folks who know that lack of driving directions CAN be <br/>
a part<br/>
&gt; of letterboxing) - not while you are driving around town trying to <br/>
get your<br/>
&gt; bearings in a broad way AND find a very specific place too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I wondered at times during that discussion if the difference of <br/>
perspective<br/>
&gt; was that we are from a big state and they are all from little <br/>
states.  You<br/>
&gt; could cross three New England states in the distance between DFW <br/>
and Houston<br/>
&gt; - so maybe in Texas, inexact driving directions are a lot worse <br/>
than they<br/>
&gt; are in smaller states.<br/>

We enjoyed "My Little Knife" that we found while at the T.A.L.E. in <br/>
March. It was placed by WowMom and was in the same idea that Mark wrote <br/>
about his lost coin. It however was listed on LBNA and Atlas Quest as a <br/>
clue and not in a talk list. I guess that was the difference. If you go <br/>
to the clue section of either of these sites, you expect a clue and not <br/>
a real plea for help. We thought it was a clever clue and very detailed <br/>
clue also. Thanks WowMom for doing this.<br/>
