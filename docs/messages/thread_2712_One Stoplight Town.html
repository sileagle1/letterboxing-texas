<br/>
Today after work I had a chance to check on One Stoplight Town.  <br/>
Right in front of the hiding place was a truck, trailer and two men--<br/>
planting shrubs.  After driving around the Dairy Queen to summon up <br/>
my courage, I stopped.  As I got out of the Jeep I recognized one of <br/>
the men as having lived across the street from my grandmother.  And <br/>
worse, he recognized me and called me by name.  What to do, what to <br/>
do?  I told them that some friends and I had been "playing a silly <br/>
treasure hunt game" and I had left something in the area that they <br/>
were digging and would like to claim it.  They said they hadn't found <br/>
anything, but when I mentioned that it was a camo-covered film <br/>
canister that had been hidden behind the lightpole, the man with the <br/>
shovel started scratching in the the dirt.  About an inch down, there <br/>
it was!  He picked it up, handed it to me.  I thanked them, smiled <br/>
sweetly and left.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think any aspects of letterboxing were compromised:  One of <br/>
the men is about 70 and there was at least one beer (and probably <br/>
more) being consumed, so the details of the encounter might be a bit  <br/>
hazy.  Tomorrow morning at the Shell station or Busy Bear over <br/>
coffee:  That crazy Connie!  What's she up to now?  She said she was <br/>
playing some sort of game with friends. What!?! Connie has friends? <br/>
<br/>
What this all boils down to is that "One Stoplight Town" will be <br/>
unavailable until the landscaping is finished, and even then I might <br/>
have to relocate it.<br/>
