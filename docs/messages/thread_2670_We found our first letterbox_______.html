                    <div class="plaintext-content">Friday afternoon my husband called and said he would be home early from <br>
work. We decided that the kids and I would meet him at the Abilene <br>
State Park and we would hunt for Silver Eagle's letterbox as well as <br>
the other one placed by Caleb. <br>
When we got there the main gate was closed so we did the self pay thing <br>
and went on in to find the park almost completely empty, which was <br>
perfect! We followed our clues and found the microbox. It was soooooo <br>
exciting to find it! We looked all over the log book at all the other <br>
people who had been there and found a spot to put our stamp and little <br>
comments. The log is almost full and was a little moist but we had no <br>
problem writing on it or stamping. The look in the kid's eyes when they <br>
found that box was priceless! My husband and were pretty exhilerated <br>
too! lol lol lol Afterwards we set off to find the other box SHOTB by <br>
Caleb. We had no luck finding it due to the fact that the clues were <br>
gone. We looked as best as we could in the general area but no luck. We <br>
were not disapointed though, we found one and now we can officially say <br>
we have been letterboxing! We can't wait to go again and to also plant <br>
our own boxes! <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am so happy my box was still there for you to find, especially <br>
since you live in a letterbox-poor area.  My experience has been that <br>
a person isn't really hooked on letterboxing until they actually find <br>
one, so hopefully this applies to you.  You will find that placing <br>
boxes will draw others to you, so give it a try and have fun!<br>
