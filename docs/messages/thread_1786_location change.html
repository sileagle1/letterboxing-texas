</p><div>If anyone has recently printed out the clues to the Give Peas a Chance LB, in Irving, Texas, I just wanted to let you know, due to high water last week, the box has been relocated as of today. I found the box still in the hollow log where it had been planted, but the log had washed into the middle of a field and the box was exposed! It was also full of water, but luckily the last folks who found the box before the flood had sealed the baggies well so the logbook and stamp were in perfect condition! (Thanks mater et regisfilia!) Anyway, if you've printed out these clues before today, you will need to print out the clues for the new location.</div>
