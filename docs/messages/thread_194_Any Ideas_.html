Now for my question...I am putting together a "Letterboxing starter <br>
kit" for my sister in law's birthday, I know she will love "boxing", <br>
but since she is far away I can't take her to get her hooked.  I'm <br>
including a stampbook, a personal stamp, a compass, and clues to <br>
boxes in her area (Michigan).  Any other ideas of what I could put <br>
in?  Thanks!  Mother of four<br>

PS  Have a great trip Silver Eagle!  Hope the weather cooperates!<br>

   To get on the list, all you have to do is email me your mailing <br>
address.  The PLB will be mailed hopefully on July 9th, so I need it <br>
before then.  It might take a while to get to you since it is going <br>
to other members also. Like Lucy said, just stamp in like a regular <br>
letterbox, and mail it on to the next person on the list.  You can <br>
count it as a Found, or some people make a separate PLB category.  <br>
It's up to you.<br>
<br>
As for your kit, it sounds like you have all the basics.  The only <br>
other thing you should add would be an ink pad.  She can add any <br>
personal extras later as she gets more experienced.<br>

Go ahead and put a pen in there, just in case<br>
How big is the box, can a can of OFF fit in there too?<br>
<br>
Our local dollar store has the walking sticks/canes, for a $1<br>
Maybe you can send on of those for poking around?<br>
<br>
We always carry a stick with a hocked end so we can pull stuff out of crevices!<br>
