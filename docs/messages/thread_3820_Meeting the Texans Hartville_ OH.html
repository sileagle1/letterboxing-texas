can see the photos on AQ.  <br/>
<br/>
The restaurant is an Amish one and quite large but through traffic <br/>
all day long.  <br/>
<br/>
We stamped..had folks looking at us kind of funny...then ate, and <br/>
decided that there would be a room at the library where we could <br/>
carry on and get to know one another.<br/>
<br/>
This little Meet N Greet...when I counted the feet and divided by 2 <br/>
turned out to be 22 of us!!  Whew..when you throw a party these OH <br/>
boxers come to welcome folks.<br/>
<br/>
We enjoyed meeting and even had 2 other newbies who hadn't been to an <br/>
event before either!  Young and old alike enjoyed the weather, the <br/>
food, the hiking and the laughing. <br/>
<br/>
Be sure you check out the pictures on AQ.  It will give you some <br/>
faces to put with the trailnames.  <br/>
