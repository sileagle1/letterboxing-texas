<div>The Frye Team is in Dallas waiting out Hurricane Rita and asked me to share 
this with the letterboxing group:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Just went and found Celtic Lions AWESOME Texas Bronze#1 SHAWNEE 
TRAIL.  The steer are incredible to look at and the stamp is just as 
great.  There were a lot of homeless people in the park but it was really 
in a place that wasnt too hard to fake it.   The reason I post..  
I did stamp the log but forgot to date it or anything.  If any of you are 
being adventureous and go there soon could you kindly date it for me?  Too 
much sun I guess as we had spent the morning at the Dallas Zoo. </div>
