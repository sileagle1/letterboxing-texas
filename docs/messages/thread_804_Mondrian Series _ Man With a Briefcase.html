I went looking for Art to stamp this morning in Ft Worth - first, to <br>
the Kimbell to refind the Mondrian series (I love those stamps <br>
that "build" a Mondrian print and I wanted to restamp it to send to my <br>
sister, PuddleSplasher, in CT).  Last time I had checked, most of the <br>
boxes were missing, but they were all there today and in excellent <br>
condition, although a little harder to find this time as Kantexan had <br>
warned - not to have them go missing again anytime soon!  I had figured <br>
that no one would be around, since museums are closed on Mondays, and I <br>
could crawl through the bushes as much as necessary without being <br>
observed, but landscapers work on Mondays mowing the lawn and testing <br>
sprinklers, which added to the challenge.   Not so lucky finding Man <br>
With a Briefcase today, though - a press conference was going on there <br>
with TV crews and a small crowd, and landscapers were setting out new <br>
summer annuals in the beds on the NE corner - right where I wanted to <br>
search for the LB! I trust they didn't discover it! Thanks, Kantexan, <br>
for my Monday morning Art Stamp experiences - and for the tip about the <br>
Asel Art Supply Store (I found it, and they had exactly what I was <br>
looking for!  Now, I just have to learn how to use it.)<br>

-TX2Chic,<br>
The pleasure was all mine!  I love carving and planting as much as I <br>
love finding!  Hopefully the groundscrew won't find the Man with <br>
Briefcase!  I was hopefully tricking enough in how I placed it that <br>
it will be safe.<br>
<br>
This is kind of related to the subject of art stamps.  Did y'all <br>
read about the renegade artist who "plants" his own artwork in art <br>
museums around the world?  Usually the museums figure it out <br>
immediately, but occasionally he gets away with it for a little <br>
while.  I can't remember his name but it was in the Star Telegram a <br>
couple of months ago.  He sounds like a Letterboxer at heart!  If it <br>
weren't for those pesky security cameras we could go nuts <br>
planting! ;)lol<br>
