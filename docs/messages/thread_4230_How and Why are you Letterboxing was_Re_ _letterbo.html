                    <html><body><p>Lori,<br/><br/>I'm so glad you shared that - I was thinking about her yesterday, about how I view her, and wondered how true to my view of her her bigger life was. We all see each other through a letterboxing lens, but I think over time we get a pretty good idea of the personality and character of the person behind the trail name (at least with those folks who contribute as much as Janet did). <br/>
<br/>Janet and I emailed privately fairly often and had agreed to make a road trip to El Paso to do Mike's Army Man hike with him when we had each lost 50 pounds. I had the feeling that once she committed to that, there was no way she was going to blow it off. <br/>
<br/>I have to confess I had to wonder about her when she first came onto this list - she was so full of enthusiasm that I had a feeling she was one of the many that come to letterboxing and get all pumped up, plant a bunch of boxes, and then bale out after a few months. Over time I came to believe that her verve and vitality was a part of life for her, that anything and anyone she embraced, she embraced with enthusiasm. What you say, Lori, confirms that.<br/>
<br/>The beauty of the internet is the flip side of its risk - we can come to communicate with folks online more personally than we do with the folks we see every day. Familiarity breeds complacency, I suppose, so we (the bigger we - people) don't "really" talk to each other face to face, but when we take the time to communicate by email, we are more deliberate in what we say. Geez...I don't know! Where I'm going with that is that I am a bit surprised by how strongly I felt her friendship and feel her loss since I basically only knew her through email and one brief meeting at a gathering, as though she were someone I knew well personally - but that's exactly how I feel about her!<br/>
<br/>Every time I read a personal email from her, I came away feeling better about life and the world around me, even if I was feeling pretty good about it already! Thing is, I don't think I'm alone in that - I'm betting that any of us who had direct communication with her feels the same way, because I know her list email always had a good effect on everyone. <br/>
<br/>I'm figuring she kept heaven up all night last night!<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Sat, Sep 12, 2009 at 11:26 PM, lori baker <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:loribaker2002@yahoo.com">loribaker2002@yahoo.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/>

<div>As I was sitting here tonight replaying in my mind all the memories I have of Janet I thought I would share...We were at work one night and I had seen Janet several times with all these manilla envelopes (postals I would later learn). I asked her to explain Letterboxing. After she spent most of the night explaining with the postals being the example and answering all of my repetitive questions I told her "ok, your just weird". On July 4th my family was wanting to get out of the house and I remembered my conversation with Janet from a couple of nights ago so I thought "what the heck". We went to Michaels and I bought 3 logbooks (one for me, one for each of my daughters) and 3 store bought stamps. I had already printed the clues so off we went. We had such a blast. She introduced me to the letterboxing community and I have been hooked ever since. When LTC's
 became the big thing on AQ we both talked about how stupid that was and we would never start "that". Well I started dabbling in them and the next thing I knew she was signing up for trackers left and right. Janet was a character ~ who else do we know that goes letterboxing in a limo, she was so excited that night that ALL of her family went and they had a GREAT night. Heck, just a couple of weeks ago she was telling me about her and her daughter Carrie got a wild hair and went boxing at 4am. When they got to the park a cop was sitting in the parking lot so what does she do ~ she rolls down the window, waves to him and yells "hi". Oh man I have so many good memories of Janet. I love you girl!</div>

<div>Hi, Buckysfirst. Just noticed you live in Colleyville. I lived there for 17 years before we moved to Connecticut for six years (where I discovered letterboxing) . Now we're back in Texas in McKinney. I see you signed up for the event in Denton at the end of the month. See you there.<br/>
<br/>Here's my story: I had an antique booth in a mall in Connecticut. Every weekend, (except in the winter) we'd go antiquing - tag sales, estate sales etc to find treasures for my booth. One gorgeous Saturday in July, I bought a pair of crystal lamps and the seller wrapped them for me in an issue of the Danbury Post newspaper. When I got home and was unwrapping them, I noticed an article by a reporter who had just gone letterboxing with his girlfriend in a forest a few miles from my house. After reading about his adventure, I went straight to the computer and checked out LBNA. Less than two hours later, my store-bought stamp, journal, ink pad, husband, black lab and
 I were on a trail heading for our first box. I lived on the Housatonic River surrounded by a state forest, and was surprised to learn there were letterboxes all around me. For the rest of the summer, I would spend at least three days a week letterboxing, but usually never go for more than two or three boxes in a day. Most of the boxes I'd search for were at the end of a long hike - which suited me perfectly. I'd justify my frequent letterboxing outings by stopping by some antique stores along the way and calling it "business". Five things CT has a plethora of: letterboxes, forests, antique stores, jeeps and black labs. I was in heaven.<br/>

&gt;<br/>&gt; I'm new to
 letterboxing; just started this summer. I actually heard about letterboxing on a knitting podcast. My nieces were scheduled to come for thier 1st visit in 5 years this summer and I wanted to find an activity that they would enjoy. So, I did more research on it. Once they arrived I took my parents, my sister and her 3 girls letterboxing almost daily. We found ~15 boxes and discovered beautiful places near our home (of 40 years) that we had never known about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>&gt; My nieces are now back in Florida letterboxing there, and my mother and I are continuing the fun here. The people are great, the places beautiful and the stamps are a blast.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Thanks to everyone who helps to make this pasttime great.<br/>
