                    <div class="plaintext-content">Perhaps the series could be called something like Texas<br/>
Trivia, and each box would be the next number in the series<br/>
(e.g. Texas Trivia #1, #2, etc).  That way each box would<br/>
have the name of the series in its name.  The only other<br/>
way would be to post one clue for Texas Trivia Series containing<br/>
X number of boxes and keep adding to the clue as more boxes<br/>
are added.  You would be the owner of the clue and have to<br/>
update it as people send you clues for boxes they hide.<br/>
Well, I'm off to the Hill Country for 10 days so will be<br/>
out of touch for a while.  I hope to do some letterboxing<br/>
along the way and will make a report when I get back.  Have<br/>
a fun July 4th!<br/>
