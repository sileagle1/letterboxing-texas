am the planter of doomed boxes, I would not attempt to do this <br>
myself. I have a list of the really big stuff in Texas, each one <br>
worthy of a letterbox. I have a question/riddle for each. Anyone who <br>
knows the answer to the question and/or lives nearby could place a <br>
box, and we'll keep the series of boxes together, ya' think? <br>
<br>
Here goes number 1: What is the tallest statue in the state of Texas?<br>
<br>

P.S. Does anyone know how we could organize the series together, <br>
like Silver Eagle's bird series... (hint, hint)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Perhaps the series could be called something like Texas<br>
Trivia, and each box would be the next number in the series<br>
(e.g. Texas Trivia #1, #2, etc).  That way each box would<br>
have the name of the series in its name.  The only other<br>
way would be to post one clue for Texas Trivia Series containing<br>
X number of boxes and keep adding to the clue as more boxes<br>
are added.  You would be the owner of the clue and have to<br>
update it as people send you clues for boxes they hide.<br>
Well, I'm off to the Hill Country for 10 days so will be<br>
out of touch for a while.  I hope to do some letterboxing<br>
along the way and will make a report when I get back.  Have<br>
a fun July 4th!<br>
