<br/>
HUBBY: So my wife is driving separately because she wants to go letterboxing after the games.<br/>
<br/>
COACH: What the HECK is letterboxing?!?!<br/>
<br/>
HUBBY: It's where people carve stamps, put them in boxes, and hide the boxes for other people to find.<br/>
<br/>
COACH: I have never heard of such a thing!  Is it kinda like a cult?<br/>
<br/>
HUBBY: LOL...I guess it sorta is like a cult... They have these secret meetings (gatherings) and take food (GOOD food, I might add), use codes to identify each other (Which way is North?), identify themselves by an alias, use terms only THEY know the meaning of, and then hide more boxes for only each other to find.<br/>
<br/>
At this point, the coach turns to the team mom to ask her if my hubby is feeding him a line of bull, when she responds with "I have actually heard of this before.  It's similar to Geocaching."<br/>
<br/>
Hmmm...never quite thought of it like that!!!<br/>
