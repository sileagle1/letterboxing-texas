                    <html><body><div>I'm glad you decided not to change your name, Stargazer.  I've got a history of looking for, being frustrated for not finding (esp. FWAS), delight in finding some of yours on this year's trip to Texas, being astounded by the fact that some them were left standing, sealed but out in the open (Whelk especially since it was a group project) without a single leaf, twig, doggie doo or anything (not that I'm recommending covering a box with doggie doo) to conceal the letterboxes that should be hidden to the casual or interested eye.</div> <div> </div> <div>Up here where I live, crowds hitting the boxes have resulted in many losses, due to attention getting activity and by poor replacement.  Parents of some of the crowds have bragged, despite having "Be discreet" stated 4 times in the clues, "Discreet at the mall, we were not!!" followed by laughter.  The kids chimed in, "We don't know how to do that!"</div> <div> </div> <div>I take that to mean
 that they won't do that.</div> <div> </div> <div>Hence, some of the better boxes - usually those donated by others for me to plant, which is one of my favorite parts of this hobby - now have a P5/F50.  I feel badly that I'm excluding people, but by the same token, I won't come across one of my boxes sitting right on the middle of the trail with a note in the logbook "Too many spiders!" but no note via email that they didn't rehide it.  This was not a case of an animal dragging, before you guys start to look for possibilities.</div> <div> </div> <div>In this latest bit here, I can certainly see both sides and agree with both.  It's tough when you're new and you think you're being judged, especially unfairly because you haven't done anything yet.  On the other hand, a lot of time - more than many people would believe - goes into the choices of image, carving, placement, and upkeep.  Somes its hard not to be objective when trying to give
 judicious advice.  I'm one of those that people think I'm bring rude when I ask them to rehide well, in terms I think way too soft, but evidently, is taken much meaner that I wanted it to.  Really though, don't leave corners of boxes sticking out or sticks sticking out and such to 'help the next person.'</div> <div> </div> <div>Anyway, I'm being verbose, which rhymes with my last name, incidently and probably Barefoot Lucy is casting her moderator wary eye at this message, shaking her LB finger at me.  ;-)</div> <div> </div> <div>MoWizLiz</div> <div> </div> <div>Sum total, I'm glad you decided not to change your name.  Do some less labor intensive boxes that if they go missing, then that's okay too.  Everyone needs the learning curve!   </div> <div> </div> <div>hahaha laughing about knowing many of you could never let loose of a stamp or logbook that was less than
 perfect.  It's making me giggle, the masochisty me.</div> <div> </div> <div>I'm going to end this message eventually, but Dang on The Czech Stop.  Yummy kolaches....  I haven't gotten that box either.</div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><br/><br/><b><i>Sandy Milfeld &lt;pugapalooza@sbcglobal.net&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div>Hoppers, you are absolutely right. 100 is too big.

Thanks for your reply, MWL.  You make me feel better.  The Czech Stop has a restriction of <br/>
P5, F50, so you are absolutely fine on that one with your hundreds of finds!  The logbook <br/>
looks terrible right, now, anyway. I'll be fixing it up Sunday, grabbing some kolaches, and <br/>

If you put P &amp; F restrictions on your boxes at AQ, it is better to<br/>
remove the link if they're linked from LBNA.  People get a weird error<br/>

<div>Puzzles and mystery clues - I really like that method.  It also adds 
to the planter's task, since you have to create the puzzle or mystery clues for 
someone else to solve, but I've also discovered that even the simplest form 
of mystery clues or cipher or puzzle or riddle requires more commitment from 
finders, and also, apparently, more serious intent and care.  </div>

<p>Well, because of veiled threats, I'm placing F and P restrictions on <br/>my 
  clues. I hate doing that. I really think it cheats new boxers. <br/>But I don't 
  see any other recourse, short of pulling them all and <br/>starting over with a 
  new identity.<br/><br/>So, how much is enough on an F count restriction? How 
  much is too <br/>much? Is an F restriction of 25 too small? Is an F count of 
  100 too <br/>big?<br/><br/>(I'm restricting them to those that have at least one 
  plant. So, if <br/>you don't have one planted, but want my clues, email me and 
  I'll hook <br/>you up.)<br/><br/>And what do I do about LbNA? There's no way to 
  place restrictions <br/>there. Should I just pull them from LbNA 
  altogether?<br/><br/>SG<br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

<div>You're so right! By the time I finally solved The Scarlet Pimpernel and Surrender Dorothy boxes, I approached those boxes likethey were the Holy Grail! I love mystery boxes. Right now I am trying to wrap my brain around Gryzzled Gryphon's new box, but it's still getting the best of me! Good one, GG!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Just an idea to throw out there...but instead of putting <br/>
restrictions on boxes why not add a line to the clue that <br/>
says "groups of 5 or more please contact placer before <br/>
attempting"....this might be an only option on lbna...<br/>
I'd also like to throw out there that as fairly new boxers we seem <br/>
to enjoy the find more than the plant.  But at the same time, we <br/>
have no plants yet, and have just under 30 finds.  We box as <br/>
husband, wife, and 3 year old daughter.  We are uncomfortable in <br/>
doing a plant as of yet and our actually planning on attending the <br/>
March get together and hopefully getting tips and ideas from more <br/>
experienced planters and carvers before tackling that part of the <br/>
sport.<br/>
It would be nice if there were more frequent gatherings where we <br/>
could learn from others but time is hard on everyone.<br/>
Last note, as someone who does this with such a young child yes we <br/>
sometimes find it difficult.  I often stay behind while my husband <br/>
goes off hiking and hunting.  It's always nice if there is a cool <br/>
playground or walking trail to keep her occupied but many a times <br/>
her and I just sit in the truck while he brings it back.<br/>
On that note too though, we were recently the last to find a box <br/>
before a group of kids found it and did not rehide it where they <br/>
found it so it was MIA for a few days before the owner went out and <br/>
found it.  We both felt very bad that these kids had found it just 2 <br/>
days after we had been there.  This was one where daughter and I <br/>
stayed behind but I also know my husband.  He is a very experienced <br/>
Scouter and takes the Leave No Trace to heart.  I know he replants <br/>
too well sometimes.  Boys will boys and will dig in the most <br/>
unlikely of places.  You just never know.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>Don't rush to make your first plant.  Savor a few boxes along the way and attune yourself to what you like and don't like about the boxes you find.  One of these days, you'll find yourself with the itch AND the ability and you'll know it's time to plant!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You didn't mention what area you are in, but in some areas there are fairly frequent gatherings.  The DFW area, the Houston area, and Northeast Texas all have gatherings a few times a year.    I don't think there are any on the books before the annual gathering though - we all just had one recently.  At any rate, you'll see new gatherings listed here!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You mentioned your husband is an experienced Scouter.  Just wondering - what's his background?</div>
