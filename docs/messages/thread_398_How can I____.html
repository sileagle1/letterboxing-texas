You're doing everything right, though - someone on this Texas list may be<br/>
able to help you as far as the status of "missing boxes". Have you looked at<br/>
SeaDove's Atlas?<br/>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi<br/>
<br/>
I love that site to help plan trips around Texas, because you can search by<br/>
city or county and see clusters of boxes to judge proximity.<br/>

*whispers* If you plant them, they will come.<br/>
<br/>
The people I went to the coast with last weekend are from San <br/>
Antonio and would probably jump at any boxes you would plant.  We go <br/>
up there from time to time and would hit them as well.<br/>
<br/>
For those missing boxes, I would contact the placer to get more <br/>
details.  Someone could report a box as missing when they just <br/>
overlooked it... I know I've done that.  If the placer hasn't <br/>
confirmed that it is not there, I think it would still be worth a <br/>
look.  If you don't find it, no surprises, but if you do, then that <br/>
would make it all the more fun.<br/>

Unfortunately, many of the boxes in San Antonio have<br/>
been reported missing, but I would contact the placer<br/>
to find out current status and ask if they plan to<br/>
replace them.  However, you are lucky to live so<br/>
close to Austin, which has many boxes in town and<br/>
in the surrounding area.  Also, there are several<br/>
boxes just to the south of you.  Part of the allure<br/>
of letterboxing is getting to see places you might<br/>
not have heard of before and never would have gone to.<br/>
Just consider it a good excuse to take a day trip to <br/>
enjoy the wonders of Texas!<br/>
