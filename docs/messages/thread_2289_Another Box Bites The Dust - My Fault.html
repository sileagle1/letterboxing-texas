&gt; I think we're all going to be hearing from officials more frequently <br/>
in the<br/>
&gt; near future. AQ seems to try to protect clues from being casually <br/>
found by<br/>
&gt; internet browsers - don't know how effective it is - but I'm not <br/>
sure that<br/>
&gt; LbNA does the same thing. <br/>
