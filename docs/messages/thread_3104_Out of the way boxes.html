<div>I'm with the other 
ladies on this one.  There is nothing like finding that cool spot in the 
middle of no where because of a box.    One of my favorite boxing 
trips of all time was way back when I was Mother of Four, and the only boxes in 
the whole state were placed by SE and BB.  The kids and I took a trip up 
through Waco to Dinosaur Valley, stopped at the Confederate Battlegrounds on the 
way back, and spent an entire weekend having a blast and finding **gasp**4 
boxes.  But we saw that great suspension bridge in Waco, a bunch of baby 
javelinas, dinosaur tracks, and each and every one of us slipped and fell in the 
river.  Keep planting where you want to plant, and the people that do find 
your boxes will be awfully glad you did.  By the way, I read your clues to 
"The Home Run That Never Was" yesterday, and I think that is the best baseball 
story I have ever heard.  If I can ever get myself out to Midland, I know 
which box will be the first I find!  MO5</div></body></html>

<div>Oh, Lucy, don't you 
know ANY baseball game is a good baseball game? (Unless, of course, St. Louis is 
winning)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is one great 
story, though.  My 11 year old ball lover said, "Why doesn't anything cool 
like that ever happen to me?  That would make a good book!"  I think 
Boots Tex winning boots makes the story even better.</div>
