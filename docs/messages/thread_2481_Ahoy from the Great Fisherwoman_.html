                    <html><body><div>Just got home from fishing with a few of my closest friends and their families.  We took the pack to the Athens Fresh Water Fishery for the tour, the dive show, and an afternoon of fishing for trout.  When I'm doing Cub Scout stuff, I try real hard not to be too girly, but I kept catching myself saying, as someone was reeling in another trout, "oooohhh....he's so pretty!"  Thankfully, I'm not squeamish about taking fish off the hook or baiting hooks and I can cast with the best of 'em, so I didn't totally ruin my credibility as a Cubmaster.  Wind-blistered faces, stinky hands, and muddy clothes, along with a catch of 25 trout and we are home.  I sure am thinking that's a park that deserves a letterbox, so I made friends with the curator and I think I'm gonna start working on my trout stamp to take back when I go back to Athens for my songwriters workshop in early February.

<div>Got that right! My son-in-law is in Seattle with the Cowboys until sometime in the middle of the night tonight, so my daughter and I took the grand kids to the Ft Worth Zoo today. Because it was only in the 40/50's today, we planned to only stay for about an hour or so, but it ended up being great weather, and we spent about four hours there. The animals were frisky (the actual animals, not my grandchildren), so we were greatly entertained. There had been a letterbox hidden there (Detroit Tigers), but the bushes had been trimmed and cleaned out, so the box was gone. Anyway, our mission was accomplished. The "babies" were worn out and will be asleep by the time she gets them back to Frisco. I may last for a quarter or two of the game before I am asleep too. You're right though, fresh air does wonders for the soul.</div>
