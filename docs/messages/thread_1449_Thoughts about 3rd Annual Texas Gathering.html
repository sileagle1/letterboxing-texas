*****My thoughts exactly.  It doesn't make sense for<br>
Silver Eagle to foot the bill AND do the work - at the<br>
past two gatherings, he's set out a cup for donations<br>
and I think he's broken even each time, but everyone<br>
needs to come prepared to kick in whatever they feel<br>
they can afford or that they think is appropriate.<br>
 <br>
Silver Eagle is far too gracious to bring this up and<br>
I'll bet he would not ever tell us what it really<br>
costs him, but I think this is a good opportunity to<br>
remind everyone that there are certain expenses that<br>
go into putting a gathering together, and if we all<br>
chip in a little, no one has to pay a lot. <br>
<br>
Also, if he knows he can count on our donations, he<br>
doesn't have to worry as much about keeping the<br>
facility cost down.  When you consider that we need a<br>
facility that will accomodate a minimum of 50 (and<br>
this is a bare minimum in my opinion - we had 50 at<br>
the last gathering and we've grown by about 25% in the<br>
past year) AND we really need electricity, AND it's<br>
really best to have a covered area, we have a lot of<br>
requirements withouth throwing on the cost ceiling as<br>
well.<br>
<br>
Now, that said, please understand that I in no way<br>
support a per person charge because there may well be<br>
some folks that will be straining their budgets just<br>
to be there, much less to donate, and we certainly<br>
wouldn't want them to exclude themselves because of an<br>
expected donation.  But if we each give what we can,<br>
all will be well!<br>
<br>
Lucy<br>
