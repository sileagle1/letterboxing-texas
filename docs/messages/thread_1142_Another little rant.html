                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, my hubby made a liar out of me. We went boxing<br/>
yesterday when I said we'd probably wait until the<br/>
weather cooles down.<br/>
<br/>
We went to a relatively new box and had a nice(?) long<br/>
walk. When we got to the box, we were a little<br/>
disappointed. I know, I'm picky -already- about<br/>
quality carved stamps. We were tired after that long<br/>
hot walk. We felt it the walk would have been worth it<br/>
if the stamp were more artistic. I know I'll probably<br/>
get flack for this, but we were hot and tired so don't<br/>
be too harsh on me.<br/>
<br/>
FW Botanical gardens... We went a few weeks ago to try<br/>
to find the one in the japanese gardens. I'm sure we<br/>
were looking in the right place, but the box was<br/>
missing. I just contacted baby bear thru the website.<br/>
But if someone here who is nearby and found the box<br/>
already ... wanna check it?<br/>
<br/>
We also found, yesterday, the slumbering family tree.<br/>
I loved the find and the tree itself. So no compaints<br/>
on this one. We just love the botanical gardens. I'm<br/>
planning to plant one in another garden or another<br/>
area within the bg's the next time we go.<br/>
<br/>
I decided to check on Polly's Paws as well. I wanted<br/>
to see who had come by and guess who ... GG (among the<br/>
others)! The box was there but it wasn't covered up<br/>
and it just looked like someone just tossed it into<br/>
it's place. I mean, I wasn't very close and the box<br/>
was pretty obvious. I replaced it UNDER my debris I<br/>
had previously collected. Other than that, the box was<br/>
still sealed pretty good. We just had a storm and<br/>
nothing was wet or wilted.<br/>
<br/>
So I want to stress too, PLEASE recover very well!<br/>
<br/>
My 2c.<br/>
