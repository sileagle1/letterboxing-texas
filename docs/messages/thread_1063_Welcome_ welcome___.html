okay, I admit it - I was trying to guess who the Gryzzled One might be<br>
;-)!!!), when I stumbled upon the name of a new letterboxer in our area. I<br>
had written to invite them to join this list when they logged in one of our<br>
CelticLion boxes last week. <br>
This is so exciting - I very well remember writing to Catpawz and Tx2Chics<br>
when they first reported finding our boxes - and now they are both<br>
letterboxing teams on this list that we consider friends! (And the bonus is<br>
that they hide WONDERFUL boxes!)<br>
It's really fun and gratifying when a name in your logbook suddenly becomes<br>
someone you'd look forward to having coffee with!<br>
<br>
We're growing by one great letterboxer at a time!<br>
