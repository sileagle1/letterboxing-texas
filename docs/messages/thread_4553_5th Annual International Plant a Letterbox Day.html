<br/>
It is 5th Annual International Plant a Letterbox Day.  The description reads:  We came up with the idea for this day in 2006. At first it was a to see if we could break the AQ record for the number of boxes posted on AQ in one day. And we did! Now we just celebrate for the fun of it! The idea is to get out there on the event day and plant letterboxes in your area. (If you need to plant them the weekend before the event or several days before, we understand). Then post the clues on AQ. So, it's not really a get together, "face-to-face" event. But more of a get together "in-spirit" kind of thing. Just think of all those letterboxers out at the same time on an international planting spree!<br/>
<br/>
I hope Texas is well-represented for this event!<br/>
