<br/>
   Way back in 2001 Eoghan and the Pumpkin Princess were living in Austin and active in geocaching and letterboxing, placing some of the earliest caches and boxes in the state.  A few years later they moved to Colorado, got married, and slowly faded away from our notice, leaving all those Texas caches and boxes behind.  Several people in the Austin area stepped up and formally adopted the caches but the letterbox clues were on eoghan's personal website so those were less formally looked after locally.<br/>
<br/>
   At some point a few years ago Eoghan's website disappeared so the clues were formally lost.<br/>
<br/>
   Recently, I found that Silver Eagle had posted the clues to Eoghan's Lost Pines letterbox in the file archives of this mailing list, noting that Lost Pines was the oldest letterbox in Texas.  This gave me the idea to try to resurrect the rest of Eoghan's boxes and recreate the clues as best I could. <br/>
<br/>
   I started with a visit to Bastrop State Park to try to locate the four O-Knots boxes.  I was able to locate #1, #3, and #4 from memory and a partial paper copy of the original clues although the some information was no longer valid.  I took #4 home with me as it needed work and it sat in my garage for a while.<br/>
<br/>
   Today I returned to Bastrop and my project of resurrection.  #4 is back in place near where it was originally but I have not been able to locate #2.  I have made two recent visits now and just cannot locate the tree where the box was placed.<br/>
<br/>
   Here is where I need guidance.  Should I publish the clues to these boxes in the archive files of this mailing list, on Atlas Quest, on LbNA?  How should I credit Eoghan as the originator of the series?<br/>

I would ask his wishes first of all, if he is reachable. If he isn't reachable, I would follow the path he took. and post the clues as he posted them (they are, by the way, listed in the basement on LBNA). As to crediting him, you could put his name in the title - Eoghan's O-Knots #4. OR - you could credit him in the first line of the clues. <br/>
<br/>There are some boxes that call for special treatment. Sort of "legacy boxes". I think these are some of those boxes. If it were my decision only, I think they should be kept off the major clue repositories and held as WOM, But that's my .02<br/>
<br/>Thanks very much for revamping those boxes. They have always had sort of a mystique about them. <br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">First of all, thanks very much for helping to keep our TX Letterboxing heritage alive, and who better than someone who was actually participating during those early days.  I did receive an email from Eoghan at least 2 years ago, but I have since cleaned out my archives and don't have it anymore.  At one time I did contact him about his clues and received a link to his new website, but now I can only find it in the archives, which I put in the Links section of this List:<br/>
<br/>
http://web.archive.org/web/20040131120839/http://www.sharawadgi.com/letterbox/<br/>
<br/>
It works, but says some of the boxes are missing (e.g. Mayfield and Wraith, both of which I found many years ago), which may not be true.  Back before he sent the new link, I asked permission to post his Lost Pines clues in the Files section of this List and he agreed, so posting any other ones there should be ok, too.  That way you could make any changes needed, give credit to Eoghan, and they would serve as a backup if the website gets lost again.  Maybe the letterboxers in the Austin area could look for them and verify if they still exist.  I still have the notes from when I found the O-Knots many years ago, but not detailed enough to tell which tree to look at for box #2.  Maybe next time I'm out that way I'll try to find it.<br/>
<br/>
Lou, I see you are signed up for TALE8.  I sure hope you can make it and stay for the campfire so we can all here more stories from the early days of TX Letterboxing!<br/>

I found the clues to the Lost Pines box on the Wayback Machine, in 2007 I believe, and because of the way it was hidden, it looked like it could last forever.  Those are the only two of Eoghan's boxes we've found, but I would very much like to find the others if they are available some day.  Thanks for making that possible, PI Joe.<br/>

&gt; First of all, thanks very much for helping to keep our TX Letterboxing heritage alive, and who better than someone who was actually participating during those early days.  I did receive an email from Eoghan at least 2 years ago, but I have since cleaned out my archives and don't have it anymore.  At one time I did contact him about his clues and received a link to his new website, but now I can only find it in the archives, which I put in the Links section of this List:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; http://web.archive.org/web/20040131120839/http://www.sharawadgi.com/letterbox/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It works, but says some of the boxes are missing (e.g. Mayfield and Wraith, both of which I found many years ago), which may not be true.  Back before he sent the new link, I asked permission to post his Lost Pines clues in the Files section of this List and he agreed, so posting any other ones there should be ok, too.  That way you could make any changes needed, give credit to Eoghan, and they would serve as a backup if the website gets lost again.  Maybe the letterboxers in the Austin area could look for them and verify if they still exist.  I still have the notes from when I found the O-Knots many years ago, but not detailed enough to tell which tree to look at for box #2.  Maybe next time I'm out that way I'll try to find it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lou, I see you are signed up for TALE8.  I sure hope you can make it and stay for the campfire so we can all here more stories from the early days of TX Letterboxing!<br/>

I was just getting to know about Eoghan's boxes when the website's lease went out.  I was able to go the caches and copy most of his clues into a word document. Who ever decides the best place to host them I can give them all of the original text.  I don't know what happened to my copied of the Mayfield box text though. I must have deleted it out of the document after I got the box, but I do know of one other leterboxer whom I gave a hard copy of the original document to.  They might still have Mayfield's original text.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found all 4 of these back when I first started letterboxing, but that park has changed alot since then.  I beleive part of it burned.  I will look through my old notes and see if I can find anything to help in locating it again.  I know one of the boxes I had a hard time finding the first time, and another (near the lake side) took me through some rough country.   Anyway, more to come if I can find it.<br/>

&gt;    Pull up a chair and I will tell you a story.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Way back in 2001 Eoghan and the Pumpkin Princess were living in Austin and active in geocaching and letterboxing, placing some of the earliest caches and boxes in the state.  A few years later they moved to Colorado, got married, and slowly faded away from our notice, leaving all those Texas caches and boxes behind.  Several people in the Austin area stepped up and formally adopted the caches but the letterbox clues were on eoghan's personal website so those were less formally looked after locally.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    At some point a few years ago Eoghan's website disappeared so the clues were formally lost.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Recently, I found that Silver Eagle had posted the clues to Eoghan's Lost Pines letterbox in the file archives of this mailing list, noting that Lost Pines was the oldest letterbox in Texas.  This gave me the idea to try to resurrect the rest of Eoghan's boxes and recreate the clues as best I could. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    I started with a visit to Bastrop State Park to try to locate the four O-Knots boxes.  I was able to locate #1, #3, and #4 from memory and a partial paper copy of the original clues although the some information was no longer valid.  I took #4 home with me as it needed work and it sat in my garage for a while.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Today I returned to Bastrop and my project of resurrection.  #4 is back in place near where it was originally but I have not been able to locate #2.  I have made two recent visits now and just cannot locate the tree where the box was placed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;    Here is where I need guidance.  Should I publish the clues to these boxes in the archive files of this mailing list, on Atlas Quest, on LbNA?  How should I credit Eoghan as the originator of the series?<br/>
