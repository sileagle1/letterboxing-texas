Thanks, Joy. The article (minus any pictures) showed up just fine - <br>
very neat, not messy at all. I had been searching all over the <br>
internet and couldn't find anything, so came back here to check, and <br>
saw that you had copied and pasted the article. Thanks. :)<br>
<br>
So, the idea in the article, I guess, is: "Money left at graveside <br>
goes back to the coins left with the dead in ancient Greece to pay <br>
Charon, ferryman over the River Styx -- the price of transport to <br>
the Underworld. And then there's the Jewish tradition of putting a <br>
small rock on the gravestone to mark one's visit. Leaving a small <br>
remembrance is common in many cultures." But I don't know... This is <br>
an old Catholic Polish Cemetery, and looking around as best I could <br>
on my rush out of the cemetery, I didn't see any coins or anything <br>
unusual on any other graves. I just don't think the 'River Styx' <br>
thing would be observed there. So, I am still baffled. And the money <br>
was not really, really old from what I saw on top of the pile - just <br>
ordinary, modern day nickles and pennies....on a really old grave. <br>
Still, maybe it was just a simple 'remembrance' in sympathy for the <br>
loss of a child. <br>
<br>
I didn't have a minute to spare today, but what I should have done <br>
was stop in the Panna Maria museum/visitor center and ask the ladies <br>
there. So if anyone else remembers to do so when you go for that <br>
letterbox, maybe you'll check with them. If anyone does, please <br>
report back to the 'inquiring minds' here. ;)   <br>
<br>
Also, now that I think about it, the last time I was at the old <br>
Helena Mexican cemetery (very near Panna Maria), I explored all <br>
around and looked at all the headstones and didn't see any coins at <br>
all there. <br>

Curiousity got the better of me, and I called the visitor's center <br>
this morning, but the only lady who was there, said she had no idea. <br>
She had never seen such a thing, although she did say that she had <br>
heard of 'little children leaving a teddy bear on a brother or <br>
sister's grave'. She said that she visits the cemetery quite often, <br>
but had never seen that, and only attends to her family's <br>
gravesites. She said that she would ask the other visitor center <br>
volunteers when she sees them. <br>
<br>
So then today, I asked a few ladies I was working with, and they had <br>
never heard of it either. <br>
<br>
Part of my puzzlement comes from the fact that it is modern day <br>
money (I think.) on a very old grave. I don't remember the date on <br>
the tombstone, (1800's???) but I wouldn't think there would be <br>
anyone alive now who would have known the child. So to me, that <br>
somewhat rules out the 'remembrance token' thing.<br>

I found out when I spent a summer in Matagorda that it's a custom to <br>
leave sea shells on the gravestones of the sailors and shrimpers.  <br>
But have never heard anything about leaving coins. <br>
