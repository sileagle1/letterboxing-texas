the tasty treats on Thanksgiving day, so I just gave up and fell asleep on the

check for letterboxes.  There was one in the entire country, but <br/>
Flash Dreamer planted two for us to find while we're here, so we <br/>
have found three so far.  Also, we will be planting two before we <br/>
leave, so hopefully there will be 5 here when you come.  By the way, <br/>
Barefoot Lucy, the Italian mosquitoes did show up.  They are the <br/>
ones that planted the first and second boxes in Italy, and they are <br/>
really cool.  Check them out: they're called "On the Rim" and "Old <br/>
World Charm" and are listed on LbNA (International).<br/>

My mom and daughter only bought stuff for themselves. It always depends on what is on sale for me. This year it was 600 count sheets at a steal. I can't wait to use them.

When they say no straws, they mean it. Don't even play, I used a straw after getting mine pulled and I've never been in so much pain in my life. Natural childbirth was less painful (well at least you get a bundle of joy from the pain). My dentist was so upset with me, he almost didn't prescribe pain meds for it.
