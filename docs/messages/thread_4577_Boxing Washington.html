                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had a nice day letterboxing in Washington County today (one box was in Fayette County).

It was hot to be sure, but most of the boxes were in cemeteries and historic parks and so were mostly easy finds.

&gt; LSQ and I are braving the heat tomorrow to find some new letterboxes that have been planted in Washington County this year, most by Baby Bear, Silver Eagle and Mousepie. I've heard of a couple of those guys, but I'm not familiar with Mouspie. BB has a new series of boxes called "Immigrants of Texas Series" that sound intriguing to me, so we'll check them out.<br/>

Well, it's too late anyway.  We were in Brenham yesterday but back home today waiting for a mysterious lb'er to come around.  Who knows what mischief he's up to today?  Yesterday we were hunting a lot of Baby Bear boxes in cemeteries (he seems to be obsessed with cemeteries lately for some reason) and kept seeing a flash of red (with white hearts?) hovering around his hiding places, like they're haunted or something.  Strange.  One of his boxes was being guarded by a Baby Deer (really!) We had to shoo it away to get to the tree where the box was hiding.  We also saw a grey fox in a little nature park in Burton.<br/>
