OK, just want to ask around . . .<br/>
<br/>
I'd really like to have the event during spring break (Mar 19, 2005)<br/>
but what holds me back is the gathering in Texas on the same date.<br/>
If anyone is wanting to come from Texas, that would be awesome and we<br/>
can keep the date April 2. However, if no one responds from Texas or<br/>
otherwise about preferring April 2 for some reason or another, I<br/>
think I will change the date to Mar 19th. Everybody please let me<br/>
know.<br/>

if there is a date conflict, but we may well wind up<br/>
at your event if it's on a different date; HOWEVER,<br/>
don't schedule around us - we've got a lot of<br/>
different things that may pop up between now and then<br/>
preventing us from attending anyway.  March/April is a<br/>
very busy time of year for my family and I've had to<br/>
defend March 19th vigorously already-I'll try to<br/>
defend a second date too, but it might be tough!  <br/>
<br/>
Do what makes you Oklahoma people happiest, and it<br/>
will be a bonus for us in Texas if we are lucky enough<br/>
to be able to attend your gathering too.<br/>
