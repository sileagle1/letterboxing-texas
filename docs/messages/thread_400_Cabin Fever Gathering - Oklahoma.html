OK, just want to ask around . . .<br>
<br>
I'd really like to have the event during spring break (Mar 19, 2005)<br>
but what holds me back is the gathering in Texas on the same date.<br>
If anyone is wanting to come from Texas, that would be awesome and we<br>
can keep the date April 2. However, if no one responds from Texas or<br>
otherwise about preferring April 2 for some reason or another, I<br>
think I will change the date to Mar 19th. Everybody please let me<br>
know.<br>

Oklahoma gathering is on a different date, we would try to attend. One of<br>
our kids is in Denton, and I just talked to him about driving up to OK with<br>
us. Of course we don't want or expect you to plan around us, because April<br>
is a long time off and plans change!<br>
My free advice (which is worth every penny!) would be to hold it on whatever<br>
date works best for you OK letterboxers!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Same with me and my crew - we'll go to the Texas event<br>
if there is a date conflict, but we may well wind up<br>
at your event if it's on a different date; HOWEVER,<br>
don't schedule around us - we've got a lot of<br>
different things that may pop up between now and then<br>
preventing us from attending anyway.  March/April is a<br>
very busy time of year for my family and I've had to<br>
defend March 19th vigorously already-I'll try to<br>
defend a second date too, but it might be tough!  <br>
<br>
Do what makes you Oklahoma people happiest, and it<br>
will be a bonus for us in Texas if we are lucky enough<br>
to be able to attend your gathering too.<br>
