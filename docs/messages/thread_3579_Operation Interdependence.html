am going to be asking other people I know to join with our family in <br/>
donating so the impact will be bigger.  Just wanted to let everyone <br/>
know in honor of the holiday.  I guess you could say we could plant <br/>
boxes in honor of our military and SEND boxes in their honor as <br/>
well!!  (there, I did get letterboxing in here afterall!!  lol!!)<br/>
