                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our group is pretty laid-back and open to talk about just about <br/>
anything pertaining to letterboxing, and sometimes NOT pertaining to <br/>
letterboxing.  Feel free to jump in and begin posting as soon as you <br/>
get this message back. I do ask, though, that you post an <br/>
introduction of yourself so the other members know that you are out <br/>
there, even if you just intend on lurking (and that's okay!).  Just <br/>
let us know a little something about yourself, how you got involved <br/>
in letterboxing, and what your interest is in Texas letterboxing, <br/>
what your favorite color is - whatever you think is important!<br/>
<br/>
I recieve and email asking me to introduce myself! So my name is <br/>
Kelli Smith I was born and raised in a little town out of Beaumont, <br/>
Texas. I evacauted to Marshall, Texas in Sept of 2005 from Hurricane <br/>
Rita! I am a single mom of two and just landed my first steady job 45 <br/>
days ago and Marshall Regional Medical Center as a Unit Clerk. I am <br/>
my daughter's softball coach and son's cub scout leader (Webelos). I <br/>
meet  Barefoot Lucy in June of 2007 at Dad and Lad (cub scout camp), <br/>
where my son, x-hubby, and I got introduced to letterboxing. I was <br/>
listening to Barefoot Lucy talk about the history of letterboxing and <br/>
had got takin in by how neat it all sounded and sat myself down and <br/>
listened to everything she had to say and would share with me! I felt <br/>
kinda like I was asking to many questions but she just kept answering <br/>
them like ti was nothing! Thank you for taking my under wing and <br/>
talking and sharing with me about it! Since then my son and I have <br/>
talked on several occasional aboput startign and have been trying to <br/>
think of names and what we would like our stamps to be. Also since I <br/>
have meet a wonderful new man and we have got him intrested in it to, <br/>
so as a family we plan on this being our little adventure! It has <br/>
been hard to find anything to get my son intrested in since we <br/>
evacauted he has not made the transition to the move and think seem <br/>
to have his attention! Anyway I can't wait to get my feet wet and get <br/>
started. My favorite color is red and favorite animal is panda bears <br/>
so more than likely my stamp and name might have something to do with <br/>
Panda's. I am workign on getting my whole cub den into this as well <br/>
so maybe we can plant some more boxes in the Marshall area! Thanks <br/>
again for welcoming me into the group and Barefoot Lucky for doing <br/>
the cub scout camp in June! It have opened up new door for some boys <br/>
and they had a great time!<br/>
