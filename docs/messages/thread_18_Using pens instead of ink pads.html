Silver Eagle,<br/>
<br/>
In your Mission Tejas box, you have a red felt tip pen<br/>
instead of an ink pad.  I was suprised by how well it<br/>
inked, but it works really well.<br/>
<br/>
I have a stamp I'm finishing right now that will<br/>
really need two colors to make it look great, so I<br/>
figure the best way to do it will be to place two pens<br/>
in the box with directions (it's kind of a duh thing,<br/>
but I figure directions won't hurt).<br/>
<br/>
My question is - what kind of pen is that?  I've tried<br/>
a number of different felt tips, but none of them are<br/>
really wet enough, so that they dry before I finish<br/>
inking the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>
Lucy<br/>

well and Sharpies aren't that great, either.  What<br/>
I use now for multi-color stamps are the small raised<br/>
ink pads shaped like a cat-eye.  Unless you need <br/>
the precision of a marker, they seem to work best.<br/>
I got them at Michaels.  Looking forward to finding<br/>
your boxes next time I'm up that way.<br/>

<div>As a long time rubberstamper, I have a bit of input on this one.  You need to use a water-based marker.  The ones that rubberstampers use for the most part are "Tombow" brand markers.  They usually come in a bullet tip and brush tip making them useful for detail and not-so-detailed work.  You can buy these at your arts/craft stores, scrapbooking stores and rubberstamping stores.  At a lot of these places, they can be bought singly or in sets.  There are other brands as well, just check and make sure they are water based or dye ink.  "Magic Markers", "Sharpies", "Prismacolor", etc markers are alcohol based and will not work.  There are oodles of rubberstamping and scrapbooking sources on the net.  Just do a search!</div>

You know, there's always more to know than meets they<br/>
eye, isn't there?  I would've thought a marker is a<br/>
marker.  I guess alcohol-based markers are doubly bad,<br/>
since they would also dry out the stamp.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again,<br/>
