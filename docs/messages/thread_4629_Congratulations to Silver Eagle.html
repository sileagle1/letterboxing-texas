                    <div class="plaintext-content">It is getting to be letterboxing weather, so we may just take a little trip down that way one day next week and gather some of your recent placements. They all look very interesting.  I found Mr. Heffelfinger on www.findagrave.com and they didn't mention his pro football connection, so I added a paragraph to his page and also a picture of him wearing his Yale sweater.  When my son went to Texas Tech, he published a little comic strip in a college newspaper and one of his characters was named "Pudge" after Mr. Heffelfinger.  He was excited when I told him about your letterbox at the cemetery.<br>

I was in Colorado last week too - mostly hiking in the Steamboat Springs area. Could you believe the weather there? It was 10 degrees warmer in Steamboat Springs than in McKinney while we were there, but perfect for hiking and ATVing! I only attempted one box (obviously missing) and planted ZERO. Next time I'll prepare better and plant one at the top of Hahns Peak for the brave and foolish (like me) who drive an ATV to the top (about 12,000 elevation).<br>
