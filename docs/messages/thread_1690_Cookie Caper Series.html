series to do it while they are still there!  The series is doable for <br/>
anyone and tons of fun. Most of the boxes are pretty close to each <br/>
other, and even the furthest box (in Austin)is North Austin and not <br/>
very far from the others.  Even if you don't get the chance to do all <br/>
the boxes for some reason, each one is a good find.  Georgetown has <br/>
some great parks - I'm envious.<br/>
     While doing the series, we also found Winter and Pocket Wocket.  <br/>
