                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wanted to let everyone know that we are going to be in Ark and OH for <br/>
the mth of Oct. I remember a lady from OH but I don't remember her <br/>
trail name that said if we ever get to OH let her know and we could <br/>
meet up. I think she was a granny butterfly of some kind. Not sure <br/>
exactly the name though. My husband's father will be 100 years old <br/>
Sept. 29 2008. We will be leaving the 26 to go to AR for his BD party. <br/>
We will visit there for about 10 days and then head to OH. We hope to <br/>
do a letterboxing there. We will be finding all the letterboxes in <br/>
Stark Co. or at least trying, if we two old people hold out. LOL<br/>
<br/>
We have not been doing to much letterboxing lately but we have been <br/>
keeping up with the post. I am still having trouble with my heart and <br/>
give out real easy. Can't seem to last long enough to find more than 3 <br/>
or 4 unless they are drive bys. I may not have internet service much <br/>
while I am away but will check on you all whenever I can. Lois<br/>
