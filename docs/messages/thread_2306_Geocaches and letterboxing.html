                    <div class="plaintext-content">Viewfinder reported yesterday on the metroboxers list that someone put<br/>
a geocache literally right on top of her letterbox.  It turned out to<br/>
have been done by a very new geocacher who had found 4 caches and<br/>
placed 1.  Likely had no idea about anything like letterboxing!<br/>
<br/>
It made me start thinking - we could easily do the same thing, and it<br/>
is no less rude or irresponsible for us to do it to them than for them<br/>
to do it to us.<br/>
<br/>
If you haven't already, take a minute to sign up for an account at<br/>
www.geocaching.com and learn a bit about how to use the site.  An<br/>
account there is free (like AQ, if you want premium services you can<br/>
buy a membership, but a basic free membership gets you a good bit of<br/>
information) and allows you to send communication to GC placers if you<br/>
ever need to.<br/>
<br/>
If you go to Hide and Seek Cache (left hand column) and click, and<br/>
then scroll down, you can see a keyword search where you can enter<br/>
various keywords that might help you see what caches are in a<br/>
particular place.  You can also do a Zip Code search.  Those are<br/>
probably the easiest searches for someone without a GPS to do on the<br/>
website.<br/>
<br/>
Judging from the sound of the cache description, this guy is not some<br/>
lamebrain, more likely just unaware, and any of us could easily be the<br/>
same way if we don't think a little more broadly than just<br/>
letterboxing!<br/>
