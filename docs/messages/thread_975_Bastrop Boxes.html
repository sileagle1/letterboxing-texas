We successfully found Cool Cat, Poison Ivy, Lost Loblolly, O-Knot <br>

has been reported missing, but I would look for it again, it had <br>
gotten really pushed under the ledge when we were there--very cool <br>
hiding place).  <br>
<br>
That was all the kids wanted to walk, so we didn't get to look for <br>
any of the other O-Knots.  I thought the orienteering course looked <br>
like a lot of fun.  Would love to go back and do that.<br>

Didn't you love the Skinny Pine hiding place?  I<br>
thought it was great!  Of course, I enjoyed all the<br>
boxing we did at Bastrop, but that one featured a<br>
perilous moment for my son, who as it turns out is the<br>
one of us that always seems to have something happen<br>
to us while we're boxing.  Still though, he's the<br>
first one out the door with me...<br>
<br>
Anyway, lots of great boxes in Bastrop.<br>
<br>
