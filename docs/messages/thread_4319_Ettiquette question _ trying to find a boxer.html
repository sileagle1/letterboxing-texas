metroplex?  I sent them a message via AQ mail to let them know what
happened, and was thinking of duplicating it on LbNA's contact the
placer system.  Suggestions, ideas?  I pulled the poor deceased box, since it's completely trashed (and
certainly hope that isn't considered stepping on toes), and have in my
boxing bag.  Was I wrong to pull the trashed box?  What do y'all do
when this type of thing happens?<br/><br/>Rogue Artist<br/></div>

<p>Hi Rogue Artist!<br/>
<br/>
Sounds like that box was a mess!<br/>
<br/>
Asking on this list is a good way to find out the status of letterboxers. 
For some reason, I want to say I remember Kantexan moved away.  Some of
the DFW boxers might be better able to answer that question.<br/>
<br/>
As far as whether you were right to remove that box, well - you hit on a hot
topic!  <br/>
<br/>
First let me say that in MY opinion, you were right to pick up the
remains.  No stamp, no logbook=no letterbox.  No box - no harm in
collecting the leftover trash (because really, that's what it is when there's
no stamp and no logbook).  Did you look around really, really well to see
if there was anything to salvage of the stamp and logbook?  Assuming you
did and there wasn't anything to be found.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, an occasion to move or remove a box is very rare indeed.<br/>
<br/>
For the sake of discussion, let's ask the group a few hypothetical
questions.  What would YOU consider proper in the following circumstances?<br/>
<br/>
1) You find the box with the stamp and the logbook, but the container is
destroyed.<br/>
<br/>
2) No sign of the box and the stamp, but you find the logbook.  What do
you do?<br/>
<br/>
3) You find a stamp, but have no idea what box or boxer it might go to?<br/>
<br/>
4) You find the box in perfect condition with contents intact, but there are
bulldozers nearby.<br/>

Carry extra containers, extra baggies, extra logbooks. Tough to carry extra stamps, but I remember someone several years ago saying that they carried some sort of a placeholder stamp so that if they ran across a box without a stamp, they could put their temporary stamp in the box and let the placer know ASAP that the stamp was gone; however, any subsequent finders would have an image to take if they found the box before the placer could replace the stamp.

<br/>Another things that comes to my mind is - know your fellow letterboxers. As an example, if I were boxing in my own neck of the woods, and I found that Puddle Splasher's box was needing a new logbook, I would go ahead and replace it. If the box belonged to JB Kokopelli, I wouldn't replace it, but let her know. Why? Because JBK lives close enough to get the job done, Puddle Splasher doesn't. Another consideration - how easy is it going to be for me to get back to the box if the placer asks for my help? Do I live 5 minutes away, or a half hour away, or four hours away? Do I know of other boxers in the area that could be called on to help? Is the placer someone who is real particular about their boxes, or is it someone who will be pretty laid back? As to the lost stamp, have I seen it in other logbooks? Does the image seem to correspond with a themed box? <br/>

<p>Heh...as you said, there are no real right answers - so the fact that you 
  considered and answered, means you get an A+!</p><div><div></div><div class="h5"><br/><br/>The answers so far point 
  up that we should all always be prepared to do all but create a new box. 
  Carry extra containers, extra baggies, extra logbooks. Tough to carry 
  extra stamps, but I remember someone several years ago saying that they 
  carried some sort of a placeholder stamp so that if they ran across a box 
  without a stamp, they could put their temporary stamp in the box and let the 
  placer know ASAP that the stamp was gone; however, any subsequent finders 
  would have an image to take if they found the box before the placer could 
  replace the stamp. I always kind of liked that idea.<br/><br/>Another 
  things that comes to my mind is - know your fellow letterboxers. As an 
  example, if I were boxing in my own neck of the woods, and I found that Puddle 
  Splasher's box was needing a new logbook, I would go ahead and replace 
  it. If the box belonged to JB Kokopelli, I wouldn't replace it, but let 
  her know. Why? Because JBK lives close enough to get the job done, 
  Puddle Splasher doesn't. Another consideration - how easy is it going to 
  be for me to get back to the box if the placer asks for my help? Do I 
  live 5 minutes away, or a half hour away, or four hours away? Do I know 
  of other boxers in the area that could be called on to help? Is the 
  placer someone who is real particular about their boxes, or is it someone who 
  will be pretty laid back? As to the lost stamp, have I seen it in 
  other logbooks? Does the image seem to correspond with a themed 
  box? <br/><br/>Lots of things to consider, and these are only a 
  few...<br/><br/><br/><br/>

An out of state letterboxer was visiting Houston last week and found a box at Memorial Park laying in the middle of the trail. She thought it might be one of my Oz boxes, so we met and she gave me the box. It's not mine. It doesn't indicate the box name anywhere - not on the container, not on the logbook. The logbook shows that the stamp was carved by the Gillespie Tribe from California. The only two finders in the logbook are Boots Tex and Will's World from December '07.  The image and the timeframe make me think it is an Oz box... possibly the stamp was contributed to Dewberry for the event.  Based on description alone, Boots wasn't able to identify it, so I'll scan the image in tonight and send it to him and to Dewberry.  <br/>
<br/>
Not knowing the name of the box, and not knowing where it should be re-hidden, I think our out of town friend did the right thing in pulling the box and giving it to a local.  Now if we can just figure out where it belongs.  :)<br/>
<br/>
Interesting to note... the container is a lock-n-lock, and although it's been in the wild for at least two years, everything was in perfect condition!<br/>
