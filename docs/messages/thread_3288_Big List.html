                    <html><body><div>LOL...I know what you mean.  You just can't stop from reading sometimes.  This particularly one was actually pretty humorous.  It always amazes me how folks are willing to run with any new idea, no matter how odd or impractical it is. I guess the only way to find really good new ideas is to have lots of stinky ideas too.  For the record, this flame war seems to have gone out now.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The thing is, in the midst of a big flame war some kernel of particularly good information comes out that folks keep missing or choose to ignore.  The original poster said she wanted help "burying' t-shirts, and talked about digging them up and wanted to get them buried in all 50 states (and I did get a kick out of the fact that she said she was planning to email them out at first until she corrected herself).  The original premise was that folks would dig them up and sign them and rebury them.  I got this vision of someone wanting to hide the t-shirt really well, so they dig a hole six feet deep on some university's grounds. A few folks sent emails poking fun at her and a few folks volunteered to help, but finally someone sent a very nice message saying "please reconsider digging as digging isn't part of letterboxing and it would be best not to associate digging with letterboxing."  Someone else suggested putting the t-shirts in letterboxes and using them for logbooks, which seems like a more workable way to make her idea work (ain't my thing, but whatever).  She finally said she didn't mean "digging" but "planting" and thought she could use the two terms interchangeably.  In the midst of all this was the standard flame war verbiage of someone with a thin skin posting to the Big List and others responding in their normal very direct way.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a good example of an idea that could have reflected badly on letterboxing and was just basically ludicrous to an idea that is workable as a letterboxing experiment (although the logistics of mailing 50 t-shirts to 50 different states would preclude me from carrying it out - I can barely remember to buy stamps, much less mail packages!), and I'm going to be interested to see how it develops.  I have no idea who she is although she says she has been letterboxing "for a long time", so I am guessing she's from another part of the country.  
<br/></div>
<div>And the offshoot thread is "How to keep t-shirts from smelling musty".  Yuk.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>BUT - there is a lot to be gleaned from the Big List.  That's where the long-term folks hang out, the ones who were in it from the beginning, the ones that can give some depth to the game for those who are just coming into it.  And therein is the rub...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You may or may not have noticed that there is sort of a generational thing in letterboxing.  The generations are a lot shorter now than they are in real life.  I visualize the scene as a big ol' family farm, with lots of dogs.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The newbies are the puppies.  They are very excited and romp around, yapping along and tugging on the tails of the bigger dogs.  They think they discovered the stick.  Every new game is a great idea and they jump in with all four feet to play.  Without puppies, the farm will eventually run out of dogs, but goodness, are they ever obnoxious sometimes.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And puppies get older - the young dog is above all that romping around and silliness.  He envisions himself much wiser than the puppy, although occasionally he can be caught playing with the stick too.  But he knows the puppy didn't invent the stick - after all, HE invented the stick.  He knows there is a lot he doesn't know, but he wants to hang with the old dogs, so he pretends.  If he's a smart dog, he learns not to howl with the big dogs, but to listen to them howling and notice what makes them howl.  Somewhere in there, he vows not to become like those old grouchy dogs though.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And the young dog becomes the working dog.  Who knows what job he has, but who cares.  He doesn't have time for that stick, and he gets really irritated watching the younger ones playing with it - after all, he is now a working dog and he has to worry about what must be done and how it must be done and who cares if it gets done.  He's gotten it all figured out, but he's too busy working to realize it.  Occasionally at the end of the day, he kicks back on his haunches and howls away with the old dogs, but he tries not to howl as loud as them because he feels like he hasn't quite earned the right.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, there are the old dogs.  Retired they are.  They've done their due and it's time for them to relax on the porch.  They sleep most of the day, dreaming of their glory days.  They are pretty happy, until one of those young yappers accidentally slaps him with the stick, and then, oh then, he comes alive and all but eats the pup for lunch.  By now he realizes the stick has been there all along and dogs long before him had the stick too.  He looks at those puppies and realizes how silly they are, how they have all these silly games they play, but he knows they really don't have a point in the end.  He has a little respect for the working dogs, he tolerates the young dogs, but those puppies?  They really, really get on his nerves.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's how I see the big list and why I think there are so many flames there.  It is, after all, the original letterboxing talk list for the US and that's where the first boxers wound up.  Now as new folk come along and start trying to use the Big List for a sounding board for their new ideas or thoughts or concepts, the porch dogs get cross and shoo them away because they have already been there and done that.

<br/>
For those new, you should look up the following:  GeoGeorgia,<br/>
K-Martha, K-Martha on Ebay and more.  There have been some hilarious<br/>
pranks pulled on the big list, often with elaborate &amp; months-long<br/>
set-ups.  People throw something out there, and others' reactions are<br/>
half the fun.  GeoGeorgia once did one where posters' responses were<br/>
part of the clue.<br/>
<br/>
I like the big list, because I like the history.  I'll wade in<br/>
sometimes when I have something to say.  If you have nothing to<br/>
contribute but just like the sound of your fingers typing, the folks<br/>
on the big list will sure let you know...<br/>

&gt; LOL...I know what you mean.  You just can't stop from reading sometimes.<br/>
&gt; This particularly one was actually pretty humorous.  It always<br/>
amazes me how<br/>
&gt; folks are willing to run with any new idea, no matter how odd or<br/>
impractical<br/>
&gt; it is. I guess the only way to find really good new ideas is to have<br/>
lots of<br/>
&gt; stinky ideas too.  For the record, this flame war seems to have gone out<br/>
&gt; now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The thing is, in the midst of a big flame war some kernel of<br/>
particularly<br/>
&gt; good information comes out that folks keep missing or choose to<br/>
ignore.  The<br/>
&gt; original poster said she wanted help "burying' t-shirts, and talked<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; digging them up and wanted to get them buried in all 50 states (and<br/>
I did<br/>
&gt; get a kick out of the fact that she said she was planning to email<br/>
them out<br/>
&gt; at first until she corrected herself).  The original premise was<br/>
that folks<br/>
&gt; would dig them up and sign them and rebury them.  I got this vision of<br/>
&gt; someone wanting to hide the t-shirt really well, so they dig a hole<br/>
six feet<br/>
&gt; deep on some university's grounds. A few folks sent emails poking fun at<br/>
&gt; her and a few folks volunteered to help, but finally someone sent a very<br/>
&gt; nice message saying "please reconsider digging as digging isn't part of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing and it would be best not to associate digging with<br/>
&gt; letterboxing."  Someone else suggested putting the t-shirts in<br/>
letterboxes<br/>
&gt; and using them for logbooks, which seems like a more workable way to<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; her idea work (ain't my thing, but whatever).  She finally said she<br/>
didn't<br/>
&gt; mean "digging" but "planting" and thought she could use the two terms<br/>
&gt; interchangeably.  In the midst of all this was the standard flame war<br/>
&gt; verbiage of someone with a thin skin posting to the Big List and others<br/>
&gt; responding in their normal very direct way.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a good example of an idea that could have reflected badly on<br/>
&gt; letterboxing and was just basically ludicrous to an idea that is<br/>
workable as<br/>
&gt; a letterboxing experiment (although the logistics of mailing 50<br/>
t-shirts to<br/>
&gt; 50 different states would preclude me from carrying it out - I can<br/>
barely<br/>
&gt; remember to buy stamps, much less mail packages!), and I'm going to be<br/>
&gt; interested to see how it develops.  I have no idea who she is<br/>
although she<br/>
&gt; says she has been letterboxing "for a long time", so I am guessing she's<br/>
&gt; from another part of the country.<br/>
&gt; And the offshoot thread is "How to keep t-shirts from smelling<br/>
musty".  Yuk.<br/>

<div id="ygrp-text">
<p>
</p><div>I'm really glad it isn't like that too!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - there is a lot to be gleaned from the Big List.  That's where 
  the long-term folks hang out, the ones who were in it from the beginning, the 
  ones that can give some depth to the game for those who are just coming into 
  it.  And therein is the rub... </div>
<div> </div>
<div>You may or may not have noticed that there is sort of a generational 
  thing in letterboxing.  The generations are a lot shorter now than they 
  are in real life.  I visualize the scene as a big ol' family farm, with 
  lots of dogs.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The newbies are the puppies.  They are very excited and romp around, 
  yapping along and tugging on the tails of the bigger dogs.  They think 
  they discovered the stick.  Every new game is a great idea and they jump 
  in with all four feet to play.  Without puppies, the farm will eventually 
  run out of dogs, but goodness, are they ever obnoxious sometimes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And puppies get older - the young dog is above all that romping around 
  and silliness.  He envisions himself much wiser than the puppy, although 
  occasionally he can be caught playing with the stick too.  But he knows 
  the puppy didn't invent the stick - after all, HE invented the stick.  He 
  knows there is a lot he doesn't know, but he wants to hang with the old dogs, 
  so he pretends.  If he's a smart dog, he learns not to howl with the big 
  dogs, but to listen to them howling and notice what makes them howl.  
  Somewhere in there, he vows not to become like those old grouchy dogs though. 
  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And the young dog becomes the working dog.  Who knows what job he 
  has, but who cares.  He doesn't have time for that stick, and he gets 
  really irritated watching the younger ones playing with it - after all, he is 
  now a working dog and he has to worry about what must be done and how it must 
  be done and who cares if it gets done.  He's gotten it all figured out, 
  but he's too busy working to realize it.  Occasionally at the end of the 
  day, he kicks back on his haunches and howls away with the old dogs, but 
  he tries not to howl as loud as them because he feels like he hasn't quite 
  earned the right. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally, there are the old dogs.  Retired they are.  
  They've done their due and it's time for them to relax on the porch.  
  They sleep most of the day, dreaming of their glory days.  They are 
  pretty happy, until one of those young yappers accidentally slaps him with the 
  stick, and then, oh then, he comes alive and all but eats the pup for 
  lunch.  By now he realizes the stick has been there all along and dogs 
  long before him had the stick too.  He looks at those puppies and 
  realizes how silly they are, how they have all these silly games they play, 
  but he knows they really don't have a point in the end.  He has a little 
  respect for the working dogs, he tolerates the young dogs, but those 
  puppies?  They really, really get on his nerves. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's how I see the big list and why I think there are so many 
  flames there.  It is, after all, the original letterboxing talk list for 
  the US and that's where the first boxers wound up.  Now as new folk come 
  along and start trying to use the Big List for a sounding board for their new 
  ideas or thoughts or concepts, the porch dogs get cross and shoo them away 
  because they have already been there and done that.  </div>
