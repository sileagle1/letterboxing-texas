<p><font face="Arial" size="2">So JBKokopelli and I had another one of our marathon boxing days last week.  I hate that it takes me so long to write up site reps on these, but they ARE marathons after all and there is a lot of typing involved!  We had a great time and found a ton of boxes. Here goes…</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">JBKokopelli picked me up at 6:30 a.m. and we hit the road for another fun-filled, and hopefully box-filled, day together. Our first stop was in Bullard so that I could stamp in on her box, "The Case of the Deadly Milkshake".  We drove on into Tyler and I stamped in at her new "Trail of Destruction - Koresh"; this is a great stamp and I hope everyone in the area will visit it. Next we picked up "Dixie Dragons" and "Fly Away".  By now it was around 8:00 a.m. and I felt like I had a right to be awake, dressed, and out in public.  For those playing along at home, I am NOT a morning person, and how my cousin convinces me to get up at ungodly hours of the morning to go traipsing around in dew-covered fields, well I'll just never know.</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Redland was our next stop so we could visit the site of the Battle of the Neches and look for "Chief Bowles and the Battle of the Neches".  This is a very well-kept area, and we enjoyed the serene walk down to the Indian chief's monument.  We couldn't find the box, but the site was worth the visit.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We visited Edom next and found "Old School" and "Moving Again", and took pictures at the cemetery of a beautiful old grave with a dilapidated iron fence around it (for those playing along, the love of cemeteries really does run in our family).  We found Box 3 of "Wait 5 Minutes" and "A Family Project" next.  While we were stamping in at the car, a pickup pulled into the circle drive in front of the cemetery and parked near the gate.  The driver and passenger wouldn't get out, and they wouldn't drive off, and we had about decided they were boxers just waiting their turn.  We left and then drove back by twice and they were still just sitting there.  I guess it was a false alarm.</font><font face="Times New Roman"> </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We found our way to Ben Wheeler and picked up Boxes 1 and 2 of "Wait 5 Minutes", as well as "What's My Name?", then headed off to Van.  </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Our first stop in Van was the site of "Together Forever".  We were intrigued by the story of this loving couple, but didn't find the box; when I went to log my attempt, I noticed that it had already been reported as unavailable.  We located "It's Drilling Time" and "Gotta Go?" (note - the trees are pecans, not oaks), but had no luck finding "Oil Boom".  We were pretty sure we had the right tree, but the area around it had been cleaned up and the box was probably discovered and removed.  We wanted to get "Playing Around", but two little girls insisted on camping out at the picnic table near the spot and there wasn't any way to get the box without witnesses.  We did find "Camping is a Blast" at a beautiful spot right next to the water, and also found "Childhood Memories - Button Moon".   Our next stop was Garden Valley, where we found "Seven Spheres of Influence - Church".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">By now it was 1:30 and we made our way to Lindale.  We found the empty box of "Seven Spheres - Business", and just missed its replacement by a couple of days.  After a good deal of hunting, we found "Seven Spheres - Media" and then stopped for "Storytime".  "Seven Spheres - Education" was next, and unfortunately the box was open, the bag unsealed, and the logbook soaking wet.  We replaced the logbook and baggies and gave the box a fresh start.  We found "You Gotta Love Country Music" and "Seven Spheres - Government" in good shape.  Next we looked for "Dr. Kinzie"; though we found his old office and checked different flower beds, we were not able to find the box.  We found the "Lindale Eagle Marching Band" box and its "Going My Way" hitchhiker, then "Seven Spheres - Arts &amp; Entertainment".   By now it was time for a "Coffee Break" and a refreshing drink…we recommend the caramel and mint/chocolate frappuccinos.  After refueling, we found "We Are the Eagles" and "Fighting Lindale Eagles", then found a new, safer hiding place for my "Candy's Cows" box (it floated away from the Lower Sabine River Bottom WMA). Ending our time in Lindale, we sweated around the lake at Faulkner Park and found "Seven Spheres - Family".</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Quitman was our next stop, and we were successful in finding "Pillsbury Doughboy" around 5:30 p.m.  We drove on to Alba and hoped to find a nice little overgrown cemetery to plant JBK's "Lignite in Alba" box.  We found exactly what we wanted…knee-high grass leading up to a pretty, old cemetery.  We reached Golden at 6:30 p.m., and drove around looking for a home for JBK's new "Golden Rule" box.  We found a neat old building and discovered what has to be an old bank vault behind it.  We took some great pictures there too.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Canton was the final stop on our route, but it sure felt strange to be there when it wasn't "First Monday".  We drove around for quite a while looking for a couple of specific points of interest, then finally settled on a location for JBK's new "America's Shortest War" box.  We found "My Favorite Flower Is…", and ended the day at 8:40 p.m., almost dark, with "Gotta Eat" and another hitchhiker, "Tiger Cub Paw".   We finished up and hit the road for home at 9:00 p.m.</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">We made it to my parents' door at 10:30 p.m. That's 16 hours of letterboxing, 315 miles, and 28 boxes (plus 5 of JBK's boxes for me and 3 hitchhikers).</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial" size="2">Folks, I call that a marathon!  Hey, JBK…where are we going next?</font>

I love that box and did an awesome job on the carving (or at least that is my opinion) in memory of my grandmother. I will also be planting a box called "Bigfoot" in the vicinity of Lake Hawkins that weekend.</p>

><br>
> We visited Edom next and found "Old School" and "Moving Again", and <br>

><br>
> We found our way to Ben Wheeler and picked up Boxes 1 and 2 of "Wait 5 <br>
> Minutes", as well as "What's My Name?", then headed off to Van. <br>
><br>
> Our first stop in Van was the site of "Together Forever".  We were <br>
> intrigued by the story of this loving couple, but didn't find the box; <br>
> when I went to log my attempt, I noticed that it had already been <br>
> reported as unavailable.  We located "It's Drilling Time" and "Gotta <br>
> Go?" (note - the trees are pecans, not oaks), but had no luck finding <br>
> "Oil Boom".  We were pretty sure we had the right tree, but the area <br>
> around it had been cleaned up and the box was probably discovered and <br>
> removed.  We wanted to get "Playing Around", but two little girls <br>
> insisted on camping out at the picnic table near the spot and there <br>
> wasn't any way to get the box without witnesses.  We did find "Camping <br>
> is a Blast" at a beautiful spot right next to the water, and also found <br>
> "Childhood Memories - Button Moon".   Our next stop was Garden <br>
> Valley, where we found "Sev en Spheres of Influence - Church".<br>
><br>
> By now it was 1:30 and we made our way to Lindale.  We found the empty <br>
> box of "Seven Spheres - Business", and just missed its replacement by a <br>
> couple of days.  After a good deal of hunting, we found "Seven Spheres <br>
> - Media" and then stopped for "Storytime".  "Seven Spheres - <br>
> Education" was next, and unfortunately the box was open, the bag <br>
> unsealed, and the logbook soaking wet.  We replaced the logbook and <br>
> baggies and gave the box a fresh start.  We found "You Gotta Love <br>
> Country Music" and "Seven Spheres - Government" in good shape.  Next <br>
> we looked for "Dr. Kinzie"; though we found his old office and checked <br>
> different flower beds, we were not able to find the box.  We found the <br>
> "Lindale Eagle Marching Band" box and its "Going My Way" hitchhiker, <br>
> then "Seven Spheres - Arts & Entertainment".   By now it was time for <br>
> a "Coffee Break" and a refreshing drink…we recommend the caramel and <br>
> mint/chocolate frappuccinos.  After refueling, we found "We Are the <br>
> Eagles" and "Fighting Lindale Eagles", then found a new, safer hiding <br>
> place for my "Candy's Cows" box (it floated away from the Lower Sabine <br>
> River Bottom WMA). Ending our time in Lindale, we sweated around the <br>
> lake at Faulkner Park and found "Seven Spheres - Family".<br>
><br>
> Quitman was our next stop, and we were successful in finding "Pillsbury <br>
> Doughboy" around 5:30 p.m.  We drove on to Alba and hoped to find a <br>
> nice little overgrown cemetery to plant JBK's "Lignite in Alba" box.  <br>
> We found exactly what we wanted…knee-high grass leading up to a <br>
> pretty, old cemetery.  We reached Golden at 6:30 p.m., and drove <br>
> around looking for a home for JBK's new "Golden Rule" box.  We found a <br>
> neat old building and discovered what has to be an old bank vault <br>
> behind it.  We took some great pictures there too.<br>
><br>
> Canton was the final stop on our route, but it sure felt strange to be <br>
> there when it wasn't "First Monday".  We drove around for quite a <br>
> while looking for a couple of specific points of interest, then finally <br>
> settled on a location for JBK's new "America's Shortest War" box.  We <br>
> found "My Favorite Flower Is…", and ended the day at 8:40 p.m., <br>
> almost dark, with "Gotta Eat" and another hitchhiker, "Tiger Cub <br>
> Paw".   We finished up and hit the road for home at 9:00 p.m.<br>
><br>
> We made it to my parents' door at 10:30 p.m. That's 16 hours of <br>
> letterboxing, 315 miles, and 28 boxes (plus 5 of JBK's boxes for me and <br>
> 3 hitchhikers).<br>
><br>
> Folks, I call that a marathon!  Hey, JBK…where are we going next?<br>
