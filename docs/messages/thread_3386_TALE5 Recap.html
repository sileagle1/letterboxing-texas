                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, a combination of great weather, good food and a huge turnout <br>
(about 60-70 people) made this TX Annual LB Event the best one yet!  <br>
People came from all over TX and even from New Mexico and Louisiana. <br>
It was fun seeing old friends and meeting new ones, and it was kind <br>
of like a combination family reunion and ice cream social.  We didn't <br>
have ice cream, but we had many other goodies.  In fact, there was so <br>
much to eat even my teenage son was satisfied!<br>
<br>
The carving demos by Baby Bear & Boots Tex were popular and I want to <br>
thank them again for volunteering.  The LB Match Game was won by <br>
Dewberry (or was it Mother Of Five, Puddle Splasher or all 3) and for <br>
the second year in a row, Gryzzled Gryphon came in second.  I will <br>
try to post the questions and answers in the Files Section if you <br>
want to try your luck.<br>
<br>
We also had a great turnout at our campfire that night (about 15).  <br>
This is usually my favorite time at our Events since everyone can  <br>
relax without the frenzy of stamping and just enjoy swapping <br>
stories.  Fearless Fox and Lightning made us some great peach <br>
cobbler, which went well with the Cranberry Meade used to toast the <br>
death of the Cranberry Cruiser.  <br>
<br>
I have posted some pictures in the Photos section and feel free to <br>
add any of your own:<br>
<br>
http://ph.groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/photos/browse/4cab<br>
<br>
I hope everyone had as much fun as I did and will come again next <br>
year!<br>

Is there a way to change the title of a picture that I've already <br>
added to the event album or how can I delete it and so I can post a <br>
new one with Pug Momma's name added?<br>

sitting in a McDonald's in Seguin logging on to read what everyone <br>
said about the event, and we couldn't agree more that it was great <br>
and SE and BB did a wonderful job as usual.  We've found 13 <br>
letterboxes today and hope to get a few more before the sun goes <br>
down.  We were greatly honored by having our Murder at the Arboretum <br>
letterbox judged Letterbox of the Year by such distinguished pioneers <br>
as Silver Eagle and Baby Bear.  If you don't know, our family, <br>
collectively, is known as The Texians.  This includes our two sons, a <br>
daughter-in-law and a sister.  We are planning a another series, but, <br>
due to the success of our first effort, we are having a hard time <br>
deciding exactly what to do.  Oh, Lord, it's hard to be Humble.  <br>
Seriously, we all really appreciate your comments and invite those<br>
 who haven't found the box yet to do so.  P. S.:  Our travel trailer <br>
must be haunted; we found a couple more of IRA Boxer's boxes in there.<br>
<br>
We'll be home friday and catch up then.<br>

<p>Well, a combination of great weather, good food and a huge turnout <br/>
(about 60-70 people) made this TX Annual LB Event the best one yet!  <br/>
People came from all over TX and even from New Mexico and Louisiana. <br/>
It was fun seeing old friends and meeting new ones, and it was kind <br/>
of like a combination family reunion and ice cream social.  We didn't <br/>
have ice cream, but we had many other goodies.  In fact, there was so <br/>
much to eat even my teenage son was satisfied!<br/>
<br/>
The carving demos by Baby Bear &amp; Boots Tex were popular and I want to <br/>
thank them again for volunteering.  The LB Match Game was won by <br/>
Dewberry (or was it Mother Of Five, Puddle Splasher or all 3) and for <br/>
the second year in a row, Gryzzled Gryphon came in second.  I will <br/>
try to post the questions and answers in the Files Section if you <br/>
want to try your luck.<br/>
<br/>
We also had a great turnout at our campfire that night (about 15).  <br/>
This is usually my favorite time at our Events since everyone can  <br/>
relax without the frenzy of stamping and just enjoy swapping <br/>
stories.  Fearless Fox and Lightning made us some great peach <br/>
cobbler, which went well with the Cranberry Meade used to toast the <br/>
death of the Cranberry Cruiser.  <br/>
<br/>
I have posted some pictures in the Photos section and feel free to <br/>
add any of your own:<br/>

I hope everyone had as much fun as I did and will come again next <br/>
year!<br/>
