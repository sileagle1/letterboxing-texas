<div>Viewfinder and I had planned to go letterboxing last Tuesday and I woke suffering from allergies and not feeling well, but I decided to put mind over matter and go anyway because I really wanted to go! Driving to Arlington, I was not sure I had made the right decision. I started feeling a tiny bit better when we started hiking to the first box. After finding it, we hiked over to another box hidden in the same park on the opposite side. That box was hidden under some wooden steps of a multi-tiered wooden deck on the side of a small hill in the woods. When Viewfinder reached under the stairs of the deck where the box was hidden to pull  it out, it tumbled through a hole to the earth below the deck! Neither of us could reach it. We were so bummed! Finally we went down the hill to the edge of the deck and looked under the deck and could actually see the box wedged way up under the deck about ten feet away. Suddenly - some strange urge came over me and I found myself crawling on my stomach under the deck in the moist dirt and leaves until I could reach the box. I'm usually someone who doesn't do well in tight places - but the need to recover that box was my only focus! Voila! I recovered it, and slithered back out from under the deck. Amazingly, my allergies didn't really bother me for the rest of the morning, and we went on to find four more boxes. Letterboxing can certainly be an adventure.</div>
