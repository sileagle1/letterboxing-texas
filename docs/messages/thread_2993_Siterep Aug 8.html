                    <html><body><div>I've been doing some research about the whole area making a triangle between Corsicana and Athens and Seagoville.  There is quite a lot of great history in that region and plenty of nice places to place boxes yet.  As JBK alluded to, there are three new boxers going strong in the Athens area - monarch trailer, athens dicer, and frankston native.  Between them and Adams Trails, they'll get that whole area planted up pretty quickly, but I hope to get a box or two up in there myself in the next few months.

permanently missing. It went missing once in less than a week and I <br/>

I did not replace it nor will I. Thanks for finding all my boxes <br/>

&gt; again a great stamp and a great history to go along with it.  I <br/>
have <br/>
&gt; really been impressed by the history, location, and stamps of <br/>
&gt; Frankston Native, who placed these four boxes.  Just hope that they<br/>
&gt; continue to put those stamps out there.  Next we headed to Athens <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; find The Sheriff box which was in tribute to Jess Sweeten.  The box <br/>
&gt; was located near the old jail and was a really nice carving.  I had <br/>
&gt; already found some of athens dicer's boxes and the history, stamps, <br/>
&gt; and locations were also really great.  Again, hope they keep it <br/>
up.  <br/>
&gt; The next stop was the park behind the Community Center in Malakoff <br/>
&gt; to pick up the Little Bunny Fu Fu box.  The box was in great <br/>
shape.  <br/>
&gt; We then journeyed down to Seven Points and went to the library to <br/>
&gt; find Adventures of Adams Trail2.  This box is actually in the <br/>
&gt; library, and Adams Trail did a phenomenol job on the box and <br/>
&gt; placement..the stamp was also really nice.  We then went to Seven <br/>
&gt; Points Park to find Love is in the Air box.  We found the right <br/>
&gt; tree, but no box was to be found.   Our next stop was Kings <br/>
Cemetery <br/>
&gt; in Seven Points where we were able to pick up the Hot and <br/>
Cole/Harts <br/>
&gt; on Fire box. The box was in good shape.  We then continued on to <br/>
&gt; Mabank to the Tri County Library to pick up A Butterfly by Adams <br/>
&gt; Trails.  Again this was a great job on the placement and a nice <br/>
&gt; stamp to go with it.  We then went to a park near the rodeo grounds <br/>
&gt; in Mabank to pick up The Blue Daisy.  The box was safe and<br/>
&gt; sound.  Jr then navigated me to Phalba to a really neat little one <br/>
&gt; room school house.  The people who own the property are really <br/>
&gt; taking care of the grounds, but the school is deserted even though <br/>
&gt; the bell is still out front.  The box that is placed there is An <br/>
&gt; Apple for my Teacher and it was in great shape.  Next we<br/>
&gt; headed out to find The Drifter in Goshen Cemetery  between Eustace <br/>
&gt; and Phalba.  This was a neat old cemetery and the history about the <br/>
&gt; area was really interesting.  The box was in great condition.  We <br/>
&gt; then went to Palestine and picked up the Blueberry Scout:  Dot box <br/>
&gt; in Davy Dogwood Park.  Nice carving and the box was safely tucked <br/>
&gt; under the log.  We then found our way to Old Palestine Cemetery in <br/>
&gt; Palestine and found The Railroad Man - Texas Governors Series.  <br/>
&gt; Again Boots Tex did not let me down on the carving of this <br/>
&gt; governor.  He did a wonderful job, and the box was in great <br/>
&gt; condition.  So all in all, it was a great day.  JR and I found 14 <br/>
&gt; out of 15 boxes.  Thanks again to all the wonderful boxers out <br/>
&gt; there.  <br/>

<div>Wow, I am so impressed by this list! I have 
no idea where you find all the listings for these boxes! A lot of this is near 
me and I've got to get more organized so I can do 2-3 boxes with my boys when we 
get out. (The idea of getting all of them out of the van 15 times just exhausts 
me...that is a bit beyond my ability!!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We have piano lessons in Canton and start 
back up in the fall. I am hoping to find some in that area of the world...I'd 
love to find one a week as we go back and forth between Home &amp; Canton. 
Wouldn't that be a fun thing for them to look forward too?</div>
