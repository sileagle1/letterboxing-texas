It sounds like there really just is not one there yet.</div><div><br/></div><div><span style="font-size:10pt;">The Zoo itself was nice enough, as zoos go.  It is a non-profit foundation and is populated mostly with refugee or rescued animals, often from pets that grew too large or too dangerous to keep in the home.  why someone would want a
 lion as a pet is beyond me, but apparently some people do.  they receive no funding from city, state, or federal, so they are run entirely on donations,
 and I suppose they are managing the best they can, within that financial arrangement.  It was not fancy, but it was nice enough and the people were friendly and the animals seemed well-enough cared for.  When we were there, it was full of people and they had plenty of guests, so it's an active area for visiting, clearly.  For a fine way to fill a few hours some afternoon, it worked well for that.</span></div><div><br/></div><div>I agree it's hard to find a place in a zoo to leave a hidden box, as the grounds are really kept well and it is such an active place with so many people all the time.  If I were going to do a box there, I would go prepared with a speech about how letterboxing can bring new people to visit the zoo, and ask them about placing an approved-in-advance box to be placed somewhere they know about, such as in the gift shop, perhaps behind the counter or perhaps just in a certain area within the gift shop
 that would be hard to find by accident, but easy to find if you knew where to look. </div><div><br/></div><div>However, I am not going to be placing this new box, as this is the first time in many years that I have been to Austin, and I expect will be the last time for many more years, as well.  I would not be able to develop a relationship with the people there or check on the box or do follow-up or anything like that. </div><div><br/></div><div>Hopefully someone who is more local to the area would like to go for it?</div><div><br/></div><div>Thanks again for the info from everyone!</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div></td></tr></tbody></table></div></td></tr></table></body></html>
