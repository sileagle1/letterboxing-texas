                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello Texas letterboxers. In July/August I will be traveling to WV to <br>
hike the 80 mile Greenbrier River Trail. I will be placing some <br>
letterboxes along the way. I am willing to take some HH's or maybe <br>
even a box if you would like to have one placed there. WV is kind of <br>
letterbox deficient and I hope to help increase the box count there. <br>
Maybe it will catch on there like it seems to be in Louisiana now. <br>
If you want some info on GRT go to www.greenbrierrivertrail.com or <br>
use a search engine and there are lots of sites with information. <br>
I can be reached at<br>

Happy trails,<br>
DrooP<br>
