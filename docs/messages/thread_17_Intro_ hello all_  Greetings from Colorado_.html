Austin and hid some there as well.  We have 5 hidden in Bastrop <br/>

with a letterbox (not hidden) in Bastrop SP!  So when I read about <br/>

hee!  I found my first letterbox (Lost Pines) Buescher back in <br/>
2000!  And it was Eoghan's box!  That's the funny part, we were <br/>
hiding boxes for each other to find at that time.  Sad but true.  We <br/>
did find the one in Dallas, which was a series but only 'one' was to <br/>
be found - I don't think those are around anymore.  So you can see <br/>
how desperate we were for other people to start letterboxing at that <br/>
time!  It was still so new.  We even made sure to look boxes up if <br/>
we were taking a road trip.  <br/>
<br/>
I will work hard to convince Eoghan that we should go to Bastrop.  <br/>
It would be a shame if we didn't.  We LOVE the cabins there but they <br/>
book so quickly!  We shall see!  <br/>
<br/>
Take care all of you and have a great week!<br/>
