                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  It was exciting to see this list posted.  I found it today <br>
after looking up RMLetterboxing (Rocky Mountain Letterboxing).  YES, <br>
I will be a lurker from Colorado but am TEXAN by birth and proud to <br>
be from Texas!  I grew up in South Texas - "Odem" to be exact and <br>
I'm very familiar with that area - so hearing about towns from there <br>
in your posts is very familiar to me!<br>
<br>
We moved to Colorado almost two years ago in May!  I lived in Austin <br>
since 1989 and my husband since 1987.  We discovered letterboxing in <br>
Austin and hid some there as well.  We have 5 hidden in Bastrop <br>
State Park, our favoritie SP in Texas AND my husband proposed to me <br>
with a letterbox (not hidden) in Bastrop SP!  So when I read about <br>
the Bastrop event I was so envious!  I'm going to work very hard to <br>
convince my husband, also a letterboxer - hopefully he will post <br>
soon, that we should go to this event!!!!  I know it's a longshot <br>
but I really want to go.<br>
<br>
Look forward to the news, ideas, events and meeting new people!  <br>
Thanks for putting this group together!<br>

of the group how special Pumpkin Princess and her husband<br>
Eoghan are to Texas Letterboxing.  They were one of the<br>

oldest, if not the oldest letterboxes still alive.  When<br>
I first started boxing, only theirs, a few in Dallas, <br>
Brownsville, Hueco Tanks and Franklin Mountains existed.<br>
Now, the original ones in Dallas (which I think were the<br>
first ever in Texas), are gone and I'm not sure about the<br>
others.  It must have been tough waiting all those years<br>
for the rest of us to start letterboxing and find your boxes.<br>
It would almost be a crime if ya'll weren't at the First<br>
Texas Letterboxing Event! <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Ha!  Thanks Silver Eagle!  Saves me from tooting my own horn, tee, <br>
hee!  I found my first letterbox (Lost Pines) Buescher back in <br>
2000!  And it was Eoghan's box!  That's the funny part, we were <br>
hiding boxes for each other to find at that time.  Sad but true.  We <br>
did find the one in Dallas, which was a series but only 'one' was to <br>
be found - I don't think those are around anymore.  So you can see <br>
how desperate we were for other people to start letterboxing at that <br>
time!  It was still so new.  We even made sure to look boxes up if <br>
we were taking a road trip.  <br>
<br>
I will work hard to convince Eoghan that we should go to Bastrop.  <br>
It would be a shame if we didn't.  We LOVE the cabins there but they <br>
book so quickly!  We shall see!  <br>
<br>
Take care all of you and have a great week!<br>
