Though it doesn't look much harder than my Yahtzee box, it took me several months and over 2500 lines of code to program, so I hope you enjoy it.<br>
<br>
I also checked on my Call Of The Wild LB and it was missing the stamp and the log was ruined, so I retired it and will probably create a new one and place it next Saturday.<br>
