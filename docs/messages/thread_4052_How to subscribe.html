What with that Austin Statesman article, several in the area are joining the fun. I'd like to direct them to this list, albeit with caution re certain investigators and ghosts. But I can't remember how to get on. (Which is a good thing because I can't remember how to get off either. So I lurk with gusto, lol, which always bring BirdDog running to see what I'm laught at. Okay, calm down, Not at you. With you)<br>
<br>
Anyway, could some tech savy person put out directions on joining the talk list or newbie list? Much appreciated, unless directive come from that investigator fellow. Could we trust him?<br>

Of course, you can trust me. Have I ever steered you wrong? That ghost fellow though, not sure about him. Personally, I don't think he is all there. <br>
