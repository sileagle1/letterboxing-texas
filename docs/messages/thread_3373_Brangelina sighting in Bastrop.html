                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings from Bastrop.  We're staying at the state park until tomaking <br/>
a orrow.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are here,too, making a movie <br/>
(not at the state park, but in Bastrop).  They were spotted shopping at <br/>
the Walmart.  I here they're shooting in Smithville Saturday.  We got <br/>
here Monday and found 4 boxes, planted 2 at South Shore and one at <br/>
Farview Cemetery.  Went to Georgetown Tuesday, windy and cold.  Found <br/>
my lost "To Hell and Back" box safe and sound, but 50 yards from where <br/>
it should have been, rehid in a different spot, so it's back in <br/>
business.  Found a few boxes, including one out at Lake Georgetown by <br/>
Boopy &amp; Boy.  I accidentally left my walking stick there, if anyone <br/>
happens to be going by and finds it, I would appreciate your letting me <br/>
know.  It's a hickory stick with several state park medallians on it. <br/>
Today should be warmer, but breezy.  We have a couple more boxes to <br/>
hide, going back to Austin today.  We're in camping space 76 if you're <br/>
here tonight and will be moving over to South Shore tomorrow.  See you <br/>
all soon.  I didn't know the park has wi-fi, but the library's open til <br/>
9:00 tonight, closes at 6:00 on Friday.<br/>
