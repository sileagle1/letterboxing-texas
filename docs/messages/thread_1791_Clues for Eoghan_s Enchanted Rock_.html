<br>
Am just now back on my feet...just in time for the Cub Scout Family <br>
Campout at Enchanted Rock State Park.<br>
<br>
I've already got the clues printed out for Silver Eagle's Enchanted <br>
Rock (reported missing...but I just thought I'd try to confirm) and <br>
Baby Bear's Yogi (also attempted, but not found...who knows?).<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, however, the link to Eoghan's Enchanted Rock box is not <br>
working.  Does anyone have a copy of Eoghan's clues?<br>
<br>
Thanks, Batty B<br>

*****Thanks so much for the link!  I've now got the clues and am <br>
ready to go.  I'll let everyone know how we do with both Eoghan's <br>
Enchanted Rock, your Enchanted Rock and Baby Bear's Yogi.<br>
<br>
I hope everyone has beautiful weather and a lot of fun boxing this <br>
weekend...this is my favorite time of year for boxing...the weather <br>
is beautiful and the boxes are plentiful!  What more could a <br>
letterboxer ask for?!?<br>
