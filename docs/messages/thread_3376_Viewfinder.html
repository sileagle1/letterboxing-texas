<i>Thanks for the tip,
Viewfinder.  I haven't actually logged in any of my finds or 'attempts'
on the websites, but I'll be sure to not include those that I just
chickened out on as 'an attempt'.  LOL.<br/>

<div>That's what I call "counting coup" - and I've often been tempted
to do the same thing (and actually have on at least a couple of
occasions).  I understand completely!</div>

PS:  When you do this, thought, don't actually log the find as an
"attempt" on the websites,  because that's a sign to many letterboxes
that the box couldn't be found, was missing, or something, so they'll
ignore that one rather than go for it themselves.  Just a suggestion .
