                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, that was probably the shortest-lived box I never placed.<br/>
Ryan deleted it from AQ because of the reasons he sent me in an<br/>
email that I have included below.  I guess you will have to <br/>
log finds any way you can, which is what I was trying to avoid.<br/>
I told Ryan he should offer the original method of hiding clues<br/>
from Search Engines instead of using F-1 instead, but I doubt<br/>
he will make the change.  I still don't think a person looking<br/>
at clues on LBNA that point to AQ should have to register on<br/>
AQ, then log a Find, before being able to just see the clue.<br/>
My recommendation is for anyone posting clues on AQ to take the<br/>
time to post them to LBNA separately, not using the AQ box.<br/>
Then the clues will show up in both places.<br/>

<div>I almost always post my clue on AQ first and check the box to link the 
clues onto the LBNA site, which saves me doing it all twice.  The only 
thing I have to add to the LBNA site when it pops up (also very nice 
convenience) is the county and click the box to announce it automatically.  
I like this feature.  -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
