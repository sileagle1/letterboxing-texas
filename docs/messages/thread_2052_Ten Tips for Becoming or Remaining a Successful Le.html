HAFTA put in my two cents<br/>
<br/>
--Understand that there are different ways to play the game.<br/>
<br/>
--Be realistic about your own temperament and physical limitations and<br/>
choose (to the best of your knowledge), boxes that are appropriate for<br/>
you and your group.  Consider hike length, the difficulty of the<br/>
terrain, the ages and physical condition of your group, the need for<br/>
subtlety, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
--Do not be afraid to leave without the box.<br/>
<br/>
--Expect surprises and be prepared.  That means having a first aid kit<br/>
(at least in the car), water and a well-stocked backpack.  Use common<br/>
sense when hiking and pay attention to your surroundings.  Don't wear<br/>
headphones while hiking.<br/>
<br/>
--Don't be afraid to try something new.  You can become a pretty good<br/>
carver more quickly than you might think.  Come to a gathering (hint,<br/>
hint, one coming up)!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
And I just want to say one word about leaving without the box. <br/>
Several weeks ago, while on vacation, we went looking for a box that<br/>
the clues said were in a hole.  This was turned out to be a DEEP hole;<br/>
I think the box slipped much further in than the planter had intended.<br/>
 I poked around with a stick to no avail, but no way was I putting my<br/>
arm into that hole, even if I'd had gloves (it was at least arm<br/>
length).  No box was worth that potential nasty surprise.  I have also<br/>
walked away from boxes when there's not a PI-free way to the hiding<br/>
place and ones that I felt were planted in a sensitive ecological<br/>
environment.  And, as difficult as it's been, sometimes I've walked<br/>
away from a perfectly fine box because my kids had lost all enthusiasm<br/>
for the outing.  This is a drag for me (so close!  so far!), but I try<br/>
to remind myself that we're in this (hopefully) for the long haul and<br/>
it's better to come back than to push them past the breaking point to<br/>
where they resent the hobby I enjoy so much.  <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, great topic Lucy!  I really enjoyed everyone's responses.  <br/>

<div>AHA!  You are like me!!!  Probably the most important lesson I have learned from letterboxing is that if I wait for perfection, I will NEVER go letterboxing!  I did all my research, but somehow stepping out there and going it without someone to tell me if I was doing it right or wrong was a big jump for me.  I've learned that learning the game is a process that I will very likely never perfect - which is why it is also something I will likely never quit.  Perfection begets boredom!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I was a kid about 12, I rode horses and I had a colt that needed to be broken.  We took it to a ranch hand from a family friend's ranch and asked him to break it.  He worked on the horse, but in the meantime wanted me to come out and ride with him so he could get a feel for what he needed to do with the horse.  Now this guy had been the national bareback bronc riding champion several years running, and stayed in the top three for more years beyond that and was now spending his twilight years working cattle on a ranch, so I was in awe of him.  The first time I rode with him, we were saddling up and he asked me if I had ever been thrown from a horse.  I hated to have to admit it, but I told him I had been thrown - several times.  His response was "Good!  I know I don't have to worry about you out there today then because you've got a little experience behind you."  What I thought was a weakness was to him a strength.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you've never made a mistake letterboxing, it is probably only because you've never been letterboxing.  The key is to not make the same mistake over and over again!</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I may be one of the newbies, but I've got a tip too:  Use a strong, <br/>
solid plastic box for your letterbox!  I've already been disappointed <br/>
several times to find a thin, flexible box that is now full of <br/>
standing water because the top cracked or warped.  I suspect that <br/>
these boxes were hidden before Rubbermaid came out with those blue-<br/>
rimmed flex and seal boxes, so I'm not blaming or pointing fingers, <br/>
but it does seem to be worth mentioning.  <br/>
<br/>
The worst situation was one I found in Mississppi where the hider <br/>
hadn't even used a box, but had put the log book in a ziploc bag and <br/>
then buried under a rock in the ground!  Let me tell you, Mississippi <br/>
is WET, so the logbook had degraded into a disgusting sludge.  Yikes!<br/>
