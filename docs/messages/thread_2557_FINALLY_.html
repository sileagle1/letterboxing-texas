<div>I am remorse to tell 
you how long ago I actually hid my new boxes, suffice to say it was a while 
ago.  HOWEVER, since it has been raining so much here, you all wouldn't 
have had much of a chance to go and look for them.  The boxes are "Words to 
Live By" and "Trumpet of the Swan", both at George Bush Park in Houston.  
They are part of a 4 box tribute to the works of EB White, so if you go look for 
them, please don't forget to look for "Charlotte's Web" and "Stuart Little" by 
Sandibox...both very astounding boxes.  (Hers are the astounding ones, just 
to avoid confusion!)  Have Fun!  (That is, if it ever stops 
raining!)  MO5</div></body></html>

been, because mine were planted even earlier!  <br/>
<br/>
And now I must also confess that because I'm totally immune to poison <br/>
ivy, I don't always pay attention or even recognize it when I plant.  <br/>
Sooo.... while I went ahead and posted the clues to Charlotte's Web, <br/>
please realize that the box is attached to a dormant PI vine <br/>
<embarassed grin="">.  Dummy me, I didn't even realize it, but MO5 clued <br/>
me in.  Maybe during the March event, someone can give me a lesson on <br/>
identifying PI.  LOL!<br/>
<br/>
I will try to get out there in the next couple of weeks to move the <br/>
box to a nearby, but hopefully PI-free location.  So make sure you <br/>
print currently clues before you go!<br/>
