                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL --- I am still laughing -- I too got the hysteric call -- barely <br>
understanding anyhting other than THE BUS -- and a terrible way of <br>
prouncing Tawakoni -- (still laughing about that) -- I am stuck with <br>
the mother (who is drama herself) so I was unable to go -- but I <br>
prayed all the way that You two would beat Barefoot Lucy there -- <br>
lol --- but I too knew we had an hour on her --- <br>
<br>
Sorry Lucy - but we REALLY WANTED THE BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
<br>
Frogkisses - I just minutes ago found out you jetted to my house -- <br>
lol -- thank you so much --- I really wanted to go -- but can't <br>
leave mom in hysterics--- but then when I got the text that you had <br>
it in hand -- lol --- my moms mood became happy - as she is <br>
convinced we have lost our minds -- especially since recently <br>
catching a flea - cootie -- and digging in a grave yard -- SO I am <br>
convinced we should have tied her up - gaged her - and stuck her in <br>
your trunk --- then I too could have witnessed the barreling down <br>
trails to get the bus!  PS --- THANK GOD FOR CRUISE CONTROL -- that <br>
would be hard to explain to DPS -- (Mr. Officer I MUST beat a  <br>
Barefooted lady and any other friendly Texas Letterboxer to a <br>
mystery bus - hidden in a lake....lol)<br>
<br>
DANG the stories our kids will have.........I will be by tomorrow -- <br>
Homemade Pizza on Easter is a new concept -- please  take pics -- I <br>
am surely going to come around to the LA way of life in backwoods <br>
texas........<br>
<br>
Thank you for thanking of me! I love you guys ----<br>
<br>
AND WE GOT THE BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br>
