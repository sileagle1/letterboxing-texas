understanding anyhting other than THE BUS -- and a terrible way of <br/>
prouncing Tawakoni -- (still laughing about that) -- I am stuck with <br/>
the mother (who is drama herself) so I was unable to go -- but I <br/>
prayed all the way that You two would beat Barefoot Lucy there -- <br/>
lol --- but I too knew we had an hour on her --- <br/>
<br/>
Sorry Lucy - but we REALLY WANTED THE BUS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/>
<br/>
Frogkisses - I just minutes ago found out you jetted to my house -- <br/>
lol -- thank you so much --- I really wanted to go -- but can't <br/>
leave mom in hysterics--- but then when I got the text that you had <br/>
it in hand -- lol --- my moms mood became happy - as she is <br/>
convinced we have lost our minds -- especially since recently <br/>
catching a flea - cootie -- and digging in a grave yard -- SO I am <br/>
convinced we should have tied her up - gaged her - and stuck her in <br/>
your trunk --- then I too could have witnessed the barreling down <br/>
trails to get the bus!  PS --- THANK GOD FOR CRUISE CONTROL -- that <br/>
would be hard to explain to DPS -- (Mr. Officer I MUST beat a  <br/>
Barefooted lady and any other friendly Texas Letterboxer to a <br/>
mystery bus - hidden in a lake....lol)<br/>
<br/>
DANG the stories our kids will have.........I will be by tomorrow -- <br/>
Homemade Pizza on Easter is a new concept -- please  take pics -- I <br/>
am surely going to come around to the LA way of life in backwoods <br/>
texas........<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for thanking of me! I love you guys ----<br/>

talker on my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; phone. After thinking about the conversation, this is what I <br/>
hear.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; "Stacy..we need to get in our cars NOW and go to Wills Point." <br/>
OMG! I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; say. The bus The bus!"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Turns out Texas Pokey saw the post 4 minutes after it was <br/>
posted. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; throw the kids in the car. Yes I buckled up Tadpole in his car <br/>
seat.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Luckily the diaper bag was packed and the car was full of gas. <br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; head towards Txtatas to get hernot knowing if she is going <br/>
with us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; yet. Hee hee. Second call from TP that TT cannot go this time. <br/>
Darn<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It!!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I make a U-turn and race for the freeway. After hitting the <br/>
drive<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thru for the older boys, I race for Lake Tawakoni SP. I had to <br/>
put<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the cruise control on to control my speed down the I20. Going <br/>
70mph<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; never seemed so slow. Thank goodness I was there not that long <br/>
ago<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and still remember how to get there. If you know meI have no <br/>
memory<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of where places are located or how to get home from them. My<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instructions from TP are "if you get there before metackle <br/>
anyone in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our way to the bus." Hmmm..should be interesting.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Upon arrival to the park I jump from the car, scan the parking <br/>
lot to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; see if I recognize any cars from Bastrop. Nopethank goodness. <br/>
No<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; tackling necessary. TP pulls in next to me within minutes of my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; arrival. I leave my kids and the baby at the car and the rest <br/>
of us<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; just about run down the trail. After walking and sinking in <br/>
poison<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ivy/oak I we make it to the tree.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; SO AT 4:12 THE TEXAS TOUR BUS 2 has been busjacked.<br/>
