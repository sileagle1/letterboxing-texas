                    <div class="plaintext-content">I thought I'd share a story about the adventures of my General <br>
Sherman letterbox in Rusk State Park.  It was first reported missing <br>
by the Boxalots on June 29.  I replaced the box with a new box and <br>
stamp and a new location in early August after an unsuccessful <br>
attempt at finding it. The old box was found by a new letteboxing <br>
family on October 1, while attempting to find the new box. They <br>
realized when they found the new one, exactly where it was supposed <br>
to be, that they had found the old one.  They graciously took the <br>
old box, notified me, and mailed it to me.  The logbook tells an <br>
interesting story.  The earliest entry, by other than known <br>
letterboxers, was on May 12 when someone named Tim and Nick stamped <br>
my General Sherman train stamp in with the marker I had provided in <br>
the box and signed and dated it.  On May 20, a family from <br>
Duncanville did the same and put a note "Was great to find this on <br>
our little walk".  On June 4, the Richard family stamped in with my <br>
stamp and left the note "Great end to our weekend trip".  Next was <br>
Dan B. and Brittney B. on June 10 "Leaving only footprints".  June <br>
17, Troop 1444 signed in (all of them) with a note "Thanks for the <br>
fun".  June 18, the Rhoads and McCaffertys.  June 21, the Call <br>
family from Marshall signed and stamed the book.  June 25 found <br>
Aymztx from Fort Worth signing in with a personal stamp.  June 29 is <br>
when the Boxalots attempted to find the box, but couldn't.  July 2, <br>
the Cains from New Caney stamped and wrote a note "This is cool!!".  <br>
On September 3, a family from Nevada, Texas signed in and on <br>
September 21, a family from Crosby, Texas stamped and signed in.  <br>
That brings us to October 1, when the new boxers found the box lying <br>
on the ground next to the railroad track.<br>
I think it's pretty amazing that, for almost 5 months, this <br>
letterbox just hung out in the state park.  I guess visitors would <br>
just find it and, out of curiosity, open it and sign it, then leave <br>
it someplace where someone else could find it.  Who says you have to <br>
hide your boxes?  Just leave 'em lying around and they'll be found.  <br>

<div>So glad this box is safe!  We had a great time that day in Rusk - but were sad that we didn't find your box.  Always worry that something terrible has happened.  I find the history of this box amazing - I can imagine a young child walking along and poking around that area - then finding the box and taking it back to the campsite to show friends and family - and then ----who knows where it goes!  It had its own "march" around the park, so to speak!  Glad all is well - if you replant - we would love to "relook!"</div>

already making the rounds of the park by that time, chillin' out at <br>
the picnic table or taking a ride on the train, who knows?  I've <br>
already replaced the box with a duplicate stamp and a new location, <br>
similar to the old location, but farther on down the line.  I might <br>
place the old box with a new name in Harrisburg if I can find an <br>
appropriate place.  That's where the General Sherman (the first <br>
railroad train in Texas) was located.  When you come back through <br>
Rusk, look for the new box, still listed as General Sherman on LbNA.<br>

                    <html><body><div>Sounds a lot like bookcrossing. I wonder how long a letterbox could really last like that. It's amazing that you found it intact. Thank you so much for sharing this story with us. The further along I get into letterboxing the more exciting it gets. You really never know what might happen next. With hobbies like knitting (I am not knocking knitting, please don't take it the wrong way, I'm about to break out the huge suitcase on rollers for knitting Christmas stuff), so as I was saying when I interupted myself, knitting is pretty predictible. The worst that could happen is you run out of a color and they change the dye lot on you. With letterboxing, you just don't know. Bears, lost boxes, snakes, scratches from the thorny bush that you were warned about. . .</div> <div> </div> <div>Thanks again,</div> <div>Janet<br/><br/><b><i>Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter &lt;janet@redbarnretreat.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote class="replbq" style="PADDING-LEFT: 5px;
