Of course, it was dark at the campfire and there was all that smoke from IRA burning and his close call over the flames.  Nice picture, I'd recognize you anywhere since I am acquainted with the original occupants of the circus train.  Silver Eagle must have taken your picture with my old Brownie Hawkeye when he was trying to fix it and it accidentally went off.<br>

I guess it is time to bury the hatchet, so next time I acutally see you I will do so.  Bring your buddy BOZO, and y'all can share the chopping block.   Until then I guess I will have to keep looking over my shoulder.   <br>
