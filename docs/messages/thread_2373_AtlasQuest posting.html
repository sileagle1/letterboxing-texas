<br/>
Hello!<br/>
<br/>
I personally know the family that the posting you<br/>
referred to is from.  I met PurpleinTex originally at<br/>
the homeschool co-op that my girls and I attend.  Her<br/>
daughter Tana is in my daughter's Girl Scout troop. <br/>
They are a very sweet family.  Tana brought a smile to<br/>
everyone's face in our local Christmas parade Thursday<br/>
night, she proudly donned a Lemon Cooler cookie<br/>
costume..antlers and a flashing red nose and waved<br/>
enthusiastically as she wished everyone a very Merry<br/>
Christmas.  She is an excellent example for the other<br/>
girls in our troop in the holiday spirit department.<br/>
<br/>
Barefoot Lucy was kind enough to come to one of our<br/>
troop meetings a few weeks ago and show us how to hand<br/>
carve stamps.  Tana made a ladybug, it was very cute<br/>
but she was disappointed in how it turns out...so if<br/>
you happen to see her first attempt at hand-carving in<br/>
one of your logbooks please take the time to comment<br/>
on it. <br/>
<br/>
They would greatly appreciate your continued prayers,<br/>
it will be a very trying Christmas for them yet again<br/>
this year with the possibility of her husband having<br/>
to endure brain surgery.<br/>
<br/>
She will definitely be at the mini-gathering in<br/>
January that Barefoot Lucy is hosting in Rusk, and I<br/>
will do my best to talk her into coming with me to the<br/>
one in March so you should get the chance to meet her soon.<br/>
<br/>
