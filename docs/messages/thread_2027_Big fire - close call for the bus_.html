<div>The Tour Bus is safe.  Yesterday I picked up the bus (it was just a 
couple of miles from my house! I couldn't let it be so near and ignore it!) 
Today, the park where it had been was involved in a huge grassfire which 
destroyed about 15 acres.  While the park was burning, the tour bus 
passengers were enjoying iced tea in my kitchen instead of becoming ashes.  
Lucky folks!  Soon, after they all recover from their near tragedy, they'll 
all be back on the road again.  --

<div>Well, some of them might not have been drinking tea, actually.  It's 
been pretty lively with all of them around here.  Somewhere between a San 
Antonio bar and Billy Bob's Texas, you might say.  All pretty hot and tired 
and thirsty, I guess, since they've been cooped up together in that bus!

<div>You mention bars in San Antonio, and all I can think about is a long skinny bar I went to with co-workers on the boardwalk there.  One of our members had some very heated words with a local patron and we decided it was time to get him back to our hotel.  We had a heck of a time getting out, it being long, skinny and crowded - and the fact that I had been cornered for some half an hour by an odd sort of character near the door (I have a weirdo magnet that keeps life interesting) after everyone else in my party migrated to the other end of the bar.  I had only just broken free when the situation got critical and we had to pass the odd guy again on the way out and he wasn't finished talking to me.
