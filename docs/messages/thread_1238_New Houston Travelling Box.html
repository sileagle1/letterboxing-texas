<div>Ok you all, I'm getting ready to introduce a new 
travelling box (sort of like the tour bus) and I wanted to tell you a little 
about it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>You know the saying, "Nice place to visit, but I 
wouldn't want to live there", well, I read someplace (I can't remember where) 
that Houston is the opposite of that.  In order to really appreciate 
Houston's charms you have to be a long time resident (first of all, it takes a 
long time to drive to them!) and also because Houston is the sort of place that 
grows on you.  I love Houston, I feel like it is the home that I've been 
looking for my whole life.  In honor of this I have created a box called 
"Houston's Hidden Treasures".  The "rules" are this:  when you find 
it, grab it.  Take it home, decide where you are going to plant it next, 
add your stamp, and let us all know in the logbook why you chose to include your 
particular spot.  It doesn't matter if it is a park, a bar, a library, 
it just has to be in Houston (or less than about a half hour drive out of the 
city limits.)  Then post your clues on this list, and also e mail them to 
me off list.  I'm going to add it to the main LBNA sight as well, so that 
Houston boxers who don't participate on this talk list have a chance to 
look as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope this makes sense, thanks to Dewberry for 
answering all my questions, and sorry to all of you out there not lucky enough 
to live in this crazy town!  Clues to its first stop should be out this 
weekend.  -Mother of Five </div></body></html>

<div>I love Houston, too! Got here from Chicago, by way of Jackson, TN and Dallas, about 30 years ago, and I wouldn't live anywhere else! If I'm not mistaken, it is already "this weekend", being, as it is, Friday night, and I am ready to go!</div>

<br/>
NOW - you have completely caught my attention with<br/>
this.  You have me really wishing I could move to<br/>
Houston, if for no other reason than to participate in<br/>
your box.  I've never lived anywhere that I didn't<br/>
like or learn to like, but now I'm curious what sorts<br/>
of cool things I would discover in Houston!  I've<br/>
spent a little time there and I have my fave things to<br/>
do while I'm there, but I've always had a feeling<br/>
there was so much more...and now, my curiosity is<br/>
totally engaged!<br/>
<br/>
Y'all are gonna have to let me (and others maybe) live<br/>
vicariously through this box - as you find it, tell us<br/>
about the cool places it's been, okay?<br/>

been looking for my whole life.  In honor of this I have created a box
called "<st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:city>'s
Hidden Treasures".  The "rules" are this:  when you
find it, grab it.  Take it home, decide where you are going to plant it
next, add your stamp, and let us all know in the logbook why you chose to
include your particular spot.  It doesn't matter if it is a park, a bar,
a library, it just has to be in <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:city>
(or less than about a half hour drive out of the city limits.)  Then post
your clues on this list, and also e mail them to me off list.  I'm going
to add it to the main LBNA sight as well, so that <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Houston</st1:place></st1:city> boxers who don't participate on this
talk list have a chance to look as well.</span><o:p></o:p></p>

&gt; Ya know, I have always wanted to live in Austin,<br/>
&gt; especially after I travelled there frequently on<br/>
&gt; business for a few years.  It is one of those towns<br/>
&gt; that you have to spend a little time in to get the<br/>
&gt; nuances.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; NOW - you have completely caught my attention with<br/>
&gt; this.  You have me really wishing I could move to<br/>
&gt; Houston, if for no other reason than to participate in<br/>
&gt; your box.  I've never lived anywhere that I didn't<br/>
&gt; like or learn to like, but now I'm curious what sorts<br/>
&gt; of cool things I would discover in Houston!  I've<br/>
&gt; spent a little time there and I have my fave things to<br/>
&gt; do while I'm there, but I've always had a feeling<br/>
&gt; there was so much more...and now, my curiosity is<br/>
&gt; totally engaged!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Y'all are gonna have to let me (and others maybe) live<br/>
&gt; vicariously through this box - as you find it, tell us<br/>
&gt; about the cool places it's been, okay?<br/>

&gt; &gt; Ok you all, I'm getting ready to introduce a new<br/>
&gt; &gt; travelling box (sort of like the tour bus) and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wanted to tell you a little about it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; You know the saying, "Nice place to visit, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; wouldn't want to live there", well, I read someplace<br/>
&gt; &gt; (I can't remember where) that Houston is the<br/>
&gt; &gt; opposite of that.  In order to really appreciate<br/>
&gt; &gt; Houston's charms you have to be a long time resident<br/>
&gt; &gt; (first of all, it takes a long time to drive to<br/>
&gt; &gt; them!) and also because Houston is the sort of place<br/>
&gt; &gt; that grows on you.  I love Houston, I feel like it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the home that I've been looking for my whole<br/>
&gt; &gt; life.  In honor of this I have created a box called<br/>
&gt; &gt; "Houston's Hidden Treasures".  The "rules" are this:<br/>
&gt; &gt;  when you find it, grab it.  Take it home, decide<br/>
&gt; &gt; where you are going to plant it next, add your<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp, and let us all know in the logbook why you<br/>

&gt; &gt; answering all my questions, and sorry to all of you<br/>
&gt; &gt; out there not lucky enough to live in this crazy<br/>
&gt; &gt; town!  Clues to its first stop should be out this<br/>
&gt; &gt; weekend.  -Mother of Five <br/>
