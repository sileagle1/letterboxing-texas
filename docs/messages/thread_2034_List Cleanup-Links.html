<div>#1 Question:  Is the Houston yahoo group active at all anymore?  Can I delete that link?  Does anyone care if I do?  Not a problem to leave it, but I'd rather get rid of it if it is obsolete.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>#2 Question: If you have a link to your site posted in the Links section, I have very likely moved it as I created subcategories for links.  If you don't like where I put your link, feel free to move it.  If where I moved it to makes sense, but you have it linked elsewhere, you may need to update your link elsewhere.

<div>#3 Comment: Take a look at the links section and see if it makes sense to you.  Feel free to add links, or even subcategories if you have any really good letterboxing resources that you don't see listed.<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy
