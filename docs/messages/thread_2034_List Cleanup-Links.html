<div>#2 Question: If you have a link to your site posted in the Links section, I have very likely moved it as I created subcategories for links.  If you don't like where I put your link, feel free to move it.  If where I moved it to makes sense, but you have it linked elsewhere, you may need to update your link elsewhere.
