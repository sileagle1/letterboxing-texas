she is coming to Dallas area soon and would like<br>
to be contacted by letterboxers from that area to<br>

She lives in Idaho and I was lucky enough to find<br>
some of her boxes last year.  I must say she is a<br>
great carver and I hope she leaves a few boxes while<br>
visiting.  Wish I could be there when she comes, but<br>
I'm sure our North Texas boxers will show her our<br>
great Southern Hospitality.  Contact her directly<br>
via email if you are interested.  Thanks.<br>

<div>That's good news!  I for one would love to meet Cadenza and will be 
very excited if she decides to honor us with a few letterboxes in the DFW area, 
and hope she can visit some of ours while she's here!  Thanks for the 
notice.  -- Viewfinder of tx2chic</div></font></body></html>
