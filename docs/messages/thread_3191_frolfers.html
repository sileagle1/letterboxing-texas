<div>That sounds like a case of someone having entirely too much time on their hands. Sad. On the bright side, I'm glad you were able to find it before it went missing.</div>

I don't know if you remember, but on the day that I found it, I had to wait forever for a group of frolfers to play through the area so as not to draw attention to where it was hidden. Don't keep it retired for long.... just rehide it somewhere else.

But with the sport becoming more and more popular, I'm going to have to rethink some of my future hiding places.
