That first gathering was memorable and the subsequent gatherings in and near the park have been like "going home" in a letterboxing sense. It was there that letterboxing really sank in for me, when I quit feeling like someone who wanted to letterbox but couldn't get it off the ground (so few boxes in my area way back then!), when I realized my family could be a part of the letterboxing community. Little did we know back then how much it would grow! I hope that we do as PuddleSplasher suggested, and make plans for a gathering in the future so we can go and re-establish the park for letterboxing.</div>

<div>I love that story, Barefoot Lucy! I can just picture it. When we came to the Bastrop TALE a couple of years ago, we stayed in one of the CCC cabins in the State Park. I fell in love with the park, the trails, the CCC buildings and especially the night songs of Houston Toads at the lake in the park! I have been worried sick about that beautiful park and the surrounding homes and community, and the wonderful wildlife who make that their home. One night while we were there, we hiked down to the Wildlife Viewing Area, and although we didn't see anything too much out of the ordinary that evening, it was so peaceful. Although I rank Mission Tejas as my favorite "event park" so far, Bastrop is a very, very close second, and will be anxious to return.</div>

<div>It's going to be sad to see the effects of the fires on Bastrop State Park.  That first gathering was memorable and the subsequent gatherings in and near the park have been like "going home" in a letterboxing sense.  It was there that letterboxing really sank in for me, when I quit feeling like someone who wanted to letterbox but couldn't get it off the ground (so few boxes in my area way back then!), when I realized my family could be a part of the letterboxing community. Little did we know back then how much it would grow!  I hope that we do as PuddleSplasher suggested, and make plans for a gathering in the future so we can go and re-establish the park for letterboxing.</div>

<p><span>If anyone needs them, I have the clues for Lost Pines, O-Knots, and Mayfield Park.  Ill type them up and get them distributed to some people so we have more copies available.  Unfortunately the O-Knots series is in Bastrop state park and may not have survived.  Even if the boxes did, the clues are all based on the orienteering markers which may be gone.  </span></p>

<p>Looks like the old site containing Eoghan's boxes is prohibiting access. The only other way I know to see the old clues (besides getting them from PI Joe) is to do a search for Eoghan in the LBNA Yahoo Talklist. Since we used to have to send our clues to the Webmaster for him to post, some of his clues are in old messages.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Christine Borgfeld" &lt;christine@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Speaking of maintaining boxes, I've noticed that the link to Eoghan's boxes<br/>&gt; is no longer working.
