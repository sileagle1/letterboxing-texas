<div>Dont nix carving so soon. There are many easy ways to do image transfers onto a carving block to carve. No drawing required. Check out the tutorials on Atlasquest  <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/">http://www.atlasquest.com/tutorials/</a></div>
<div>I have an 8 year old daughter as well who loves to go box with me. I hope you both find this a fun added activity to your cacheing pastime. </div>
