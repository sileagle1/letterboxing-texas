<div>Congratulations, p ?uest! I'd say those of us in the DFW metroplex were pretty excited to see it finally drive up to our area - based on the fact that the wheels never stop spinning before it's scooped up. In fact, at this rate, the possibility of it being accidentally discovered by someone before it's rescued by a letterboxes is pretty slim since I doesn't idle in the elements for more than a few hours each time.</div>
