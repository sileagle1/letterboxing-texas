I am Sea Dove, my wife is Peacekeeper (Dove), my daughter is Splish <br>
Splash (Duck), and my son is Liberty Eagle.  We make up the Birds of <br>
a Feather Family.<br>
<br>
My wife was introduced to letterboxing in September 2003 via another <br>
mom in Girl Scouts who had seen the Family Fun magazine article. She <br>
decided to approach my daughter's Girl Scout troop about <br>
letterboxing.<br>
<br>
The girls liked the idea and my wife began to plan which letterboxes <br>
they would attempt. She was looking over the Hodges Bend letterbox <br>
and the Sugar Land letterbox as they were the closest ones to us. <br>
She had been reviewing Silver Eagle's website for information and <br>
had shown it to me.<br>
<br>
The next day I was visiting with a co-worker and mentioned <br>
letterboxing. Come to find out, he was Silver Eagle.  <br>
<br>
A quick gathering of the Girl Scout Troop (plus my son) was held on <br>
the first Saturday in October and Silver Eagle came to talk about <br>
letterboxing to the girls. Afterwards, they exchanged stamps and <br>
went to find the Sugar Land Letterbox.<br>
<br>
Our website for letterboxing is <br>
http://www.geocities.com/birdsofafeather_lbox<br>
<br>
We have placed two letterboxes on at trip to the Rio Grande Valley <br>
while visiting my parents and grandparents who are Winter Texans. <br>
The website has the clues for the boxes.<br>
<br>
The boys are ahead on the finds as we went letterboxing while the <br>
girls were on a ski trip in Colorado and we had a trip to the Corpus <br>
Christi area. <br>
<br>
I am hoping to make it out to Bastrop with the kids for the Texas <br>
Event. <br>
