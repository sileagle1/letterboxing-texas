                    <html><body><div>I had contacted the Freshwater Fish Hatchery about placing a box on their facility in anticipation of the gathering (which has now been moved to Purtis Creek SP, but oh well).  I heard back from one of the staff members there just a few minutes ago and received very positive feedback for a box at their site.  She had a few concerns, but she also mentioned that they had been planning to do a geocaching program on their site, so she was open to having a letterbox as well.

<div>We discussed the possibility of folding it in to their educational program (my intended box is a Guadalupe Bass I did for scout camp), and while I had mixed feelings about that, I also began to think that this may be a good way to have a high profile box in a TPWD facility (albeit not a state park) to use along with Mike's boxes out in Franklin Mountains for future reference as discussions go on about letterboxing on state facilities.
