                    <div class="plaintext-content">As you all know, I've been in contact with the Texas Parks and <br>
Wildlife Department regarding their policy for letterboxing in State <br>
Parks.  I hadn't heard from Mr. Good lately, so I sent him an email <br>
today to see if any progress had been made.  He sent me the <br>
following reply:<br>
<br>
"I had to spend a couple of weeks in the field unexpectedly, with <br>
limited email access, so I'm way behind on emails.  I have drafted a <br>
new policy that will include letterboxing and hope to get it <br>
approved by the end of the month.  I don't foresee any opposition to <br>
this activity.  Kevin Good"<br>
<br>
As you can see, Mr. Good hasn't elaborated on what the new policy <br>
might be, but I think we can assume it will be included with <br>
geocaching as an approved activity with restrictions.  I found the <br>
following questions and answers on the official TPWD website <br>
concerning geocaching which might indicate how they will also see <br>
letterboxing:<br>
<br>
<br>
Q: Is geocaching allowed in Texas State Parks?<br>
A: Yes, geocaching can be a great way to enjoy parks and geocaches <br>
can also add to the educational experience of site visits.<br>
<br>
Q: What should I do if I want to place a geocache in a Texas State <br>
Park or Historic Site? <br>
A: First, visit with the park or historic site superintendent and <br>
discuss the location where you intend to place the cache. Some parks <br>
or historic sites may be entirely off-limits to geocaching due to <br>
the sensitive resources contained within the sites. The <br>
superintendent may limit placement of caches in some areas due to <br>
archeological or historical resources, endangered species or <br>
concerns for visitor safety. If the placement is approved, obtain a <br>
copy of a geocache permit in order to complete the contact and <br>
placement information. <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think hunting has a better lobby than we do and hunters spend more <br>
money.  If you get the TPWD magazine, you know that they are always <br>
featuring articles about hunting and fishing. I've yet to see an <br>
article about geocaching or letterboxing. They are heavily funded by <br>
hunting and fishing licenses.  Am I being cynical?  I have asked Mr. <br>
Good on two occasions to meet with us personally and, while he <br>
hasn't rejected the request, he hasn't addressed it either.  He's <br>
just ignored it.  I suggest that we wait and see what the new policy <br>
has to say.  If there are restrictions that we can't live with, <br>
maybe then we could mount a campaign to see how many letterboxes we <br>
can place in state parks legally.  I mean, let's all go to a state <br>
park and fill out permits and take up the rangers' time showing us <br>
where we can hide boxes, then go ahead and place a lot of boxes.  If <br>
they end up being removed, consider them expendable.  If you can, go <br>
back and place more, within their rules.  At least they would become <br>
aware of letterboxing, and maybe even learn to appreciate it. <br>
