  someone, but didn't even know where to start.<br/></blockquote></div>

<div>The first few boxes I placed, I left clear, but everytime I checked on 
them, those blue tops were visible and I was sure they'd soon go missing, so I 
went back and covered them all in camo tape and now they're really harder to 
spot even if some of the cover gets knocked off; I had noticed that just about 
every box I found anywhere in this area was camo-covered and that really helped 
hide it, but I always leave the bottom uncovered and print in permanent 
markers:  LETTERBOX: PLEASE DO NOT REMOVE and the letterboxing 
website.  I'm also afraid that just a clear container with plastic bags 
inside is pretty likely to be taken for litter and thrown away before anyone 
discovers what's really inside, especially in an area where there might be 
litter thrown into bushes (unfortunately, not too rare in city areas!), and I 
guess I figure that at least the camo covering might get a little more attention 
from a casual finder who might at least check it out before dropping it into a 
trashcan somewhere. -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
