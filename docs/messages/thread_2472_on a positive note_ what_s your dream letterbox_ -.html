the boxes with really tricky clues.  Just finding the park when you <br>
are not a local can be a big challenge.  Also the boxes that require a <br>
lot of research are out of the question when we are on the road.  Last <br>
year we were in Seattle and gave up on finding most as it seemed to <br>
the clues were geared to locals who know the area geographically and <br>
historically.  Thankfully the TX boxes are not so elusive!<br>
Guitarzan loves to solve the tricky ones but it is all a matter of <br>
time.  A few of my boxes at home have difficult clues, written mainly <br>
for local boxers just to make it more fun.  But I also have a second <br>
set of clues for visitors and invite them to contact me for the easy <br>
clue if they wish.  We get so few boxers up north that I'll even roll <br>
out the red carpet if it will help!  Norasta<br>
