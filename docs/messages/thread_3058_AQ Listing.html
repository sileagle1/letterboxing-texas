<p>Hey Mike, that's great to hear! More boxes to find on my trip there <br/>in

<p><span class="938155513-03092007"></span><span class="938155513-03092007">Well - The Culberson County Letterbox will be 
  relatively easy to get to, about 200 feet from the vehicle.  But it is 
  over 100 miles from El Paso.  So unless you are coming in or leaving via 
  US-62/180 through Guadalupe Pass, this one is a bit of a 
  drive.</span></p>
<p><span class="938155513-03092007">The 
  Hudspeth County Letterbox will only be about 20 miles away from the Eastern 
  city limits of El Paso, and only about 12 miles from the Hueco Tanks 
  Letterbox.</span></p>

<p><span class="938155513-03092007">The most

  climb.  But worth it.</span></p>

  remember - we are at 4000 feet+ here, and this is the DESERT!  I don't 
  care if it is December.  BE PREPARED!  Rather dump water at the end 
  of the hike than need water 1/2 way through the hike.  Everything 
  sticks-stabs-bites-burns.  There isn't much shade, so wear a wide-brimmed 
  hat.  It may be 20 F at 0600 and 70 F at 1600.  Sturdy shoes are a 
  MUST - and trekking poles can help.</span></p>

This confused me. I was wondering what was going on. <br/>
We are making another trip to your neck of the woods and I was going<br/>
over what boxes I hadn't gotten last time. To my surprise several I<br/>
had already gotten were listed as I hadn't got them. When I know I<br/>
did. I have the stamp to prove it. The logbook never lies. lol<br/>
This has made it hard to seek out the ones I need. I thought I was<br/>
going crazy. (Again) lol I've be there once.<br/>
Thanks for clearing that up.<br/>

&gt; If you've also logged your finds on LBNA, that will probably be<br/>
easier for<br/>
&gt; you to follow with respect to my boxes since  I didn't remove them<br/>
there.  I<br/>
&gt; haven't yet finished relisting my boxes on AQ and won't for a few<br/>
days, and<br/>
&gt; there are also a couple of boxes that won't be listed there.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Ok that's a good idea.<br/>
Your right I was only looking on AQ. I like to look at the map it to<br/>
see all the boxes in the area.<br/>
I do log on LBNA also so that will make it easier.<br/>
Thanks for the help<br/>
