<br/>
Because y'all are going to be practically right in my backyard next <br/>
weekend, it you be just unAustinish of me if I didn't go leave some <br/>
goodies out for you. So, look for 2 new boxes on AtlasQuest and <br/>
LBNA: Just 'in Case and Pinch! Pinch! (First box by KoolKid, <br/>
formerly known as Riven). <br/>
<br/>
As for my plea for help: Help!  I lost my little red swiss army <br/>
knife! I went placing boxes for the TALE #5 gathering and while I <br/>
was in Lake Bastrop South Shore Park  I lost my knife! This was not <br/>
an expensive knife, but the sentiment that goes with it makes it <br/>
valuable to me. One of my friends had given it to me, not for any <br/>
special occasion, but just because. Most people give me foofy stuff <br/>
like bubble bath, lotion, earrings, etc... while that it nice of <br/>
them, I don't use it as much as my little knife. This friend took <br/>
the time to look at what I really like to do and though of something <br/>
useful to me! Really, I don't think it is worth much money. I think <br/>
she got it at a pawn shop, but I LOVE IT! <br/>
<br/>
So, here is where I think I lost it: My son and I ate dinner at the <br/>
pavilion, cleaned up, took everything to the car, and went for one <br/>
last hike. We walked across the parking lot, along the boat docks, <br/>
and into the woods. After going down and up the stairs, KoolKid <br/>
stopped to pick up a walking stick. I took out my knife to cut some <br/>
of the little branches off it so he could hold it easier, and stupid <br/>
me, instead of putting my knife back into my backpack, I just put it <br/>
into my pants pocket. After a little while, we came to the end of <br/>
the little trail near the camping loop and I knelt down to tie my <br/>
shoe on  the trail right over the spot where a culvert (metal pipe <br/>
to direct water) goes under the trail.  My little knife must have <br/>
fell out of my pocket right there! When I felt my pocket for it, it <br/>
was gone! I looked all over the place there, but because it was late <br/>
already, there wasn't enough light to find it. If you wouldn't mind <br/>
stopping to look for it when you are hiking around the park, I would <br/>
be indebted to you! In fact, there is a reward in it for you if you <br/>
find it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, <br/>

If you can't place who I am, that is because I read all of the time <br/>
and post seldomly. I have one photo in the photo's section. <br/>
