                    <div class="plaintext-content">For those unfamiliar with LBNA I should point out that these aren't the only ways to search for clues.  In fact, these search methods are relatively new since LBNA was originally designed to use maps, and still does that quite well.  From the main page just click Clues and you will see a map of North America with links to states and countries.  If you click on Texas you will see a map of our state divided into 7 regions with all the counties shown.  When you click a region you will get a list of all non-mystery boxes in that region sorted by county.<br>
<br>
If you just want to see recently added boxes you can click on What's New from the main page to see if any new boxes have been posted to an area that interests you.  The default is to show the most recent 25 boxes, but you can change that number.  I usually check this once or twice a week.<br>
<br>
BTW, the Texas map didn't always look like it does now.  Back when I started letterboxing in 2002 the regions were divided the way the Texas Tourist Bureau has it:<br>
<br>
http://replay.web.archive.org/20030402002638/http://www.letterboxing.org/tx/tx.htm<br>
<br>
This was ok when there were few boxes, but it soon became difficult to narrow a search down, especially the Gulf Coast Region that included cities from Brownsville to Beaumont.  So I redesigned the map into geographic regions, got TX Letterboxers  to make suggestions, sent it off to Wes, the webmaster at that time, and waited for him to implement it.  And waited.  And waited.  It took over 2 years to finally get the map the way it looks now, but there were still problems.  He had put several counties in the wrong regions so they showed up in the wrong places during searches.  I had to compile a list of all 254 counties and what regions they belonged in, send it off to Wes, and wait another year for it to get straightened out.  Nothing against Wes, he had a lot of other things on his plate, but it was frustrating at times and I hated being a nag.  It was worth it though, and that is one of the reasons I am such a loyal LBNA user.<br>
