                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our plans for Thanksgiving were cancelled this morning.  We were to go <br/>
to my parents lakehouse and spend the rest of the week with them.  <br/>
They are both sick though and said they didn't feel like driving down <br/>
there just to get in a different bed.  I understand, no problem.  But <br/>
they have the turkey and stuffing, we have the vegetable, rolls, and <br/>
pie fixins.  <br/>
<br/>
Any ideas on what we can do now?<br/>
Anyone from near Ft. Sam Houston in San Antonio, I was thinking of <br/>
heading that way since my son has an on post pass for the day.  Where <br/>
could we stay down there.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks <br/>
