<div>Yes, my letterbox at Bastrop was okay.  I planted it after the 
fire.  I had a hard time finding it though, because of the subtle trail 
changes.  So sorry to hear Lost Pine Warbler didn’t make it.  I fear 
most boxes didn’t.  <img alt="Sad smile" src="cid:FE47AD00868E4428AA6BFE1937563AF5@BonniesNetbook"/></div>
