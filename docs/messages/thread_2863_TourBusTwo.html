Should we all chip in a few cents for fuel to get TTB-1 going again? Or maybe Bonnie and Clyde have commandeered that bus! Could this be a hostage situation? If so, can we negotiate? What are the requirements for a release of the passengers/bus? Do we need a mediator? How about freeing the hostages, and we'll all look the other way? How about returning the bus to the location where it was taken hostage and post the ransom note letting us know it is available to be rescued.</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">El Lobo and Star Seeker still have TTB2, I believe.  They have both <br>
been very busy this summer.  Star Seeker has been working on her <br>
master's thesis and graduated last Friday with her degree.  They <br>
also drove up to Boston, and letterboxed on the way, I'm sure.  We <br>
haven't talked to them lately, but I'm sure the Tour Bus will be <br>
leaving its West Texas station sometime soon.  We know it's in good <br>
hands.<br>
