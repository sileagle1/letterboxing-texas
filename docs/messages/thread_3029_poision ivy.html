<div><font size="2">My personal experience is that after it starts to blister, it just has to run it course which for me is two weeks. It will continue to blister and itch and ooze! I may have exposed myself to some yesterday and I immedietely put Purel hand sanitizer all over my exposed skin, which is said to help. (I think it has before.) I carry a small container in my backpack. Last time I got an outbreak, I went to the drugstore and he just told me to use an hydrocortizone cream at that point to help with the itching. I like the gel, Ivarest too, but NOTHING stops it until it dries up and goes away. Technol is the best thing to use right after exposure.... so I've heard, but I didn't have any last night and didn't have time to stop and get any. I'm hoping I'm not a big miserable mess by tonight. (It usually takes me about 24 hours to develop a rash to it.) Good luck!</font></div>

<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial">You have waited too long for a lot of 
products. There is a very expensive product called Zanfel (like $35 for a 
tiny tube) that really does help it stop spreading, but at the blisterering wet 
rashy stage, most products don't do a thing. One thing that can cause relief, 
albeit temporary, is heat. When you heat poison ivy it releases the histimines 
which is what makes you itch. So if you are having trouble sleeping because 
you are going insane, you can run as hot a water as you can stand on your poison 
ivy. It will feel good in a very evil sort of way, just like scratching. It will 
also make you want to scratch. But when you stop the heat, you will have a 
window where you don't itch, and that window is a perfect time to fall asleep! A 
hair dryer works really well too. But I agree with the last post, it is 
about two weeks until you are better and you will itch even when it is 
scabby.</font></div>
<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial">One extreme thing I have done that really, 
really does help although it sounds awful...in some of your extremities (hands, 
feet, legs) you can scratch the worst parts until you break the skin. (Sounds 
awful but feels wonderful) then pour vinegar on the area. It burns and 
cauterizes the area and that part quits itching. If it still itches, you didn't 
scratch it hard enough. This doesn't work on sensitive areas though and is too 
painful for some places. It isn't painful at all really for legs, hands and 
feet, though. I've done this, my husband has done this and it 
works.</font></div>
<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial"></font> </div>
<div><font color="#800000" face="Arial">There is a wonderful product called Tecnu 
that you can put on after you've been exposed to poison ivy and it really does 
keep you from getting it. So each night after letterboxing, you can tecnu up and 
not have this problem again!</font></div>

PS- We were in Athens all day Saturday and these are<br/>
all excellent boxes. We even picked up 2 hitchhikers.<br/>
I only mentioned this because I have been reading<br/>
about a meet on Sept. 22.<br/>

When I got there, I was disheartened to find that she was also covered with PI and was scratching like mad during my entire visit. She told me she got it from her Labrador retrievers who would get the oil on their coats as they ran through the woods, and then nuzzle up to her and share. She said the oil can also be airborne when people burn it.  Basically, she gave me some cortisone cream which did little to help the itching, and I had to wait it out.</font></div>

<div> </div>
<div>One thing you really want to be cautious of is letting the open blisters get infected.  I'm not sure about the antibiotic characteristics of any of what has been mentioned, but you may want to throw some TAO on top of the other stuff for soothing - it may be just enough to stave off infection.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Zanfel is far better than Technu, but as mentioned, it is VERY expensive!  I think it works a little later in the game than Technu, but because of the cost I wouldn't use it myself - I'd rather just ride out a mild case, which is what I usually get.  My daughter, on the other hand, would use Zanfel in a heartbeat if she didn't catch it in time with Technu.

                    <html><body><div>LOL...I know she appreciated the advice!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Our family's last doc refrained from smoking during the exam, but he went out to the desk and wrote up his notes and puffed away.  When I picked up our medical records after he retired, they smelled of smoke.  I normally wouldn't have cared to use a doctor who smoked right in the office, but I loved the way he cussed at my kids when they did something ignorant and wound up in his office.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Really though, he was an old army doc and he cussed like a sailor, but he had a ton of respect for his patients.  He would still make an occasional house call and if you sat in his lobby for more than 15 minutes after your appointment time, he gave you your visit for free - your time was as valuable to you as his was to him.  And he gave scouts and scout leaders free checkups for camp.  And he would see you the day you needed to see him.  And he would load Lightning up with fistfuls of double bubble gum when he left, so much that he couldn't possibly carry it all and always wound up dribbling it out the door, the whole time trying to go back and pick it up again.  
<br/><br/>He was also the doc who, after SJZ's car accident a couple years ago, saw her the Monday after the accident, when her regular doctor would "try to work her in" if she would come sit in his lobby for who knows how long in excruciating pain from her several injuries.  The old doc refused to give her anything more than she already had for pain, which is why we were there, but he said "Why didn't they put her on anti-inflammatories?".  He wrote her a scrip and sent us home, and within hours some of her pain had laid off!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So - I would take a little cigarette smoke in the charts now in favor of good ol' fashioned common sense thinking in a doctor!</div>

 also the doc who, after SJZ's car accident a couple years ago, saw her the Monday after the accident, when her regular doctor would "try to work her in" if she would come sit in his lobby for who knows how long in excruciating pain from her several injuries.  The old doc refused to give her anything more than she already had for pain, which is why we were there, but he said "Why didn't they put her on anti-inflammatories<wbr>?".  He wrote her a scrip and sent us home, and within hours some of her pain had laid off! </wbr></div> <div> </div> <div>So - I would take a little cigarette smoke in the charts now in favor of good ol' fashioned common sense thinking in a doctor!</div> <div> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 8/21/07, <b class="gmail_sendername">Maribeth Jagger</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:cjagger405@earthlink.net">cjagger405@earthlin<wbr>k.net</wbr></a>&gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote class="gmail_quote" style="BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid"> <div style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff"> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div><font size="2">Or like the doctor with an ashtray on his desk counseling you on the prevention of lung cancer.

a doctor, they will probably give you a shot, some<br>
steriod-y thing of some sort.  i had that twice,<br>
because of excessively bad reactions, and it worked<br>
like a charm, to clear up the poison ivy. <br>
<br>
however, it also made me nearly suicidal, which the<br>
doctor did not mention to me at all as a possible side<br>
effect, and said "no way" to me about, when I asked<br>
him about it later.  however, other friends have told<br>
me they had the same side effect, and of course we<br>
have recently seen newspaper article about athletes<br>
have emotional or psychological reactions to steriods.<br>
 so i think it is a valid side effect to be concerned<br>
about, or at least aware of the risk of.<br>
<br>
hope it heals up quickly for you.  it's a drag.<br>
