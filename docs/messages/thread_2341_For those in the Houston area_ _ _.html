school's bookfair.  Because this is my party, we've added a<br>
letterboxing flair to one of the events:<br>
<br>

<br>
You're welcome to swing by and hunt snowmen & snowflake stamps with us<br>
if you happen to be free next Friday afternoon (figuring that'll be as<br>
close to a blizzard as we get here) & have some popcorn.  If you find<br>
me, I may even have a bonus stamp--fingers crossed--it's almost<br>
finished.  <br>
<br>
If you ask for Dewberry, almost everyone will look at you funny. <br>
You'll just have to find me.<br>
