letterboxing weekend last weekend!<br>
<br>
Now by the time you finish reading this, you'll know<br>
exactly what was meant by "guilt", but I'm going to<br>
leave it that you have to go find the boxes I found<br>
this weekend to know where the other two items come<br>
in.<br>
<br>
Well, as I mentioned last week, I intended to spend<br>
last weekend LB'ing since Fearless Fox and Lightning<br>
went on a weekend hike.  I decided I would return to<br>
the area where we held the JEN gathering since I never<br>
did get to go out and search boxes, except the tricky<br>
box placed by Gryzzled Gryphon!  In that light, I<br>
called my bro-in-law and his wife in Kerens and asked<br>
if I could spend the night so I would be perfectly<br>
positioned to hit the trail at first light.  I<br>
gathered my clues and mapped out my plan, and when I<br>
got to Kerens, my bro-in-law fell right into my hands<br>
by suggesting that I get his wife to drive me while I<br>
go find the Corsicana boxes that night.  So off we<br>
went - with one teenager in tow.  My LSS called as we<br>
were leaving McD's (remember, teenager in tow) about<br>
10 p.m. to see where I was (I guess he knew where his<br>
kids were, so he was checking to see where his spouse<br>
was).  I told him we were going to hunt a couple boxes<br>
and he expressed concern - he doesn't like us night<br>
boxing without him.  I told him his bro (a cop) had<br>
assured us it was a safe part of town and besides, we<br>
had a gun with us.  To which he said he "hoped<br>
everyone else was safe."  Funny guy.<br>
<br>
Anyway, we got to the site of the first box in honor<br>
of Wolf Brand Chili, only to find that the gates were<br>
locked at some undetermined time of day!  Hmph.  Well,<br>
we knew where the park was anyway... So we went on to<br>
find the Petroleum Park box.  I love the way Catpawz<br>
find these little out of the way places.  We showed up<br>
there and while I was diligently digging my gloves and<br>
a stick out of the car, my sis-in-law stuck her bare<br>
hand into the hiding place and pulled out the box. <br>
Clearly, I will have to read the disclaimers to her! <br>
Finding that there really WAS something there, she was<br>
intrigued.  I did the deed while they watched, then we<br>
headed back to her house with a 50/50 success rate. <br>
Knowing that she was playing with the hook and was<br>
debating whether to bite, I offered to carve her a<br>
stamp.  She knew exactly what she wanted, so I carved<br>
it and by midnight she had her own personal stamp -<br>
and it was shortly after midnight that she suddenly<br>
realized she had no way to say "No" when I asked her<br>
to get up at the crack of dawn and drive across two<br>
counties to begin letterboxing our way back to her<br>
house.  GUILT!  A wonderful thing!  <br>
<br>
So we got up wayyyy earlier than her alarm clock<br>
acknowledges exists and brushed our teeth and put our<br>
hair up in pony tails, threw on warm old clothes in<br>
layers because it was C-C-C-OLD and left.  I gave her<br>
navigation duties and we headed out across the<br>
countryside.  It was beautiful as the sun came up -<br>
the only problem was that we were heading west and not<br>
east!  We made it to Italy and found Catpawz' passport<br>
box there (nice location) and she took lots of<br>
pictures.  As we were getting out of the car to start<br>
looking, she took the clue book and refused to give it<br>
back.  Hmmm.  I showed her how to go through the whole<br>
process of stamping in and so forth and she got to try<br>
her new stamp.  She deemed herself Flutterby and she<br>
sports a gold fairy stamp.  We jumped in the car and<br>
started moving again and eventually found ourselves in<br>
Cleburne - our intended destination.  I had hoped to<br>
be able to go a little further north to Burleson and<br>
Joshua as well, but I knew she had time constraints so<br>
we didn't try to get on up there.  <br>
<br>
We passed by the cemetery where Delivery Girl's "Where<br>
Have All the Flowers Gone?" box is while we were<br>
trying to figure out how to get to Cleburne State<br>
Park, when suddenly we realized that the big cemetery<br>
we had passed was THE cemetery we would have to find. <br>
Sure enough - and after one of those "this HAS to be<br>
the place, but where is the ????" moments - we found<br>
the box in a very clever hiding spot.  <br>
<br>
We found a place to eat lunch, then headed on out to<br>
Cleburne State Park to find the several boxes there. <br>
Now I learned - again - that all of Texas is NOT the<br>
gentle, rolling hills of East Texas!  I made a mental<br>
note that it is NOT a good idea to <br>
eat and then go letterboxing in CSP, AND that it is a<br>
good idea to wear my hooves when I go back.  Despite<br>
being taken by surprise by the terrain, we had a great<br>
time in the park and thoroughly enjoyed every box we<br>
found there.  We found Delivery Girl's Hot Chicks and<br>
Chick's Rule, and Silver Eagle's Cleburne Catfish, and<br>
we also found Baby Bear's Northern Exposure.  All<br>
great boxes!<br>
<br>
We left Cleburne and headed to Waxahachie, stopping<br>
first to find Celtic Lions' Hole in the Ground box at<br>
the site of the Superconductor Supercollider monster<br>
project.  Very interesting site!  We were interested<br>
in the fact that the windows were clean and there were<br>
huge dumpsters full of fresh trash, despite the<br>
project being abandoned 10 or more years ago.  Now I<br>
haven't mentioned that Flutterby is a newspaper woman,<br>
so she had her camera with her and felt it was worthy<br>
to take pictures.  I got a little uneasy after our<br>
discussion of the clean nature of the site when she<br>
started snapping pictures all around!  I said<br>
"Umm...you ummm...do realize this was the site of a<br>
one of the most secretive non-secret federal project<br>
that was ever doomed to failure?"  To which she<br>
responded "I'll flash 'em my press credentials if they<br>
have any questions..."  Hmmmm.  I wonder what that<br>
meant?  Special jail cells for the press???<br>
<br>
On we went to Getzendaner Park and Viewfinders and<br>
Puddlesplashers boxes there.  As she had done<br>
repeatedly all day long, Flutterby took the clue book<br>
and wouldnt give it up.  After we identified the<br>
trail we needed to begin on, we were distracted by<br>
some teenagers who were using tree service equipment<br>
to hoist themselves wayyyyy up high in the trees and<br>
then swinging themselves across the creek there.  Very<br>
interesting.  They had quite an operation going!  <br>
<br>
We went off in search of Viewfinders Red Barn for JEN<br>
and Puddlesplashers Celebration of the Texas<br>
Countryside.  That is the coolest park and great<br>
little trails.  We located each of the boxes without<br>
attracting undue attention of the tree jumpers,<br>
although we noticed them watching us trying to figure<br>
out if we were watching them.  Lots of fun.  And at<br>
one point, we had another of those I KNOW this is the<br>
right place moments.  Or I should say, Flutterby did.<br>
 Ive had enough of those on my own to know that if I<br>
have any doubt about being in the right place, stop<br>
and rethink it.  I got a kick out of her absolutely<br>
insisting we HAD to be in the right place and the box<br>
was simply not there.  I had a feeling we werent on<br>
track, so I finally wrestled the clue book from her<br>
hands and convinced her we needed to walk a little<br>
further.  We did finally find the box and the clues<br>
fit exactly the place that we eventually got to.  We<br>
had a big laugh about that!<br>
<br>
By the time we finished the Getzendaner boxes, the sun<br>
was setting and we headed back to her house.  The<br>
sunset was just beautiful, but we were driving east<br>
and not west!  We hit her door just as her company was<br>
getting there (the reason we couldnt go on to<br>
Burleson and Joshua) and Ive wondered what they<br>
thought about us showing up disheveled and<br>
ink-stained.  I had gotten a phone call on the way<br>
back that I needed to go on home, so I didnt get a<br>
chance to hear her explain.  Bet it was a good one<br>
though!<br>
<br>
The only unfortunate part of the trip is that I didnt<br>
get to plant two boxes Ive been carrying around for<br>
Navarro County because I had to cut my trip short. <br>
Otherwise though  we found Italy, Chicks Rule, Hot<br>
Chicks, Cleburne Catfish, Northern Exposure, Hole in<br>
the Ground, Petroleum Park, Celebration of the Texas<br>
Countryside (all three), Red Barn for JEN, and Where<br>
Have All the Flowers Gone?  We also found a bonus box<br>
 my first and hers.  We netted some pretty cool<br>
scenery and new terrain, and saw the moon from one<br>
more angle than we expected.  Hopefully Flutterby will<br>
come along with me again some time, but we ARE going<br>
to have to talk about her hogging the clue book.  <br>
