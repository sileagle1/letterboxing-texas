</p><div>Just remember.....</div>
<div>you can hide the Bus in someone's backyard, but that doesn't mean someone who lives far away won't sweep in and snag it first.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last December, the box had FINALLY made it close to the DFW area for the first time. By the time I read about it, Lucy Lockett from east Texas had made a mad dash and confiscated it! A plan started to percolate in my mind, and I watched diligently for the announcement of the next release. Late one night, the first week of January, she announced it had been placed in Tatum State Park in east Texas. Immediately I gassed up my Jeep, set my alarm for 3:00 a.m., was on the road by 3:30 a.m. driving through the eerily vacant streets of Dallas on my way to east Texas. By six a.m. I was at the gate of the park and by 6:15 a.m., I had the BUS safely tucked away in my Jeep. While in the area, I found a few other letterboxes before starting my drive back to the metroplex.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the time I got home and announced I had the Bus, my good friend Barefoot Lucy was pretty steamed that I had stolen the Bus right out of her neighborhood. Apparently I had beat them to the box by a slim margin. That led to a series of good natured jabs back and forth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That's the fun of this box. It moves fast and is (and should be) unpredictable. Since then, I've seen that Bus picked up within a couple of hours of having been announced. So all I can say is, Batty B, be gassed up and ready to scramble, but there's still no guarantee that someone won't get to it first!</div>
