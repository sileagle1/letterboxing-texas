<br/>
If you're taking the free class on Tuesday night, we're going to keep<br/>
the supply list very simple.<br/>
<br/>
If you plan to work on a stamp or two in class, you'll need something<br/>
to carve and something to carve with, plus your usual letterboxing<br/>
kit.<br/>
<br/>
THINGS TO CARVE:<br/>
<br/>
Erasers - Most of the smooth-surface ones work well.  I haven't tried<br/>
the Target $1 specials recently mentioned on the LbNA list.  Some<br/>
smooth erasers have a slightly oily surface that can repel ink, but<br/>
you can try a corner of it at home and see if it picks up ink okay,<br/>
before you carve it.<br/>
<br/>
I have used Sanford's "Magic Rub" erasers and they're okay but not<br/>
fabulous.  But, when you're starting out, you may prefer to invest in<br/>
the least-expensive erasers that will do the job.  So, the Magic Rub<br/>
or other smooth-style erasers are fine to learn with, and also for<br/>
boxes that may vanish in a hurry anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I've heard that some people carve traditional pink erasers.  In my<br/>
opinion, they crumble too easily and absorb ink irregularly, but that<br/>
could be a quirky experience.  For all I know, they work fine.  If you<br/>
already have some on hand and want to try them, go for it.<br/>
<br/>
Pink stuff - At Michael's, Hobby Lobby, etc, there are thickish sheets<br/>
of pink rubber and white rubber that are sold for block printing and<br/>
making rubber stamps.  I've used both happily.  Usually, they cut well<br/>
and hold detailing nicely.  One sheet will make lots &amp; lots of stamps,<br/>
but they're usually more expensive than erasers.<br/>
<br/>
THINGS TO CARVE WITH<br/>
<br/>
Some people love to cut with a small Xacto knife... the kind with the<br/>
pen-style holder.  I have one in an Xacto Gripster handle, and the<br/>
blade is standard... I think it says #11 on it.  It's not my favorite<br/>
tool, but I know many, many letterboxers and stamp carvers who swear<br/>
that it's the best possible tool.<br/>
<br/>
I have also heard of people who can actually carve well with plain ol'<br/>
utility knives, kitchen knives, and so on.  I'm not one of those<br/>
people.<br/>
<br/>
I generally use a traditional block cutting blade (in a holder) that<br/>
are sold in art supply stores.  You may want a couple of different<br/>
sized blades, but one holder is probably enough if you're just testing<br/>
this to see how it works.<br/>
<br/>
I have two Speedball block cutters.  One is a #2 v-style blade that I<br/>
use in a good holder, and I have a smaller #1 v-style blade in a<br/>
cheapo wooden holder.<br/>
<br/>
All of these supplies can be purchased at Michael's, Hobby Lobby,<br/>
Texas Art Supply, and so on.<br/>
<br/>
TRANSFERS<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to keep the transfer process simple.  Bring a small sketch<br/>
(the size of the finished stamp) or two or three.  You can use a<br/>
photocopy of a simple Dover design if you like--the public library has<br/>
Dover (and other) clipart books (sometimes in the children's books<br/>
section)--or any very simple design.<br/>
<br/>
Also bring a pencil, preferably one with a soft lead (4B or 6B, from<br/>
the crafts shop) but a regular pencil (the kind you sharpen, not a<br/>
mechanical pencil) will be fine for the class.<br/>
<br/>
STAMPING SUPPLIES<br/>
<br/>
Please bring your own rubber stamp pad.  Ink or pigment... either is<br/>
fine, but ink dries faster.  I recommend one very dark pad (black, for<br/>
example) and one that's very light (grey, tan, pale pink, etc.).  But,<br/>
if you are simply bringing your usual stamp pad, that's fine too.<br/>
<br/>
You'll need a few sheets of paper for testing your stamp as you carve<br/>
it.  Junk paper left from misprints at Kinko's or your home printer<br/>
are fine.  The back of envelopes from junk mail are fine. Any paper<br/>
that's smooth and light-colored will work.<br/>
<br/>
Also bring your usual letterboxing kit so that we can exchange stamps<br/>
during the class.  If you're new, this means a stamp, stamp pad, and<br/>
logbook... unless you're making the stamp and logbook in class, of<br/>
course.<br/>
<br/>
CLASS NOTES<br/>
<br/>
I'm hoping to get the class notes and handouts online this weekend. <br/>
I'm running very late after an exhausting (but productive) research<br/>
trip to NOLA this week... I'll have to see how it goes.  However, the<br/>
class notes aren't vital and if I end up posting them after the class,<br/>
it will be fine.  I'll be explaining and demonstrating EVERYthing in<br/>
class... including one "trade secret" cutting technique that won't be<br/>
in the notes.<br/>
<br/>
IF YOU SHOW UP WITH A SMILE AND THAT'S ALL...<br/>
<br/>
When I teach, I always say, "If you show up with a smile and that's<br/>
all, you'll still have fun in my classes."<br/>
<br/>
I always try to have extra supplies on hand, and teach an<br/>
information-packed class anyway.  So, if all you show up with is a<br/>
smile, you can still take notes and perhaps do a little hands-on<br/>
experimenting with my own supplies.<br/>
<br/>
In my next email, I'll talk about logbook options.<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
