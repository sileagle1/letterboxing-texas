  children. We moved to TX in Dec. 04<br/>&gt; with<br/>&gt; the military. I 
  recently found out about<br/>&gt; letterboxing<br/>&gt; from a friend back home. 
  I am very excited to figure<br/>&gt; out everything with letterboxing so my 
  family and I<br/>&gt; can see more of TX. If anyone knows of a good<br/>&gt; 
  informative website, or would like to offer their<br/>&gt; help<br/>&gt; as to 
  how letterboxing works I would greatly<br/>&gt; appreciate it! Good luck

<br/>
Welcome to letterboxing and the letterboxingtexas group!<br/>
<br/>
Most carvers don't actually use erasers to carve their own stamps. I've actually only met two or there boxers who use erasers.  <br/>
<br/>
I use orange or white pz-cut, mars staedler, or speedy cut (the pink stuff). Pz-cut has to be ordered from Stampeze, but the others can be found at Michael's or Hobby Lobby.<br/>
<br/>
 You can also find the speedball carving tools at your local craft stores.  You'll need to look for them around the fine set supplies. I usually find them somewhere near the calligraphy stuff. <br/>
<br/>
If you choose to order from Stampeze, you can order the speedball cutting tool, or the mars staedler version of cutters. <br/>
<br/>
Most importantly, don't give up on carving your own stamps. Practice makes perfect and letterboxers will love ALL of your creations!<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps! Batty B of the Busybeesfamily<br/>

Hi to all. My husband and I have been letterboxing about six months. Jan 3rd <br/>
 we placed our first box. We are still learning and want to make our own <br/>
 stamps but were not sure where to get large erasers at. We've tried all the <br/>
 local hobby stores and aren't having much luck. We'd also like to know what <br/>

<br/>
The previous posters have pointed you in the right<br/>
direction for supplies, either mail ordered through<br/>
Stampeaz or just going down to Hobby Lobby, but I'd<br/>
have one warning:  Because stamp carving isn't the<br/>
most common of hobbies, the staff at Hobby Lobby don't<br/>
seem to know where the supplies are kept!  I had to<br/>
walk aisle by aisle on my own to finally find the<br/>
carving tools and mastercarve and pink stuff in the<br/>
aisle where they also see easles.  My point being that<br/>
you should keep looking, even if the staff don't know<br/>
how to help you.<br/>
<br/>
(This now makes me want to say "easle aisle" ten times<br/>
fast.)<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>

Hi to all. My husband and I have been letterboxing<br/>
about six months. Jan 3rd<br/>
we placed our first box. We are still learning and<br/>
want to make our own<br/>
stamps but were not sure where to get large erasers<br/>
at. We've tried all the<br/>
local hobby stores and aren't having much luck. We'd<br/>
also like to know what<br/>
cutting tools are best to carve the erasers with. I<br/>

<br/>
Went I shopped for some supplies at the Hobby Lobby<br/>
near me, it was on the aisle with craft lamps,<br/>
drafting supplies and something else odd (can't<br/>
remember).<br/>
<br/>
If you abandon all hope of finding it yourself, ask<br/>
for help from someone working near the fine arts<br/>
supplies and tell them you're looking for screen<br/>
printing supplies -- ink, brayers, etc. The section<br/>
these supplies are in is devoted to printing. (By the<br/>
way, the buff stu8ff Barefoot Lucy was referring to is<br/>
used by artists for printing. They carve their works<br/>
of art into it, then print it -- these works don't get<br/>
a lot of use like your stamp will, though.)<br/>
<br/>
By the way, supplies are also available on the Hobby<br/>
Lobby Web site, for those not into the hassle of<br/>

location.<br/>

Also, I carved my first stamp using Master Carve<br/>
yesterday. I'm in love with how easy it is to work<br/>
with. Remains to be seen how I'll like it out and in<br/>
use =)<br/>

&gt; Hi to all. My husband and I have been letterboxing<br/>
&gt; about six months. Jan 3rd<br/>
&gt; we placed our first box. We are still learning and<br/>
&gt; want to make our own<br/>
&gt; stamps but were not sure where to get large erasers<br/>
&gt; at. We've tried all the<br/>
&gt; local hobby stores and aren't having much luck. We'd<br/>
&gt; also like to know what<br/>
&gt; cutting tools are best to carve the erasers with. I<br/>

&gt;Janet referred to pink stuff.  Pink stuff isn't it's real name (like<br/>
&gt;BarefootLucy isn't mine), but that's what letterboxers call it.  You'll <br/>
&gt;know<br/>
&gt;it when you see it.  It's rubber and - well - it's pink.  I like it myself,<br/>
&gt;although I like PZKut a little better.  HOWEVER, the same company that <br/>
&gt;makes<br/>
&gt;pink stuff (Speedball) makes some stuff that is a buff color.  Don't buy<br/>
&gt;it.  Don't even be tempted.  It's yukky.  You'll be tempted, but don't.  It<br/>
&gt;seems to be universally acknowledged by letterboxers that it just isn't <br/>
&gt;good<br/>
&gt;for what we do.  It must have a purpose, but it isn't for stamps that will<br/>
&gt;be seeing some wear and tear.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;This concludes our public service announcement.<br/>

&gt;&gt;it's true, I haven't carved many stamps, but the few I have carved get<br/>

We just wanted to say hello and introduce ourselves.  We are 4 Keeps <br/>
from Spring, TX.  We are new to boxing-- we started August of 2006.  <br/>
I had heard about Geocaching and thought it was a neat concept, but <br/>
a little to advanced for our pace.  Then serendipity... I found an <br/>
article on letterboxing in Family Fun magazine while waiting to get <br/>
a dental exam.  We like to camp, hike, fish and canoe, and our six <br/>
year old son loves to treasure hunt.  Letterboxing was just right <br/>
for us and I think we are now officially hooked.  We know so many of <br/>
your names from reading the log books, especially, Baby Bear, Silver <br/>
Eagle, Boots Tex, and Lone Star Quilter.  We are humbly admitting to <br/>
the fact that we aren't stamp makers and have bought most of our <br/>
stamps, but we are starting to branch out to try the stamp making.  <br/>
You all have made some of the most creative stamps and we are <br/>
excited to learn the art of it.  We are Sam and Stephanie so we <br/>
alway sign Sands from Spring, TX with a Sand Dollar stamp.  We are a <br/>
family of four with our son, Whitt, and our daughter who is waiting <br/>
for us in China( the adoption paperwork is done, just waiting for <br/>
our info to go through China's system).  Looking forward to meeting <br/>

<div>Welcome! That is so exciting about your dear little one waiting for you in China! Please keep us updated.</div>
<div>Don't worry about the store bought stamp. I think most of us just love having the boxes we've planted visited, and especially love receiving an update from the finders. When you do decide to venture into carving, you may find it becomes equally as addictive as letterboxing itself.</div>
<div>Glad to have you join our ranks and I hope your family will have many wonderful experiences letterboxing together.</div>

<p>Hi all,<br/>We just wanted to say hello and introduce ourselves. We are 4 Keeps <br/>from Spring, TX. We are new to boxing-- we started August of 2006. <br/>I had heard about Geocaching and thought it was a neat concept, but <br/>a little to advanced for our pace. Then serendipity.<wbr/>.. I found an <br/>article on letterboxing in Family Fun magazine while waiting to get <br/>a dental exam. We like to camp, hike, fish and canoe, and our six <br/>year old son loves to treasure hunt. Letterboxing was just right <br/>for us and I think we are now officially hooked. We know so many of <br/>your names from reading the log books, especially, Baby Bear, Silver <br/>Eagle, Boots Tex, and Lone Star Quilter. We are humbly admitting to <br/>the fact that we aren't stamp makers and have bought most of our <br/>stamps, but we are starting to branch out to try the stamp making. <br/>You all have made some of the most creative stamps and we are <br/>excited to learn the art of it. We are Sam and Stephanie so we <br/>alway sign Sands from Spring, TX with a Sand Dollar stamp. We are a <br/>family of four with our son, Whitt, and our daughter who is waiting <br/>for us in China( the adoption paperwork is done, just waiting for <br/>our info to go through China's system). Looking forward to meeting <br/>you and chatting in this group.<br/>4 Keeps<br/><br/></p></div><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

lettergboxing. I have a blast... for example just this past weekend <br/>
while on a geocaching spree, found out that there are a few letterboxs <br/>

It is my goal to place a hybrid Letterbox/geocache this spring so wish <br/>
me luck, or maybe I should ask for prayers on making my first stamp <br/>
