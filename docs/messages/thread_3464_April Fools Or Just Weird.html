&gt; Didn't have too much time in Austin for LBing, but did find your <br/>

&gt; the Velo lot, pulled her pants down to her knees, stepped over to <br/>
the <br/>

Now <br/>

Just after replaceing your box and walking back to our <br/>car <br/>&gt; in that VERY PUBLIC and busy parking lot, a woman walking with two <br/>&gt; friends down the middle of the street from the Wildflower Center to <br/>&gt; the Velo lot, pulled her pants down to her knees, stepped over to <br/>the <br/>&gt; curb and did her business. The most puzzling part was that the <br/>porta-<br/>&gt; potty mentioned in your clues were no further than 30 feet away. <br/>Now <br/>&gt; that was NO April Fools joke. For once I was rendered speechless.<br/>&gt; Rehsalps Elddup<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "Silver Eagle" <br/>&gt; &lt;sileagle@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; The McBoxing on AQ is well planned and executed, and the reverse <br/>&gt; trail <br/>&gt; &gt; names on
 LBNA is cute, but the best Letterboxing April Fools I <br/>ever <br/>&gt; saw <br/>&gt; &gt; was back in 2004. The animosity between geocachers and <br/>&gt; letterboxers <br/>&gt; &gt; was particularly high during that time, so imagine the surprise <br/>and <br/>&gt; &gt; outrage when on April 1, 2004, letterboxers who clicked on LBNA, <br/>&gt; and <br/>&gt; &gt; geocachers who clicked on their site, were all sent to a new site <br/>&gt; &gt; called Boxcaching. It proclaimed that both hobbies had merged <br/>into <br/>&gt; &gt; this new one and too bad if you didn't like it. The flames were <br/>&gt; out of <br/>&gt; &gt; control and really amusing to peruse, including some from the <br/>&gt; webmaster <br/>&gt; &gt; of Geocaching.Com, and I highly recommend that you look at the <br/>&gt; archives <br/>&gt; &gt; of the main Talklist. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; elgaE revliS<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote> <div></div></div><!--End group
