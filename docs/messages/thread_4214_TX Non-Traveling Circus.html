&gt; &gt; &gt; Well the Circus is about 1 year old and it has only moved about 6 times.  That means the circus is staying with finders for an average of 2 months!  Now I love visiting with y'all, but this is ridiculous.  Please show some of the same urgency you display getting the box by sending it on its way as soon as possible so more will have a chance to get it. <br/>
