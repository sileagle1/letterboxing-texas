<p><span>Years ago when I was young, my family lived
in <st1:country-region w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">England</st1:place></st1:country-region>.(
Yes, I’m going to start WAAAAY back in my childhood with this story!)Our
next door neighbor told me about letterboxing on the moors, and I wanted desperately
to go. My parents would vaguely agree that we might do it sometime in the
future, but it never happened. To sum it up, they were “indoor people”…more
interested in antiquing than hiking. Years later my parents were retired and
living in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Vermont</st1:place></st1:state>
and one day my mother phoned me to tell me about her latest volunteer project:
something called “ELF”, and something called “Valley Quest”.
I was a little skeptical about my mother trudging through streams and forests
with a band of children looking for boxes, but thought it sounded a little like
Mr. Gilmore’s letterboxing stories. However, my own sons were so busy
with so many other activities (swimming, martial arts, fencing, Destination
ImagiNation, Scouts) that I just didn’t follow up on her suggestion that
I create a “Valley Quest” here in <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:state>! More years went by.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Then, last spring, I was driving along,
listening to NPR as usual, when I almost drove off the road – they were
doing a feature about letterboxing!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>By this time, two sons were out of the
house and we were down to one child &amp; three dogs!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>I collected the family and announced that
this was something we were going to do as a group, starting on our family
vacation on Key Allegro. (It will tell you a lot about our family that no one
pointed out any problems with this sudden brilliant idea… I could
probably have announced that we were going to hunt Zombies and there would have
been the same enthusiasm. Scary thought….)<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>So my oldest son’s girlfriend (
Flicker) immediately bought supplies and created 3 boxes with store-bought
stamps which she &amp; her parents ( Wild Birds) hid in Arkansas. This is a
young woman who gets things done! We then started reading a little further and discovered
that we should really be carving our own stamps. I had always done artsy-craft things
and felt sure I could do it. Wrong. Mine looked a lot like chewed dog toys. But
we bought the all the necessary “stuff” and packed to go down to
Rockport to stay on Key Allegro. We even had thought up a theme for 3 boxes –
different “keys”, and had found tiny keys to attach for first
finders.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>And then it turned out that there was not
one square inch of Key Allegro which was not private property…so much for
our creative theme! I was so desperate I tried to suggest that we could place a
box in the rafters under the bridge onto the island. My sons pointed out that
access to the bridge would require someone to hang upside down, stand in front
of the Real Estate office or float underneath in a boat and jump up. For once,
they refused to get carried away with my enthusiasm.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>But CactusLicker had carved his first
stamp (turned out to be backwards, but we all loved it) and we were determined
to place a box.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Our first find was Silver Eagle’s “Big
Tree” on <st1:place w:st="on"><st1:placename w:st="on">Goose</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Island</st1:placetype></st1:place> down the road from
Key Allegro, and it was a truly thrilling find. And the entire clan (all 7 of
us) stood under that magnificent tree in a violent lightning storm, a
monumentally stupid moment, which is captured forever in a keepsake photo. A
day later we found BusyBee’s charming “R.I.P.# 3” and
BabyBear’s very cool “Bonefish” with our first hitchhiker!! <o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>Our first letterbox “Missing Key #1”
is planted in that state park, but we ended up having to bring the other two “Missing
Keys” back to <st1:city w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Dallas</st1:place></st1:city>.
<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p><span>We’ve had a few whole-family
vacations since then (Eisenhower, <st1:placename w:st="on">Possum</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Kingdom</st1:placetype>, <st1:city w:st="on">Galveston</st1:city>,
<st1:place w:st="on">Brazos</st1:place>) and we try to bring at least 3 boxes
to place each time…but now we do much better research on the location
before we start carving ;-)!<o:p></o:p></span></p>
