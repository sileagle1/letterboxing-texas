                    <div class="plaintext-content">That IS amazing!  Just a reminder that the 6th TX Annual LB Event <br>
(TALE6) is a little more than a month away.  It is listed on Atlas <br>
Quest:  http://www.atlasquest.com/showinfo.html?gEventId=985<br>
and the website for more info is:  <br>
http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/Events/TALE06/<br>
<br>
There is still availability at the Group campsite that I reserved if <br>
you want to tent camp (no electric).  Just send me an email with the <br>
number of campers.  Can't wait to see y'all there!<br>

<div>In the event camping in Mission Tejas fills up, there is camping nearby at Ratcliff Recreation Area:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/texas/recreation/davy_crockett/ratcliff.shtml">http://www.fs.fed.us/r8/texas/recreation/davy_crockett/ratcliff.shtml</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Ratcliff is about 17 miles from Mission Tejas through the Davy Crockett National Forest.</div>
<div>I've camped many times at both places, and I like 'em both.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Other lodging is available at Salmon Lake in Grapeland, about 18 miles away:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.salmonlakepark.com/">http://www.salmonlakepark.com/</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>For very primitive camping, you can camp along the 4C trail which runs a scant few miles (2-5 miles) from Mission Tejas.  The 4C basically runs from Mission Tejas to Ratcliff Recreation Area.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://www.ouachitamaps.com/picture_library/Four%20C/Four%20C%20Trail.jpg">http://www.ouachitamaps.com/picture_library/Four%20C/Four%20C%20Trail.jpg</a></div>
<div><a href="http://www.ouachitamaps.com/Four%20C.html">http://www.ouachitamaps.com/Four%20C.html</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the 4C, you can find primitive car camping at Neches Bluff (4C-19 on the second ouachitamaps link above).  4C-10 has a camping shelter about 1/2 mile off the road, and 4C-12 has a good primitive camping spot about 1 mile off the road.  Neches Bluff is about 3 miles from Mission Tejas.  No clean water at any of these, so BYOW or bring a filter.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>For hotels, look in Crockett, 18 miles away.  Rusk is just a little further.  Palestine, and Lufkin aren't too far away either, 38-40 miles, but they are harder drives because you are driving smaller roads.</div>
