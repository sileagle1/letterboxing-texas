while finding my "Fire in the Hole" box.  He and his family went out <br>
this weekend to give Letterboxing a try.  Here is what happened.....<br>
<br>
Message: <br>
So....we ventured out on a Saturday afternoon for a fun-filled <br>
family <br>
'treasure hunt.'  Little did we know we would have to be explaining <br>
our <br>
actions to the Constable for over 30 minutes!!!<br>
.<br>
Needless to say, our first adventure is one we will not soon forget.<br>
.<br>
We went to the park, me, wife, 2 little girls - baseball bat in hand <br>
(to knock away anything that may be living around the box).  It <br>
seems <br>
that some of the neighbors thought that looked a little strange and <br>
decided to make a phone call.<br>
Well, being our first time, it took us a little while to get the <br>
directions right and actually find the box.  So, as we're sitting on <br>
the path <br>
stamping our pads and talking about it, we see the cop drive up, and <br>
just stay in his car by the exit to the park.  We take 10-15 minutes <br>
to <br>
complete the stamping, put the box back in place, and make our way <br>
to <br>
the exit.<br>
As we make our way out, he gets out of his car - "Everything ok out <br>
there."  (I think he senses we are harmless since we have 2 little <br>
girls <br>
in tow, and the bat was plastic).  We explain ourselves and what we <br>
are <br>
doing out there, letterbox, stamps, etc...  It all seems to go over <br>
his <br>
head as he just looks at us dumbfounded.  He then started rambling <br>
on <br>
about wishing they'd put bathrooms out there, glad they put the <br>
fence up <br>
'cause all those dumb kids with their ATV's were tearing up the <br>
park, <br>
yadda, yadda, yadda...<br>
.<br>
Anyway, thought you would find it funny that the first one we try, <br>
we <br>
almost get arrested!<br>

<div>Oh sure, Baby Bear! You probably set the poor guy up... his sweet little children will be in therapy for years trying to deal with being accomplices to their Dad's illegal activities.</div>
