                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today I was finally able to check on the last of my five boxes that <br/>
were in the flood zone at Grapevine Lake.  Four are fine, dry and <br/>
right where they should be.  One obviously floated away and will be <br/>
replaced soon.  The lake is definitely high (higher than I remember it <br/>
in nearly 20 years of living around it) but way down from the high <br/>
point.<br/>
