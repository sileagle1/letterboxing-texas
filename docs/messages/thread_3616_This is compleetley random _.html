                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, so i've been thinking about writing this for a few days now, but <br>
keep on not being sure wether i should send it or not, but decided to <br>
just go ahead and do this anyway!<br>
<br>
so do you ever wonder what letterboxers do in real life? i know i do - <br>
i wonder what do these people do when they are not letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Anyway.. I am origionally from England and been living in Texas since <br>
september of 2002.  <br>
I work with an organization called Youth With A Mission (YWAM), and i <br>
work in the MercyWorks department, Which focuses on long term and short <br>
term disaster relief and medical trips, and we are also working on <br>
expanding into microfinace too.  <br>
Anyway, everyone involved in YWAM on waht ever level is responsible for <br>
raising thier own financial support.  There are no paid workers in YWAM.<br>
<br>
And at the moment it is difficult to obtain visas etc to be here.  I <br>
absloutley love Texas and think of this as my home, and would never <br>
want to leave.  <br>
<br>
I am currently in the process of having to renew my visa, and i am <br>
needing to increase my monthly support by approximately $500 a month, <br>
this feels like a huge ammount when you have no idea where in the world <br>
i could even increase my support by $1 from.  <br>
Anyway, i am sending this out because i need prayer support and <br>
encouragemnt - and i thought there may even be somone out there who <br>
would maybe be able to even help a little!... but please pray that God <br>
will lead me ot open doors to be able to fundraise from - i don;t get a <br>
whole lot of support from people back in England.<br>
<br>
If you would like more information on what I do or have any questions  <br>
e-mail me at Purplenic1979@gmail.com (just cos i'd rather this not get <br>
too personal in a group setting, and don;t want people who aren;t <br>
intersted to have to recieve more e-mails )<br>
<br>
thanks for praying - i appreciate it<br>
PurpleNic<br>

<br/>I have a 3-year-old, a 2-year-old, and an infant... that fact combined with the recent talk of snakes and poison ivy is making me think that we'll get back into letterboxing full-swing in the fall.  Unless of course there happens to be a box out there hidden near a nice cool floating-river... <br/>

<div><b><font color="#00407f">I think the best thing about finding letterboxing is that it has given our whole family a ready-made treasure hunt that Daddy and I don't have to plan!!  We have gotten to go on hikes in places we'd never heard of prior to this and spent a lot more outside time than I think we would have otherwise.  </font></b></div>

<div>Hi, so i've been thinking about writing this for a few days now, but <br/>keep on not being sure wether i should send it or not, but decided to <br/>just go ahead and do this anyway!<br/><br/>so do you ever wonder what letterboxers do in real life? i know i do - <br/>
i wonder what do these people do when they are not letterboxing.</div></div>
