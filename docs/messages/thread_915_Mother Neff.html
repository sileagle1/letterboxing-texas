find all 3 boxes there.  I unfortunately parked in the wrong place <br>
which made our hike MUCH longer in sauna-like humidity and heat.  We <br>
did find box #1 of CCC Co 817 alive, but were just too pooped to look <br>
for box #2 or House of Water.  It's only about 45 minutes away so <br>
we'll try again soon.<br>
<br>
We're heading tomorrow to find Peace and Friendship in Belton.  We're <br>
going in the morning this time to hopefully avoid some of the heat.<br>
<br>
Happy hunting,<br>
