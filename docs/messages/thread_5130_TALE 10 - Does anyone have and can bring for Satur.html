We have something that hooks to a laptop so you can project on screen that I think will work. But Bird Dog is already snuggled under the covers, and you know what they say about letting sleeping dogs lie. So I'll ask him in the morning. He will want to know if you have Mac or PC. And that is the extent of my gadget knowledge.<br/>
