<br/>
I have an event stamp I take around with me to the events I attend, but someone just listed having found my event stamp on 7/18, when I wasn't at any event.  I noticed the person had listed a bunch of other LBCON event stamps from the St. Louis event.  Should I just let it go, or nicely explain that they have the wrong stamp?  If so, how would you word it?<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance :)<br/>

I just had this happen too.  I sent the "finder" this message:<br/>
<br/>
Hey there,<br/>
I got a message that you found my box called "Boo Boo Box". I think you might have found a different box by the same name, since my box has hasn't been out and about for several months!<br/>
