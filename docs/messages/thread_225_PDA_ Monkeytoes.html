<div>Monkeytoes,</div>
<div>What kind of PDA do you 
have?  Palm OS or Microsoft OS?  I would like to do this, but on a 
much smaller scale...lol.  I have no idea how to do this!!!   I 
need K.I.S.S. instructions to get me started.  I have a Toshiba with MS OS 
and an older Handspring with Palm OS.  Which is easier to do?</div>
<div>Hope you can help me 
out,</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm new to the whole palm thing too, so I don't know how much help I <br/>
can be, but here it goes...<br/>
 I have a Palm IIIx ($30 off Ebay!) It has 8mb of RAM which I can <br/>
assure you is much more than enough.  It runs off palm OS version <br/>
3.3.<br/>
<br/>
It came with Palm Desktop software, which is basically every <br/>
application that you have on your palm, but on your computer. In the <br/>
Memo application I made a separate category for each region for <br/>
orginazational purposes. <br/>
Then I went online and did a copy and paste from each clue from the <br/>
LBNA site to microsoft word.  I then edited the text so each clue <br/>
was in the same format.  Once that was done, I once again copied <br/>
that text and then pasted it into correct region in the Memo <br/>
application in the Palm Desktop program.  All this was done one clue <br/>
at a time so I wouldn't go insane.<br/>
<br/>
When I finished all that, I performed a HotSync between the computer <br/>
and PDA so the info would show up in the PDA.  <br/>
<br/>
I know there are programs out there that make it easier to do than <br/>
all that, but those cost money and I'm pretty cheap.  The clue <br/>
database at LBworld.com will soon be set up so that you can <br/>
instantly download clues to your pda without all the copying and <br/>
pasting.  I think it works by magic.<br/>
<br/>
When I was shopping around I heard good things about the Handspring. <br/>
It's recommended by a lot of those tech-oriented geocachers. <br/>
Basically all they said was that it should have at least 8megs of <br/>
memory and be able to hotsync. I know nothing about the Toshiba, but <br/>
I think your handspring should be capable of all that.<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helped,<br/>
