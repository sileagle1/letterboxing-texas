another letterboxing group "on the trail". Actually,<br/>
we were all in the parking lot, but we were all in<br/>
pursuit of boxes at Memorial Park Arboretum and Nature<br/>
Center. I was returning to the car from finding "Bear<br/>
Hunting" and placing a box of my own (watch for clues<br/>
on letterboxing.org for "Koala-ty Time Together").<br/>
Another vehicle pulled in next to my car. The door<br/>
opened, and the driver had two journal-type books and<br/>
a piece of paper which was immediately recognized as<br/>
"clues". I think I caught Dewberry a bit off guard,<br/>
but after introductions, we had a great time<br/>
exchanging stamps: me, Dewberry, Patrick, and Graham<br/>
(great seasonal personal stamp, Graham!).<br/>
<br/>
What a wonderful surprise!!!!! I'm still giddy with<br/>
excitement!<br/>

<div>That is so cool!  My sister and I thought we saw someone 
else boxing last spring at Mercer...he seemed to be listening to us and stayed 
nearby.  Someone else stamped into the box we found the same day we found 
it.  But as we had only just started letterboxing we were too nervous to 
approach him.  How lucky for you!  Maybe I'll see you out on the trail 
someday! -Mother of Four</div>
