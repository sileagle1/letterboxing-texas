                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh my, can I get on the list? The adventures of Lucy(where's Ethel?) <br/>
sound too good to be true and I can attest to the Walgreens sale...I <br/>
stopped there yesterday and got lots of goodies too...starting to <br/>
think about stuffing stockings since it seems we are headed for <br/>
colder weather as we drop below 100 this week :)<br/>
We have been out and about traveling over the last week and managed <br/>
to get a few letterboxes too.<br/>
Last week we stopped in Corsicana for Pitch In -great stamp! and I <br/>
love Corsicana- didn't much care for the webs guarding the box <br/>
though.I enjoyed visiting the area where my older children grew up, <br/>
played ball and got into mischief as younger kids.<br/>
We continues toward San Antonio and got Texas Ranger- amazing stamp <br/>
and we were followed by a very quiet duck who scared the begeebers <br/>
out of us but made for a great laugh the rest of the afternoon.<br/>
Next stop was for Whistle Stop and they are not kidding -even in the <br/>
afternoon heat that is one amazing playground nearby- we really had <br/>
a blast (and an excuse for ice cream)We stayed there a good while <br/>
delaying our SA arrival a good bit.<br/>
As we continued we stopped for the Texas Salamander and thouroughly <br/>
enjoyed our time there- my 4 year enjoyed the nearby exibit of <br/>
animal scat- see there is something for everyone- they left that out <br/>
in the Family Fun article :)<br/>
Once in San Antonio I had great plans and more than a dozen <br/>
potiental boxes but alas the 4 year year old teamed up with my 3 <br/>
year old grandson and ...well we got one at Mission San Juan <br/>
Capistrano- a great place for little boys but maybe not for Grandma <br/>
at 103 degrees.<br/>
A fun trip and 5 new stamps. I am only an hour from Dallas and visit <br/>
there frequently but I have yet to get any Dallas <br/>
boxes...Lucy...heading West anytime soon?<br/>
<br/>
I also purchased some supplies to start trying carving..bandaids, <br/>
speed ball, bandaids, erasers, bandaids, carving block...you get the <br/>
idea..now I need a tetnus shot and I can begin.<br/>
<br/>
Having fun this summer,<br/>

<p><span>I met that duck too!<span>  </span>There had been a fellow eating at the table next to us and feeding the duck while we were getting Texas Ranger.
<span>  </span>When he got up and left, the duck felt strongly that we should pick up the guy's slack and feed him scraps.<span>  </span>The only scraps we had were rubber scraps though, which DID look like carrot peels, but we couldn't bring ourselves to feed the poor duck rubber.
<span>  </span>He apparently really wanted rubber though, because he stalked us until we left the area.<span>  </span>But I'm wondering  did a little guy come and talk to you for awhile while you were there?
<span>  </span>The first time I went for that box, I had a fellow come over and talk to me while I was stamping in.<span>  </span>He paid no heed to what I was doing while he talked, and thankfully left before it was time to put the box back.
<span>  </span>I swear I saw him the second time too, but maybe he was afraid of the duck because he didn't come over that time!</span></p>
<p><span>I've really been wanting to get further west lately, and south and north, but I can't seem to get out of my own town for some reason!<span>
  </span>This trip to </span><span>Denton</span><span> was the first I've made in awhile and it wound up not being very fruitful for letterboxing, although we had a great time and had some offshoot adventures that wouldn't have happened if I hadn't had letterboxing on the brain.
<span>  </span>Maybe when the weather cools</span></p><br/><br/>
