<p>Thank you, Baby Bear.  I'm glad you brought this up, because I am a little bewildered and a little embarrassed about this box being named Box of the Week.  While I do appreciate recognition for my efforts, I don't understand how my Wearing the Cinco Peso box would qualify for Box of the week for the following reason:  I placed the box at Mission Tejas State Park for the TALE event we had there in 2009, and most of the finds were during the event.  It was last found on June 6, 2009.  Open Space reported it missing in June 2013 when she filed her report on the state of boxes in that park.  So, a couple of weeks ago, when we went up there to check on all the boxes, this was one of the boxes we replaced.  So, it's not the original box, although the stamp is identical to the original, and it has a new logbook and a new box.  I just like the subject and wanted to leave boxes in the park to be found by others.  On Sept. 7, it was found by Cannibal69nsons.  So, it was only found once in the week in which it won the Box of the Week award.  This really doesn't make sense to me.  The finders must have given it a great rating!  I know this subject has been discussed on the AQ boards and Ryan has tried to explain the logic of the selection process, but I never understood how it works, except that it's done by a computer with many factors contributing to the final choice for Box of the Week.  Do all of the finds factor in, even if it went six years without being found?  I don't know.  The selection of my box makes the choice seem random and somewhat cheapens the honor for me.  That's just my two cents worth.  </p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div><p></p>

    I doubt many people are going back thru their previous finds
    recorded on LBNA and voting/marking up their recommendations.
    Therefore it would be a little unfair to compare an older box on
    both sites. Now, in a year or so we could compare boxes listed going
    forward and that would interesting to see how these box rating
    systems work out.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Thanks, Baby Bear.  I believe you do have the most recommended boxes on LbNA.  Also, your boxes haven't been listed on AQ long enough to have compiled a long history of finds, if that makes any difference to the powers that be at Atlas Quest.  And, you don't have to be a premium member to get Box of the Week.  I just scrolled through the last 23 and 10 of the winners are not premium members.  But one of the things I like about letterboxing is that it is not a contest.  Each box counts the same in your find number. I try to make every box I put out the best that I can make it, and I believe that everyone does that. </p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>Well said, Boots.  That is why I am ok with the Most Recommended box listing on LBNA.  It uses an internal formula to generate a list of boxes that finders have recommended, but nobody, including the owner of the box, can see what the box is rated and there is no Box Of The Week or Box Of The Month award.  It tries to answer the question most asked by visiting letterboxers:  "Which boxes do you recommend most?".  It is still subjective and dependent upon finders rating the boxes, but I think it might eventually be a nice feature.  The only problem could be that if none of your boxes are on the list, they may rarely be found unless they happen to be "Nearby" some that are.  I guess I better start placing my boxes near Boots' :)</p><div><br/></div><div>Silver Eagle</div></body></html>
