                    <div class="plaintext-content">I live in Newtown (just up 34). Last year (my first year too) after reading<br/>
an article in the Danbury newspaper about letterboxing, I looked it up on<br/>
the net and my husband and I immediately rushed off that day and located<br/>
our first LB in Newtown. Then I traveled the state of CT locating all 30 of<br/>
the Ct State Forest Letterboxes (became an obsession), then turned to the<br/>
LBNA! My sister, who lives in Texas, was visiting me in October so I<br/>
introduced her to LBing by doing 5 of the state LBs, then we did one in<br/>
Rangely, Maine which was extremely cool! A month later when I visited her<br/>
in TX, she had already done about a dozen down there and we did more! Now<br/>
she's probably done 100 and has just placed her first four as well as a<br/>
couple of HHs. Like the rest of us, LBing is her drug of choice! I used to<br/>
log in with a store bought chick simply as Maribeth or as Tx Chick. When my<br/>
sister and I LBed together, it would be 2txchicks. She is now Viewfinder<br/>
and I am Puddle-Splasher. My stamp is now a Jeep (grill) with a canoe tied<br/>
to the top and splashes flying off the side. With the nicer weather<br/>
arriving, this week I found the LBs in New Milford at Lovers Leap, two in<br/>
Roxbury's Land Grant at Moosehorn (a very vigorious and beautiful 2 mile<br/>
hike ending by very loud series of waterfalls), and of course the 3 in the<br/>
Ansonia Nature Center. Like many other LBers, I have a stack of clue sheets<br/>
printed out and ready to go! Since my sister has just placed 4 (or maybe 6<br/>
by now) new boxes in Keller, Texas this week which are being visited<br/>
already by the very active Tx Letterboxers group, I thought that would be a<br/>
great place for your HH to start some great travels so I sent it to her to<br/>
make the circuit down there before heading on! I had just picked up a HH in<br/>
La Jolla, CA two weeks ago and it had started its travels in New England,<br/>
and is now in TX!<br/>
I will be moving back to Texas at the end of June, but my husband wants to<br/>
hang in and work here (Sikorsky) at bit longer so I will be spending half<br/>
my time here and half down there. (I have two little grandsons and they<br/>
have pulled me back!) Hope to see you out there on the trail!<br/>

&gt; Congratulations to you too Maribeth!  Well, my plan worked to get it <br/>
&gt; moving fast!! ;-)  All the way to Texas?  Wow!<br/>
&gt; Do you live near Ansonia, or maybe you were visiting here from Texas?  <br/>
&gt; I live in Orange. I haven't seen your name in local boxes...<br/>
&gt; Thanks for writing!<br/>
