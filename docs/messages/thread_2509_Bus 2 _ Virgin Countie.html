<div>I have had a box ready for Harrisson County (Uncertain) for quite a <br/>while. Just can't seem to get back to Caddo Lake SP to plant it. I <br/>love the idea as Lucy said about getting those NorthEast counties <br/>
filled with new boxes. That is still a plan when we can work it out. <br/>Since there are a lot of new East Texas Boxers of late, maybe we can <br/>all get together and make a day of it. Even if they gave us a box to <br/>plant if they can't go? I'm not sure if that is feasible idea or 
<br/>not. What do you think Lucy? We will keep trying. Now that the <br/>holidays are over, maybe we can work it out. Spring is coming!

<div> </div>
<div>I've not proven this will work yet, but an idea I have is to use the atlas of Texas historical markers (<a href="http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">
http://atlas.thc.state.tx.us/</a>) as a guide to finding places and box ideas in areas I don't know.  You can do a county search of markers and the descriptions include a transcript of the marker itself in a lot of cases.  It might be a way to at least get an idea for a stamp in a particular town or county, even if you can't plant the box AT the marker.  Otherwise, I wind up doing a crazy amount of research on a town and getting so involved in learning about it that I forget what I'm supposed to be doing! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now would be a good time for us to count how many counties have boxes, and how many we have to go, so we can measure our accomplishments at the end of the year!<br/><br/> </div>

 markers and the descriptions include a transcript of the marker itself in a lot of cases.  It might be a way to at least get an idea for a stamp in a particular town or county, even if you can't plant the box AT the marker.  Otherwise, I wind up doing a crazy amount of research on a town and getting so involved in learning about it that I forget what I'm supposed to be doing! </div> <div> </div> <div>Now would be a good time for us to count how many counties have boxes, and how many we have to go, so we can measure our accomplishments at the end of the year!<br/><br/> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 1/13/07, <b>Silver Eagle</b> &lt;<a href="mailto:sileagle@alltel.net" target="_blank">sileagle@alltel.<wbr/>net</a> &gt; wrote:</span> <blockquote> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div>I agree, and already have several boxes made and trips

I ordered the latest edition (number 5, I think) and discovered that <br/>
they had taken out all the markers that weren't on a state or national <br/>
highway, so if you are looking for something off the beaten path, like <br/>
on a county road or in a town, you're out of luck unless you can find <br/>
an older edition.  Their reasoning was that if you were on a major <br/>
highway, you wouldn't have time to stop, but if you were driving out <br/>
in the country, you could just stop and read the sign.  I would like <br/>
to write to the publishers and tell them that I look for places in the <br/>
book, then go find them, usually not the other way around.  Anyway, <br/>
thought you might like to know.<br/>

&gt; There is also a book on Texas Historical Markers.  I think it might <br/>
be  <br/>
&gt; called "Why Stop?" or something like that.  Check your local <br/>
bookstore  under the <br/>
&gt; Regional/Texas section.  On the cover is a picture of a  Historical <br/>
Marker sign.<br/>
