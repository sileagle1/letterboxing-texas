I just went to the zoo the other day and it was fantastic.  Does <br>
anyone have any boxes at zoos?  I'm trying to think of a way to entice <br>
them into letting me place a couple of boxes, and I was wondering if <br>
anyone had any ideas.  Some kind of educational letterboxing series <br>
would be ideal, but I'm not sure what the size of my scope should be.  <br>
Should it be to entice new letterboxers through a zoo program, or just <br>
to make clever clues for existing boxers?  They do a lot of things <br>
with kids- day camps and such- maybe that could be a way to go.  I <br>
don't know.<br>
I sent them an email proposal a while back, but never got a reply <br>
back.  This time I definetley need to see someone face-to-face.  <br>
<br>
Ideas! Ideas! I need ideas!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a box in a zoo.  I didn't ask permission and<br>
it's been awhile since I've been there, so I'm not<br>
sure it's still there (it's one of the first couple we<br>
planted and we've learned a lot since then).  Looking<br>
back, I should've asked permission and if it's still<br>
there, I think I'll take it up, then ask permission<br>
and replant it.  I did a great stamp of the zoo's<br>
mascot animal, then planted it within view of that<br>
animal's enclosure.  If I ask permission, I will do it<br>
on the premise that it is an artistic nod to the zoo's<br>
mascot, will be placed where there will be no<br>
destruction, and that the clues are online and<br>
encourage visitors to the zoo. I think the mascot<br>
thing will be enough to make it fly because the mascot<br>
isn't just an animal chosen by the zoo to represent<br>
it, it has personal historical significance for the<br>
zoo and its founders.<br>
<br>
I also have a box at Tiger Creek Refuge, north of<br>
Tyler.  TCR, while not a zoo per se, is a wildlife<br>
sanctuary that rescues big cats and cares for them, so<br>
it is zoo-ey.  I did ask permission to plant there. <br>
When I told them about letterboxing and showed them my<br>
awesome tiger stamp, and explained that I wanted to<br>
plant it there because I believe in what they do and I<br>
wanted to share that with other people by bringing<br>
them to TCR through my box, and when I added that<br>
LB'ers are by and large naturalists and<br>
conservationists, they were enthusiastic.  I visited<br>
there a month or so ago and there were a fair number<br>
of stamps in the logbook, several of whom noted that<br>
if it hadn't been for the box they would never have<br>
known about TCR.  The director also told me that the<br>
folks who had come out to look for my box were the<br>
nicest group of folks they could ever hope to have as<br>
visitors and that they seemed to really care about<br>
learning about the TCR mission.  It appears that<br>
everyone wins by my having placed that box there.<br>
<br>
Does that help?<br>

Actually, it may.  Do you mind if I use your Tiger Creek Refuge box as <br>
an example for the zoo dudes?<br>

<div>Maybe you could do a series of some of the animals in that zoo. In each box, you could put some interesting facts about that animal. Just a thought!</div>
