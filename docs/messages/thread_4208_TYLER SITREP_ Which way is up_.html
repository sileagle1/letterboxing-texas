                    <div class="plaintext-content">If Heather was watching the gathering website at all, she saw that my RSVP<br>
numbers changed on Friday - more than once.  If I had changed it every time<br>
our plans changed, it would have changed more often than it did.<br>
<br>
I knew I would be going to her gathering, but at the last minute Fearless<br>
Fox and Lightning became available to go too.  Then they became unavailable<br>
due to pressing work in the garage, then Trail Whale decided to come visit<br>
and they all became available to go to the gathering again (Trail Whale<br>
would have made the garage work difficult at best).  It was close to<br>
midnight Friday when they were still trying to decide what to do, and I<br>
decided I had to go to bed because regardless of their plans, my plan was to<br>
get to Tyler very early and do some boxing there before the gathering.  I<br>
asked Fearless Fox to leave me a note as to whether to wake them all up or<br>
not.<br>
<br>
My plans were not to be.  After going to bed, I still didn't get to sleep<br>
until well after 1 am, so as I was drifting off I knew in my heart I would<br>
not be rising at 5:30 as I had hoped.  Sure enough, when I awoke at 3 am and<br>
couldn't get back to sleep until 5 am, I turned the alarm off and decided I<br>
would be happy to just wake up when I woke up and then I could feel good all<br>
day instead of dragging around.  Given that we had Trail Whale (2 years old<br>
tomorrow!), I had no doubt that dragging was a bad idea!  I got up at 7:30<br>
to the sound of Trail Whale's persistent babbling and feeling surprisingly<br>
rested and relaxed.  Trail Whale and I got ourselves up and going, then I<br>
got the guys up, and they decided they were game to go with - that was cool<br>
because rarely does Fearless Fox come along and lately, Lightning just<br>
hasn't had time.  It was going to be a day with three of my favorite guys!<br>
<br>
We ambled out of the house a little after 8 - after the gathering was to<br>
have started, but still, a little less than a half hour drive for us so we<br>
would be a little late.  We loaded into the car, stopped at the store for a<br>
watermelon for the gathering (still rolling around in my van) and headed<br>
on.  We noticed some band kids doing a car wash and decided the van needed a<br>
wash.  9 am by then, but still - no worries.  THEN Fearless Fox decided to<br>
try getting to the gathering site the back way (for those who know the area,<br>
he decided there would be access from 2493 - Old Bullard Road).  I was<br>
pretty sure that was wrong, but it's best not to argue with the man with an<br>
onboard compass in his head so I let him roll on, figuring that would add<br>
about 15 minutes to the trip.  Besides it was easier for me to spot coming<br>
from Tyler than Jacksonville, so we'd just sneak around the backside and<br>
come up on it from the direction I knew better anyway.<br>
<br>
Now I have already mentioned that I knew how to spot the place we were going<br>
to.  I had seen the sign many times on my way home from Tyler, so I didn't<br>
sweat directions.  The problem was, the sign I knew was not there yesterday,<br>
and I now know it was covered by another temporary sign!  I also thought ROC<br>
was the name of the church (there's a chain of churches on the East Coast by<br>
that name).  Turns out, ROC is the Recreation Outreach Center for Green<br>
Acres Baptist Church in Tyler (is that right, Heather?).  So when I looked<br>
at what the temporary sign was covering up, I saw that it was Green Acres<br>
and not ROC and figured we were in the wrong place.  Lesson to event goers -<br>
even if you know where you are going, READ what the event organizer says in<br>
case there are special instructions or up to date information!  Sorry<br>
Heather...<br>
<br>
We were all in good moods and pretty relaxed and I was sure enjoying having<br>
my guys with me, so after a little looking (and after checking AQ on my<br>
phone only to find the event section isn't part of the mobile site), I<br>
suggested we pass on the gathering and just go letterboxing.  Fearless Fox<br>
was reluctant because he knew how much I had wanted to go, but he finally<br>
agreed when I pointed out that Trail Whale was getting antsy.  So off we<br>
went...<br>
<br>
I can't really explain to you why it takes me so long to get the boxes<br>
closest to me, but Tyler is a mere 30 minutes from me and I've done precious<br>
little boxing there.  Maybe it's because Tyler is very congested most of the<br>
time and driving is a pain there (I've often said I would rather drive in<br>
Dallas than in Tyler), or maybe it's because I usually have a mission when I<br>
go to Tyler so I'm on limited time.  Anyway...I've done very little boxing<br>
there.<br>
<br>
One thing I wanted to accomplish was to show Fearless Fox where the new Cub<br>
Scout Camp is going to be so I suggested we go find JBK's boxes there,<br>
Universe and Headache Springs...oh, but, I digress.<br>
<br>
In our search for the gathering location from FM 2493, we stumbled upon the<br>
site of one of Purple Nic's funky hat box locations.  A chain of coffee<br>
shops that all have cowboy hats.  Weird.  It would have been hard to miss.<br>
Great place for a box. Even though we were intent on finding the gathering<br>
site, I decided we should stop and get her box.  I rattled through my clues<br>
and found the one we needed and we figured out where we should be.  NOW - we<br>
might have been at the wrong pole, but if we were at the right pole, the<br>
vegetation surrounding the box has been killed and the box would have been<br>
exposed and is now no longer there.  Someone who has found that box (the one<br>
in Flint) might stop by and check for her.  I was bummed.  We started to get<br>
coffees anyway but we had each had an espresso at home so figured the<br>
caffeine might have been overkill.<br>
<br>
So anyway, back to Universe and Headache Springs.  On the way to the<br>
location, Fearless Fox and I had a discussion about whether that could<br>
possibly be the place where the camp was supposed to be because he could<br>
have sworn it was to be up north of I-20.  I had actually been to where we<br>
were going and had seen the BSA sign, so I knew I was right but decided to<br>
let him find out for himself.  Sure enough we got there and there was the<br>
BSA No Trespassing sign.  He graciously admitted I was right.  So<br>
anyway...JBK had planted a box there, presumably before the No Trespass<br>
signs had gone up, so when I had gone for the box before I didn't want to<br>
cross the signs (yeah, I could argue that as a registered scouter I was<br>
"technically" on property I had a right to be on, but I really didn't want<br>
to have to go to jail before I got an opportunity to explain it and I had a<br>
BSA banquet to go to later than night and I didn't want to have to tell them<br>
I was late getting there because I had to be bailed out for trespassing on<br>
BSA property - just didn't seem like a good thing).  She moved the box<br>
slightly so it would still be at the site, but not beyond the signs.  In any<br>
case, Headache Springs and Universe were fairly close together.<br>
<br>
We ventured into the cemetery (because we all know JBK loves to plant<br>
cemetery boxes!) and began following directions.  She led us to yet another<br>
immensely interesting cemetery!  As we followed the trail and wound through<br>
headstones, we found ourselves in woods. This was the first time Trail Whale<br>
has been letterboxing since he could stand on his own two feet, and his mama<br>
and daddy don't get him off the concrete often enough for his taste, so as<br>
soon as he heard the leaves rattling under his feet he was EXCITED!  While<br>
Fearless Fox chased him around the woods, Lightning and I zeroed in on<br>
Universe, the first box.  We quickly found it and found a shady spot to sit<br>
down and log in, and eventually Trail Whale wound up in the middle of<br>
everything trying to figure out what we had going on.  He wound up wearing a<br>
stamp image of the box and of mine and we finally got finished, buttoned the<br>
box back up, did a little maintenance on it and got ready to replace it.<br>
Now THAT got Trail Whale's attention!  He definitely associates tupperware<br>
with food, and he's all about the next snack, so he wasn't getting why we<br>
would think it is a good idea to leave a tupperware container in the woods.<br>
We had to replace it twice before we could keep him from dragging it back up<br>
to bring with him.  We were ready to look for the next box, except...<br>
<br>
Does this happen to anyone else?  You might have JUST gone to the bathroom,<br>
but suddenly when a bathroom is very inacessible and you're letterboxing and<br>
on a mission, you have to go again.  It doesn't matter if I'm by myself or<br>
with six other people, SOMEONE invariably has to go to the bathroom at an<br>
inconvenient time at a box location.  Well SOMEONE in our group had to go.<br>
Bad.  So we wound up abandoning the search for the next box and heading to<br>
Schlotzsky's for a bathroom break and lunch.<br>
<br>
While at Schlotzsky's, I took the time to rearrange my clues which had been<br>
arranged based on locations I thought we could do after the gathering and<br>
got them together as likely hunts with Trail Whale and from our current<br>
location.  I decided to take us downtown to look for JBK's Cotton Belt Depot<br>
box and then for Puppy Love's Winter Wonderland.<br>
<br>
I navigated while Fearless Fox drove.  I'm not quite sure why we always take<br>
this arrangement since he has an amazing sense of direction and knows<br>
innately how to get to streets and locations if he's ever been there once.<br>
Anyway, I navigated while he ignored my directions (to which he always says<br>
"I listen, but then I adjust your directions.") and we wound up right where<br>
we needed to be.  We always take the time to read historical markers and the<br>
one at the depot was no exception - and was very interesting.  We've always<br>
enjoyed learning about the history of the railroad in East Texas though.  We<br>
read the clues and spotted the likely box location and went our way there.<br>
It was one of those places anyone else would not think to look, which made<br>
it a great hiding spot.  Lightning and I were going to make short work of<br>
it, but Trail Whale wanted to go along so we took him with.  He was entirely<br>
amazed to see that someone else had also left tupperware in an obviously<br>
foolish place in terms of storing snacks.  We grabbed him up and went back<br>
to the car to stamp in (nice rendition of the subject), then took him back<br>
to replace the box.  He wasn't so keen on keeping that box - I guess he<br>
figured any snacks hidden in there weren't fit to eat anyway (although he<br>
isn't real picky about what floor he eats off, so I wouldn't have thought<br>
him to find under a rock too unusual!).  He then decided he needed to sit on<br>
the step, and sit he did, until he got good and ready to go.  Grandparents<br>
and uncles put up with a lot more than moms and dads do.<br>
