                    <div class="plaintext-content">Woke up this fine morning in our campsite to find a frightened cajun character named Junior huddled in the corner of Lightning's extra sleeping bag.  <br/>
<br/>
It took some convincing, but Junior is weary of Zydeco Joe's single-minded obsession with our tour bus and with Pancho Juan's persistent pursuit and ominous presence.<br/>
<br/>
We devised a daring plan to snatch the bus right from beneath their noses.<br/>
<br/>
We sneaked up on the two of them, who appeared to have fallen asleep while staring each other down - the bus at their feet.<br/>
<br/>
While Junior made a huge racket, Lightning slipped in and grabbede the bus, tossing it out to Fearless Fox.  I backed up Junior to improvise a story if needed.<br/>
<br/>
Now the bus is hidden safely away, at least for the moment.  Anyone interested in claiming it had better hurry.<br/>
<br/>
It can be found at the state park in the town known for its chicken and sausage.  <br/>
Go to the site where the flag flies free over the 403.  Sorry for being so cryptic, but we are trying to keep the bus a step ahead of Zydeco Joe and Pancho Juan.<br/>
