worthy but once I got there I found that it may have been covered <br/>
up.  The piles of cement have recently been leveled out with a bull <br/>
dozer.  I saw a few culverts in the water but none had any dates on <br/>
them.  It's possible I wasn't looking hard enough, but I know I was <br/>
at the right launch.  After hunting I walked the path around the <br/>
park and saw a solid black squirrel and several red(Fox)squirrels <br/>
feeding in the tree feeders.  I was going to plant one but the few <br/>
hiding spots I found didn't pass my my checklist.<br/>
