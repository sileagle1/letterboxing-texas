                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Duck Ducks...Jeff and Tara had a great day out boxing today and <br>
we wanted to share it with y'all.<br>
The very first day we started this adventure we couldn't find a few <br>
particular boxes by Catpawz2004.  Since these are very close to us <br>
we have gone back several times to look for them.  We have even <br>
taken our older son along thinking maybe we were doing something <br>
wrong.<br>
Well, Forest Park was fine.  Found it, it just doesn't get much <br>
visitors.  But Oak Creek we could never find until today and we <br>
finally did it.  It was in bad shape.  We cleaned it up, replaced <br>
the box and moved to a more secure location out of danger.  Since <br>
catpawz2004 has not been heard from in awhile we have arranged to <br>
adopt these two boxes for now.  We consider it just babysitting for <br>
awhile.  <br>
We also found a long lost HH today, which was a first for us.  So we <br>
will be setting it back free tomorrow, I can't wait.<br>
There is one more box by catpawz that we have not been able to <br>
locate and we will be going back to it again tomorrow.  I am not <br>
leaving that park until I have found that box!<br>
So I just wanted y'all to know that Hunt County is really getting <br>
busy with boxes.  Head this way and you are sure to get some good <br>
finds.  Happy boxing!<br>
