"...Most of the area land was devoted to livestock and to <br/>

orchard of dwarf apple trees in 1980, and the first apples were <br/>

apples that were 40 percent sweeter than large-tree varieties and <br/>

2,500 trees an acre. In 1989 the Texas Department of Agricultureqv <br/>
declared Medina the Apple Capital of Texas. The 300,000 trees in the <br/>
Medina area produced 100 tons of fruit in 1990, and more orchards <br/>
were being planted each year. The annual Medina Apple Festival, held <br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">If you go to Medina, be sure to stop by Love Creek Orchards<br/>
store:  http://www.lovecreekorchards.com/<br/>
It has just about everything you can make with apples and<br/>
the best soft-serve apple ice cream you will ever eat!<br/>
Be sure to put the hot apple syrup on top, too.<br/>
Not sure where you can put a box (I wanted to put one in<br/>
the store, but never got a reply from my email to them), but<br/>
it would be great if you could do it.  It is a "must stop"<br/>
every time my family heads that way.<br/>
