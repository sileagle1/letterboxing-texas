                    <html><body><div>It's only been in the last year or so that I've become a night owl.  Don't know why - getting older maybe?  I know that's why I'm going from being distinctly near-sighted to needing longer arms.  Anyway, I normally have to keep myself up on New Year's Eve, and here I am, thinking Midnight is closing in quickly and I haven't gotten half the things done I really wanted to finish this year!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I first started LBing, I started out with a spiral-bound index card book for my logbook.  That was September 2003.  Because there were no boxes to be found and I had never even seen another letterboxer, I had only scratched the surface of the game by New Year's Eve that year.  I had no idea what real letterboxers used for logbooks, so I was content.  I went to that first Texas gathering, the one at Bastrop, and I saw lots of different logbooks, and I also found that little book just wasn't sufficient.  Lines on one side, small pages just weren't good for doing exchanges or for collecting quite a few stamps.  I determined I would stick it out until I filled it up, but by the end of 2004, I had the itch for a new and real logbook and I reasoned that the new year was a good time to start a new book.  So I did.  And I went in search of the perfect logbook.  It had to be bigger - it was like a light bulb for me - why did I HAVE to have a small logbook for myself?  It made sense for boxes, but not for personal logbooks - not for me anyway.  So bigger.  Yep.  I still liked the spiral thing, so that was a go for the new one.  I finally found one I liked - don't remember where or really, even what sort of book it was.  It had a black cover and black spirals and very slightly off-white pages.  I wanted to make it the best logbook ever so I took the time and calligraphied our names and everything into the first page.  I made a nice orange-y cover announcing it was our logbook and glued it to the cover.  I resolved to keep it neat and clean and to be careful in placing new stamp images.  I started it on Christmas Day 2004 by placing Catching Any? in Henderson after our family dinner over there.  That was the day I started trying to drag our extended family into this madness of a game!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That was a good logbook.  Except that the surface was too shiny.  Ink didn't take well.  Mental note #1.  I was very careful about putting stamps into it - at first.  As I started finding more boxes, I started not being so careful.  And then I went to the second Texas gathering - the one at Brazos Bend - the weekend of the great flood.  The weekend Lightning and I were put to the test and passed.  The weekend we, seasoned campers, got flooded out of our tent.  The weekend the raccoon tried to steal my dinner right off the picnic table - while Lightning watched!  The weekend Lightning learned that it is best to take it on faith that raccoons will steal anything and that he should always protect another camper's meal unless he is willing to share his own.  The weekend of BEA's, BoxDN, that crazy Clue game, lots of alligators and many other critters roaming about.  But I digress.  The logbook.  After that gathering, stamps were literally thrown to the page willy nilly.  But we remembered every one of them.  Somewhere along the way, I realized I should be better organized and should at least save room to put series together.  Mental note #2.  That was the year of JEN - a box planting gathering.  And meeting Gryzzled Gryphon.  And sitting around with my LB friends trying to solve that infernal clue, only to find we all managed the insurmountable within a few short hours of each other.  And as the year drew to a close, I had not even nearly filled that logbook, but I decided I liked the custom of beginning a new logbook with the new year.  SJZ beat me to the hunt by giving me a lovely bound logbook that looks like a tree on the outside - some weird textured cover intended to look tree-y, but feeling not at all like I was carrying a tree around.  It was a gift from my lovely daughter, my girl who was so close to leaving home, who had so recently given us the scare of our lives, the one I hope y'all never have to live through - she came so close to losing her life in a car accident the November of 2005.  That was the very best logbook I could ever hope for, because she picked it out for me. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So with new logbook in hand, Fearless Fox, Lightning, and I went letterboxing on New Year's Day, this time taking a friend and his two car-seat aged grandsons with us.  It was some time around the first of the year that GG tickled my love of a good challenge and mentioned that dastardly Scarlet Pimpernel, which was to become my and GG's and PuddleSplasher's bain for several months, and which Dewberry solved in a matter of days, if not hours.  It was only a few days into the year that the Texas Tour Bus landed in my back yard and I had to go to work, so I convinced Fearless Fox to make that fateful run to Martin Creek Lake to retrieve the Tour Bus, only to be out-maneuvered by PuddleSplasher - GRRR!  But I digress.  I kept my lovely logbook lovely, and I actually started out writing trip summaries in this one, telling who went, where we went, what the day was like.  I was so very close to F100 a few weeks before the March gathering that I went on a boxing binge trying to get there before the gather - after all, how could I attend my third gathering with fewer stamps than some who had started and were just attending their first?  Even with that mad rush that put me over 100, I kept my book all orderly - until the third Texas gathering - the one in Rusk.  Dinner at Big Bertha's.  Outing Gryzzled Gryphon.  The Maydelle Winery.  Staying until the last embers died talking to Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, Gryzzled Gryphon, and Sea Dove of Birds of a Feather.  Having our good friends, Kim of Compass Points and her daughter, along with Kim's parents' Happy Days, all from Oklahoma coming down for the gathering and Happy Days planting a box that officially annexed Texas to Oklahoma.  Armadillo Girl was so proud of her new stamp and of being able to spell armadillo, that I let her stamp it in my book every time I saw her that weekend - not once, not twice, but three times!  That was when I decided I didn't WANT to care so much what my logbook looks like, because I want little kids to feel free to stamp my book over and over again if they so desire.  Kids are cool.  And as the year drew to a close, it was very difficult to decide, yet again, to get a new logbook.  My tree-y book was, after all, a gift from SJZ.  Still and all, I decided the tradition was a good one, since I still had things I wanted to do to improve my logbook.  Bound is out.  Too much space in the middle that is wasted.  Keeping space together for series.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And so it is that I am now closing out my 2006 logbook, even as the year draws to a close.  I feel very good about this year.  I got in more outings and I ventured out further than I did in previous years.  I met lots of great people, and got to see again folks who have become good friends.  Lucy Locket, Blue Butterfly and I got to have a spur of the moment meet-up with the totally awesome Box-Alots.  I continue to find places I would never find if it weren't for letterboxing.  My eyes stay open and my mind aware as I go about my days, largely because letterboxing has taught me to be observant, and even keenly observant on good days.  
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>My new logbook, is smaller than my previous two, but not as small as my first.  It's got a hard moleskin cover.  Creamy pages, smooth and clean, and no gloss.  It's bound - I rethought that because this one opens out flat.  What I like best about it is that it is clean and cool - full of promise.  I will let kids, and maybe some adults, stamp into it as many times as they want, but I will try to do a better job of getting good images of box stamps.  I'll take a little more time  in stamping into it, and I will also do better at writing notes in box logs because I'm taking my time this year.  I'll make room for series, so they can be together.  I'll be a better boxer this year.  I will.

<div><font size="2">What a great message! It brings such a smile to my face. You are awesome. I especially love your resolution to "do better at writing notes in box logs because I'm taking my time this year". I was telling my husband today that I need to get back to the basics of letterboxing, and recapture the way I felt when I first started. I rarely went for more than one box in a day. I would take pictures, write in my journal, enjoy the hike, even enjoy the drive to the trailhead.... it was positively ZEN! I sometimes forget that it really is the journey and not the destination that counts. Enjoy that new log book, and I hope that when you're flipping your calendar at the end of 2007, you can look back through your full log book and be reminded of many great adventures.</font></div>

<div><font size="2">Happy New Year to all the Texas Letterboxers. I am certainly looking forward to seeing each of you on the trails and at the March Event!</font></div>
