Great Book Adventure.  Those of you who have followed Wanda's<br>
adventures know that she is a prolific letterboxer--with more than<br>
10,000 finds.  More than her F count though, she is an avid hiker, an<br>
enthusiastic participant, an encourager of newbies and more.  No<br>
matter how many boxes Wanda hits in a day, she takes the time to write<br>
a little note in each one and carefully rehide.  I am still happy to<br>
see her stamps and notes in the boxes she hit when here for the Brazos<br>
Bend Texas letterboxing event.  Looking forward to meeting Pete as<br>
well. . .<br>
<br>
So watch out!  No letterbox in Texas is safe!<br>

ps--both Team King and I have been really busy and haven't had that<br>
much of a chance to update our blog on the event.  Rest assured that<br>
some great stamps are arriving from across the country. . .it's going<br>
to be the best collection of stamps seen in Texas if not anywhere.  <br>

                    <html><body><p>A few weeks ago, we were boxing in Arizona and saw they had stamped in
one of the boxes there.  We were so excited to see someones name
we recognized!!<br/>
<br/>
Boxing there is quite different than here - mainly due to the
rattlesnakes but we saw all kinds of containers - peanut butter jars,
mayo jars, etc.  I did find it neat that several were covered with
a 12" square  of sand colored vinyl material.  Worked very
well in disguising the boxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Out of the 4 or 5 people that I emailed about finds or missing boxes
only 1 responded so that makes me think that Texas letterboxers are the
absolute BEST!!!<br/>

<div>I'd considered jars before, but decided they'd break in a freeze, and then 
everything would be soaked.  I've seen metal containers (altoids tins, for 
example) and kept several of those just in case, but then I've run across a few 
that had completely rusted together and were all but impossible to get open, so 
threw mine away.  I've also found pillboxes as well as film canisters used 
for microboxes and they seem pretty effective, watertight and weatherproof, 
although they limit the logbook and stamp to micro, too!  --
