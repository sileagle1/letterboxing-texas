                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi to all,<br/>
<br/>
I'd like to ditto Barefoot Lucy's comments about<br/>
internet safety, and personal safety in general.  I<br/>
agree, this does seem like a very nice cyberplace, and<br/>
the folks all seem very friendly, but then again,<br/>
that's only these folks, now . . . . . . and makes no<br/>
promises about possible future folks, nor about how<br/>
any folks might be irl.<br/>
<br/>
I'd agree with her -- how you first meet people is<br/>
most appropriately how you should continue to interact<br/>
with them, and changes in that situation should come<br/>
from the other person, not from you pressuring them,<br/>
or from someone pursuing you (as she mentioned).  If<br/>
you have "met" someone through the internet list, or<br/>
"contact the placer" or any other internet option,<br/>
that is based on trail names, then you should stick<br/>
only with those kinds of options.  If, at some point,<br/>
someone OFFERS you a different approach (such as real<br/>
name or phone number), then you can take it, or leave<br/>
it, and offer yours in return, or NOT, as you please. <br/>
(and please, let's never forget the "public place"<br/>
commandment, for first-time meetings!)<br/>
<br/>
It's like checking IDs at the daycare.....anyone who<br/>
is even reasonably aware of the risks to children in<br/>
today's world *should* be delighted to have their ID<br/>
checked, any time any employee has even the slightest<br/>
doubt that they have, or have not, met you before.  If<br/>
you quibble or balk, then that only makes you more<br/>
suspicious, I think (and my employer thinks so, too).<br/>
<br/>
Likewise, people who understand the potential risks of<br/>
meeting irl with folks you only know from online will<br/>
be understanding, and similarly reasonably cautious,<br/>
most likely.  And folks who don't understand these<br/>
potential risks, well....they need to catch up with<br/>
the new world, I think!<br/>
<br/>
When folks say or imply "there's never been a<br/>
problem", what I hear is "there's never been a problem<br/>
YET" - just like when folks say their dog "has never<br/>
bitten anyone", what they really mean is "has never<br/>
bitten anyone YET".<br/>
<br/>
But most assuredly, I do want to say it again, this<br/>
particular List has been very great and fun and<br/>
friendly and I would in fact like to meet many/all of<br/>
you in person, someday.  But if I were to suddenly get<br/>
a phone call from someone I had not directly shared my<br/>
real name or number with, that would feel pretty odd,<br/>
it really would.<br/>
<br/>
(Sheesh!  I don't post often, but when I do, it just<br/>
all falls out, doesn't it!?)<br/>
<br/>
: )<br/>
<br/>
Have a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Ashby<br/>
