                    <div class="plaintext-content"> I finally went on a letterbox maintenance outing this evening to <br>
check on the boxes in my Looping Lassos series. Unfortunately out of <br>
the 5 boxes, only 2 were still there - Purple Cow (but the little <br>
poems were molded) and Come On, Sea Biscuit (but it was wet). So I <br>
removed the poems for now, and took Sea Biscuit home with me for an <br>
overhaul. <br>
<br>
 While there, I checked on Baby Bear's Hiker's Maze. It was still <br>
there, only the book was wet and most (but not all) of the stamps <br>
were washed out. The names were still there though. I'll be glad to <br>
send you the book, if you email me with your address. I put a sheet <br>
of paper in the micro-box, and when I go back again, in about a <br>
week, I will have another little booklet made to replace the <br>
previous one. <br>
<br>
I am not going to replace my missing letterboxes, but I think I will <br>
make some new ones for that location. But I won't be putting them <br>
back in the same areas. I was quite surprised at the three that were <br>
missing - well, two of them anyway. I wouldn't have thought anyone <br>
would be wandering around in the area where they were hidden. And <br>
Sea Biscuit - I was surprised it was still safe and sound. <br>
Especially since it looked like the mowers had been over it. Park <br>
maintenance on the hiking-biking trail is not consistant and what <br>
you might hide dangerously far off the trail, in thick snakey brush <br>
one time, might be mowed and detailed the next time you come. So it <br>
is hard to judge... <br>
<br>
I took Shabree and Zachary with me, and in searching for one of the <br>
missing boxes, we found a tree covered in wild grape vines. The <br>
grapes were ripe and we picked a few to eat there, and a good amount <br>
to take home too. A nice bonus. :) Then we played and ate cold <br>
watermelon in the playground until dark. It was a really enjoyable <br>
evening. <br>

<br>
So nice to hear from you again!<br>
I think of you every time I pass a cemetery....hmmm...that may not have<br>
sounded the way I intended. I think of your RIP series every time I pass a<br>
cemetery!<br>
We recently found Tx2Chic's lovely "Lonesome Dove" in a quiet and serene<br>
graveyard, and another of our all-time favorite boxes was Catpawz' Forest<br>
Park. At the moment, we're creating a box for Pioneer Cemetery (next to<br>
Pioneer Plaza), so I've pulled out your RIP#3 stamp image to look at for<br>
inspiration. <br>
