<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">I just wanted to say that Pink Cookie and I had such a wonderful weekend at TALE 7 and we are so looking forward to TALE 8.<span>  </span>Letterboxing; camping; and being around such great people what more could you ask for.  But e<span>ven with all our fun going on o</span>ur prayer's went out to Lucy Locket and we hope that she is back on the trail real soon. <span> </span>This morning with SandiBox helping to keep a serious watch out for me I was able to rescue Lucy Locket's box that she planted in that little rascals home.<span>  </span>And he was home too, laying right out in front of his door just a sunning himself.<span>  </span>I will be posting pictures to the group site. <span> </span>Don't worry, I never got close enough to him and I trusted SandiBox to tell me when he moved I went around the back way to get to the tree stump and was able to knock the box free with a very long stick and that was it.<span>  </span>The Mug Shot Box is back safe in Lucy Locket's hands now.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Also while I was the gathering this weekend I spied a <b><i>sweet</i></b> text message in the kitchen - <span> </span>"The train has left <span> </span>Station 17 Elevated Platform", my heart starting racing because I hadn't seen a railroad track all day and thought that this could be interesting!<span>  </span>I quickly ran and found Pink Cookie and told her let's go! <span> </span>I left my backpack; my markers; stamps and pads just all over the table.<span>  </span>Pink Cookie didn't know what was up but Mama had said to run so she ran.<span>  </span>We got in our car and we actually peeled gravel out of the parking lot!<span>  </span>Drove around the loop twice before we found Station 17 and we pulled in.</font></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">We never saw a train, but we heard a ruckus around the platform and went to take a look.<span>  </span>Looked like a clown and a bear on a bike together and some interesting other characters looking on and cheering for them.<span>  </span>We said hello and asked what was going on? <span>  </span>The really nice Clown said that they heard about a gathering in Ottine and wanted to come down and put on a show but that they had been waiting for someone to pick them up for a little while.<span>  </span>I asked them if I could help and they said that they were really tired and just wanted some place to take a rest.<span>  </span>I said no problem you can sleep in my car for a while and I asked them if they need help with their stuff?<span>  </span>Well the Bear pointed over to this big blue cargo box and said that their Big Top was in it and that was all they needed.<span>  </span>Looking at the big blue cargo box I wondered if it would fit in my car.<span>  </span>Hummm, what could I leave behind to be able to help these nice Circus folk. chairs, tent, ice chest, Pink Cookie okok <span> </span>just for a split second on the last onelol.<span>  </span>She can sit on top of it all the way back!<span>  </span>Well I got over to the cargo box and there was a note posted that the train station attendant had taped on the top and it said something like "take everything inside but not the cargo box" whew!<span>  </span>Good thing too because Pink Cookie wouldn't have been too happy with me.<span>  </span>We gathered up all the Circus people and got them in the car nicely tucked in on the back seat for a nap. <span> </span>Then Pink Cookie and I went back to the gathering a little out of breath; slightly flushed and giddy with excitement of meeting such interesting folks. </font></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt;"><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">Well they slept the rest of the afternoon away in my car and never woke up.<span>    </span>Later that evening after dark some of the Circus folks heard some hullabaloo and took a peek out the back window what they saw scared them into staying put and not getting out to investigate.<span>  </span>Seems there was this ghost flying across a campfire trying to jump into the fire with screaming and laughing going on by all these people in a circle.<span>  </span>Then there was this woman shaking a flashlight and saying I can't get this to work can someone else try?<span>  </span>And another woman couldn't find her lighter and kept asking people if they had any matches?<span>  </span>And there was this very old camera that they were trying to take pictures with that looked very primitive in today's era And this clear chilly looking box with a bean that looked a little curious too then they heard about someone named Pepper in a peach can and that sounded a little weird to them. <span> </span>Then they saw this man with a worn hat start dancing a jig by the fire and then a woman was bowing to the fire; then they heard this guy talking about stamping a baby hummm what kind of gathering is this they thought?<span> Not for us!  </span>So they bunkered down and decided to stay the night where they were.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt;"><font face="comic sans ms" size="3">The next morning I went hiking again bright and early and when I got back to break camp talked with them for a minute.<span>  </span>They asked if they could hitch a ride my way and they were so nice I couldn't turn them down.<span>  </span>So we packed them up tight on top of the pile of stuff in the back seat and headed home.<span>  </span>So for a little while the Texas Traveling Circus will have their Big Top set up behind my Beach Shack and they said something about needing some new Circus folk for some new acts so I guess I will see what they need and if I can help them getting back out on the road real soon.</font></span></p>
<p><span style="FONT-SIZE: 11pt;"><font face="Comic Sans MS" size="3">Needless to say we had a very exciting weekend!</font></span></p>

Wow, that campfire sounds insane. Who knows what kind of people those were? Too bad the circus perfomers didn't check it out - I think they may have found a good sideshow act, especially the guy dancing the jig by the fire!<br>

&gt; Hi Everyone,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I just wanted to say that Pink Cookie and I had such a wonderful weekend<br/>
&gt; at TALE 7 and we are so looking forward to TALE 8.  Letterboxing;<br/>
&gt; camping; and being around such great people what more could you ask for.<br/>
&gt; But even with all our fun going on our prayer's went out to Lucy<br/>
&gt; Locket and we hope that she is back on the trail real soon.  This<br/>
&gt; morning with SandiBox helping to keep a serious watch out for me I was<br/>
&gt; able to rescue Lucy Locket's box that she planted in that little<br/>
&gt; rascals home.  And he was home too, laying right out in front of his<br/>
&gt; door just a sunning himself.  I will be posting pictures to the group<br/>
&gt; site.  Don't worry, I never got close enough to him and I trusted<br/>
&gt; SandiBox to tell me when he moved… I went around the back way to get<br/>
&gt; to the tree stump and was able to knock the box free with a very long<br/>
&gt; stick and that was it.  The Mug Shot Box is back safe in Lucy<br/>
&gt; Locket's hands now.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also while I was the gathering this weekend I spied a sweet text message<br/>
&gt; in the kitchen -  "The train has left…  Station 17 Elevated<br/>
&gt; Platform", my heart starting racing because I hadn't seen a<br/>
&gt; railroad track all day and thought that this could be interesting!  I<br/>
&gt; quickly ran and found Pink Cookie and told her let's go!  I left my<br/>
&gt; backpack; my markers; stamps and pads just all over the table.  Pink<br/>
&gt; Cookie didn't know what was up but Mama had said to run so she ran. <br/>
&gt; We got in our car and we actually peeled gravel out of the parking lot! <br/>
&gt; Drove around the loop twice before we found Station 17 and we pulled in.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We never saw a train, but we heard a ruckus around the platform and went<br/>
&gt; to take a look.  Looked like a clown and a bear on a bike together and<br/>
&gt; some interesting other characters looking on and cheering for them.  We<br/>
&gt; said hello and asked what was going on?   The really nice Clown said<br/>
&gt; that they heard about a gathering in Ottine and wanted to come down and<br/>
&gt; put on a show but that they had been waiting for someone to pick them up<br/>
&gt; for a little while.  I asked them if I could help and they said that<br/>
&gt; they were really tired and just wanted some place to take a rest.  I<br/>
&gt; said no problem you can sleep in my car for a while and I asked them if<br/>
&gt; they need help with their stuff?  Well the Bear pointed over to this big<br/>
&gt; blue cargo box and said that their Big Top was in it and that was all<br/>
&gt; they needed.  Looking at the big blue cargo box I wondered if it would<br/>
&gt; fit in my car.  Hummm, what could I leave behind to be able to help<br/>
&gt; these nice Circus folk.… chairs, tent, ice chest, Pink Cookie…<br/>
&gt; ok…ok  just for a split second on the last one…lol.  She can sit<br/>
&gt; on top of it all the way back!  Well I got over to the cargo box and<br/>
&gt; there was a note posted that the train station attendant had taped on<br/>
&gt; the top and it said something like "take everything inside but not<br/>
&gt; the cargo box"… whew!  Good thing too because Pink Cookie<br/>
&gt; wouldn't have been too happy with me.  We gathered up all the Circus<br/>

                    <html><body><div>I think what I enjoy the very most about every event is meeting and getting to know different boxers every year. Over the years I've made so many great friends! Even Fearless Fox, who shies away from us all a little bit, is starting to feel like he knows folks at these things. And Draconis viridis just seems to do his own thing at gatherings - I glance up every now and then to see him across the area, talking to someone or doing something - it's kind of cool to realize he has basically grown up amongst letterboxers and doesn't know much different!</div>
<div></div>
<div>This year, we had the pleasure of sharing a campsite with BeachBum and Pink Cookie and with Cancan. We had a great time in our own campsite during the down time because our company was so good. I will always remember the great conversations around our own campfires in the morning and evenings.One thing I advise though if you ever think to share a campsite with someone- be sure you REALLY know what type of peopleyour sitemates are. As it turns out, we had the Cootie Queen and her Trainee in our site. Every time I turned anything over, every time I opened anything up, a cootie fell out! I have never been so cootied during the non-event portion of an event as I was this year! Of course, it would be rude to name names as to who this person (and her trainee) is, but I think I could maintain my manners and still rule out Cancan (who, by the way, graced us with her delicious Texas sheet cake).</div>

<div>We had the good fortune of spending a little after event time with Bell Motel and Whiz Gee on Sunday morning. I had heard from several folkshow congenial and truly good-hearted they are - but really, until you meet them you have no idea how much that is the case.</div>

<div>There is just never enough time to get to know the new folks and talk to the old friends, so I guess Silver Eagle and Baby Bear will have to keep having gatherings forever.

<div>I think what I enjoy the very most about every event is meeting and getting to know different boxers every year.  Over the years I've made so many great friends!  Even Fearless Fox, who shies away from us all a little bit, is starting to feel like he knows folks at these things.  And Draconis viridis just seems to do his own thing at gatherings - I glance up every now and then to see him across the area, talking to someone or doing something - it's kind of cool to realize he has basically grown up amongst letterboxers and doesn't know much different!</div>

<p>As I understand it, Lucy Locket had a cootie queen or so visit her at the hospital yesterday as well. Seems she found a couple of cooties in her hospital bed after some pretty cool letterboxers paid her a visit. I guess if you try to escape from letterboxing by going to the hospital, letterboxing will come to you. We'll have to find out more about this when Lucy Locket gets back to her computer.</p>

<div>This year, we had the pleasure of sharing a campsite with BeachBum and Pink Cookie and with Cancan.  We had a great time in our own campsite during the down time because our company was so good.  I will always remember the great conversations around our own campfires in the morning and evenings. One thing I advise though if you ever think to share a campsite with someone - be sure you REALLY know what type of people your sitemates are. As it turns out, we had the Cootie Queen and her Trainee in our site.  Every time I turned anything over, every time I opened anything up, a cootie fell out!  I have never been so cootied during the non-event portion of an event as I was this year!  Of course, it would be rude to name names as to who this person (and her trainee) is, but I think I could maintain my manners and still rule out Cancan (who, by the way, graced us with her delicious Texas sheet cake).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We had the good fortune of spending a little after event time with Bell Motel and Whiz Gee on Sunday morning.  I had heard from several folks how congenial and truly good-hearted they are - but really, until you meet them you have no idea how much that is the case.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was pleased to meet Mosaic Butterfly, who arranged for accomodations for us all at Gonzales Food Market, where we all gathered on Friday night and set the tone for the whole weekend.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nice to catch up a bit with BloominGrammaJo and Bird Dog, to get to talk briefly to Corazon, to see and wave to PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder (why did we never manage to sit down and talk?), to visit a bit with SandiBox...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There is just never enough time to get to know the new folks and talk to the old friends, so I guess Silver Eagle and Baby Bear will have to keep having gatherings forever.  Thanks, guys, for another great event.  Only thing I suggest is - Next year, don't invite the snake.  I told y'all when we started letting ghosts in, the crowd was gonna go downhill!<br/></div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>
