<div>I've not yet encountered anything really really scary, but I 
did get a fright once in a cemetery in a rural area while looking for Celtic 
Lions' Caddo Cemetery box - struggled to lift a large rock covering a 
small depression in the ground near the fence where the box was hidden 
and uncovered the box AND a small field mouse, who, I have to admit, was far 
more frightened than I was.  But I did fling that heavy rock quite a way 
when I jumped and yelped.  Then, of course, I did have to put it back later 
- watching carefully for any snake who might have been interested in the 
mouse.  So far, though, I've been pretty lucky - only one frightful 
experience and that by a small fieldmouse.  </div>

<div>Several come to mind and all but one involve the Frye Team!  :)  Maybe I should rethink who I box with?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Washington on the Brazos State Park:  All of the clues matched perfectly to the route my husband and I chose.  Of course, I wouldn't let him have the clues because this was MY hobby.  Our last clue, and the location of the letterbox took us to a tree near the water. Box was in a cavity on the side of a tree. This tree had a cavity and was near the water.  I bent down to reach in for the box ( did I mention that I was brand new to letterboxing at this time?) and then pulled my hand back quickly.  Maybe I should look inside the cavity first!  Thank goodness I did, because as I bent down, I came eye to eye with a rather large water moccasin, who had taken up residence in the cavity!  That was when my husband took the clues away from me and decided to call the shots...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Frye Team:  That overprotective dog at the Pop a Top letterbox site.  He was friendly at first, but then managed to get between me (out of the car) and Frye Team ( sitting protected IN the car).  Angela even tried throwing my lunch at him but he was more interested in me.  He jumped up on me a couple of times and I tried scratching his head, but his jumping became more violent as did his demeanor.   Aside from a few scratches, all was okay!  And then there was the tick episode and the pack of dogs episode...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>All in the name of fun and games, right?  :)<span contenteditable="false"></span></div>
