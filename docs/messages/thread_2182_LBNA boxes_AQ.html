<div>Would this Blue Diamond thing be too big a deal to explain here?  I'm just too darned tired to go dig through the chatter and I haven't seen anything about it in the places I go on AQ.  If it's complicated or involved, just say so and I'll go look later.

<p>It's vice-versa too, because there are some boxes listed on AQ that<br/>aren't listed on LBNA. Placers' choice, for a variety of reasons. . .<br/><br/>I think the blue diamond thing is a bunch of hoop-la over not much. <br/>
Many people automatically react to change in a negative way, without<br/>really giving it a chance. I don't think it'll affect either how I<br/>box or how I plant, but it may be one more helpful tool (not the only<br/>tool) in helping me evaluate boxes when I travel.

When people email and ask for help choosing boxes, I take into account<br>
what they're looking for, how long they want to hike, how comfortable<br>
they are driving around mega-opolis, whether they have kids.  When I<br>
ranked the boxes (and I did rank my finds; took all of 5 minutes), I<br>
took into account SOLELY our experience.  Just because I found them to<br>
be great boxes/experiences, doesn't mean someone else would!<br>
<br>
I don't think you can expect to ever get a completely "right" set of<br>
rankings, because experiences are so subjective, people aren't all<br>
ranking the same boxes, and they're not all using the same criteria. <br>
HOWEVER, to me it's kind of fun.<br>
<br>
For me, I started with a base of 3.  I added points for any of the<br>
following:  great view, cool hike, interesting hiding place, unique<br>
container, handmade or altered log, creative clues, beautiful carved<br>
stamp, etc.  I took away points if there were things that were<br>
off-putting about the box.  I felt free to be honest, because unlike<br>
with online comments, the placer is not seeing the ranking.   I<br>
appreciate anyone's efforts, but let's be honest, some boxing<br>
experiences are more rewarding than others.<br>
<br>
I don't have a lot of ego about our boxes, so it doesn't bother me if<br>
someone else ranks one I like a lot really low.  It's supposed to be<br>
fun and I plant for those who share our sense of humor, knowing full<br>
well that's not the general public.  Not all placers' boxes are going<br>
to be right for everyone.  So if I put a box out there that you hate;<br>
that's okay, you're probably just selectively not going to look for my<br>
boxes.  <br>
<br>
I don't think that it's anything to get all worked up about; people<br>
really flew off the handle (change, change, change), without seeing<br>
how it shakes out and if it's at all helpful to anyone.  Me, I'm going<br>
to wait and see.  <br>

<div>I did a little reading, and what the heck.  I voted on a few myself.  If nothing else, it's made me stop again and think what makes a box really special to me.  By knowing what I consider above and beyond can only help me be a better box creator, right?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I love to read Ryan's writing.  He has a great way with words, and a way of boiling things down to the simple facts.  Play if you want, don't if you don't, but don't tell other folks what they have to do.  Very cool.  For those of you who have never read "Ryan's Great Adventures" - DO!  The guy lives a life most of us never considered, and then has a great skill in telling about it!  Here's the link.  Pick any volume and read it, then you'll be hooked.
