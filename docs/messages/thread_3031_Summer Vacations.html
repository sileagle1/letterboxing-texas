<div>So, now we know where 
SE and BB went, and that they splurge when the kids aren't along :).  My 
goal is to someday have all 50 states under my belt, I don't have that many more 
to go, but Hawaii is a LONG way off.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So I wonder, where did 
the rest of us go for summer vacation?  We started off the summer in the 
pristine Upper Peninsula of Michigan, a trip that I would highly recommend to 
anyone who likes to be outdoors.  It is one of the most beautiful places on 
earth.  (And MUCH cooler than Houston in June!)  Then we went to South 
America (Chile) to visit my Mother in Law during July.  It was an amazing 
trip, and another beautiful place.  Look up "The Valley of the Moon" 
sometime...it is a landscape that is like no other.  My favorite week of 
the whole summer was a week at Crystal Beach, we are lucky to have neighbors who 
loan us their beach house from time to time.  Just me, the kids, and a near 
miss of a tropical storm.  I wish summer could last forever.

                    <html><body><div>Well, I went to Plaza Medical Center for vacation. Not once, but twice. And the second time, I got to eat lots and lots of Jell-O. It took them two floors to come up with a whole plateful. Talk about being spoiled. The best part about it, I wasn't able to lift more than 10 pounds (still on that restriction) for 2 months. So, I get away with being spoiled even more.</div> <div> </div> <div>But, really, I'm in a house now instead of an apartment and that is like a vacation for me. I get to eat out in the backyard whenever I want.</div> <div> </div> <div>South America sounds like fun. And to have a place to stay, BONUS!</div> <div> </div> <div>I too wish Summer would last forever. I am one of the only moms I know that dread back to school. Then you have deadlines, bedtimes, limited time to spend playing. Ugh!</div> <div> </div> <div>Vote for SUMMER FOREVER (ooh, that would make a great series),</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, Blooming
