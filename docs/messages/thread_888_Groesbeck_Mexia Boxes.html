<br>
Comanche - box was/is in the stump - only other entry was the  <br>
infamous GG about a year ago<br>
Ambling Armadillo - exposed and water in box, but logbook bagged and  <br>
dry so no problem<br>
Val Verde Cannon - all fine<br>
Confederate Flag - exposed but nothing wet or damaged<br>
<br>
Couple of notes though. . .2 of the 4 were sitting out completely  <br>
exposed. I have been noticing this more and more, especially with  <br>
older boxes.  The Armadillo box (one that was exposed) reminds me a  <br>
bit of Monkeytoes comment. . .the last half dozen entries were of  <br>
people - mostly families -  who didn't have a stamp and didn't appear  <br>
to be letterboxing. They just signed the book 'hey, we found this'  <br>
and other interesting comments. At least no one took it.<br>
<br>
But PLEASE PLEASE be sure to re-cover up the boxes after you find  <br>
them. I would venture to guess that often the kids in the group put  <br>
the boxes back and they aren't being covered up very well. (as MOST  <br>
of the exposed ones had family/kids as the last signed in)<br>
Perhaps just a double check on the box before you leave would help.<br>
<br>
Other than that, nice weekend up there, and sounds like Texas Tour  <br>
Bus is moving along just fine down here in Houston.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>
