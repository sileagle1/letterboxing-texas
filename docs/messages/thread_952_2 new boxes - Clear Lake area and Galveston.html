and one on our way back to town.<br>
<br>
Kemp's ridley is a tribute to an endangered species that is slowly <br>
making a comeback thanks to a lot of dedicated turtle friends.  This <br>
has been a record year for nesting turtles, with 6 on Galveston <br>
alone.  This box is at the Sandhill Crane Soccer Complex, primarily <br>
because the National Marine Fishery Service on Galveston where we <br>
wanted to place it near was spectacularly un-box-friendly.<br>
<br>
Then, we placed Labyrinth at Sylvan Rodriguez Park on Clear Lake <br>
City Blvd.  I think it's technically City of Houston, but if map-<br>
wizard Krohm wants to double check would seriously appreciate it.  <br>
We were there at sunset, and walking the labyrinth under the setting <br>
sun was a magical experience.  It was not the meditative walk that I <br>
know labyrinths are for some people; more like an all-out sprint to <br>
the center, but hey, they boys got something out of it at least!<br>
<br>
Clues to be posted soon, when the brain starts to function again <br>
after a day in the sun.<br>
