<div>You know, Silver Eagle, 
Dewberry and I went to look for that box not too long ago.  I would guess 
that after Ike a lot of trees were taken out in that spot, it looked like there 
were a lot of recently cut logs.  Don't be too disappointed, because even 
though the box was gone, you gave at least two letterboxers a wonderful morning 
out when we really needed it.  MO5</div>
