Howdy,<br>
<br>
Is anyone staying in one of the screened shelters Saturday night? <br>
Does anyone have extra room in their shelter for a Mom and a little <br>
kid? Do you think if I check in on Friday and refuse to leave they <br>
will let me stay on Saturday? I knew I should've made my <br>
reservations a loooooooong time ago.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
<br>
WOW<br>
MOM<br>
<br>
P.S. Yes, I am very trusting of a group of people who secretly go <br>
traipsing around in the woods, are only known my psudo-names, and <br>
play hide-and-seek even though they are grown ups.  Ohh the trouble <br>
I get into on the internet.<br>

Sugarland is just down the road.  Heck, for all the driving we do in <br>
Texas anyway, you could stay in downtown Houston and be to the park in <br>
probably less than an hour. LOL.<br>

Just an idea if the shelter doesn't work out. . .:)<br>

    There will be lots of room.<br>
we have already rented more sites then we need.<br>
each site is allowed a camper and a tent with as many<br>
as 8 people per site. It's actually unheard of. I've<br>
camped all my live and never known such latitude...<br>
there will be many of us there with extra room.<br>
just keep in touch and will give you the camp site #.<br>
several of us from La. will be going several days<br>
early for we plan to make this a redneck vacation...<br>
keep in touch,<br>
