Howdy,<br/>
<br/>
Is anyone staying in one of the screened shelters Saturday night? <br/>
Does anyone have extra room in their shelter for a Mom and a little <br/>
kid? Do you think if I check in on Friday and refuse to leave they <br/>
will let me stay on Saturday? I knew I should've made my <br/>
reservations a loooooooong time ago.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
<br/>
WOW<br/>
MOM<br/>
<br/>
P.S. Yes, I am very trusting of a group of people who secretly go <br/>
traipsing around in the woods, are only known my psudo-names, and <br/>
play hide-and-seek even though they are grown ups.  Ohh the trouble <br/>
I get into on the internet.<br/>

Sugarland is just down the road.  Heck, for all the driving we do in <br/>
Texas anyway, you could stay in downtown Houston and be to the park in <br/>
probably less than an hour. LOL.<br/>

Just an idea if the shelter doesn't work out. . .:)<br/>

    There will be lots of room.<br/>
we have already rented more sites then we need.<br/>
each site is allowed a camper and a tent with as many<br/>
as 8 people per site. It's actually unheard of. I've<br/>
camped all my live and never known such latitude...<br/>
there will be many of us there with extra room.<br/>
just keep in touch and will give you the camp site #.<br/>
several of us from La. will be going several days<br/>
early for we plan to make this a redneck vacation...<br/>
keep in touch,<br/>
