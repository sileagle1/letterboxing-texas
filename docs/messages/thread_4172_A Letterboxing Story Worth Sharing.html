<p>Please forgive my longwindedness and please read this post if you have the time. I've been wanting to give my own take on mine and DMS's experiences in Vermont, but in all the drama of the last several days I've been worried it would get lost. Things seem to have blown over a bit, so I'd like to post it now. I'm sure Mitch considered writing about it himself, but I imagine his take on what happened might be so personal, he's had difficulty putting it into words. So as a third party observer, I thought I might give it a try - because it's a story worth sharing, one that I feel so lucky to have experienced, and one that I hope might touch some others as it did me. <br/>
<br/>
When DMS and I first heard about the Back to Our Roots Gathering, we'd already made our travel plans for the summer. We're leaving for a month-long road trip centered around vending at LB-Con in St. Louis, and our entire travel budget and vacation allotments for the YEAR had already been completely taken by these plans. So the answer to "Can we go?" Was an unequivocable "No!" But still, the possibility just nagged and nagged at Mitch and there wasn't a day that went by that he didn't utter the phrase "Man, I just wish there was some way we could make it work." <br/>
<br/>
You see, 10 years ago, when the first ever gathering happened in Killington, VT, Der Mad Stamper was, as I understand it, the only conspicuously absent member of that original founding American Clan of our now favorite pasttime. Oregon is a long way from Vermont and the travel distance was a lot easier for most of those other originators. So it was understandable, with Mark Pepe planning surprises up his sleeve, and with him also dropping plenty of hints that those surprises were actually his attempts to get as many of those early pioneers as possible to attend this anniversary gathering, that Mitch was a bit obsessed with the idea of somehow making it out.<br/>
<br/>
As the weeks passed, I became very aware that a hole created with his absence at that first gathering ten years ago was still sitting empty somewhere in his heart, and that perhaps, if we could just make it work, a trip to Back to Our Roots might just be what he needed to finally fill it in. So in spite of all the reasonable and financial reasons for why it was an awful idea, we found ways to tighten our belts and make the trip. Of course, Mark had sworn us to secrecy, keeping us from signing up on the AQ list or letting anyone know we were coming. We knew he must be doing the same to many of those other "old timers", but it was anyone's guess who might actually show up.<br/>
<br/>
DMS wondered aloud many times during the few weeks about who might be there. Who, among all of those he's formed lifelong bonds with, communicating only by computer, might he finally be able to attach a face and a smile to the personality he could only imagine he'd guessed at correctly? He mentioned Randy Hall, Tom Cooch, Silent Doug, Jay Drew, and several others I can't remember. He wondered especially about Susan Davis - the one he's always described to me as "The Peacekeeper", the one who helped them all keep things in perspective when early debates between all those boys, including her husband Erik who's now passed away, turned petty.<br/>
<br/>
And what a gratifying gathering it was! There were so many wonderful friends to see again, and people to meet for the first time - those we thought would be there and those we hoped would, and so many others that weren't expected at all but who were just as delightful. Just to name a few: Choi, Silent Doug, Silver Eagle and Team Green Dragon (especially Brian, who must admit along with Mitch that they have shared as many snappish words as kind ones with each other over the years - it's about time those two found out thy might actually be able to get along!) And then there was Tom Cooch, who hasn't been around much in recent years, and who Mitch really only hoped wistfully might show up. And yet there he was, and the two hugged like old friends, even though they were meeting for the first time. I can only imagine he felt like he was surrounded by long lost family. And even though not every single one of those Killington Folk were able to make it - Susan Davis couldn't, and a few others too, there was enough magical experiences at that gathering to last a lifetime.<br/>
<br/>
And I guess if you've gotten through all my babbling so far, it's time to tell you that all of this has really just been the lead-in to what was truly one of the most special moments I've ever witnessed in my lifetime: <br/>
<br/>
As Mitch mentioned in his own post a couple of days ago, outside of the actual gathering, we only made time for two (yes, two - I know it's pitiful!) letterboxes for the entire trip. That was my fault mostly - I have too-rarely-seen family in the area so the vacation was serving a dual purpose and we had other obligations to meet that week as well. But during the little free time we were able to devote to boxing, we made two decisions: get one box in Killington as we were passing through, since it was the site of the first gathering (we chose "James P. Taylor"), and get over to Bristol for the newly replaced "Prayer Rock". Well the Killington had its own wonderful rainy adventures, as Mitch has already described, but it was our finding of "Prayer Rock" that he seems to have chosen not to describe. Like I mentioned before, I can only imagine that his experience in finding the box that he really feels was the first one was personal to share with others. But it's such a wonderful story that, even though he doesn't know I'm doing so, I thought that perhaps my bystander account might be just as special without making him feel quite so exposed.<br/>
<br/>
It really was just a "find" like any other; a few compass readings and a confusion or two before the final moment of enlightment. We sat at a picnic table visible from the road, opened the box, looked through the too-short logbook wishing we could have seen the original, before spreading our inks and books out for a luxuriously slow stamping in process. There was even the all-too-common moment when another car pulled in and we discussed whether we should put away our mess, or at least consolidate it, before nosey tourists felt the need to ask us too many questions. Being a little lazier than we probably should be, we did none of these and left everything lying about, and I proceeded to ink up the stamp. The occupants of the car got out - a woman and a young man on the verge of adulthood. They started walking toward us, which wasn't so odd since our table lay between them and the infamous "Prayer Rock" that the clue is named for. But instead of a curious and polite nod as they walked by, they came up to us directly, and the woman looked blatantly over Mitch's shoulder at the stamp in my hands. Thinking perhaps these two were just the investigative sort, I gave a polite hello, and waited for the inevitable questions about what we were up to. But the first words she uttered were an unexpected, "I've been wanting to see how the new carving turned out." Realizing at last that these were fellow letterboxers, I asked in reply, "Oh, did you have the opportunity to see the orignal?" To which the young man standing behind her replied, "Yeah, she CARVED the original."<br/>
<br/>
It was this moment that I made the connection, although Mitch stayed oddly quiet, given who we were obviously, magically, sitting next to. I asked what had to be asked though, "Are YOU Susan Davis?" to which she humbly nodded a slight affirmative. (Mitch told us all later that his delay in making the connection was because he was reacting internally to her carving claim with the thought, "No you didn't! Susan Davis carved that stamp!") At this point, the truth finally sunk in with DMS and he quite literally leaped from his seat at the table, coming close to mauling the poor woman before he seemed to realize that she had no idea who he was and looked momentarily scared to death. So stopping mid-embrace and instead reaching out a hand for a shake, he said "Susan, I'm Mitch. I'm Der Mad Stamper." Well her eyes got as wide as his did moments before and I hope I'm not embarrassing either one of them too badly by telling you all that they probably hugged for a solid 3 minutes, tears and all! (I even took a sneaky picture.)<br/>
<br/>
When the novelty of the situation finally abating, we all sat and had a truly beautiful conversation. The young man turned out to be Benjamin, Erik and Susan's son who had just graduated from high school a week earlier.  We showed them the one other image of theirs that we had found the day before in Killington, and Ben reminisced about how he, at 8 years old, had been the one to actually do the hiding because he was the only one small enough to comfortably crawl into its hiding spot (and yes, it had been a tight squeeze for us!). Mitch and Susan discussed old times, both happy and sad, and I got to bear witness to it all. We stamped into the box, and both Susan and Ben signed our books and gave us each their inky thumbprints as an exchange. Mitch mentioned the "Peacekeeper" label he had given her years before, and she laughed and told me about how all those boys really had needed a mom. And both of them also talked about letterboxing and what it has meant to them over the years. The people, the connections, the adventure, the friends made and lost - and even how this hobby and its members, as odd as it may seem, has been a lifeline to some in their times of grief. I will always, always feel thankful for my opportunity to sit and hear these stories. <br/>
<br/>
Now I'm not a person of faith. I'm not even one to believe that coincidence is anything more than random occurences that we just happen to place meaning on because they feel special. And I'm certainly not inviting anyone to try and convince me otherwise today. But I just can't deny it;  something was in the air there in Vermont for our entire trip, and especially on that day. When I think of everything that needed to fall into place for us to be visible from the road at that moment that Susan and Ben were driving by, for them to look over and recognize us as letterboxers, and for them to take the time out of their errands to stop and say hello - all I can say is that I believe in wonder that is letterboxing. <br/>
<br/>
Because there's a reason this pasttime has taken hold so well. It goes beyond the fun of carving or writing clues, the thrill of the hike, the satisfaction of collecting images, the social and family fun. It's because this activity is a way for us to put our own special take on the world out there so others can see through our eyes - and so we can see through theirs. It's because carving these silly stamps and writing these silly clues is a wonderfully pure way to share a little bit of our souls with each other. And all I can say is, thank goodness that a few people who shared that early vision, as scattered about the country as they were, found each other and organized it all, so that the rest of us could have this outlet. Many of them have had the opportunity to meet over the years, but DMS had met very few - and watching him finally make those connections was like watching a very very special process that started over a decade ago finally come full circle. Kismet.<br/>

the Big List for discussions, nothing else.  Later, regional groups (including this one) were formed, then AQ.  As BL said, there is a <br>
lot of history in the Big List, and even current posts worth reading.  In addition to this post, several early letterboxers (Der Mad Stamper, Tom Cooch, etc.)have recently posted and it makes for good reading.  Because of this, I recommend joining and glancing at it once in a while, just don't elect to receive posts as emails or you might be overwhelmed.<br>
