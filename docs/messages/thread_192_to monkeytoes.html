A PLB is a postal letterbox.  It travels by mail and recipients sign <br>
up for it by sending their address to the maker.  The maker adds <br>
names and addresses to the list of recipients which goes out with the <br>
box.  The first recipient stamps in just like a regular LB, then <br>
forwards it on either to a recipient they pick at random, or to the <br>
next on the list, or in whatever manner the maker has requested.  <br>

(And for the record, that WASN'T a silly question!)<br>
