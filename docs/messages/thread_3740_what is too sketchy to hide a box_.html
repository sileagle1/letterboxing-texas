                    <div class="plaintext-content">so saturday i was walking around Lindale, and saw this place that <br/>
looked kinda interesting, so me and my friend went to investigate.  <br/>
there was like a slab that probably had a building on it once, and then <br/>
there was like a cement rectangle filled up wiht junk and water, then <br/>
in the bak corner was like a circle brick wall with a huge hole inside <br/>
it.. (possible once a well) then another round tower brick thing wiht a <br/>
little door way in it.. and we were going ot investigate this too... <br/>
BUT.. i think a homeless person was living in it! as we saw a sleping <br/>
bag layed out in there so we went running off quick wiht out finishing <br/>
looking around.... if it wasn;t for the homeless person... it would be <br/>
a really cool place for a box... should i go ahead and put a box there <br/>
any way... and just warn peeopl not to go at night and to watch oput <br/>
for the homeles guy? (who we didn;t see... jsut the stuff) or should i <br/>
advoid that area all together!? <br/>

<p>First of all, what made it a cool hiding spot?<span>  </span>If there was something significant about the location, perhaps you could find a different hiding spot a little removed that would still point to the significance of the location.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>If you are certain a homeless person is using that spot for shelter, I would avoid it  it is, after all, his "home".<span>  </span>I dunno  just seems disrespectful of another human being, however lowly his state is, to go sticking stuff around where he lives.</p>
