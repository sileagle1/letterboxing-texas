                    <div class="plaintext-content">so saturday i was walking around Lindale, and saw this place that <br>
looked kinda interesting, so me and my friend went to investigate.  <br>
there was like a slab that probably had a building on it once, and then <br>
there was like a cement rectangle filled up wiht junk and water, then <br>
in the bak corner was like a circle brick wall with a huge hole inside <br>
it.. (possible once a well) then another round tower brick thing wiht a <br>
little door way in it.. and we were going ot investigate this too... <br>
BUT.. i think a homeless person was living in it! as we saw a sleping <br>
bag layed out in there so we went running off quick wiht out finishing <br>
looking around.... if it wasn;t for the homeless person... it would be <br>
a really cool place for a box... should i go ahead and put a box there <br>
any way... and just warn peeopl not to go at night and to watch oput <br>
for the homeles guy? (who we didn;t see... jsut the stuff) or should i <br>
advoid that area all together!? <br>
