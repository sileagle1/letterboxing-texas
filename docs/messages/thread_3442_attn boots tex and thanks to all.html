i also wanted to thank everyone for the birthday greetings...it was a <br>
great birthday, since it was on my birthday that we reached over 100 <br>
finds for the trip...i also have to let everyone know that i reached <br>
my 500 mark (and went over that mark) on this trip which was a really <br>
great landmark for me, since april marks my two year mark for <br>
letterboxing<br>
thanks again to everyone<br>
