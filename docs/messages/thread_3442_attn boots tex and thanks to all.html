i also wanted to thank everyone for the birthday greetings...it was a <br/>
great birthday, since it was on my birthday that we reached over 100 <br/>
finds for the trip...i also have to let everyone know that i reached <br/>
my 500 mark (and went over that mark) on this trip which was a really <br/>
great landmark for me, since april marks my two year mark for <br/>
letterboxing<br/>
