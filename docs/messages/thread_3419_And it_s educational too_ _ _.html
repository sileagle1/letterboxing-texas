                    <html><body><p>Well, I think a mounted magnifying glass or a magnifying lamp help a lot. I'd be interested in hearing others' transferring techniques... I still do best with pencil transfers and the chemical ones have all been VERY dissappointing for me.  </p>
<p>In terms of tools, I like PZKut for value and overall durability. I've tried a variety of things from erasers to vinyl kickboard molding (it's cheap. LOL).  I use a traditional Speedball lino cutter and Xacto knife, but I also have an 18-guage syringe needle (for tiny details - like in lettering).  -- I don't know about other tools. I tried a dremmel one time -- not so good for me. I couldn't find a tip tiny enough to do close work and it had a tendency to leave a shredded edge that I had to try to clean up anyway - oh and it tries to buck around, not great.  </p>
<p>If anyone wants to do the classes I will be sure to put out a list of needed supplies, but hopefully that helps for the carving. A magnifying glass isn't necessary, nor is a 18-guage needle, but you get the point. LOL.  I'll do the same thing for codex journals, too.</p>
