<br/>
I am new to the area. I am up in Ardmore, OK, but plan to be down to<br/>
Texas for boxing quite often. I've been a letterboxer for about 6<br/>
years now. My trail name is Penguin Patrol. I have met a few of you<br/>
over the years so it is nice to see some familiar faces on the list.<br/>
Others I can't wait to meet. I'll be at the Plano event this weekend<br/>
and am looking forward to it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm not a real chatty type and mostly I lurk in these large groups. If<br/>
anyone has any advice for me about boxing in Texas, I'd love to hear.<br/>
Things like watch out for rattle snakes and hey - that's a scorpion<br/>
are probably things I need to hear. I've lived in 7 states now, but<br/>
this is the farthest west I've been. New terrain for me. Also good to<br/>
know are things like don't go near so-and-so park. Or here's a WOM for<br/>
you. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I'm rambling now. Glad to be in an area with active boxers and<br/>
I look forward to meeting y'all in person one day and seeking your<br/>
boxes. Maybe I'll even plant a few during one of my trips.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm so happy you're "in the area". I've always enjoyed your LTCs! I'm <br/>
in McKinney (north of Dallas... not too far from the Tx/Okla border <br/>
on the grand scale of things). I didn't sign up for the Plano event, <br/>
but I'm still hoping to come by and see everyone. My daughter just <br/>
opened a new dance studio in Frisco this week, and I've been working <br/>
about 24/7 with her for the past few weeks, so I've been slightly out <br/>
of touch recently. This weekend is our second annual pumpkin carving <br/>
party for our grandkids and nieces, nephews, etc (nine kids and <br/>
eleven adults) so I'm scurrying around today trying to get everything <br/>
set up. I hope to see you Sunday, but if not...a BIG OL' TEXAS <br/>
WELCOME to the community!<br/>
