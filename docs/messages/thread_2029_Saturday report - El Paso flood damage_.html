I just did a 6 hour inspection of the Franklin Mountains.  I didn't need to<br/>
go down the trails too far to see damage and destruction.  The floods off<br/>
the mountain were terrible.  Franklin Mountain State Park is in bad shape.<br/>
<br/>
Two of my letterbox-Hybrid Geocache combinations are removed.  Not because<br/>
they were damaged.  But because the approach to them is in need of serious<br/>
maintenance.  They will be replaced once the park is again in shape for it.<br/>
<br/>
Mr Silver Eagle sir.  I removed your letterbox on the Nature Walk.  The<br/>
nature Walk is more than 50% destroyed.  When you take the left fork, in 75<br/>
paces you hit the wash-out.  The trail is totally gone until the high area<br/>
just before you get to your box.  The rock had settled on your box and<br/>
deformed it.  NO WATER DAMAGE.  You will need to re-write the clues once<br/>
things are back to normal.  I will hold you letterbox safe here - unless you<br/>
have other ideas.  Let me know what you would like me to do.<br/>
<br/>
Dear SandiBox.  Your letterbox is in GREAT shape.  I did not remove it.  The<br/>
clues essentially still work.  If you can find your way to the trail.  I<br/>
did, cause I know the trail.  The trail starts down, makes a slight bend to<br/>
the left, and DISAPPEARS!  If you hug the left side of the wash-out,<br/>
eventually you find the trail, then lose it and find it again.  By the time<br/>
you get to the brown trail sign and the rock of the old placement, the clues<br/>
work.  Beyond that less then 100 yards the trail is shot again.  That trail<br/>
is gone until you hit the switchbacks on the rhyolite wall.  But your box is<br/>
OK and the clues still work.<br/>
<br/>
I guess the wife and I can put together a slideshow of what we saw.  OTOH,<br/>
we are gearing up to go and inspect several trails tomorrow too.  Perhaps we<br/>
will wait till later.<br/>
<br/>
Silver Eagle and SandiBox, please let me know you got this.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Mike.  KD9KC<br/>

I'm glad to hear you are safe and sound.  My in-laws live on the <br/>
north side and didn't experience any problems.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for taking the time to check on my box. I'm sure the reason <br/>
that it's in such great shape is because of the fantastic job you <br/>
did in relocating it for me this summer!  Please let me know if I <br/>
need to modify the clues for those who might not be very familiar <br/>
with the trail (such as it is).<br/>
<br/>
You're our letterboxing champion out there!  Thanks again for <br/>
everything you do.<br/>
<br/>
Sandi<br/>
