I have twice almost met Silver Eagle, including being in the same <br/>
park in LA on the same weekend, and once I think I saw Baby Bear <br/>
planting a box ( I was in the Arkansas Wildlife refuge on the same <br/>
day that he planted one of his boxes) but I have never met either of <br/>
them, not even at the gathering last year. That's it, I'm going to <br/>
the gathering this year for sure. <br/>

I hope I get to meet all of you at the Event that I have <br/>
just missed on the trail.<br/>
Baby Bear and I bumped into 3 new boxers in a small park<br/>
in the middle of Idaho last summer.  We had taken the box<br/>
to a picnic table and watched as this trio pulled up and<br/>
proceded to follow the clues to the box.  They looked<br/>
disappointed at not finding it until I walked up with it<br/>
in my hand.  They had no idea how rare this encounter was<br/>
and I had to explain about exchanging before they would<br/>
stamp into my logbook.  This encounter is even more <br/>
amazing when you realize there were only a handful of<br/>
letterboxers in the entire state at that time!<br/>
