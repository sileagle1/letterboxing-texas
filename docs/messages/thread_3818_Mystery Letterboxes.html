trash on the way to finding the box.  Then, if they let me know that <br/>
they found the box and give me a report on the trash, I send them a <br/>
recipe for "Texas Trash".  Only 3 times has anyone asked for the <br/>
clues and out of those 3, only 1 reported back (they found no trash <br/>
to pick up) and asked for the recipe.  So, as an experiment, that one <br/>
hasn't been too successful.  On the other hand, my box "Snipe <br/>
Hunting" has been in that park for almost a year, has been found a <br/>
few times and, as far as I know is alive and well.  I don't think the <br/>
park gets many visitors because of its reputation. Thanks for the <br/>
