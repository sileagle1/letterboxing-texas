    Sorry you did not get it. We really expected you to find it first. <br>
We thought the people in the camp site would be gone by the time <br>
someone went to find the box.Boy were we wrong! We had a lot of fun <br>
placing it there and were very glad to get a good spot. It was a great <br>
adventure!<br>

P.S. Maybe I will get that cup of coffee at the gathering in march :)<br>

that I wouldn't have any trouble getting it either.  I<br>
guess that's what makes the Tour Bus an adventure -<br>
what fun!<br>
<br>
My guys had quite a good time going for it, and they<br>
collected your Harmony Hills stamp in the process, so<br>
it was a good day all in all (except for me - who was<br>
stuck in the office looking out the window at a<br>
beautiful day!).<br>
<br>
It kind of reminds you of a spirited game of musical<br>
chairs, doesn't it?  Ya never know who's going to get<br>
knocked out of the way in the rush!  I guess if the<br>
truth were known, the ones who should have been<br>
worried were the campers...can you imagine their<br>
surprise to look out their window flaps to see two<br>
wild letterboxers converging on their campsite?<br>
