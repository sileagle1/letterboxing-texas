    Sorry you did not get it. We really expected you to find it first. <br/>
We thought the people in the camp site would be gone by the time <br/>
someone went to find the box.Boy were we wrong! We had a lot of fun <br/>
placing it there and were very glad to get a good spot. It was a great <br/>
adventure!<br/>

that I wouldn't have any trouble getting it either.  I<br/>
guess that's what makes the Tour Bus an adventure -<br/>
what fun!<br/>
<br/>
My guys had quite a good time going for it, and they<br/>
collected your Harmony Hills stamp in the process, so<br/>
it was a good day all in all (except for me - who was<br/>
stuck in the office looking out the window at a<br/>
beautiful day!).<br/>
<br/>
It kind of reminds you of a spirited game of musical<br/>
chairs, doesn't it?  Ya never know who's going to get<br/>
knocked out of the way in the rush!  I guess if the<br/>
truth were known, the ones who should have been<br/>
worried were the campers...can you imagine their<br/>
surprise to look out their window flaps to see two<br/>
wild letterboxers converging on their campsite?<br/>
