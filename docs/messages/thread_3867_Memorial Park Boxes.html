at Memorial Park called the Writing's on the Wall.  This was my first<br/>
time to get to Memorial Park since Ike, and the number of downed trees<br/>
was quite incredible.<br/>

Perky P had emailed me about my Orange Your Glad box, and the tree<br/>
which was hiding it was a casualty of the hurricane.  I knew about<br/>
where in the tree it was, so I tried several different approaches to<br/>
try and reach it.  Luckily, after about 15 minutes and multiple<br/>
strategies, I found it.  The logbooks were soaked, which makes me sad,<br/>
as it had been one of my most-found boxes in the 3 1/2 years it had<br/>
been out there.  But, I brought it home to do maintenance and I plan<br/>
on finding a new spot and replacing it.  <br/>
<br/>
And, Perky P?  No mosquitoes this morning.  Seriously.  I walked back<br/>
there without spray and left without a single bite.<br/>
