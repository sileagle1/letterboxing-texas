Our friends we are going with have been a couple of times this year and she tried to describe to me what to expect. She (She Who Volunteers Me For Everything) said all the houses around the one we will be staying in were destroyed. We will actually be on Row 2, but we have a clear view to the beach because Row 1 is gone. I believe they are beginning to rebuild though. We used to visit CB at least once a year before the storms came through. Many good memories there. I'm looking forward to visiting again.</div>
<div><br/></div><div>What was interesting to me was (and all you coast dwellers probably know a whole lot more about this than I do) that folks who owned property on beaches like Crystal Beach, the property line is measured from the high tide line, and when Ike came through it took away so much beach that the high tide line moved enough that some folks no longer have property. The Scout Executive for our council had a house on Crystal Beach and he was one of the unfortunate ones who lost his property by this method. This was my understanding of his explanation of it anyway. </div>
