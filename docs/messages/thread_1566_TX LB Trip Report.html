whirlwind letterboxing trip lasting 5 days and 4 nights.<br>
This has become an annual winter affair, starting in early<br>
2003 with our wide sweep through East, North and Central TX<br>
planting our "seeds", then in 2004 with our Dallas trip.<br>
For 2005, we wanted to go Northeast for all the new boxes<br>
planted there in the last year, but decided to do it before<br>
the Event next March.  That left Dallas again since so many<br>
new boxes were planted since our last visit, but finding<br>
the time to go was tough.  We pushed it back until after<br>
Christmas and lucked out with the weather; it was perfect!<br>
<br>
Our plan was to leave early Tuesday, 12/27, and when I say<br>
early, I mean EARLY.  Baby Bear wanted me at his house by<br>
5:00 am, so I had to get up at 4:00 am.  Never mind that it<br>
does not get light until 7:00 am, he just said "That is what<br>
flashlights are for".  So our first few boxes in Brenham area<br>
were in the dark, which was nothing new to us, but still a<br>
challenge.  We had a new wrinkle this time though, since the<br>
first box was in a cemetery.  I like boxing in cemeteries in<br>
the daytime, but at night it is just a little too creepy.  I<br>
have to admit it added spice to the hunt, though.<br>
<br>
We worked our way northwest through Somerville, Waco, Mother<br>
Neff SP and eventually Cleburne SP where we camped for the<br>
night.  It was dark when we pulled in so had to find the 2<br>
boxes there in the dark.  We also placed 2 in the dark, which<br>
is even harder in a way.  One of the boxes (Hot Chicks) was<br>
near the trailhead, so we figured we would just find it and<br>
bring it back to the car to stamp.  When we went to its location<br>
we found a ziplock with log and stamp just laying out in the<br>
open, so assumed the box was missing.  Once we got back to the<br>
car we realized it was a Hitchhiker and not the letterbox at all.<br>
So back we went and sure enough, the box was nearby safe and<br>
sound.  We think the last letterboxer must have placed the HH<br>
with the box but not in it, since there was no room, and then<br>
an animal scattered both.  We ended up taking the HH and placing<br>
it somewhere else on our travels, so it worked out well.<br>
<br>
The next day we broke camp and were on the road before 6:00 am.<br>
Our first box was again in the dark and the weather was decidedly<br>
colder, so our headlamps could barely pierce the fog coming <br>
from our breaths.  We wondered, not for the first or last time,<br>
what we must look like to anyone crazy enough to be out watching<br>
us.  Boxing in the dark can be fun since you get to see some<br>
nocturnal creatures as you hike, but I would not do it alone<br>
(especially in a cemetery).  We spent most of the day in the<br>
Fort Worth area and ended up camping at Cedar Hill SP, the same<br>
park we camped at last year.  It would be our home for the <br>
next 3 nights as we combed the Dallas area for more boxes.  <br>
Since we were always up before light and home after dark, I<br>
still have never seen the park in the daytime, but it seems<br>
like a nice place.  As Barefoot Lucy had told us, the South<br>
part of the park was closed, but even so the park is still huge.<br>
We did check out the Group Picnic Pavilion and it looks nice<br>
(at least in the dark), so that might be a choice when the<br>
Event comes North.<br>
<br>
I have to say that we were very impressed with the parks in<br>
the towns around Dallas.  It seems every creek had a Greenbelt<br>
park along it with a wide hike/bike path extending for miles.<br>
Most of these places only have 1 box, so many opportunities<br>
await for those wishing to plant when they visit.  I just wish<br>
we could have spent more time exploring them.  I struggle with<br>
the choice between going fast to visit as many boxes as possible<br>
vs. going slow to enjoy the park more, and we did try to go<br>
a little slower than previous trips and "smell the roses" more.<br>
But since neither of us gets to box much with our nonboxing<br>
families, we decided to go to as many places as we could and<br>
maybe go back with family some day to enjoy the parks we<br>
really liked.  Even going fast we still enjoyed hiking and<br>
talking together as we let the Metroplex Letterboxers show<br>
us their home through their boxes.  They did a great job!<br>
<br>
The last day found us boxing in Waxahachie at 6:00 am in<br>
29 degree weather.  Now we know how northern letterboxers<br>
feel, though they would probably laugh at our thin skin.  If<br>
I needed any reminders of why I live in the South, this was<br>
enough.  Give me heat any day!  We eventually made it to<br>
the sight of the JEN gathering and wished again that we could<br>
have attended.  Even though it was too late for the Event, we<br>
both placed boxes in the park for future visitors.  We then<br>
worked our way south to Mexia area and noticed Barefoot Lucy<br>
had stamped in just 2 days before.  I felt almost the same way <br>
she must have felt last year when she found I had stamped into <br>
her box the same day.  We finally made it home (you guessed it,<br>
after dark) ready to relax, only to be told we had New Year's<br>
Eve parties to attend and we darn well better stay awake.  I<br>
managed and I assume Baby Bear did, too, but today was a very<br>
lazy day.<br>
<br>
We ended up finding almost 100 boxes, with about 15 not found,<br>
and I placed 4 while Baby Bear placed 6 new boxes.  There are<br>
too many for me to send everyone an email, but I will try to<br>
notify those that require maintenance or were not found.  We<br>
really enjoyed the places your boxes took us to, and we thank<br>
you for the opportunity to be guests in your home.<br>

P.S.  We both reached personal milestones during the trip,<br>
      both occurring at the same box (Baby Bear's new Northern<br>
      Exposure letterbox).  It was my F1000 and Baby Bear's<br>
      P200.<br>
