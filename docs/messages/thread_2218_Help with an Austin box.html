<br/>
Is there anyone out there in the Austin area who could<br/>
help me check on a box of mine that may have gone<br/>
missing?  I've moved to Amarillo, so unless I'm<br/>
willing to make a nine hour drive the chances of me<br/>
being able to check on it myself are slim!  :-/  <br/>
<br/>
It's drive-by, so shouldn't take too much time to<br/>
check.  Please email me off list if you're willing to<br/>
help out.  Thank you!<br/>
<br/>

Hi Lore,<br/>
<br/>
I don't know if anyone has volunteered yet, but I would be happy to <br/>
check it out for you.  It may take me several days, but I promise I <br/>
will get to it.  I still need to check Boots Tex's box here in <br/>
Georgetown!  Just let me know box name and clues if not listed.<br/>
<br/>
On another note, we just returned home from visiting my father, who <br/>
has had another stroke.  I hope everyone will send a little prayer <br/>
our way.  I adore him, but I can't even imagine how my kiddos would <br/>
react if/when he were to pass away!  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Batty B <br/>
