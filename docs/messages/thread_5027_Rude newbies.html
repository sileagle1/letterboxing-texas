                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can understand new boxers being excited about all the boxes out there and think that they need to find as many as they can within the time they have to spend, especially with the price  of gas these days.  We were like that once, when there were far fewer letterboxes available.  We used to make a two or three day trip planned around the most letterboxes we could get.  But, it seems like now that there are more boxes than we could ever find, we tend to be more selective.  We'll take our travel trailer and find a central location and spend a few days finding day-boxing in the area.  We pass by a lot of boxes coming and going because of pulling the trailer behind us.  But, even in those days when we were new to the activity, I don't think we ever presumed to be, say, an expert on writing clues.  I know we never would tell someone that. "OK, we found your box, but the clues were lousy, we actually had to hunt for it."  Or, "I couldn't find that little cemetery out in the boondocks, so you need to re-write your clues."  I'm not above making an error in writing my clue, and when that happens, I appreciate a correction.  <br>

<div><font style="background-color: transparent;">Speaking of becoming a Selective Boxer, That's definitely me!   I've pretty much given up local letterboxing due to an exponential increase in casually-thrown-out-there-anywhere boxes with very little apparent thought given to the location, the clues, the stamps (usually, not showing much originality in any case, hand-carved or not), the whole purpose of which just seems to be to plant as many boxes as possible -- and "finders" who pretty much seemed to expect me to walk them to the box and find it for them and hand it to them -- and then, of course, to replace it for them, which also was getting to be an increasing issue, having lost or removed a number of my favorite boxes due to failure to "recover well" or even recover at all -- sometimes even leaving the contents exposed to the elements without the baggies or even tops replaced on the box.  (Whew!  that has to be one of the longest sentences ever posted on this list!)  On trips to far-away locations, especially really scenic or interesting places, I still always take along clues which lead me to discover fascinating views (my passion) or hidden places I'd never know about otherwise, and then I consider those boxes as a serendipitous bonus to the location. I still love to plan unique boxes to plant in these far-flung scenic places, too, and I never seem to get these kinds of annoying responses from any of those boxes, either -- finders always seem excited by the location/stamp/box/find/discoveries.  I still love good carves (yours, Boots, and LSQ's among my favorites always), and fun, well-written clues with some interesting story or clever puzzle (not too hard, just enough to be intriguing and make me feel pretty smart when I figure them out).  So I'm still letterboxing, but definitely Selectively!</font></div>

<div><font style="background-color: transparent;">My sister Puddle Splasher and I were having this conversation just yesterday, in fact, remembering people like Ruby Tuesday and other boxers who always wrote wonderful clues and planted in interesting locations that led us to find new places and who always had wonderful stamps and boxes that made it so much fun -- spending all day finding that one special box and enjoying the find, or even spending months trying to puzzle out those oh-so-evilly devious clues, in some cases.  Loved finding boxes by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear everywhere from Canada to California to state parks all over Texas.  No marathon boxing possible there -- and who would want to!  I guess it's a different game for different folks:  for some people, it's all about upping the total of finds and plants -- but missing out on the experience connected to each potential find seems  just sad to me.  </font></div>

Maybe I should have one ready to place so that the next person will have two boxes to find.  Viewfinder, I hope you and Puddle Splasher decide to place more boxes in the Metroplex.

We had a couple great days of boxing and especially liked the Walnut Creek Linear Park in Mansfield, since the kids got to zip along on their scooters while we boxed Frost Maiden's plants in the park. Love those win-win situations! We all managed to plant boxes on this trip. Mosaic Butterfly & Open Space are fabulous carvers; I'm no Ruby Tuesday, but I hope you'll enjoy them all the same and accept my appreciation for all the boxers in the area who made our weekend so enjoyable!<br>
