Good evening.<br/>
<br/>
I have in my possession a packet from 3d ACR - rear detachment.  It contains the<br/>
following.<br/>
<br/>
------------------------<br/>
<br/>
OPERATIONAL SCHEDULE.<br/>
<br/>
10-30 Jan 2009 - MOST soldiers to return from Iraq to Ft. Hood.<br/>
21 Feb - 22 Mar - Regimental Block Leave.<br/>
27 Mar - 3d ACR Family Day at Bell County Expo Center.<br/>
3 Apr - 3d ACR Regimental Change of Command.<br/>
<br/>
The rear detachment command is working out how they will notify individual<br/>
families about the arrival dates and times of their deployed family members.  At<br/>
this time, no firm dates have been decided upon.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
MAIL OPERATIONS.<br/>
<br/>
The deadline for sending mail is 1 Dec 2008.  Any mail sent after that date will<br/>
be returned.  3 ACR Forward requests that no Christmas decorations be sent.<br/>
Connexes will be locked for shipment prior to the holidays.<br/>
<br/>
-----------------------------<br/>
<br/>
The rest is militareze.  Not readable by most civilians...  <grin>.  The usual,<br/>
do you need to talk to the chaplain, do you need assistance, are you moving back<br/>
to Ft. Hood and need housing, etc etc etc.....<br/>
<br/>
Of course, this is the ARMY!  Anything can - and often does - CHANGE.  I will<br/>
keep those interested updated.  Reply to this E-mail if you want to stay in the<br/>
loop.  Of course Moni and I intend to go to Ft. Hood to welcome our warrior son<br/>
home.<br/>
<br/>
James discussed it with us.  He does not intend to take much leave during block<br/>
leave.  He will come home for his things, then return within days.  It is his<br/>
intent to save as much leave as possible to take as terminal leave upon his ETS.<br/>
This will allow him to get to El Paso in plenty of time for the electrician<br/>
apprentice classes he will be attending in Sept 2009.  His ETS would be 21 Oct<br/>
without terminal leave.<br/>
<br/>
I hope you all will join us in our happiness that this is almost over.  We as a<br/>
family understand the need, and certainly support keeping the fight off our<br/>
streets and in their backyard.  Still, it will be nice to have him home.  Nearly<br/>
18 months of combat - in the hottest spot in Iraq.  Well - it's the CAVALRY -<br/>
and he is a scout, but it is time.<br/>
<br/>
More to follow as we get it - for those who reply.<br/>

&gt; OPERATIONAL SCHEDULE.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 10-30 Jan 2009 - MOST soldiers to return from Iraq to Ft. Hood.<br/>
&gt; 21 Feb - 22 Mar - Regimental Block Leave.<br/>
&gt; 27 Mar - 3d ACR Family Day at Bell County Expo Center.<br/>
&gt; 3 Apr - 3d ACR Regimental Change of Command.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The rear detachment command is working out how they will notify <br/>
individual<br/>
&gt; families about the arrival dates and times of their deployed family <br/>
members.  At<br/>
&gt; this time, no firm dates have been decided upon.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; MAIL OPERATIONS.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The deadline for sending mail is 1 Dec 2008.  Any mail sent after <br/>
that date will<br/>
&gt; be returned.  3 ACR Forward requests that no Christmas decorations <br/>
be sent.<br/>
&gt; Connexes will be locked for shipment prior to the holidays.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; -----------------------------<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The rest is militareze.  Not readable by most civilians...  <br/>
<grin>.  The usual,<br/>
&gt; do you need to talk to the chaplain, do you need assistance, are <br/>
you moving back<br/>
&gt; to Ft. Hood and need housing, etc etc etc.....<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Of course, this is the ARMY!  Anything can - and often does - <br/>
CHANGE.  I will<br/>
&gt; keep those interested updated.  Reply to this E-mail if you want to <br/>
stay in the<br/>
&gt; loop.  Of course Moni and I intend to go to Ft. Hood to welcome our <br/>
warrior son<br/>
&gt; home.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; James discussed it with us.  He does not intend to take much leave <br/>
during block<br/>
&gt; leave.  He will come home for his things, then return within days.  <br/>
It is his<br/>
&gt; intent to save as much leave as possible to take as terminal leave <br/>
upon his ETS.<br/>
&gt; This will allow him to get to El Paso in plenty of time for the <br/>
electrician<br/>
&gt; apprentice classes he will be attending in Sept 2009.  His ETS <br/>
would be 21 Oct<br/>
&gt; without terminal leave.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope you all will join us in our happiness that this is almost <br/>
over.  We as a<br/>
&gt; family understand the need, and certainly support keeping the fight <br/>
off our<br/>
&gt; streets and in their backyard.  Still, it will be nice to have him <br/>
home.  Nearly<br/>
&gt; 18 months of combat - in the hottest spot in Iraq.  Well - it's the <br/>
CAVALRY -<br/>
&gt; and he is a scout, but it is time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; More to follow as we get it - for those who reply.<br/>
