<br/>
After four tries, I finally got BabyBear's "Lucky<br/>
Dog". The first time it was missing. The second and<br/>
third times I tried, the park was under water. This<br/>
time, The park was only slightly mushy, but the box<br/>
had washed off into a BIG BUNCH of thorny underbrush<br/>
-- OUCH! The box's contents were dry (good job with<br/>
the baggies, BabyBear!) and has been put back in the<br/>
proper place.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I planted some boxes:<br/>
<br/>
1. Sitting Duck<br/>
Put on our walking shoes, TeamKing! You're going to<br/>
need a long lunch break to get this one. This is my<br/>
favorite stamp so far. A bit punny, too!<br/>
<br/>
2. Where in the "H"? (Actually adopted this one)<br/>
<br/>
3. Millie's Treasure<br/>
I have tried to plant this box 3 times, and finally<br/>
the park dried out enough for me to get it planted. It<br/>
is actually a few feet off the ground. I got creative<br/>
with a strip of Velcro to hold it onto a tree branch.<br/>
Whoever finds this, let me know how it's working.<br/>
<br/>
All three of these require some brain-power to figure<br/>
out the clues.<br/>
