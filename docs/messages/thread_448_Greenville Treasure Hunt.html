unschedueled hours...on Saturday we realized we had 4 1/2 hours, so we<br>
headed for Greenville!<br>
Catpawz2004 does an excellent job of leading a guided tour around their city<br>
with very good directions from the first box through to the fourth. We truly<br>
enjoyed a sampling of Greenville, with four very different kinds of<br>
locations and four great stamps.<br>
Our favorite location was Forest Park and our favorite stamp was a toss-up<br>
between Forest Park and Greenville Sports Park. We had Vandal the Terrier<br>
with us and his favorite was the Audie Murphy American Cotton Museum box,<br>
but he wasn't sure why we insisted on covering it back up after he found<br>
it...;-)<br>
<br>
Thanks for a great Saturday afternoon!<br>
