                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, whew folks!  I finally escaped dewberry's garage.  I mean, I <br/>
had such cabin fever, I didn't care where I was going at that point, <br/>
but come to find out that the circus train had been hijacked by some <br/>
sort of juggler.  That fool said he wanted to get out and visit some <br/>
relatives.  I didn't know what he was talking about, but apparently <br/>
he had won some sort of medal at the 2008 Summer Jester Olympics in <br/>
Beijing, China and he thought he was something special.  He had heard <br/>
of these acrobatic athletes who practice the graceful art of Tae Kwon <br/>
Do (and won some medals themselves at the actual real summer <br/>
Olympics) - and he had heard that they were hanging out at Memorial <br/>
Park.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, so off we went to visit Team Lopez...and while we were there <br/>
chatting, I saw a coral snake.  I know it was a coral because there <br/>
are lots of them at Memorial Park and it's diurnal, unlike its <br/>
harmless cousin the Louisiana snake.  Well, I don't cotton to snakes, <br/>
even ones who look colorful enough to be in a circus, so I hightailed <br/>
it 12 more steps into the woods to hide until someone could come <br/>
rescue me.  Behind the Lopez box, there's an enormous pine with vines <br/>
on the side.  I am waiting desperately for someone to come get me.<br/>
