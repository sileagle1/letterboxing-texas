little park in Jacksonville that really isn't so<br>
little any more - Nichols Green!<br>
<br>
TexasLuvBug has planted three boxes there and I<br>
already found one of them.  I decided to go for the<br>
two newer ones, thinking "piece of cake - no problem".<br>
 Well, nice walk-yes, easy-no.  Don't let the fact<br>
that this is a small-town city park fool you - there's<br>
a lot more to it than you would think!<br>
<br>
Going after Bringing Home the Bacon proved to be very<br>
difficult because there can be a lot of traffic on the<br>
nearby sidewalk, and folks can slip up on you quietly.<br>
 What caught me by surprise is that I could be so<br>
close to a sidewalk I had walked many, many times and<br>
yet I had never noticed the short trail and the<br>
beautiful little peaceful spot by the creek.  If you<br>
go for this one, DO be prepared with a couple of<br>
different cover stories because you might need them. <br>
For myself, I wasn't prepared with cover so I had to<br>
improvise.  I was stamping in with my back to the<br>
sidewalk when a man noticed me off the trail and was<br>
concerned.  He called out to me, and I just kind of<br>
mumbled something off, and he started down the trail<br>
to check on me.  Fortunately, when my daughter was in<br>
drama class she used me to help her learn how to<br>
create tears on command, so I used that skill to my<br>
advantage - I started crying, then turned toward him<br>
and replied that I was "fine - just fine."   He wasn't<br>
sure whether to continue to my side or not, so I<br>
mumbled something about "just had an argument with<br>
someone and ..."  He said something comforting and<br>
went on!  Wow!  Now I can see how that could backfire,<br>
but I suddenly realized people get really<br>
uncomfortable with other peoples' pain, especially<br>
that of strangers!  I felt a little bad about playing<br>
off his sympathy, but I figure he was happy enough<br>
that I let him off the hook by saying I would be fine.<br>
 I felt a little weird with one hand on my backpack<br>
and ready to swing and wiping my tears with the other!<br>
<br>
I went on to Butterfly Falls, but I didn't see TLB's<br>
armadillo - but then I was wearing tenny shoes, not<br>
flip flops, so he wasn't lured out by my toes.<br>
<br>
GG had visited both of them yesterday - busy guy our<br>
enigmatic man is!  Also found a HH, but I can't<br>
remember the name of it.  I do remember that it is a<br>
single bare foot, so it may not leave my hands too<br>
readily!  <br>
<br>
I went and checked on my Spring Hope to see if GG had<br>
visited it - he hadn't.  I was bummed.  I wonder why -<br>
if he didn't have time to decipher the clues, which<br>
are not real direct, or what the reason was.  Oh well.<br>
<br>
