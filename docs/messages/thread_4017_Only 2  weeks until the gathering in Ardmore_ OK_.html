Ardmore is just 30 miles north of the TX border on I-35.<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget to sign-up if you can make it! Over 45 new boxes with stamps from all across the US! Over 20 HHers out there too! Hope to see you there!<br/>
<br/>
A little more info for those interested:<br/>
<br/>
Some of us have decided to get together on Friday night to hang out, say hello, and roast some marshmallows. We'll be hanging out at our campsite. Not sure which one since reservations can't be made, but please call Friday and I'll let you know. My cell is 580-277-9401. Bring a chair and join us!<br/>
<br/>
Planned for Friday night is a Texas Hold 'Em tournament for the adults. There are 7 seats for the poker game available. This is to be just for fun with a prize to the winner. No actual gambling allowed. Game will start at 7pm so we have a little bit of day light left to get going. After that, it will be by lantern. If you would like to play, even if you've never played before, please send me an AQ mail. The first 7 people will be held a seat. If you aren't at the campground by 7pm, your seat will be given to the someone else on a first come, first serve basis. If this goes well, we'll probably hold one for Saturday night too.<br/>
<br/>
For the kids, we will have Scene It, the Disney version, on the portable DVD player. A prize will go to that winner too. This game will be done on a first come, first serve basis and there may be many rounds played depending on the number of kids. We will probably play again on Saturday night too.<br/>
<br/>
A few things to mention:<br/>
<br/>
If you bring your pet, they are strict about that leash law thing.<br/>
<br/>
We are under a burn ban. No campfires will be allowed, but you may cook with charcoal. Please call the park for more info.<br/>
<br/>
If you choose to bring beer, ect. - please, remember there will be kids around so no glass bottles at our campsite please.<br/>
<br/>
Can't wait to meet everyone! I'm looking forward to a nice, relaxing event!<br/>
<br/>
