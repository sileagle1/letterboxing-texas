It was quite before then. I also got turned around about 3 times before I figured out what went wrong.  The trails could be marked better at crossings with the service roads. So I ended up hiking every trail across the falls mostly by mistake.  Lol 8 miles later,  one box planted by me,  one found #9 R by suprize. It was so fun.  I forgot how much I enjoy hiking.  Most of the trails are on even ground with a slight elevation gane. Only one badly muddy spot that was easy to go around.  The trees are just starting to get leaves and in 3 weeks it may be green! </div><div>~Dawns Glory~</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><div style="font-size:9px;color:#575757">Sent from my Verizon Wireless 4G LTE smartphone</div></div><div></div><br/><br/>-------- Original message --------<br/>From: "'Christine Borgfeld' christine@borgfeld.net [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS]" &lt;LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com&gt; <br/>Date: 02/15/2015  7:43 PM  (GMT-06:00) <br/>To: LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com <br/>Subject: RE: [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Re: Damaged boxes: what would you say &amp; Carve Event? <br/><br/>

<p></p><div class="WordSection1"><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">The carving event was great fun and we got several boxes planted this morning.  We carved, shared tools and techniques, gossiped, and kept Bell Motel running up and down the stairs to print images!  Some of us are still working on additional stamps.  Bell Motel did a great job of hosting the event and keeping us all busy with supplies and snacks.  <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">One concern came up this morning…it’s clear that there will be many boxes planted on the trails which cross the falls.  You either have to wade knee deep water or jump between a couple of feet of rocks with an intimidating gap between them.  Some members of our group were not comfortable jumping and didn’t come prepared to wade.  I’d suggest  you send out a message to the members signed up for the event on AQ to warn them about the water crossing so they come prepared.  Four people planted there today and we found some boxes by accident…so those who don’t cross the water are going to miss out on a good number of boxes.  It looks like there are several out of state visitors for TALE so a warning on this forum may not reach everyone.  <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;">Open Space  <o></o></span></p><p class="MsoNormal"><a name="_MailEndCompose"><span style="font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;"><o> </o></span></a></p><div><div style="border-top:solid #B5C4DF 1.0pt;padding:3.0pt 0in 0in 0in;"><p class="MsoNormal"><b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;">From:</span></b><span style="font-size:10.0pt;"> LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com [mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com] <br/><b>Sent:</b> Sunday, February 15, 2015 7:56 AM<br/><b>To:</b> LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com<br/><b>Subject:</b> [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Re: Damaged boxes: what would you say &amp; Carve Event?<o></o></span></p></div></div><p class="MsoNormal"><o> </o></p><p class="MsoNormal">  <o></o></p><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><p>This is tough since "the right thing to do" can vary between letterboxers.  Some would want the logbook mailed, others thrown away, and still others might even want the ziplock placed on the outside of the entire box (not my choice).  My own feeling is that the least I can expect is a note from the finder about the condition of the box, and anything else they do to try and help is welcome (or at least tolerated), even if it makes things worse.  About the only thing I hate is if they remove the entire box when the log is the only thing damaged, especially if it is far away from me, since it is much easier to replace a log than an entire box remotely.  My favorite response is if they live close enough to revisit and ask me what to do, which sometimes includes me mailing them a new log or stamp, but this is rare.  Boots, in your case I would do as Open Space said and thank them while gently explaining your wishes for next time, which could be carrying extra paper and ziplocks for future damaged logs.<br/><br/>On another note, how did the TALE Carve Event go?  Hopefully y'all are placing some new boxes for us today!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<o></o></p></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:white;"><o></o></span></p></div></div></div></div><p></p>

<p>Glad y'all had fun carving and already placed several in the park!  Good idea about warning attendees on AQ about fording the creek.  From what I remember about that area you can also ford the creek below the falls by the sand beach where it is smaller, but you then have to climb up the bank on the other side.  Not sure which way is better so will mention both.  Now just hoping for good weather on day of the Event.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle</p>
