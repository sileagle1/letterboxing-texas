If you haven't been there, I would highly recommend it.  We found 3 letterboxes there and tried to find another, which, unfortunately, I believe to be missing.  Two of our grandkids have trail names and personal stamps, so we took them to find Camping Kids, which seemed appropriate.  Our nine year old (Princess Aurora) was able to find the box by herself, following the written clues.  I also placed a box there called The First President and I got it permitted, which proved to be a pleasant and painless process. Most of the staff still didn't know about letterboxing, but the manager was aware of one of the boxes there and asked if I was there to find it.  I asked her which one she meant and she said "The Baby Bear one".  What a great opportunity for IRA Boxer!  She said that someone had come in and asked about that box a couple of years ago and so she looked up the clues and went and found it.  She thought it was cool and put it back, but no one had asked about it since, so she didn't know if it was there or not.  It was there, safe and dry and has had many visitors.  I showed them my box and explained a little more about letterboxing and they seemed genuinely impressed with the whole idea of letterboxing.  She told me I could place my box anywhere in the park that I wanted.  I just had to fill out the geocache permit application, slightly modifying if to reflect the difference between letterboxing and geocaching and turn it back in with the box location. I now have letterboxes permitted in six state parks and I'm trying to educate them one park at a time.  I would caution you, should you want to try the permit process, that the staff at the average park has probably never heard of letterboxing and are unaware that letterboxes exist in their park, so be careful of how you go about it, because once you bring it up, you will expose every other box in the park.  I'd like to pose a question: have any of you ever been contacted by Texas state park personnel about a box you might have located in their park and asked you to fill out a permit application?  I'm just wondering what effect my permitting has had on any existing boxes.  Our boxes in the following parks are permitted:  Lake Livingston, Huntsville, Cedar Hill, Dinosaur Valley, South LLano River and Inks Lake.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I forgot to mention Mission Tejas State Park.  Our boxes there are not permitted, but were placed with permission of the park manager, who didn't require us to fill out a permit application.  Either they are not aware of the permitting process or don't care, so even though they know about ours, they aren't necessarily aware of the other boxes in the park.<br/>

good if you’d give it a try first, since I’ve been working with

painless process. Most of the staff still didn't know about letterboxing, but
the manager was aware of one of the boxes there and asked if I was there to

in the park that I wanted. I just had to fill out the geocache permit
application, slightly modifying if to reflect the difference between
letterboxing and geocaching and turn it back in with the box location. I now
have letterboxes permitted in six state parks and I'm trying to educate them
one park at a time. I would caution you, should you want to try the permit
process, that the staff at the average park has probably never heard of
letterboxing and are unaware that letterboxes exist in their park, so be
careful of how you go about it, because once you bring it up, you will expose
every other box in the park. I'd like to pose a question: have any of you ever
been contacted by <st1:state w:st="on"><st1:place w:st="on">Texas</st1:place></st1:state>
state park personnel about a box you might have located in their park and asked
you to fill out a permit application? I'm just wondering what effect my
permitting has had on any existing boxes. Our boxes in the following parks are
permitted: <st1:placetype w:st="on">Lake</st1:placetype> <st1:placename w:st="on">Livingston</st1:placename>,
<st1:city w:st="on">Huntsville</st1:city>, Cedar Hill, <st1:placename w:st="on">Dinosaur</st1:placename>
<st1:placetype w:st="on">Valley</st1:placetype>, <st1:placename w:st="on">South</st1:placename>
<st1:placename w:st="on">LLano</st1:placename> <st1:placetype w:st="on">River</st1:placetype>

&gt; Hi Boots Tex<br/>
&gt; I got a request today to get a permit for my 2 boxes at Huntsville SP. I<br/>
&gt; won't be back there til 2012 and wonder if you could help out or know<br/>
&gt; someone who could do the permitting for me? I can officially put them up for<br/>
&gt; adoption if necessary...<br/>

&gt; &gt; We spent this past week camping out in Inks Lake State Park with our son,<br/>
&gt; daughter and four grandchildren and had a great time. If you haven't been<br/>
&gt; there, I would highly recommend it. We found 3 letterboxes there and tried<br/>
&gt; to find another, which, unfortunately, I believe to be missing. Two of our<br/>
&gt; grandkids have trail names and personal stamps, so we took them to find<br/>
&gt; Camping Kids, which seemed appropriate. Our nine year old (Princess Aurora)<br/>
&gt; was able to find the box by herself, following the written clues. I also<br/>
&gt; placed a box there called The First President and I got it permitted, which<br/>
&gt; proved to be a pleasant and painless process. Most of the staff still didn't<br/>
&gt; know about letterboxing, but the manager was aware of one of the boxes there<br/>
&gt; and asked if I was there to find it. I asked her which one she meant and she<br/>
&gt; said "The Baby Bear one". What a great opportunity for IRA Boxer! She said<br/>
&gt; that someone had come in and asked about that box a couple of years ago and<br/>
&gt; so she looked up the clues and went and found it. She thought it was cool<br/>
&gt; and put it back, but no one had asked about it since, so she didn't know if<br/>
&gt; it was there or not. It was there, safe and dry and has had many visitors. I<br/>
&gt; showed them my box and explained a little more about letterboxing and they<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Hi all. Sorry for my poor use of this site, I've been off the boards a long time!  As suggested I will contact Chrissy myself and if I need help I'll let you know.  Many many thanks, Nor<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I read the post from Norasta, I treated it as an email rather than as a post, so I apologize for that, I didn't really mean to make this topic public again.  The subject in this case should be Huntsville State Park and I'll explain.  We took our grandkids over to the park last week and by chance ran into Ranger Chrissy Halpen, who is in charge of Letterboxes and Geocaches for the park.  We were discussing the process that we had gone through with her to permit our letterboxes a few months ago and told her of my concern that the process had taken so long.  She said that one of the other rangers, who is no longer at the park, was responsible for the long delay that I experienced in getting the boxes legal, but that she was now in charge and would make sure that the process would be much more expedient. We only talked about our boxes and didn't mention anyone else's, but our conversation must have prompted her to revisit the other boxes in the park.  If you have a box there that is affected by this and want to get it permitted, I think she will be easy to work with.  If you need help, let me know and I'll talk to her. <br/>
