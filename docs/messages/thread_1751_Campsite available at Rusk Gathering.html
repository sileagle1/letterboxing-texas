hookup campsite and unfortunately can't make it.  I'm glad that I read <br/>
the latest messages before I cancelled the site.  IF ANYONE NEEDS A <br/>
SITE, HERE IT IS!<br/>
<br/>
I see that one of the other group members has given one up as well.  <br/>
So following their lead, here is my info on the site.<br/>
<br/>
The reservation was made in the name of Wesley Zubkow for the 17th and <br/>
18 of March.  The first night is paid for already.  The reservation <br/>
number is 3170847.  I think that's all the info you will need.<br/>
<br/>
If you need more info, email me at wzub21 at sbcglobal dot net ASAP.<br/>
<br/>
We hope that everything goes off well, and everyone has a great time.  <br/>
Just wish we could make it to our third event!<br/>

I think there are a couple other folks who may still<br/>
need/want a site, so we'll be sure and put it to good<br/>
use.  <br/>
<br/>
We'll miss y'all!<br/>
