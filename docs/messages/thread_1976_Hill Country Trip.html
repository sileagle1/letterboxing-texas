Hill Country and thought I would share some of the highlights.<br>
Thanks to Dewberry posting her clues so fast from her trip<br>
the weekend before I left, I was able to add a few boxes to<br>
my list of ones to find along the way.  <br>
<br>
We started out going to Beason Park in Columbus so I could <br>
place a box there.  A few days before we left, I read that <br>
Columbus has the oldest Independence Day celebration in TX.  <br>
This surprised me since there are older towns in TX, but I <br>
decided it needed a box and I quickly created Old Time 4th.  <br>
There are now 2 boxes in that park.  Next up was Dewberry's <br>
Lulling In Luling, planted just 2 days before.  It was a nice<br>
stop and allowed the kids to play while I boxed.  I then tried<br>
to find Missing Sequoias in San Antonio without success, but<br>
after emailing the owner I realize I was not looking in the<br>
right place.  There are now several I need to get in San Antonio.<br>
<br>
After our obligatory stop at The Cider Mill in Medina for<br>
everything apple, including awesome apple ice cream, <br>
we arrived at our cabin in Vanderpool.  It is right on the<br>
Sabinal River and is only 1 mile from Lost Maples SP.  It<br>
is so nice to get away from the big city and enjoy the small<br>
town life for a little while.  Even the weather is nicer; hot<br>
but not humid and no mosquitoes!  For 3 days we swam in the<br>
river, shot fireworks (legally), attended the fireworks show<br>
in Utopia that is the biggest one I have ever seen for a small<br>
town, and even found time to relax.<br>
<br>
I also got to letterbox in Lost Maples while birding with<br>
my wife.  I found both the Hill Country Cowboy & Lost Steer<br>
on a trail I had not been on before.  I love this park, even<br>
in summer when there is no colorful foliage, and it could <br>
stand more boxes, especially on the East Trail.  As extra<br>
incentive to visit, I left a surprise in one of the boxes <br>
for someone to find.<br>
<br>
Too soon it was time to leave, but instead of heading home<br>
we made our way to Austin via Fredericksburg.  While passing<br>
through Kerrville I was able to find Dewberry's Potted Cactus,<br>
also planted just before I left.  I had the kids with me and<br>
my wife was with her parents, who had gone on to Fredericksburg<br>
to shop.  Since I had extra time, I stopped at the library in<br>
Kerrville to get Internet access and see if any more boxes<br>
had been placed along my route.  The place was crowded, but<br>
I saw a terminal with nobody at it, so I sat down and started<br>
searching.  I saw that Dewberry had placed 2 more boxes, but<br>
they were Mystery with no City listed.  I was just about to<br>
copy the clues when a librarian came up and asked if my name<br>
was Frank.  I said no, and she said Frank was supposed to be<br>
on that computer and I needed to put my name on a sign up list<br>
before I could get online.  Well the list was long and I <br>
decided to leave, debating whether to change my name to Frank.<br>
<br>
We headed to Fredericksburg where I was supposed to meet<br>
the rest of the family at the town square.  While waiting<br>
I noticed the old building across the street was actually<br>
a LIBRARY!  It looked so old I was not sure it would even<br>
have computers, but I decided to give it a try anyway.  So<br>
the kids and I walked in and were treated to a great old<br>
fashioned library with modern conveniences, and I got on a<br>
computer with no problem and without changing my name.  I<br>
quickly copied the clues and while I waited for the family<br>
I figured out where the boxes must be.  I don't want to give<br>
away the location of the boxes, but I was able to find both<br>
later that day.<br>
<br>
After leaving Fredericksburg we went to a couple of wineries.<br>
This area has really blossomed into the "Napa of TX", and we<br>
really enjoy visiting every chance we get.  We also love getting<br>
TX peaches which are grown in this area, but this year's peach <br>
crop was ruined and there were none to be found.  Next stop<br>
was Pedernales SP, where I found Shrek and, after much effort,<br>
Ziggy Gifts.  This box by Baby Bear has been out there for<br>
over a year and has been found by only 1 person before me,<br>
and I can see why.  The clues call for you to walk 210<br>
steps down the trail, but I discovered it is more than 300.<br>
I email my brother and I think he will fix the clues so more<br>
people have a chance to find this great stamp.<br>
<br>
That night we stayed with relatives in Austin, then got up<br>
with the intention of tubing the "Horseshoe" in New Braunfels.<br>
It was cloudy and cool with strong chance of storms, so we<br>
elected to go canoing on Town Lake instead.  We rented them<br>
from the shack at Zilker Park, close to where my USA Flag LB<br>
was hidden.  This gave me a chance to retrieve the old box<br>
that had been vandalized and place a new one in a different <br>
part of the park.  USA Flag 2 is hidden in a great place<br>
I had never been to called the Austin Nature & Science Center.<br>
Kids will love it and its free.  The box is considered a<br>
new one since it has a different stamp and location, so even<br>
if you got the old one, go for this one, too.<br>
<br>
I also got to find Jack And Adam's LB and San Jacinto Hall LB<br>
before leaving Austin for the drive home.  It was a great<br>
trip and I thank all placers, especially Dewberry, for making<br>
it even more fun.  I hope everyone else had a great 4th!<br>
