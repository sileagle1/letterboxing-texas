<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="957101312-17072007">Not to compare you with a dog (although you would be in 
GREAT company!).  We had a situation over the weekend also.  We 
traveled to Phoenix to breed Sammy.  The breeding was at 10AM Monday.  
While we were gone my dog Parker had a problem.  Monday morning when my 
daughter/house-sitter woke up Parker's neck was so swollen he couldn't swallow 
and he had difficulty breathing.  My daughter rushed him to our vet 
(wife's best friend - 40 miles away).  She hooked him up.  He will be 
fine.  Good thing too - he has 5 titles in obedience and I am just not 
ready to break in a new dog yet.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="957101312-17072007">We don't know what he got in to - but I am taking 
another day off - we were up and down all night with him.  Sick dogs are 
worse than sick kids!  Trust me - we have had both!</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="957101312-17072007">Final note.  I used to take older computers and 
rebuild them for local kids in the neighborhood.  I still have about 4 
windows-98 computers laying around.  I would be glad to give you one.  
But I have no shipping boxes - mailing computers is expensive too.  Think 
about it.  Maybe someone passing thru El Paso can pick it up and get it to 
your house.  Win-98 is good enough for E-mail and web 
surfing.</span></div>

<div>Wow. I'm sorry to hear you had such an interruption to your life's routine, but I guess the timing was good - letterboxingwise. It's been too rainy over the past few weeks to get to many of the trails anyway. Maybe you'll feel like getting out there about the time Mother Earth dries up.... of course by then, it'll be 110 degrees out. Take care and hope to see you on the trails (or at a mini meet) soon.</div>
