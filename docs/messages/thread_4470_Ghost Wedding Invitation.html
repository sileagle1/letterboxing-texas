Mr. Bozo, I can only assume you've had a little too much clown juice or you would get your facts straight.  I have no idea where you get your information, but you are way off base on this one.  My lovely widow, IMA Boxer, is pretty miffed and that's not a good thing.  I was under the impression that clowns like you go to bed at midnight on April 1, all joking aside.<br>
