I must admit I usually don't ask permission first, feeling that<br>
most would not understand and would reject the idea out of fear.<br>
I would go ahead and publish, then if they say no you can try<br>
to convince them otherwise, or move the box somewhere else.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all, I have to agree with Silver Eagle on this --I also tend <br>
to not ask and beg forgiveness later. No one but letterboxers may <br>
ever know the box is there. I am not one to go stomping on <br>
endangered mushrooms or tromping in an endangered frogs habitat but <br>
I also believe that we pay for the parks and we should get to use <br>
them. The few letterboxers that we have finding boxes around here <br>
are surely not going to mess up a park or garden if the tons of <br>
letterboxes they have in New England havent messed up anything <br>
there. And it seems like they have the approval of a lot of parks up <br>
there--just from what I read on the lists. As far as a box in a <br>
garden I dont see what it could hurt if you dont have to trapse <br>
across the roses to get to it. Just my 2 cents....<br>

About asking permission to place boxes, so far when I've actually <br>
asked permission to place a box I've received a 100% enthusiastic & <br>
supportive response!  I was rather intimidated about even raising <br>
the question at first but after I overcame the fear, I put together <br>
my best 'sell' on why it was imperative a letterbox be placed in <br>
that venue.  It worked perfectly!  In one case the lady not only <br>
agreed but even begged for several dozen sets of clues, info sheets <br>
& encouraged me to speak with the local historical society & <br>
elementary school principal about the hobby--to encourage others to <br>
participate in it.  Another instance I used the Victorian history of <br>
letterboxing as a great segue into why that particular Victorian <br>
botanical conservatory really needed a letterbox!  It worked like a <br>
charm.  Unfortunately, a recent renovation to the conservatory <br>
eliminated its perfect hiding place and now I'm trying to find <br>
another spot in which to hide the letterbox.<br>
<br>
Of course, there are some places where I haven't yet asked <br>
permission (various parks & what nots).  I'm really careful about <br>
not knowingly violating any existing policy that prohibits hobbies <br>
such as letterboxing within a park or region.  I also try to take <br>
great care when placing a letterbox so as not to cause unnecessary <br>
damage to the surrounding environment or a potential threat to <br>
animals/wildlife in the area.  In light of our country's current <br>
heightened security awareness, I'm also very cognizant to avoid <br>
placing boxes that might create a 'security frenzy' that may require <br>
a call to the local E O D element.  Ex: don't hide boxes close to <br>
interstate bridges/overpasses, major tourist attractions, major <br>
traffic thoroughfares, etc.  My particular region is teeming with <br>
these sorts of spots.<br>
<br>
So, IMveryHO I've had a very encouraging & successful experience <br>
when it comes to asking permission to place letterboxes (3 for 3).  <br>
If you create a solid set of persuasive tools before you go in to <br>
ask, it usually helps in the negotiation process.  I also like to <br>
highlight the fact that Dartmoor Natl Park, the Connecticut State <br>
Park/Forest system, the Biltmore Estate and numerous other 'official <br>
venues' not only allow letterboxing on their premises but <br>
vociferously encourage it, as well.  This helps TREMENDOUSLY!!!<br>
<br>
This is a great discussion topic!<br>
