Happy Easter to you, and congratulations on your fabulous find! <br/><br/>I realize it would be poor sportmanship to mention that I will be home from Puerto Rico next Wednesday and would love the opportunity to meet your newfound guests in person, so I won't mention it.  I will instead merely wish you and your guests the absolute best! I hope they save some ham for you!<br/>

<p>After a leisurely morning of Easter egg hunts and candy consumption, Trainboy, Munchkin &amp; I dropped off Dinoguy and Fixitman at home and went on a moose hunt. As we started down the trail there was such a racket coming from one of the other paths that we took a detour to see what all the noise was and found a bunch of rowdy rascals hanging around a broken down bus. <br/>
<br/>
Noticing what a predicament they were in I offered to tow them home and have Fixitman help them with their engine troubles. They jumped at the offer and while we went on a moose hunt those rascals decided to try spit shining my truck. <br/>
<br/>
Now I have a truck covered in saliva and a horde of extra guests for Easter dinner tomorrow. Guess I'll have to go to the store and buy a larger ham!<br/>
