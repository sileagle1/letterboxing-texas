<div>I can assure you that all of Texas is waiting, holding their breath, to 
learn of the new whereabouts of the great Texas Tour Bus and its merry band of 
Famous Texans.  And all of us are also eagerly anticipating your first 
letterbox, too, especially if it's anywhere in this north Texas area!  --

<div> </div>
<div>Don't despair over carving faces - that's the worst of it, in my opinion!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I recently carved a Roy Rogers stamp for my mother and the first run at it made him look like someone who should be carrying a switchblade and hanging out in allies - hardly Roy Rogers!  The second attempt made him look prissy.  I finally, on my third try, got a resemblance I was very proud of.  I put the box together and carried it down to her house for us to go boxing, and when I showed it to her, she (who tends to say the first thing that comes to mind) said "Why, that looks nothing like Roy Rogers!"  to which I responded with something like "You should've seen the first two attempts..."  Okay, maybe not picture perfect, but not too bad on rubber...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>She planted that box last week, by the way - it's called Happy Trails in Nacogdoches.  If some of y'all go find it, be easy on her - it's her first plant, and be easy on me - it IS hard to carve faces!</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy
