called What's Blooming?  The box highlights a flower that is blooming <br/>
in our garden at that moment.  This box is meant to travel all over <br/>
the greater Houston area, and letterboxers are welcome to refind it--<br/>
because it will be in a new location with a new stamp, at least as <br/>
long as we can keep it alive.  This box was launched last month with <br/>
Foxglove (one of my favorite stamps we've carved) in Memorial Park.  <br/>
We pulled the stamp and have rehidden it in a park in West Houston <br/>
with a new Rudbeckia stamp.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you want to see What's Blooming? come find our box!<br/>
