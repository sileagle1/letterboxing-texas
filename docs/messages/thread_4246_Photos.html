Hi All,  I just got a chance to look at all the event photo's thanks for<br>
taking them!   BB - I just love the one of Pink Cookie and me !  And<br>
girls those halo's are just precious!<br>
<br>
Pink Cookie and I had a such great time Sat. at the Birthday Bash! <br>
Thank you ladies for throwing such a great event!  Great LOTR stamps and<br>
we had a great time finding your other boxes in the park too!  It was<br>
great seeing everyone again and meeting all the newer letterboxers too!<br>
<br>
Pink Cookie and I also got an added bonus later that day of having<br>
dinner with Gryzzled Gryphon & Frost Maiden at the New York Sub Hub...<br>
Pink Cookie is quite intriqued with GG she talked about him the whole<br>
way home.<br>
<br>
Happy Trails Everyone!<br>
