On the AtlasQuest site I was poking around, (looking for boxes to add to<br/>
my logbook!) and I stumbled on the fact that our own Silver Eagle passed<br/>
the century mark - this summer he planted his 100th box!<br/>
Very cool! Congratulations! And thank you very much from all of us who<br/>
get to hunt for them!<br/>
<br/>
(And the nicest thing is that he works as hard at planting them as<br/>
finding them - I bet that's pretty rare ;-))<br/>

stretching to plant boxes in bare areas, have made<br/>
letterboxing a possibility for my family and you've<br/>
inspired us to get out there and plant away - once it<br/>
cools off a bit anyway!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks a million for all you've done for letterboxing<br/>
in Texas, and everywhere else too!<br/>
