On the AtlasQuest site I was poking around, (looking for boxes to add to<br>
my logbook!) and I stumbled on the fact that our own Silver Eagle passed<br>
the century mark - this summer he planted his 100th box!<br>
Very cool! Congratulations! And thank you very much from all of us who<br>
get to hunt for them!<br>
<br>
(And the nicest thing is that he works as hard at planting them as<br>
finding them - I bet that's pretty rare ;-))<br>

stretching to plant boxes in bare areas, have made<br>
letterboxing a possibility for my family and you've<br>
inspired us to get out there and plant away - once it<br>
cools off a bit anyway!<br>
<br>
Thanks a million for all you've done for letterboxing<br>
in Texas, and everywhere else too!<br>
