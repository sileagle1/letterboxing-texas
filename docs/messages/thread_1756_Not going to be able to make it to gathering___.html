<br>
Just wanted to let you all know that Batty B and Butterfly B of the <br>
Busybeesfamily will not be able to make it to the gathering.  We are <br>
so sorry to miss it this year, but had some complications during our <br>
vacation this prior week in Mexico.  <br>
<br>
I feel kinda silly admitting this, but I got bit on the thigh by a <br>
fish (thanks to the kiddos throwing crackers right at me!) and the <br>
bite is now infected and I cannot shake the fever.  I think I'll be <br>
going to the Dr. this weekend.  Duh!  Like they say...it's Murphy's <br>
law.  If it can go wrong...it will.<br>
<br>
We do hope to take a trip up to Rusk sometime soon and find all of the <br>
boxes that are being planted in honor of the gathering.  Hope everyone <br>
has tons of fun...we're gonna miss it!<br>
<br>
Thanks, Batty B<br>
<br>
