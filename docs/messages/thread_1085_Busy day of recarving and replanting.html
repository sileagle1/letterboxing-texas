I spent a busy afternoon Sunday recarving and a busy day today <br/>
replanting all my Arlington boxes that had gone missing.  Every one of <br/>
them have new hiding places but are recarvings of the original <br/>
stamps.  I have also recarved two of my Fort Worth and one Pantego box <br/>
that were missing but haven't replanted them yet.  Whew!  Box <br/>
maintenance takes more time than I ever anticipated!  It's all still <br/>
worth it though, for this Grand Obsession!  Hmmmmm...... that might be <br/>
a cool name for a new box!  I also have a new series planned, but it <br/>
will take me a few weeks to plan.  I will keep you posted , though.<br/>
<br/>
......waiting for West Nile virus to kick in after all the skeeter <br/>
bites I got tonight!.............Kantexan<br/>
