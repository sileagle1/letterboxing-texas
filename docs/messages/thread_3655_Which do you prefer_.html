Best of both worlds!<div>Since it is a series and yes one would presumably be getting all the boxes at one time, it makes sense to have just one log book at the end of the series. Added bonus is that time spent at each box is reduced, thus reducing exposure time. There was one series I found that was a really long hike with lots of boxes, but only the logbook at the end, so the planter had alternate directions to the last box for those who didn't want to make the entire trek, but could still log in at the end.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I forgot to mention that the benefit we see to stamping in at every box is that it as a way to teach a newbie what to do when you find a letterbox. These are family friendly boxes and it would also allow families with multiple members each a chance to do the stamp work.<br/>
<br/>
Don't have to worry much about exposure since they are on protected property and the management supports the boxes being there.<br/>
<br/>
As lone boxers and non-newbies I'm leaning towards the last box only option... but what do you think from a newbie perspective or educational view? This historic place is an educational farmstead/museum.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Would you consider putting a single logbook in the first box instead of the last? That way people who do not have time to visit the entire series in one visit and might not be returning anytime soon (vacationers, etc) could still record their visit there. Just a thought.<br/>

&gt; &gt;&gt; We have a series of boxes on the same property that are designed to take you through a tour of a historic place. The property has been recently renovated, so we have pulled all the boxes and are in the process of re-doing them. We're wondering... in a series like this, where one would definitely try to find all the boxes in one trip, would you prefer...<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) a logbook be included in every box so you can stamp your signature stamp in every box you find on the property...<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; or <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) find all the boxes but only stamp your signature stamp in a log book included in the last box?<br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course in either situation there would be a hand carved stamp in each box for you to imprint the image of for your records.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I debated this question when I recently relocated my series in Memorial Park.  The park was so devasted by drought and bulldozing that I only found 2 of the original boxes and neither of them contained log books.  It made me wonder if I only had a logbook in the last box, but I don't think I ever did that, because I think that's a relatively new practice.  The problem that I can see is if the last box goes missing, there will be no record of finders, but that's true of any single plant as well.  Another fact is that, on a long series, there will be those who don't complete the series for some reason, so they don't log in at all.  If the series is a mystery plant, like mine was, half of the potential finders never find the last box, so they don't leave a record.  Half of them do, letting me know that the clue was solvable.  That having been said, I have liked the long series of boxes that I have found where there was only one logbook, because it made the process go faster.  There are other times when I like to take my time, stamp in, and look to see the cool stamps of those who have been there before me.  If I get to the last box and can't find it, I don't get that experience.  I know, I'm being wishy-washy, but I guess there is no right or wrong answer, only opinions, leaving the final decision up to the planter, and that's the way, in my opinion, it should be.  For the finder, they can and do whatever they please.  If you know you are looking for a series of boxes, you can choose to wait and only log into the last one.  No one is going to tell you that you can't .<br/>

&gt; I wouldn't think so. It's a neat museum property... I would hope someone would spend time enjoying the outdoors and stamp what they would find necessary. <br/>

The property has been recently renovated, so we have pulled all the boxes and are in the process of re-doing them. We're wondering... in a series like this, where one would definitely try to find all the boxes in one trip, would you prefer...<br/><br/>1) a logbook be included in every box so you can stamp your signature stamp in every box you find on the property...<br/><br/>or <br/><br/>2) find all the boxes but only stamp your signature stamp in a log book included in the last box?<br/><br/>Of course in either situation there would be a hand carved stamp in each box for you to imprint the image of for your records.<br/><br/>Feedback appreciated. We are trying to complete the revision by this weekend.<br/><br/>Team K9<o:p></o:p></p></div></div><div><p><o:p> </o:p></p><div><div id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div id="ygrp-msg"><div id="ygrp-text"><div><p><o:p> </o:p></p></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div><p><o:p> </o:p></p></div></div></div></div><p><o:p> </o:p></p></div></div><div><p><span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
