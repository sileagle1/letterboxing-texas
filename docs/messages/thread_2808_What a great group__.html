even just on the fringe part of, a group of people who<br>
are kind and loving to one another, and think that is<br>
a fun good way to be, rather than take pleasure in<br>
tearing each other down with sarcasm and jabs.  it is<br>
a noticable difference from many other groups, and a<br>
lovely difference, for sure.<br>
