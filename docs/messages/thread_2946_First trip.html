                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi.  My family and I are new to LBing.  I have been talking about it <br>
for months and reading everything I could find on the subject.  I <br>
fractured my knee Easter weekend and had to put off alot of summer <br>
outings.  This past week we went camping in East Texas (me on one leg) <br>
and set out to find our first boxes.  Kids were thrilled.  We attempted <br>
4 boxes and actually found 2.<br>
<br>
I managed to hike a little over a mile (RT) one crutches...but I could <br>
not be left out of the first find.  I let the rest of the family tackle <br>
the rest on their own...with a camera in hand.<br>
<br>
It was great to get out...and LBing was a great motivator for me to at <br>
least try to walk.  Thank all of you for all of your great stories and <br>
information.<br>
