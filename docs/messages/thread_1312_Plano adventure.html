<br/>
The clues didn't really tell us much, but we were in the right place.<br/>
We looked and found no box.<br/>
<br/>
However...<br/>
The place led us to this little creek. The water was low, slow and<br/>
clear and there were little fish swimming. And it was hot. Yes, I took<br/>
my shoes off and wadded. It felt SO good. And it felt so much like a<br/>
summer activity! It was just pretty. <br/>
<br/>
That's what I like about letterboxing. It can bring you to some very<br/>
interesting places. And honestly, I'm not disappointed that we didn't<br/>
find the box. I had fun!<br/>
<br/>
The only thing that I dislike is that it's hot. And when I get hot, my<br/>
face turns BEET RED. <br/>
