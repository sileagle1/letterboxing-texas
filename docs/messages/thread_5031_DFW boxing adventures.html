<div>Well, there IS that butterfly garden in the nature preserve at Cedar Hill (where, in fact, you found one of my letterboxes, thank you).  So I would expect the area to be pretty attractive to birds and butterflies as well as to letterboxers -- and some really great views from the trail along the bluff, too!  </div>
<div><br/>
I know I for one will be excited to find the new boxes you planted while in our area!  Thanks,</div>
