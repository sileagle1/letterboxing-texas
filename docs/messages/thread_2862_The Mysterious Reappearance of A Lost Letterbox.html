<div>One of my letterboxes (In the Creek: Lauren's Turtle), previously missing, 
has suddenly reappeared.  Where it went and how it returned is a really 
mystery to me.  Here's the story:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The original letterbox was in place (a great place, too, Grapevine's 
Heritage Park Botanic Gardens,!) from May 2005 until June 2006, then went 
missing.  I replaced it in the same location with Lauren's Turtle 
#2.  That one was in place until March, 2007 and then 
it was reported missing.  I checked to be sure, searched all around.  
It was definitely gone.   I decided the place wasn't LB-hospitable, so 
I created Lauren's Turtle #3 and put it in a <em><u>new </u></em>location.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last week. Lauren (of the letterbox) happened to be in the place where the 
original letterbox had been, and looked, and Lo!  The Letterbox had 
returned!  She opened it to be sure it was THE letterbox, and it was indeed 
Lauren's Turtle #2, with its logbook almost entirely full.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was amazed and went to see for myself.  There it sits, happily and 
quietly in its original location.  Where has that little turtle been?  
How did it come back?  It was definitely missing for at least a week 
earlier this spring, and I retired the box when I created #3 and changed the 
location.  So now, I'll be returning with a new logbook and relisting that 
one again.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Do you think those busy little Letterboxing Armadillos took the 
turtle home for awhile to examine the logbook stamps?  Who knows what 
happened?  But the amazing thing is that -- it's BACK!  I guess we can 
all have hopes for those missing boxes that someday, they'll just 
reappear.  Maybe I'll start looking again in all the places my other boxes 
have gone missing, to see if they've reappeared as well!  </div>
