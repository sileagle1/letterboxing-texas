to those who have donated stamps &amp; more.<br/>
<br/>
If you are going to play Bingo, please let me know by March 1st, so<br/>
that I make enough cards.  I am still working out the rules (thanks to<br/>
Lock Wench for sharing her ideas), but it will work similarly to this:<br/>
<br/>
You will receive a card with 25 squares on it.  Instead of numbers,<br/>
there will be box names in the squares.  As you box in Rusk SP and<br/>
around town, you can fill in the squares with the stamps from the<br/>
boxes.  The first one to bring back five in a row wins a prize!  The<br/>
one with the most squares wins a prize!  The one with the most rows<br/>
filled wins a prize!  Heck, you may all win a prize (this part is a<br/>
little fuzzy).  Look for sneaky clues and easy clues.  What would be<br/>
the fun if we didn't Gramatrick up at least a few of them?  Yes,<br/>
TeamKing, that means that there will be at least a few puzzle clues,<br/>
but you should be able to still get BINGO without those boxes.<br/>
<br/>
To register to play:  <br/>
<br/>
either send an email to my gmail account or to me at atlasquest.  You<br/>
must also tell me something that not everyone will know about you.  It<br/>
can be something like where you were born, your unusual profession,<br/>
that there were 20 people in your high school class, the fact that<br/>
you've been to the south pole, how your trail name found you, etc.  <br/>
<br/>
Now, clearly, there are some with closer relationships with others.  I<br/>
am not asking for your deepest family secrets, but rather something<br/>
kind of fun that isn't general knowledge and that you don't mind if<br/>
others discover about you.  <br/>
<br/>
If you plan on planting a box that should be included in the BINGO<br/>
game, let me know that too.  I need the name of the box to make up the<br/>
cards.<br/>
<br/>
I probably forgot something, but that's it for now.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What is (in your humble opinion), the world's best carving kit?  I <br/>
got the basic introductory speedball kit at Michael's to carve my <br/>
first stamp a couple of months ago, and I just knew there must be <br/>
something better, judging from the stamps I've seen in some of the <br/>
letterboxes.  I'm getting ready to carve a few to plant in San <br/>
Jacinto County (we need some letterboxes up here!) and I could use <br/>
better tools.  Where can I get them?  Thanks.<br/>

&gt; That's great.  I was leaning toward letterbox-related prizes, but <br/>
am<br/>
&gt; open to anything.  So far, I've gotten<br/>

&gt; I was thinking of making up a few letterbox kits as prizes--with<br/>
&gt; everything you need to plant a box--carving material, box, logbook,<br/>
&gt; etc.  If there would be interest?  Anything else you'd like to see <br/>
as<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Wow!  Three more great stamps arrived today from<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; out-of-state boxers.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So far, I have received lovely donations from<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with other stamps on the way from other fabulous<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxers.  A big thanks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to those who have donated stamps &amp; more.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you are going to play Bingo, please let me know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; by March 1st, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that I make enough cards.  I am still working out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the rules (thanks to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Lock Wench for sharing her ideas), but it will work<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; similarly to this:<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; You will receive a card with 25 squares on it. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of numbers,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there will be box names in the squares.  As you box<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Rusk SP and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around town, you can fill in the squares with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stamps from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes.  The first one to bring back five in a row<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wins a prize!  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; one with the most squares wins a prize!  The one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with the most rows<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; filled wins a prize!  Heck, you may all win a prize<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; (this part is a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; little fuzzy).  Look for sneaky clues and easy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues.  What would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fun if we didn't Gramatrick up at least a few of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; them?  Yes,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; TeamKing, that means that there will be at least a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; few puzzle clues,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but you should be able to still get BINGO without<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; those boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; To register to play:  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; either send an email to my gmail account or to me at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; atlasquest.  You<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; must also tell me something that not everyone will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know about you.  It<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can be something like where you were born, your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; unusual profession,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that there were 20 people in your high school class,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the fact that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you've been to the south pole, how your trail name<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; found you, etc.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, clearly, there are some with closer<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; relationships with others.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; am not asking for your deepest family secrets, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rather something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; kind of fun that isn't general knowledge and that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you don't mind if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; others discover about you.  <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; If you plan on planting a box that should be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; included in the BINGO<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; game, let me know that too.  I need the name of the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box to make up the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cards.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I probably forgot something, but that's it for now.<br/>

<div>Dewberry, I am also carving a stamp for the Bingo game and want to play. My stamp is "Letterboxing Coyotes". This is going to be so much fun. Can't wait to see everyone soon. Puddle Splasher</div>

Hi Dewberry!<br/>
<br/>
Just wanted to let you know that I decided to carve "Dining Car" for <br/>
the Bingo game.  I'll get it carved this week and hopefully mail it to <br/>
whoever is "in charge" so that JUST IN CASE we're not back from <br/>
vacation in time, it'll still be planted for the game.<br/>
<br/>
Also wondering if anybody is doing a "Riding the Rails" stamp? If <br/>
not...I've found a great clip and would like to do that one, too.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Batty B<br/>
<br/>

carve a stamp to play--thanks to the lovely donations I have received<br/>
from other boxers across the USA.  <br/>
<br/>
Just send me an email that you want to play.  Tell me something that <br/>
not everyone knows about you--there are going to be a few friends<br/>
walking around with stamps to add to the fun.  Figuring out who they<br/>
are is part of the fun.<br/>
