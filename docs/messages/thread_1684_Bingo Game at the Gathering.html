                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow!  Three more great stamps arrived today from out-of-state boxers.<br>
<br>
So far, I have received lovely donations from<br>
<br>
SewSoBizzy<br>
PostMystress<br>
Dragonrider<br>
So. Hill Hendersons<br>
Speedsquare<br>
Dixie Kin<br>
Safari Man<br>
<br>
with other stamps on the way from other fabulous boxers.  A big thanks<br>
to those who have donated stamps & more.<br>
<br>
If you are going to play Bingo, please let me know by March 1st, so<br>
that I make enough cards.  I am still working out the rules (thanks to<br>
Lock Wench for sharing her ideas), but it will work similarly to this:<br>
<br>
You will receive a card with 25 squares on it.  Instead of numbers,<br>
there will be box names in the squares.  As you box in Rusk SP and<br>
around town, you can fill in the squares with the stamps from the<br>
boxes.  The first one to bring back five in a row wins a prize!  The<br>
one with the most squares wins a prize!  The one with the most rows<br>
filled wins a prize!  Heck, you may all win a prize (this part is a<br>
little fuzzy).  Look for sneaky clues and easy clues.  What would be<br>
the fun if we didn't Gramatrick up at least a few of them?  Yes,<br>
TeamKing, that means that there will be at least a few puzzle clues,<br>
but you should be able to still get BINGO without those boxes.<br>
<br>
To register to play:  <br>
<br>
either send an email to my gmail account or to me at atlasquest.  You<br>
must also tell me something that not everyone will know about you.  It<br>
can be something like where you were born, your unusual profession,<br>
that there were 20 people in your high school class, the fact that<br>
you've been to the south pole, how your trail name found you, etc.  <br>
<br>
Now, clearly, there are some with closer relationships with others.  I<br>
am not asking for your deepest family secrets, but rather something<br>
kind of fun that isn't general knowledge and that you don't mind if<br>
others discover about you.  <br>
<br>
If you plan on planting a box that should be included in the BINGO<br>
game, let me know that too.  I need the name of the box to make up the<br>
cards.<br>
<br>
I probably forgot something, but that's it for now.<br>

open to anything.  So far, I've gotten<br>

used these tools, you'll toss the speedball.<br>
--LockNLock boxes<br>
--camo tape<br>
--sheets of grade a PZ cut<br>

I was thinking of making up a few letterbox kits as prizes--with<br>
everything you need to plant a box--carving material, box, logbook,<br>
etc.  If there would be interest?  Anything else you'd like to see as<br>
prizes?  <br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">What is (in your humble opinion), the world's best carving kit?  I <br>
got the basic introductory speedball kit at Michael's to carve my <br>
first stamp a couple of months ago, and I just knew there must be <br>
something better, judging from the stamps I've seen in some of the <br>
letterboxes.  I'm getting ready to carve a few to plant in San <br>
Jacinto County (we need some letterboxes up here!) and I could use <br>
better tools.  Where can I get them?  Thanks.<br>

Hi Dewberry!<br>
<br>
Just wanted to let you know that I decided to carve "Dining Car" for <br>
the Bingo game.  I'll get it carved this week and hopefully mail it to <br>
whoever is "in charge" so that JUST IN CASE we're not back from <br>
vacation in time, it'll still be planted for the game.<br>
<br>
Also wondering if anybody is doing a "Riding the Rails" stamp? If <br>
not...I've found a great clip and would like to do that one, too.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Batty B<br>

from other boxers across the USA.  <br>
<br>
Just send me an email that you want to play.  Tell me something that <br>
not everyone knows about you--there are going to be a few friends<br>
walking around with stamps to add to the fun.  Figuring out who they<br>
are is part of the fun.<br>
