                    <div class="plaintext-content">Had to pull Orange you Glad today--some naughty creature's been <br>
gnawing on the corner of the box, and they'd been persistent enough to <br>
put a hole all the way through the pretty-thick plastic.  A little <br>
water inside, but baggies were protecting the log book.  Should get <br>
this one in a new container and out again soon.<br>
<br>
I also pulled What's Blooming? for replacement of the stamp and a <br>
rehide.  Right now, there's slim pickings in the garden, so it'll be <br>
either gomphrena, zinnias or cosmos.  For those of you who may be new, <br>
this is a rotating letterbox that features a new stamp of what's <br>
blooming in my garden every 2 months or so.  Will post clues when I <br>
figure out what to do next.<br>
<br>
I also want to say thanks to Molly Grue for doing some maintenance on <br>
our Dragonfly Dos box at the Nails Creek Unit of lake Somerville State <br>
Park.  More pesky critters!  My money's on raccoons--they think they <br>
can break into anything.  <br>
<br>
happy boxing!<br>
