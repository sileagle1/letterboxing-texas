<div>I did not know that. In fact, I find that news to be very sad. We used to camp there with my parents when my daughters were young. Hopefully it will maintain it's original charm under the new operators.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I read an article in the Dallas Morning News today that most recreation areas at Lake Texoma would likely be "closed" for at least another six weeks and it would be more than two months before Lakes Lewisville (north of Dallas), Ray Roberts and Grapevine will reopen. In fact the article said that Grapevine would probably be the last to open because it is still twenty feet above normal, and it is the lowest on the priority list for releasing flood water due to the fact that it has more storage capacity than RR or Lewisville which empty into the same rivers and lakes downstate. In other words, recreational facilities for all four lakes in northern Texas will probably be out of commission until the fall. Even after the water recedes, there will be a lot of cleanup that must occur before the areas can be reopened.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am reasonably sure that my original moose series at Lake Grapevine is high and dry, but I will need to check and see if the trail is passable. I still don't know about Three Blind Moose. Part of the trail where that is located is flooded and the parking and entrance to that trail is underwater.</div>
