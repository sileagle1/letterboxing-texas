My issue with the locknlock I've found is that it is<br>
so tall.  I kind of figure it has to be that tall to<br>
accomodate the lock flaps, but I wonder if any of you<br>
in areas with more sources for containers have seen<br>
any locknlock in a lower profile.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There are all different sizes.  I have one on my desk that is 2 inches<br>
tall, 5.75 inches long and 4.25 inches wide.  it is a great height for<br>
a museum logbook and stamp.  There is little wasted space, but it<br>
could also hold a film container-sized HH.<br>
<br>
I am replacing my little stamp mystery.  The box I am using is also 2<br>
inches high, 4 inches long and 3.25 inches wide.  It is replacing an<br>
altoids tin which I adored for its compact profile, but when I went to<br>
check on it, had rusted so that it was too hard to open (dry on the<br>
inside, though).  I loved the low profile of the altoids-type tin, but<br>
it just didn't work in the field.  For this particular box, about 1.5<br>
inches tall would be the perfect size.  The other dimensions are perfect.<br>

<div>I've picked up the locknlock at Garden Ridge Pottery, Krogers and Walmart - but never know which sizes they will have in stock because they seem to sell out. It seems harder to locate the smaller sizes, but they do exist.</div>
