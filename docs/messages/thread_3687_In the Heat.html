<div> </div>
<div>In scouting out a spot for a plant here in Commerce yesterday, I found a very tiny Tupperware geocache in the crotch of a tree.  It contained only a log which had not been signed yet.  The funny thing is that in the past we tried geocaching and struck out both times.  Now, when NOT looking, I've found 2 of them!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I was thinking about your dilemma of not enough boxes and I want to make sure you are checking both major websites - Atlasquest and <a href="http://letterboxing.org">letterboxing.org</a>.  I'm looking at it and it looks like there is a lot of overlap, but there are also a few that are one site and not the other.  That may help you have a few more options!  One thing though - Catpawz has been out of pocket for almost two years now.  If you go looking for their boxes, realize they may or may not be there.  If you try to find them, would you please make sure to let me know the status (either on this list or privately)?  I'm trying to keep track of theirs and make sure they get archived if they are missing...  Catpawz is a great pair of ladies and they wouldn't want to think folks are hunting for their boxes needlessly.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Keep the faith though - when I first got started, there were about seven boxes within an hour and a half of me!  One suggestion to help draw boxers in closer - plant your own boxes on the outer edge of where you are able to care for them.  That will draw other boxers in a little closer to find yours, and then maybe they'll leave some of their own.  That's what worked for me!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Wow Lucy, thanks !!  There are a bunch in Hunt Co. that I didn't know <br>
about!  I've printed off the Catpawz series of 4 and we'll tackle <br>
those in an early morning run soon and I'll let you know the <br>
results.  I've gotten comfortable with Alas Quest and was forgetting <br>
about LB.org.  I need to post my plant there too.  Your idea about <br>
planting boxes on the fringes of our area is excellent too.  I've got <br>
2 more about ready to go in Commerce and then will branch out to lure <br>
more of you to this area!   Thanks again,   Fran (Celtic Knotheads)<br>
