It took us over an hour to get home from my daughter's house which is usually a 20/25 minute drive. Cars were spinning out into the ditches and getting stuck trying to go up the hills. Thank goodness we were in my Jeep with 4-wheel drive! Gryzzled, are you getting a good snow out your way?<br/>
<br/>
A WHITE CHRISTMAS! Merry Christmas to all. I hope we all have a prosperious, healthy and most importantly, happy 2010. I look forward to seeing everyone in a couple of months at TALE!<br/>
