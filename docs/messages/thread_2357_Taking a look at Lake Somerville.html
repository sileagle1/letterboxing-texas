                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have a box in need of help at the Nails Creek unit. Due to budget<br/>
cuts, they have closed it for camping (day use only).  The last person<br/>
to find it said that the trails had gotten overgrown and that getting<br/>
to my box is an exercise in bushwhacking.  This is after an animal had<br/>
gotten to a part of it already (but, believe it or not, it's still alive).<br/>
<br/>
If anyone goes out there before I do, I would appreciate them picking<br/>
it up; I'd like to retire it.  If not, I'll try to get out there<br/>
before the gathering to pick it up and plant a box on the Birch Creek<br/>
side for those that are coming for the gathering.  <br/>
<br/>
I have hiked the trail between the two, but it's been a long time and<br/>
was definitely in my pre-letterboxing days.<br/>
