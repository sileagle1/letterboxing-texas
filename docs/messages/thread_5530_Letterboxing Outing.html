                    <html><body><p>In the hope others will talk about their outings, I will tell you about my latest.  About a month ago I read a book titled "Texas Rising" by Stephen Moore which was the basis for the History Channel miniseries <span>on the Texas Revolution against Mexico and how the Texas Rangers were created.  It was a great book and I hope to watch the miniseries some day since it brought out some details I had not heard before.  I have always loved reading about Texas Rangers and know quite a bit about the early ones, but I was struck again at how amazing some of them were; especially Jack Hays.  A long time ago I created a letterbox dedicated to the TX Rangers and put it near their museum in Waco, but I had never done one for Jack Hays.  I figured somebody else probably had so I looked on LBNA and AQ but did not find one, so I decided to do it.  I had to figure out where to place it, so I looked online to see where he is buried, thinking I would place it there, and to my surprise I found he is buried in California!  My next idea was to place it in the county named after him, but I couldn't find a new place I liked, so I decided to put it in the same park where I had put my Twisted X box (Charro Ranch Park in Dripping Springs).  This is a great park that I first heard of when Walksfar placed a box there a few months ago (Dog Scout Day) and it can handle a few more boxes.  In fact, as I found out later, Walksfar also placed a new box (Pounce) the same day that I did, and on the same trail!  Luckily they are not too close to each other and mine leads to hers as if it were planned.  So now there are 4 boxes to find in this nice park.<br/><br/>On the same trip I placed another box in Austin at a park that was new to me; but first a little background.  About a month ago I watched the movie "My All American", a true story about a University Of TX football player named Freddie Steinmark who showed courage in the face of adversity in the 1960's and continues to inspire players and coaches even today.  It is great movie and I decided to place a letterbox in his honor, but since there aren't many good places on campus for boxes I needed a better place, preferably a new place.  As it happens my daughter, who is attending UT, had recently showed me a place I had never heard of called Bull Creek Preserve, and I decided to place it there.  It is a great park with miles of trails that can handle many more boxes (hint, hint), and I think Freddie would have liked it.  So I hope you will get out there and letterbox, and then tell us about it.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>P.S.  I am currently reading the book that was the basis for the movie, "Courage Beyond The Game" by Jim Dent, and I highly recommend it.  He is the same author of "Junction Boys", another classic.<br/></span></p><p><span><br/></span></p></body></html>

                    <html><body><p>Thank you for sharing your latest outings with us, I thoroughly enjoyed reading your post.  I guess the last outing we took was in October when we traveled to Huntsville, Alabama to visit Lone Star Quilter's brother, El Lobo and his wife Star Seeker.  Although they are not active in letterboxing any more, they are great hosts and we enjoyed visiting and seeing the beautiful sights around that great city.  We placed several letterboxes in Interstate rest areas along the way.  My boxes are "classic cars" and LSQ's are "movie cars".  I placed a box a few years ago in San Antonio called "Devil Yack" which was in honor of Jack Coffee Hays, but unfortunately, it was only found a few times before it went missing and I never replaced it.  I'm glad you placed one of your own and it's on my list of boxes to find next time we're out that way.  I, too, was surprised that he was buried in California.  He went out west during the gold rush and became mayor of the city of Oakland, the first if memory serves me.  I find that kind of information fascinating!  Thanks for placing more letterboxes, and for honoring our Texas heroes.  I happen to be reading a book about the life of Temple Houston, one of Sam Houston's sons.  He happens to be buried in Oklahoma.  I recently placed a box in Independence near the grave of Sam's oldest son, Dr. Sam Houston, Jr.</p><div><br/><div><div>Boots Tex</div></div></div></body></html>
