that we all act out sometimes because each and everyone of us love <br/>
this Hobby/Sport so very much. I'm not the first to get upset and <br/>
surly will not be the last. All I can do is say I'm sorry and once and <br/>
for all say that I was only trying to do my best in a even worse <br/>
situation. I know what to do now and will always be prepared for the <br/>
outcome. I will always now travel with a extra carved stamp along with <br/>
all the other things to carry and simply replace a sub standard box <br/>
until the owner can return or tell me what to do for him/her with a <br/>
note in the box explaining why that persons stamp was not there <br/>
anymore. To this I would only do that if the entire box was in fact <br/>
destroyed as in these cases. I'm very sorry to Viewfinder for not <br/>
reading her letter as it was intended to be read. I took it wrong and <br/>
got my feelings hurt and reacted maybe not as I should have. I have <br/>
only love in my heart for all who love LBing as I so dearly do. I <br/>
never ment to cause harm or ill will against something I love to do. <br/>
<br/>
Thank You All,<br/>
Your Friend in LBing,<br/>
