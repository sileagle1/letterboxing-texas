I am less than a hour away from Quitman.  I go see if I can save <br>
your "Pillsbury Doughboy" for you today.  I've been wanting to go <br>
boxing anyway and I love this stamp.  I will let you know it's status.<br>

Your "Pillsbury Doughboy" is safe and sound and staying warm at my <br>
house.  It took me a while to find it but he was exactly where he was <br>
supposed to be.  Just not where I remembered when I found him a while <br>
ago.  A family from Red Oak, TX logged in his logbook yesterday.<br>
<br>
I will be going to TALE 6 also and I can bring him there or I can <br>
mail him to you or we can meet somewhere.  Let me know which one <br>
you'd like to do.<br>

crusty old man and was considered a positive roll model for millions.<br>
<br>
Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough, their children: John <br>
Dough, Jane Dough, and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He <br>
is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart.<br>

The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes."<br>
