I am less than a hour away from Quitman.  I go see if I can save <br/>
your "Pillsbury Doughboy" for you today.  I've been wanting to go <br/>
boxing anyway and I love this stamp.  I will let you know it's status.<br/>

Your "Pillsbury Doughboy" is safe and sound and staying warm at my <br/>
house.  It took me a while to find it but he was exactly where he was <br/>
supposed to be.  Just not where I remembered when I found him a while <br/>
ago.  A family from Red Oak, TX logged in his logbook yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I will be going to TALE 6 also and I can bring him there or I can <br/>
mail him to you or we can meet somewhere.  Let me know which one <br/>
you'd like to do.<br/>

<br/>
"Please join me in remembering a great icon of the entertaining <br/>
community. The Pillsbury Doughboy died yesterday of a yeast infection <br/>
and trauma complications from repeated pokes in the belly. His use-by <br/>
date was last Thursday.<br/>
<br/>
Doughboy was buried in a lightly greased coffin. Dozens of <br/>
celebrities turned out to pay their respects, including Mrs. <br/>
Butterworth, Hungry Jack, the California Raisins, Betty Crocker, the <br/>
Hostess Twinkies, and Captain Crunch. The grave site was piled high <br/>
with flours.<br/>
<br/>
Aunt Jemima delivered the eulogy and lovingly described Doughboy as a <br/>
man who never knew how much he was kneaded. Doughboy rose quickly in <br/>
show business, but his later life was filled with turnovers. He was <br/>
not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his dough on half-<br/>
baked schemes. Despite being a little flaky at times, he still was a <br/>
crusty old man and was considered a positive roll model for millions.<br/>
<br/>
Doughboy is survived by his wife Play Dough, their children: John <br/>
Dough, Jane Dough, and Dosey Dough, plus they had one in the oven. He <br/>
is also survived by his elderly father, Pop Tart.<br/>
<br/>
The funeral was held at 3:50 for about 20 minutes."<br/>

  described Doughboy as a <br/>man who never knew how much he was kneaded. 
  Doughboy rose quickly in <br/>show business, but his later life was filled with 
  turnovers. He was <br/>not considered a very smart cookie, wasting much of his
