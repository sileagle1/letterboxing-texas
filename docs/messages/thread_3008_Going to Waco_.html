                    <div class="plaintext-content">If anyone is going to Waco for letterboxing and happens to be visiting <br/>
Oakwood Cemetery, I have a favor to ask.  I placed three of my <br/>
governor boxes there on July 9.  There has been a report that the <br/>
logbook in one of them is full, although only 6 finds have been <br/>
reported.  The box is called Parks for Texas - Texas Governors Series <br/>
and is for Governor Pat Neff.  There was no mention of the other 2 <br/>
logbooks (The Lawman and The Real Thing)being full, so I'm concerned <br/>
about Mr. Neff.  Thanks to new letterboxers The Duck Ducks for the <br/>
report.  I appreciate it.  Thanks.<br/>
