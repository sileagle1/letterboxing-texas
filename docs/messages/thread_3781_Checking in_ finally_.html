<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="468571702-18092008">Beside being a retired soldier and hiker, I am also a 
nationally ranked shooter, and somewhat of a survivalist.  I cannot help 
it, military training in a tough qualification forced me to develop these 
skills.  The alternative wasn't pleasant.  </span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="468571702-18092008">Recently - because of some disaster training, we had a chat 
on-line about disaster preparedness.  My part was my "BUG-OUT" kit.  
This is a large closet I have filled with everything I would need if some 
disaster struck and we needed to "bug-out" quickly.  </span><span class="468571702-18092008">BUT - that very 
closet would also be useful if we needed to shelter in place were bugging out 
impossible or not warranted.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="468571702-18092008">Perhaps we could start a discussion on survival equipment 
here on the list.  I would be happy to present my BUG-OUT list to the 
group.  And who knows - there certainly will be things I missed.  It 
can only help me too.</span></div>

things settle a bit more.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="468571702-18092008">Somebody let me know if it is a good idea, or forget 
it.  And when to start.</span></div>
