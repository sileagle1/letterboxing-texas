                    <html><body><div>I took off work today specifically to make sure I could get a little letterboxing in while Lightning is out of school.  Given some of our nasty days lately, I couldn't have chosen a better day to be off!  It was positively beautiful, if not a little chilly.  The sky was so blue it hurt your eyes to look at it, and the sunlight practically shown yellow in the air.  The pine trees seemed taller and greener than they have been in a long, long time, and even the stripes on the road were dazzling.  I wanted to ride with the windows rolled down, but Lightning fussed about it being cold, so I rolled them all up, except a tiny crack at the top of mine so I could sniff the fresh air.  Freedom is grand. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My intention had been to head up toward Tatum for Blue Butterfly's flower series, and then on to Kilgore and New London, and maybe even on to Jefferson.  UNTIL - Dewberry mentioned to me that she was interested in JBK's Holiday Series.  Hmmm???  Holiday series?  I checked for new boxes and sure enough, there were new boxes in Cherokee County.  I quick downloaded the clues for those instead, apologized to Blue Butterfly because I was once again pre-empting her series in favor of this series that is - ahem - TEMPORARY (hint, hint to those coming in for the gathering).   And to make it better, it was centered around Maydelle, one of my favorite small towns in our county.  Maydelle, of course, is home to ID Fairchild State Forest - the largest state forest in Texas.  The place my family likes most of all to winter hike - it's close enough and accessible enough that we can get two or three miles in easily after work and before dark!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We decided, in light of our (my) New Year's Resolution to take my time and do a better logbook and to spend time writing in logbooks, that we would also approach this series in order, so we went to New Years first off the bat!  The location is still one of my faves in IDF and as we turned off the main road to make the approach, we saw a coyote running five or six deer!  It was thrilling to watch the excitement of the chase (call me morbid, but seeing the interdependence of species at work gives me goosebumps).  We got to the little pond we are well-acquainted with and retrieved the box, then sat for a few minutes enjoying the lack of sounds and the view and the chill of the air.  It was really nice!  And - that box was a first on many levels for us!   We were first finders, it was my first stamp of the new year in my new logbook, and best of all, it was Lightning's very first stamp in his first very own logbook.  Yep.  He gets his own logbook this year!  We've shared one all this time, but he's now had occasion to go out without me, and at Tomball he kept taking our logbook as he got exchanges and did a little boxing of his own, so that I would turn around and find I had no logbook!  It was time.  He's very proud.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We proceeded on through the series - after the forest location, we celebrated our way on to two cemeteries, a village without buildings, and a roadside park.  Nicely spaced out and well-selected, and I do believe JBK's carving is better than ever.  I'm thinking I may have to make sure to celebrate January 21st.  I think series must be her "thing" - and I just got word from the horse's mouth that February will be following January!  YEA!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I got home and logged our finds, and settled in to do other things that needed to be done, when what would you expect but I got an email from PurpleintexKim (okay, we gotta stop typing this - PTK) saying they were right behind us the whole way (neener, neener, neener), but what was worse is, she planted one too while they were hunting.  I sat on that information for a few minutes, finally went and retrieved my shoes and told my sick LSS that I was heading BACK to Maydelle!  He shook his head in disbelief (thankfully, part of him being sick is that he can't talk, or he would've had something to say about it!), but wasn't quick enough to stop me!  yep!  I got THAT one too, and I was FF on it too!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Good day all in all - 6 finds, all FF, a nice day spent in a nice little part of the countryside, good company (for all but the last - Lightning opted to stay and hang out with his buddy down the street), fun boxes, nice hides.

                    <html><body><div>Well, I am turning red here at my computer.  Thanks for all of the kind words.  I never really thought of myself doing series letterboxing, but it seems as though everytime an idea pops into my head, it always needs more than one stamp.  Right now a Disney series is waiting in limbo for the summer trip to Arizona that is planned.  Also a 100 acre woods series is waiting to find an appropriate home.  Oh well, as long as no one complains, the series will continue as the need arises.  Yes, the February series has already been started, and hopefully this year will be a celebration of holidays.  By the way, if anyone has any ideas for the 100 acre woods series, please let me know.</div> <div>jb<br/><br/><b><i>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</div> <blockquote><!-- Network content
