<br>
That's just rude. My GF has a premium membership & even she can't see the clues. How would you feel????  I have been geocaching over a year and I started out as a letterboxer but this just reinforces my feeling that at least in NM geocachers are more of a fun group and some of us are like family....that doesn't mean I won't try for the ones in El Paso or Mesilla or even Albuquerque if I happen to be there... but it sure makes me feel like some people think they are better than we are.....<br>
<br>
I was going to plant some storebought stamps but why should I? HE can go look for someone elses boxes. There's only a few of us here in town anyways. My geocaches are being found almost every day and I have 40 total plants. I think I'll stick to postals and geocaches. <br>

 brings us back to the AQ vs LBNA issue. I honestly only go on AQ for events, so if boxes are not posted to LBNA then I just will never know they are out there. I guess the same goes for anyone looking for my boxes, if you don't use LBNA you will ne!
 ver see them (but at least no restrictions are on them). <br/><br/>Also, when I began I got frustrated with Urban boxes, and vented on the talk list about them. I learned to be a more tolerant Bear (after gettimg my &amp;%*&amp;$&amp; chewed on), and found peace in not trying to find every box planted, so I look at clues and determine if it is a place I really want to go. <br/><br/>Can't say I like restrictions on boxes, but just means I will not be finding. <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com"></a><a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "sileagle1" &lt;sileagle@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; If it makes you feel any better, I can't see restricted clues on AQ either, even though I have been boxing for over 8 years. The reason is because I only use LBNA, so when clues link to AQ with restrictions it becomes a problem. I think placers do this to keep Newbies from looking for
 their boxes, but sometimes it is too restrictive. Try not to judge all of Letterboxing on this alone and try sending the placer an email to get the clues (if you want them).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Silver Eagle<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com"></a><a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Valerie" &lt;brebiz@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; One of my first letterboxing experiences was not very pleasant and I had a tiff with the planter.

I have restrictions on my series of 11 at EPCOT because of the high traffic in the park. I want others, who are fairly new to the sport to realize how much work goes into our boxes. I don't think 75 finds and 5 plants is a lot to ask. I almost think that's a newbee, lol maybe because I have well over 700 finds.  The other boxes at Disney i did not restrict because they are at hotels and not the parks. I check on one of my boxes in a high traffic area here in Austin and get upset to find it out in sight all the time uuuggg. I've  been out before and heard a family 40 feet away chanting out clues, "really shhh.".

Which brings us back to the AQ vs LBNA issue. I honestly only go on AQ for 
events, so if boxes are not posted to LBNA then I just will never know they are 
out there. I guess the same goes for anyone looking for my boxes, if you don't 
use LBNA you will never see them (but at least no restrictions are on them). 
<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Also, when I began I got frustrated with Urban boxes, and 
vented on the talk list about them. I learned to be a more tolerant Bear (after 
gettimg my &amp;%*&amp;$&amp; chewed on), and found peace in not trying to find 
every box planted, so I look at clues and determine if it is a place I really 
want to go. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Can't say I like restrictions on boxes, but just 
means I will not be finding. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com</a>,

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, I don't post here very much.  I still letterbox (had a wonderful outing with my friend the other day).  <br>
<br>
I don't think private tiffs should be aired on public boards.   We don't have the whole story and we really don't want to take sides.<br>
<br>
If you publicly offer clues, then you are saying that anyone is welcome to come find your boxes, even your "enemy" such as it is.  You can't say "everyone but person XYZ."  Being a planter can mean lots of things to different people--some people want as many finders as possible, some kind of want as few.<br>
<br>
If you choose to restrict your clues, you may do so either through website apps, making them word of mouth (people have been doing this since the beginning of letterboxing) or by being diabolically eeeevil (my choice of restriction).  Not every box is for every finder.<br>
<br>
For me, when I choose to find boxes, I like a good location, fun clues, and then a great stamp.  I won't find a storebought stamp unless there are other redeeming parts to the box (for me, based on my taste), and even then it'll be at the bottom of my list.  Luckily for planters of boxes with store bought stamps, some people will happily find them--for them it may be more about number of finds.  All this is good--different planters have different audiences for their boxes, if you will.  <br>
<br>
I don't care about numbers.  I think I'm somewhere way north of 1000 finds, but I lost interest in counting long ago. For me, it's more about the experience.   Some of my best times have been letterboxing, with my kids as they were tiny and as they've gotten bigger, with my wonderful friends, and even occasionally by myself.<br>
<br>
It's not the hobby for everyone, but it is one that I still love and enjoy.  I hope you find your own personal joy in it, or if letterboxing isn't for you, that you find that joy in something else, like geocaching.<br>
<br>
Best,<br>

Some of my best times have been letterboxing, with my kids as they were tiny and as they've gotten bigger, with my wonderful friends, and even occasionally by myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>&gt; It's not the hobby for everyone, but it is one that I still love and enjoy.  I hope you find your own personal joy in it, or if letterboxing isn't for you, that you find that joy in something else, like geocaching.<br/>

&gt;&gt; <br/>&gt;&gt; I was going to plant some storebought stamps but why should I? HE can go look for someone elses boxes. There's only a few of us here in town anyways. My geocaches are being found almost every day and I have 40 total plants. I think I'll stick to postals and geocaches. <br/>

thanks for letting me know that....i won't dwell on it anymore but it's an alphabetical series and it kinda sucks that we got part of it but now one letter is right in our backyard yet we can't get it. <br>
<br>
like collecting books in a series and missing a few of them...<br>
<br>
and at least with letterboxes you can plant anywhere without worrying about the 600 feet rule. i may get to carving again...just all my craft stuff is in boxes and needs to be organized.<br>
<br>
thx for all your feedback. <br>

<br>
Great to see the list being so robust.  I don't have much time for the chat lists here or on AQ at all, although folks could probably catch me on gulf coast boxers.   TALE has been a conflict for me for the last several years, and I don't see that changing.  I feel like I don't know a lot of the newer boxers at all.  But I'm always happy to see new boxes listed, because that holds great potential for adventure!<br>
<br>
Best to all my fellow Texas boxers and those honorary Texans and lurkers.<br>
