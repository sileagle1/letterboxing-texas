<div>I found Dragonfly Springs last weekend in the course of my box-checking.  I was very concerned about it because it had absolutely no cover and was sitting in the end of its hiding place, in plain view from 30 feet away (of course, I had already found it so I knew where it was supposed to be).  I tucked it back a little further and had planned to return with a couple rocks, but I had a feeling it wouldn't be long for this world because it seemed like they needed to do some maintenance in that area and it would certainly be discovered.

<div>I second that! They gave me a report on my boxes in Waxahatchie and one required a slight clue change due to a removed barbed wire fence. I so appreciate them taking the time to let me know so I can keep my clues up to date and won't have a bunch of frustrated boxers out there!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also heard from a new boxer this week that found one of my boxes exposed and she took the time to email me and let me know they tried to recover it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks to everyone who is taking a few minutes to email the placers with a report so we can keep our boxes safe for many future finders!!!!!</div>
