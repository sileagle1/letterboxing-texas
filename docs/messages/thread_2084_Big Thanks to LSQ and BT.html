<div>I found Dragonfly Springs last weekend in the course of my box-checking.  I was very concerned about it because it had absolutely no cover and was sitting in the end of its hiding place, in plain view from 30 feet away (of course, I had already found it so I knew where it was supposed to be).  I tucked it back a little further and had planned to return with a couple rocks, but I had a feeling it wouldn't be long for this world because it seemed like they needed to do some maintenance in that area and it would certainly be discovered.
