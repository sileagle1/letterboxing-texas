<div>Yesterday PuddleSplasher and I made a little circuit from Keller out west 
to Weatherford (getting that bus back on the road!) to the Greenwood Cemetery to 
visit Oliver Loving and Bose Ikard's graves,  and then looped south to 
Granbury looking for Kantexan's Legends of Granbury boxes.  Found John 
Wilkes Booth, but Jesse James seems to have departed this scene after all (but 
it was fascinating to read the inscription on his tombstone!).  Stopped in 
Acton at Elizabeth Crockett's monument in the cemetery there to look for Baby 
Bear's Davy Crockett, which I did find last year, but this year, lots of piled 
up brush around the rock wall with PI growing all over it sort of hampered our 
search and we came away empty-handed, but still, yet another fascinating 
historic cemetery (we seemed to be following a theme here!).  Then back 
toward Ft Worth with a stop in Benbrook to find the Memorial Oak - an amazing 
tree, which actually was the site last year of another letterbox, part of the 
Leather Caveman series which seems to have somehow disappeared from the earth 
and the websites, but a great location for a letterbox!  Going through Ft. 
Worth, made a quick stop in the Botanic Garden so I could stamp in PS's 
O'Keefe's Poppies - the only one I'd not stamped yet.  A good day, even if 
we didn't find all the boxes we went for, because the places were all great to 
explore!  And, oh yes, I did manage to place my Mozart's Magical Mystical 
Mystery Box, for which I'm still writing clues.  Very satisfying day, even 
in the heat!  </div></body></html>
