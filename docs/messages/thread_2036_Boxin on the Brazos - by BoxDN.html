                    <html><body><div>This is an "encore" post - for those of you who don't know who BoxDN is, he is a bigger than life sort of guy from New Orleans who brought a whole new element to the 2nd Annual Texas Letterboxing Gathering.  He made beignets the morning of the gathering and appointed his campsite to be the site of alien-earthling peace talks, even hosting the alien emissary in his own tent, with the hope of having abducted letterboxes returned to us upon successful completion of the talks.  Upon the disappearance of yet another box during the gathering, he rightly led the army of letterboxers in revolt against the emissary, who was either trampled in the melee or fled in fear for his life - although the rumors are rampant, facts in this matter are hard to come by.

<div>BoxDN posted this sitrep in the files section and I'm posting it here among messages and will delete the file from Files.  He is among our friends to the East who were displaced after Katrina.  Every now and then someone hears from him, and I just want to say "BoxDN, wherever you are, we miss you Man!"

<div>Boxin on the Brazos</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<p align="center"><span>
 </span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>My trip started on March 17 around 7:30 a.m.<span>  </span>The plan was to hook up with more LA boxers in Baton Rouge but they were running behind so I forged ahead blazing the trail.<span>
  </span>My first stop was in Lafayette to find Sliver Eagles Acadian Flag.<span>  </span>As I follow the clues I become too confident and begin skimming the clues and could never get back on track.
<span>  </span>Started over twice and just as I was going to give up I figure it out.<span>  </span>With the first box of the trip under my belt I roll on down the Highway scouting spots
<span>  </span>along the way for my series.<span>  </span>Knowing I didn't have the newest clues for Lake Charles I opt to pass them up for the next trip.<span>
  </span>I pull into the Texas Welcome Center to let the crew catch up and snag the Texas Welcome DrooP planted.<span>  </span>Just after stamping in our caboose shows up and I find out that the folks parked across from me are new boxers form Baton Rouge meeting up with the stragglers.
<span>  </span>I let them stamp in to keep the traffic down<span>  </span>and then re-hid the box.<span>  </span>We plan our route and what boxes were possible and caravan down the road.
<span>  </span>Stopping in Tyrell park we land Spindle Top by Silver Eagle, Myrtle Turtle by DrooP, and Secret Garden by DrooP ; this was a nice park and I enjoyed the Zen garden as well as the Secret Garden.
<span>  </span>We agree that getting to the Park by dark was priority one since one of the pop-ups didn't have brake lights.<span>  </span>After what felt like driving across Texas we make it to the park and it was dark.
<span>  </span>The ritual of setting up camp begins and this is where the story begins.</span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>I unpack the truck and begin setting up my tent just as I'm putting the finishing touches on my site I keep hearing a rustling sound.<span>  </span>Playing it off to the wind I head to the truck to get dinner out and start cooking.
<span>  </span>Sticking my head in the side door I come face to face with a 20 pound Raccoon helping himself to my food.<span>  </span>Instantly I remember never corner a coon so I dart around to the side he was on and begin screaming and beating on the glass to scare him away.
<span>  </span>He gets up with the loaf of bread and darts off dropping it just outside camp.<span>  </span>I proceed to check the rest of<span>
  </span>the food and find it all to be ok so I lock up the truck and make sure the Bandits can't take anymore food.<span>  </span>While eating at the host camp across the street our new neighbors shout over to us" Is that any of ya'lls campsite, the coons are in your ice chest ."
<span>  </span>I hit the lights and there's a coon sitting on one chest and<span>  </span>digging through the other.<span>  </span>I run over there to find he had dug the heart out of the lettuce and this time ran off with the cheese.
<span>   </span>We joke that the coon must be shopping for things to make a sandwich with.<span>  </span>As we sit around the fire telling stories the shadows begin to move.
<span>  </span>The masked barraters had brought in reinforcements and we were surrounded by the gang.<span>  </span>Trying to be stealthy they move in for any crumbs we may have dropped while eating; then came right up to our circle and nabbed a bag of snacks.
<span>   </span>Wanting to get a jump on the morning we turn in for the night.</span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>The next morning I find that the coons had ganged up on my ice chests again but they could not get anything out.<span>  </span>The bags were ripped and little coon paw prints all over everything.
<span>  </span>The morning campfire is started and the coffee dripping I sit plotting out our attack on the park.<span>  </span>After everyone had there coffee and Johnny cakes we pile in our transport vehicle and
<span>  </span>head out.<span>  </span>We find Don't feed the Aalligators by ,Hawk and notice someone up trail pacing around with a piece of paper in their hand.<span>
  </span>Figuring it was another boxer we rehide the and move on.<span>  </span>The next on the list was Brazos Bend by Silver Eagle.<span>  </span>We stamp in and admire the trees and wildlife using our nature books to determine different plant and bird species but the one none of us had to check was the huge gators every where.
<span>  </span>Heading out to the observatory tower we see rare birds and baby alligators.<span>  </span>Once out at the tower I realize I didn't have clues to that box and the next one was right were we came from.
<span>  </span>Heading back to the fork in the trail we plot the way to Hats and Boots, by DrooP.<span>  </span>The next box took us to the George Observatory to find Baby Bears Star Gazer where instead of stars we see a heard of deer in the middle of the day.
<span>  </span>Those walking back straps made us all hungry so go back to home base to eat lunch.<span>  </span>We find a note pinned to our door, from the Kissing Fishes inviting us over for wine that night and to exchange with Mr. Howdy.
<span>   </span>I make sandwiches with what was left from the raid the night before.<span>  </span>While relaxing I notice that the bread bag was moving and I hadn't had anything to drink yet.
<span>  </span>So I run over to find a squirrel had made his way into the bag but could not get out.<span>  </span>As I approach he rips out the side of the bag for his escape.
<span>  </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>Later that afternoon Lber's begin to file in their camp sites and we give the secret nod to let them know we are the LbLA.<span>  </span>As we meet our old friends for the first time we ask them to join us around the fire tonight, just bring a bundle of logs to burn.
<span>  </span>Bayou Grits, Fife and I ride our bikes to get tow more boxes before the sun set.<span>  </span>The first was Horse Shoe by DrooP, and the clues had to make me laugh cause it had steps for distance and we were on bikes.
<span>  </span>No biggie cause the tree it was hidden in was an obvious Lb tree.<span>  </span>We head on down the trail to find the Good Luck box by Gramatrick only to find a group of boxers already stamping in.
<span>  </span>We pass by as though we were Noxers figuring we would meet them tomorrow and besides I wanted to find the box and not have it passed to us.<span>  </span>
Finding the box is suppose to bring good luck and as you all know I need all the luck I can get.<span>  </span>As the sun set we ride back into camp and before we know it we have about 16 people gathered around and a low roar of exchanging boxing stories begins.
<span>  </span>I offer cups of Jamabalya to our guests along with Garlic sweet potatoes made by Bayou Grits.<span>  </span>The culture starved guests taste the offering brought to them from Louisiana, and Silver Eagle and I sit at the table sipping an Abita Amber.
<span>  </span>As the fire dwindled so did our guests but a few hung around not wanting the night to end.<span>   </span>My contribution to the stories was my trip to Georgia for the Haunted Hike and how neat it was to hunt boxes in the dark.
<span>  </span>Well of course I had to bring the excitement to the rest of the group so I suggest we go.<span>  </span>Clues and flashlights in hand we head out finding our first box in the dark just before midnight.
<span>  </span>I suggest everyone write the exact time and date they stamped in so everyone finding after us could see that we are either devoted or crazy.<span>  </span>
Six to Eight of us stamp in as the bell tolls midnight to the Taz box planted by, Baby Bear.<span>  </span>Heading down the trail we realize that the clues to the next box would have to be read backwards in order to keep from starting the trail all over.
<span>  </span>Finding the LA and Texas Letterboxing Rodeo Event box, by Birds of a Feather reminded me that I had to be up at the crack of dawn to make Beignets and coffee for 25 people.</span>
</p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>The sun breaks the horizon and the crows move in to pick at what the coons didn't find that night, which I'm sure isn't much.<span>  </span>The dew begins to drip off the rain fly and the coffee peculating adds to the morning orcastra.
<span>  </span>I notice a fellow Lber across the way, Hummerlady, with a 40 cup coffee pot and I run over to commandeer it.<span>  </span>Thanks to her no one had to wait for coffee that morning and the Beignets came out as the each guest arrives.
<span>  </span>Barefoot Lucy brings over her homemade flavoring for adults and her son Lightning helped add the powder sugar and pass them out.<span>  </span>Those attending the morning event were able to get some exchanges out the way and thanked us for being so hospitable as they headed over to the Pavilion.
<span>   </span>As I'm cleaning up the morning mess a Park police pulls in to my site across the way and starts pointing around and start to freak.<span>  </span>They make eye contact with me and ask me to come over to the truck.
<span>  </span>The driver introduces himself and asks who I was and if this was my camp site.<span>  </span>I sheepishly answer yes sir, is there a problem.<span>
  </span>See the campsites are only suppose to have 2 cars and up to eight people and we had maybe three times that much.<span>  </span>He tells me I had several violations and I needed to come to the ranger station with them.
<span>  </span>I ask if he could tell me what the violations were as the next Rick walks up.<span>  </span>As serious has he could be ha points over to my LSU flag flying proud and says I can't let you fly that
<span>  </span>in _his teams_<span>  </span>country.<span>  </span>I take my first breathe in minutes and says he was so wrong for that.<span>
  </span>We start laughing and I offer a them coffee and beignets as a bribe, but they decline.<span>  </span>Come to find out that n0wka that was staying in my site sent them over to rattle me, and rattle me they did.
<span>  </span></span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>I finally make it to the pavilion and head straight to the food, Gone Fishing of Baton Rouge brings Jambalya to serve with the Chili and I catch Silver Eagle and Baby Bear eating more of the Jambalya than the Chili they had cooked.
<span>  </span>The pavilion was in a stamping frenzy and I could here talk about the crazy LA crew that stamped in two boxes at midnight.<span>  </span>Slowly people started to realize that the guy wearing the Huge Green Bailey's Top hat was Boxdn the Nut and they began to ask for it.
<span>  </span>After eating I head over to the exchange table and lay my log down for stamping and I begin making my rounds to each book.<span>  </span>Just before I could get the Traveling event stamps the announcement came that the Clue game was starting.
<span>  </span>Celticlions sponsored the TX clue game where everything had a western theme and everyone a chance to meet face to face.<span>  </span>While standing there a look next to me and low a behold it was Wanda
<span>  </span>from Rhode Island.<span>  </span>I stopped listening to the instructions for the game and turned to her and introduced myself.<span>
  </span>We both start talking and<span>  </span>almost missed the game.<span>   </span>Each able boxer got a stamp and three were withheld and the game began.<span>
  </span>Some went to find the ones on the trail first while others asked each person for the clue, it was madness .<span>  </span>Some opted to walk around and some sat in one spot and let people come to them.
<span>  </span>As some of us thought we had all the exchange clues we headed out to find the hidden clues.<span>  </span>He I am running through the park with a big green top hat looking for Tupperware in hidey holes, on lookers must have thought I was the Mad Hatter.
<span>  </span>I walk up on a fellow boxer who was just finishing stamping in so I don't finish reading the clues I just take it and to see what it is and find the next clue.<span>
  </span>Well I guess were it was suppose to be and was wrong, causing lots of boxers to think it was missing. (sorry my bad)<span>  </span>Some were able to find but they put it back where I mistakenly hid it.
<span>  </span>Back to the pavilion to give the secret pass word and get my next clue.<span>  </span>Passing the boxers that headed out first, they said the next one was already missing.
<span>  </span>"Yea right I'm not falling for that trick" I think to myself;<span>  </span>once at the spot<span>  </span>it was clear that it was gone.
<span>   </span>Feeling the game was over I go back to the pavilion to find out what to do.<span>  </span>As I walk up Krom is turning in his guess and became the first winner of the Western Clue, winning his choice of Clue prizes.
<span>  </span>I decide to go through my list and guess at the solution instead of finding the box across the park to be sure.<span>  </span>I wind up being<span>
  </span>the fifth winner right behind Wanda and picked the Clue puzzle.<span>  </span>After all the prizes were given out the stamps were collected and laid out so those who needed to re-stamp the images could.
<span>  </span>The Pavilion started to empty out as the day visitors began to head home.<span>  </span>I ask Silver Eagle when was the group picture?<span>
  </span>We stopped everyone that was still there to group up for the group picture and still had a time getting everyone in the shot.<span>  </span>I chatted with Wanda for awhile and she showed me the boxes of mine that she had found on her way in to Texas an I was speechless seeing almost everyone of my stamps in her log; she is a boxing machine.
<span>  </span>I invite her to come over to the campsite after she does some boxing to mingle around the fire and point her to the trail head with near by boxes and she was off.<span>
   </span>As we<span>  </span>police the area of the pavilion we talk about the great celebrity we just got to meet and think of questions to ask her around the fire.<span>
  </span></span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>Back at our campsites I decide to strike my campsite with the news of bad weather coming around midnight.<span>  </span>Figuring I'd rather sleep in my truck then not sleeping in the storm blown tent and having to take down the next morning soaking wet.
<span>  </span>A few drizzles fall around 8 pm and then the stars came out and the half moon lit the sky.<span>  </span>Some got in their cars to see if the observatory would open and others talked about going night boxing again.
<span>  </span>Wanda showed up and we let her in on our plans and she says great but I don't see well in the dark. <span> </span>We tell her neither do we that's why we'll be using flashlights.
<span>  </span>After a good laugh we begin to walk through the campsites looking for Mr. Howdy the Kissing Fishes PT.<span>  </span>After tip toeing into their camp site we wake up the Sheriff and get him to exchange stamps with us across the street.
<span>  </span>It was like a bunch of school kids going to sneak a friend out his house, we were all sshhh'n each other and laughing.<span>  </span>On our way back the sky filled with lightning the wind picked up and got nasty but some of us weren't done.
<span>  </span>Hummerlady grabs her keys and Wanda and I jump in the van to try for a few more before the down pour.<span>  </span>Pulling as close to Horse shoe we could we run to stamp in and go for Good luck box cause we were going to need it.
<span>  </span>Just after rehiding good luck box a light rain started but nothing real bad.<span>  </span>Just two more boxes and Wanda ties her all time count in one day then we'll turn in.
<span>  </span>Off to were we knew several were close together but the rain started picking up and we reluctinicly went for it.<span>  </span>After parking we dawn our umbrellas and head out into the woods to get ironically Don't Feed the Aalligator's.
<span>  </span>Making a shelter out of our body's and umbrellas we carefully stamp and rehide as to not get any thing wet in the down pour.<span>  </span>Walking back to the van a set of head lights approaches us in the parking lot, I tell my fellow boxers don't worry I'm use to this.
<span>  </span>I tell them if anyone asks what we are doing<span>  </span>out here tell them I'm looking for my wallet and I wasn't going to sleep till I found it.<span>
  </span>Sure enough it was the Park Police not ranger and I walked up to the truck to see it was my buddy from the camp violations prank.<span>  </span>I tell him that I lost my wallet and had to find since I was leaving early that morning.
<span>  </span>He asks if I found it and said yes and then told us to get back to camp before we get hurt.<span>  </span>He follows us back to make sure we went back safely and file into our shelter for the night. 
</span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>The storm got real bad and some didn't fare well but thankfully no one was hurt.<span>  </span>I make my rounds and pack up the last few things before saying my thanks and goodbyes.<span>
  </span>As we watched Silver Eagle and Baby Bear help plot Wanda's clues Hummerlady comes by to tell us the whole story about the park police last night.<span>  </span>They went to make rounds before the storm and saw the van at the trail head.
<span>  </span>Worried something was wrong they went and check what campsite the van was registered to and went knocking at the door.<span>  </span>Hummerlady's husband<span>
  </span>opened the door and the Ranger asked what the deal was and he said My wife is in it.<span>  </span>The Ranger replied "Well I hope she has enough sense not to be out on the trails".<span>
  </span>Well I guess the tree of us combined didn't have enough because we were.<span>  </span>When the Ranger went back to were he saw the van it was gone so he went looking for us and found us by the front gate.
<span>  </span>We all laughed about the double crazy night boxing adventure and Wanda informs us that after recounting she did in fact tie her all time count and though it got dangerous at the end I was glad to have been there.
<span>  </span>Passing through the park on my way out saying my good byes the debris everywhere showed just how bad the storm had gotten that night.<span>  </span>The way home I made a beeline for home drained from the weekend and still having to rendezvous some visiting Lb'rs from Washington, in the French Quarter.
</span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span><span>                
</span>I was glad to have been able to attend and bring some LA esscents to the event.<span>  </span>Thanks to all that made it such a memorable event.</span></p>

<div>Thanks for posting that wonderful story again, Lucy!  Boy, I'd have 
loved to have been there and met BoxDN.  Just reading all about those 
adventures after that first event made me really determined not to miss the next 
one, and sorry that BoxDN sort of left us.  Maybe the Beignet-Eating Aliens 
got to him, too, do you think?  He must be one of a kind! -
