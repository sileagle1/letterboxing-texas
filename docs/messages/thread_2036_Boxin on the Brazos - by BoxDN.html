                    <html><body><div>This is an "encore" post - for those of you who don't know who BoxDN is, he is a bigger than life sort of guy from New Orleans who brought a whole new element to the 2nd Annual Texas Letterboxing Gathering.  He made beignets the morning of the gathering and appointed his campsite to be the site of alien-earthling peace talks, even hosting the alien emissary in his own tent, with the hope of having abducted letterboxes returned to us upon successful completion of the talks.  Upon the disappearance of yet another box during the gathering, he rightly led the army of letterboxers in revolt against the emissary, who was either trampled in the melee or fled in fear for his life - although the rumors are rampant, facts in this matter are hard to come by.

<div>BoxDN posted this sitrep in the files section and I'm posting it here among messages and will delete the file from Files.  He is among our friends to the East who were displaced after Katrina.  Every now and then someone hears from him, and I just want to say "BoxDN, wherever you are, we miss you Man!"

</span>My trip started on March 17 around 7:30 a.m.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The plan was to hook up with more LA boxers in Baton Rouge but they were running behind so I forged ahead blazing the trail.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>My first stop was in Lafayette to find Sliver Eagles Acadian Flag.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I follow the clues I become too confident and begin skimming the clues and could never get back on track.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Started over twice and just as I was going to give up I figure it out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>With the first box of the trip under my belt I roll on down the Highway scouting spots
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>along the way for my series.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Knowing I didn't have the newest clues for Lake Charles I opt to pass them up for the next trip.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>I pull into the Texas Welcome Center to let the crew catch up and snag the Texas Welcome DrooP planted.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just after stamping in our caboose shows up and I find out that the folks parked across from me are new boxers form Baton Rouge meeting up with the stragglers.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I let them stamp in to keep the traffic down<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>and then re-hid the box.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We plan our route and what boxes were possible and caravan down the road.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Stopping in Tyrell park we land Spindle Top by Silver Eagle, Myrtle Turtle by DrooP, and Secret Garden by DrooP ; this was a nice park and I enjoyed the Zen garden as well as the Secret Garden.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We agree that getting to the Park by dark was priority one since one of the pop-ups didn't have brake lights.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After what felt like driving across Texas we make it to the park and it was dark.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The ritual of setting up camp begins and this is where the story begins.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-font-kerning: 14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">                
</span>I unpack the truck and begin setting up my tent just as I'm putting the finishing touches on my site I keep hearing a rustling sound.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Playing it off to the wind I head to the truck to get dinner out and start cooking.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Sticking my head in the side door I come face to face with a 20 pound Raccoon helping himself to my food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Instantly I remember never corner a coon so I dart around to the side he was on and begin screaming and beating on the glass to scare him away.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He gets up with the loaf of bread and darts off dropping it just outside camp.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I proceed to check the rest of<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>the food and find it all to be ok so I lock up the truck and make sure the Bandits can't take anymore food.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While eating at the host camp across the street our new neighbors shout over to us" Is that any of ya'lls campsite, the coons are in your ice chest ."
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I hit the lights and there's a coon sitting on one chest and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>digging through the other.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I run over there to find he had dug the heart out of the lettuce and this time ran off with the cheese.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>We joke that the coon must be shopping for things to make a sandwich with.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we sit around the fire telling stories the shadows begin to move.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The masked barraters had brought in reinforcements and we were surrounded by the gang.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Trying to be stealthy they move in for any crumbs we may have dropped while eating; then came right up to our circle and nabbed a bag of snacks.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Wanting to get a jump on the morning we turn in for the night.</font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-font-kerning: 14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">                
</span>The next morning I find that the coons had ganged up on my ice chests again but they could not get anything out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The bags were ripped and little coon paw prints all over everything.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The morning campfire is started and the coffee dripping I sit plotting out our attack on the park.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After everyone had there coffee and Johnny cakes we pile in our transport vehicle and
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>head out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We find Don't feed the Aalligators by ,Hawk and notice someone up trail pacing around with a piece of paper in their hand.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>Figuring it was another boxer we rehide the and move on.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next on the list was Brazos Bend by Silver Eagle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We stamp in and admire the trees and wildlife using our nature books to determine different plant and bird species but the one none of us had to check was the huge gators every where.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heading out to the observatory tower we see rare birds and baby alligators.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Once out at the tower I realize I didn't have clues to that box and the next one was right were we came from.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heading back to the fork in the trail we plot the way to Hats and Boots, by DrooP.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The next box took us to the George Observatory to find Baby Bears Star Gazer where instead of stars we see a heard of deer in the middle of the day.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those walking back straps made us all hungry so go back to home base to eat lunch.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We find a note pinned to our door, from the Kissing Fishes inviting us over for wine that night and to exchange with Mr. Howdy.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>I make sandwiches with what was left from the raid the night before.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While relaxing I notice that the bread bag was moving and I hadn't had anything to drink yet.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>So I run over to find a squirrel had made his way into the bag but could not get out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I approach he rips out the side of the bag for his escape.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt; mso-pagination: none; mso-layout-grid-align: none"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; mso-font-kerning: 14.0pt"><font face="Times New Roman"><span style="mso-tab-count: 1">                
</span>Later that afternoon Lber's begin to file in their camp sites and we give the secret nod to let them know we are the LbLA.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As we meet our old friends for the first time we ask them to join us around the fire tonight, just bring a bundle of logs to burn.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Bayou Grits, Fife and I ride our bikes to get tow more boxes before the sun set.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The first was Horse Shoe by DrooP, and the clues had to make me laugh cause it had steps for distance and we were on bikes.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>No biggie cause the tree it was hidden in was an obvious Lb tree.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We head on down the trail to find the Good Luck box by Gramatrick only to find a group of boxers already stamping in.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>We pass by as though we were Noxers figuring we would meet them tomorrow and besides I wanted to find the box and not have it passed to us.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>
Finding the box is suppose to bring good luck and as you all know I need all the luck I can get.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the sun set we ride back into camp and before we know it we have about 16 people gathered around and a low roar of exchanging boxing stories begins.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I offer cups of Jamabalya to our guests along with Garlic sweet potatoes made by Bayou Grits.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The culture starved guests taste the offering brought to them from Louisiana, and Silver Eagle and I sit at the table sipping an Abita Amber.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As the fire dwindled so did our guests but a few hung around not wanting the night to end.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>My contribution to the stories was my trip to Georgia for the Haunted Hike and how neat it was to hunt boxes in the dark.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Well of course I had to bring the excitement to the rest of the group so I suggest we go.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Clues and flashlights in hand we head out finding our first box in the dark just before midnight.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I suggest everyone write the exact time and date they stamped in so everyone finding after us could see that we are either devoted or crazy.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>
Six to Eight of us stamp in as the bell tolls midnight to the Taz box planted by, Baby Bear.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Heading down the trail we realize that the clues to the next box would have to be read backwards in order to keep from starting the trail all over.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Finding the LA and Texas Letterboxing Rodeo Event box, by Birds of a Feather reminded me that I had to be up at the crack of dawn to make Beignets and coffee for 25 people.</font></span>

</span>The sun breaks the horizon and the crows move in to pick at what the coons didn't find that night, which I'm sure isn't much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The dew begins to drip off the rain fly and the coffee peculating adds to the morning orcastra.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I notice a fellow Lber across the way, Hummerlady, with a 40 cup coffee pot and I run over to commandeer it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thanks to her no one had to wait for coffee that morning and the Beignets came out as the each guest arrives.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Barefoot Lucy brings over her homemade flavoring for adults and her son Lightning helped add the powder sugar and pass them out.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Those attending the morning event were able to get some exchanges out the way and thanked us for being so hospitable as they headed over to the Pavilion.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>As I'm cleaning up the morning mess a Park police pulls in to my site across the way and starts pointing around and start to freak.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They make eye contact with me and ask me to come over to the truck.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The driver introduces himself and asks who I was and if this was my camp site.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I sheepishly answer yes sir, is there a problem.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>See the campsites are only suppose to have 2 cars and up to eight people and we had maybe three times that much.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He tells me I had several violations and I needed to come to the ranger station with them.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I ask if he could tell me what the violations were as the next Rick walks up.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As serious has he could be ha points over to my LSU flag flying proud and says I can't let you fly that
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>in _his teams_<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>country.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I take my first breathe in minutes and says he was so wrong for that.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>We start laughing and I offer a them coffee and beignets as a bribe, but they decline.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Come to find out that n0wka that was staying in my site sent them over to rattle me, and rattle me they did.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></span></p>

</span>I finally make it to the pavilion and head straight to the food, Gone Fishing of Baton Rouge brings Jambalya to serve with the Chili and I catch Silver Eagle and Baby Bear eating more of the Jambalya than the Chili they had cooked.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The pavilion was in a stamping frenzy and I could here talk about the crazy LA crew that stamped in two boxes at midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Slowly people started to realize that the guy wearing the Huge Green Bailey's Top hat was Boxdn the Nut and they began to ask for it.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After eating I head over to the exchange table and lay my log down for stamping and I begin making my rounds to each book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just before I could get the Traveling event stamps the announcement came that the Clue game was starting.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Celticlions sponsored the TX clue game where everything had a western theme and everyone a chance to meet face to face.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>While standing there a look next to me and low a behold it was Wanda
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>from Rhode Island.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I stopped listening to the instructions for the game and turned to her and introduced myself.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>We both start talking and<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>almost missed the game.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Each able boxer got a stamp and three were withheld and the game began.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>Some went to find the ones on the trail first while others asked each person for the clue, it was madness .<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some opted to walk around and some sat in one spot and let people come to them.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As some of us thought we had all the exchange clues we headed out to find the hidden clues.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He I am running through the park with a big green top hat looking for Tupperware in hidey holes, on lookers must have thought I was the Mad Hatter.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I walk up on a fellow boxer who was just finishing stamping in so I don't finish reading the clues I just take it and to see what it is and find the next clue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>Well I guess were it was suppose to be and was wrong, causing lots of boxers to think it was missing. (sorry my bad)<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some were able to find but they put it back where I mistakenly hid it.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Back to the pavilion to give the secret pass word and get my next clue.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Passing the boxers that headed out first, they said the next one was already missing.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>"Yea right I'm not falling for that trick" I think to myself;<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>once at the spot<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>it was clear that it was gone.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">   </span>Feeling the game was over I go back to the pavilion to find out what to do.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>As I walk up Krom is turning in his guess and became the first winner of the Western Clue, winning his choice of Clue prizes.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I decide to go through my list and guess at the solution instead of finding the box across the park to be sure.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I wind up being<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>the fifth winner right behind Wanda and picked the Clue puzzle.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After all the prizes were given out the stamps were collected and laid out so those who needed to re-stamp the images could.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Pavilion started to empty out as the day visitors began to head home.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I ask Silver Eagle when was the group picture?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>We stopped everyone that was still there to group up for the group picture and still had a time getting everyone in the shot.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I chatted with Wanda for awhile and she showed me the boxes of mine that she had found on her way in to Texas an I was speechless seeing almost everyone of my stamps in her log; she is a boxing machine.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I invite her to come over to the campsite after she does some boxing to mingle around the fire and point her to the trail head with near by boxes and she was off.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
   </span>As we<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>police the area of the pavilion we talk about the great celebrity we just got to meet and think of questions to ask her around the fire.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

</span>Back at our campsites I decide to strike my campsite with the news of bad weather coming around midnight.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Figuring I'd rather sleep in my truck then not sleeping in the storm blown tent and having to take down the next morning soaking wet.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>A few drizzles fall around 8 pm and then the stars came out and the half moon lit the sky.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Some got in their cars to see if the observatory would open and others talked about going night boxing again.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Wanda showed up and we let her in on our plans and she says great but I don't see well in the dark. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span>We tell her neither do we that's why we'll be using flashlights.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After a good laugh we begin to walk through the campsites looking for Mr. Howdy the Kissing Fishes PT.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After tip toeing into their camp site we wake up the Sheriff and get him to exchange stamps with us across the street.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was like a bunch of school kids going to sneak a friend out his house, we were all sshhh'n each other and laughing.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>On our way back the sky filled with lightning the wind picked up and got nasty but some of us weren't done.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hummerlady grabs her keys and Wanda and I jump in the van to try for a few more before the down pour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Pulling as close to Horse shoe we could we run to stamp in and go for Good luck box cause we were going to need it.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just after rehiding good luck box a light rain started but nothing real bad.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Just two more boxes and Wanda ties her all time count in one day then we'll turn in.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Off to were we knew several were close together but the rain started picking up and we reluctinicly went for it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After parking we dawn our umbrellas and head out into the woods to get ironically Don't Feed the Aalligator's.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Making a shelter out of our body's and umbrellas we carefully stamp and rehide as to not get any thing wet in the down pour.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Walking back to the van a set of head lights approaches us in the parking lot, I tell my fellow boxers don't worry I'm use to this.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I tell them if anyone asks what we are doing<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>out here tell them I'm looking for my wallet and I wasn't going to sleep till I found it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>Sure enough it was the Park Police not ranger and I walked up to the truck to see it was my buddy from the camp violations prank.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I tell him that I lost my wallet and had to find since I was leaving early that morning.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He asks if I found it and said yes and then told us to get back to camp before we get hurt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He follows us back to make sure we went back safely and file into our shelter for the night. 
</font></span></p>

</span>The storm got real bad and some didn't fare well but thankfully no one was hurt.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I make my rounds and pack up the last few things before saying my thanks and goodbyes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>As we watched Silver Eagle and Baby Bear help plot Wanda's clues Hummerlady comes by to tell us the whole story about the park police last night.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They went to make rounds before the storm and saw the van at the trail head.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Worried something was wrong they went and check what campsite the van was registered to and went knocking at the door.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Hummerlady's husband<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>opened the door and the Ranger asked what the deal was and he said My wife is in it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The Ranger replied "Well I hope she has enough sense not to be out on the trails".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">

<div>Thanks for posting that wonderful story again, Lucy!  Boy, I'd have 
loved to have been there and met BoxDN.  Just reading all about those 
adventures after that first event made me really determined not to miss the next 
one, and sorry that BoxDN sort of left us.  Maybe the Beignet-Eating Aliens 
got to him, too, do you think?  He must be one of a kind! -
