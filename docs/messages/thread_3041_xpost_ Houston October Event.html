There's not a reservable covered pavilion at Memorial Park, but there<br/>
are plenty of picnic tables--I'll try to figure out an exact location<br/>
a bit closer.  And it's centrally located, with lots of existing boxes<br/>
there and nearby, with a great playground for the little kids.<br/>
<br/>
This is meant to be casual.  Not too many planned activities, but as<br/>
always you should keep alert.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I should add, it would be helpful to us if you will RSVP so we make<br/>
sure we have enough clue sheets.  <br/>
<br/>
There will be a special box with clues available only for those who<br/>
have hidden a box for the gathering.  We won't be hiding others' boxes<br/>
this time.  I really liked the loops and walks we did for the GBA, but<br/>
I don't think that any of us will have that amount of free time<br/>
available leading up to this gathering.<br/>
<br/>
If you need information on nearby hotels, let me know.  There are<br/>
oodles in all price ranges in the very close-by Galleria area.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to claim a specific character, place or OZ-related-thing<br/>
to carve, let me or Mother of Five know &amp; we'll update the AQ event<br/>
page so that others will know there's already a box on that idea.  All<br/>
the books and movies and anything OZ is welcome.<br/>
<br/>
That's all for now...<br/>
