                    <div class="plaintext-content">Does anyone have any experience with letterboxing in Italy?  Our <br>
daughter and her family are living there courtesy the U. S. Navy and <br>
we're going to visit them for Thanksgiving.  We'd like to plant a <br>
letterbox or two while we're there but don't know if that is <br>
acceptable or if there are any boxes there to find.  Just curious.<br>
