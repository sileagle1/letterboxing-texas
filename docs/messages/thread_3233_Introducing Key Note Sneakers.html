<br>
I don't have the time at the moment to give you the corrections - as I am attempting to pack and get on the road to make it hone for Christmas.  If I left now it would be dark when we get home.  And we still have a last dog breeding session to do.<br>
<br>
But just let me say your assumptions about GPS equipment is pretty far off.  I will elaborate from home - whenever we get there.<br>
<br>
Here's hoping the roads througn 1/2 of Oklahoma and most of Texas is clear and free of traffic.  El Paso in the windshield is sure gunna look good.  <br>
<br>
Merry Christmas Y-all.<br>
