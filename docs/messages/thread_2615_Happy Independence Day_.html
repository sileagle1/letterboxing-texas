We will probably stop by on Sunday.   If anyone is camping at Lake <br>
Somerville, we will be there tonight and tomorrow night, near the <br>

March 2: General Interest<br>
1836 : TEXAS INDEPENDENCE PROCLAIMED:<br>
<br>
During the Texas Revolution, a convention of American Texans meets at<br>
Washington-on-the-Brazos and declares the independence of Texas from<br>
Mexico. The delegates chose David Burnet as provisional president and<br>
confirmed Sam Houston as the commander in chief of all Texan forces.<br>
The Texans also adopted a constitution that protected the free<br>
practice of slavery, which had been prohibited by Mexican law.<br>
Meanwhile, in San Antonio, Mexican General Antonio Lopez de Santa<br>
Anna's siege of the Alamo continued, and the fort's 185 or so American<br>
defenders waited for the final Mexican assault.<br>
<br>
In 1820, Moses Austin, a U.S. citizen, asked the Spanish government in<br>
Mexico for permission to settle in sparsely populated Texas. Land was<br>
granted, but Austin died soon thereafter, so his son, Stephen F.<br>
Austin, took over the project. In 1821, Mexico gained independence<br>
from Spain, and Austin negotiated a contract with the new Mexican<br>
government that allowed him to lead some 300 families to the Brazos<br>
River. Under the terms of the agreement, the settlers were to be<br>
Catholics, but Austin mainly brought Protestants from the southern<br>
United States. Other U.S. settlers arrived in succeeding years, and<br>
the Americans soon outnumbered the resident Mexicans. In 1826, a<br>
conflict between Mexican and American settlers led to the Freedonia<br>
Rebellion, and in 1830 the Mexican government took measures to stop<br>
the influx of Americans. In 1833, Austin, who sought statehood for<br>
Texas in the Mexican federation, was imprisoned after calling on<br>
settlers to declare it without the consent of the Mexican congress. He<br>
was released in 1835.<br>
<br>
In 1834, Santa Anna, a soldier and politician, became dictator of<br>
Mexico and sought to crush rebellions in Texas and other areas. In<br>
October 1835, Anglo residents of Gonzales, 50 miles east of San<br>
Antonio, responded to Santa Anna's demand that they return a cannon<br>
loaned for defense against Indian attack by discharging it against the<br>
Mexican troops sent to reclaim it. The Mexicans were routed in what is<br>
regarded as the first battle of the Texas Revolution. The American<br>
settlers set up a provisional state government, and a Texan army under<br>
Sam Houston won a series of minor battles in the fall of 1835.<br>
<br>
In December, Texas volunteers commanded by Ben Milam drove Mexican<br>
troops out of San Antonio and settled in around the Alamo, a mission<br>
compound adapted to military purposes around 1800. In January 1836,<br>
Santa Anna concentrated a force of several thousand men south of the<br>
Rio Grande, and Sam Houston ordered the Alamo abandoned. Colonel James<br>
Bowie, who arrived at the Alamo on January 19, realized that the<br>
fort's captured cannons could not be removed before Santa Anna's<br>
arrival, so he remained entrenched with his men. By delaying Santa<br>
Anna's forces, he also reasoned, Houston would have more time to raise<br>
an army large enough to repulse the Mexicans. On February 2, Bowie and<br>
his 30 or so men were joined by a small cavalry company under Colonel<br>
William Travis, bringing the total number of Alamo defenders to about<br>
140. One week later, the frontiersman Davy Crockett arrived in command<br>
of 14 Tennessee Mounted Volunteers.<br>
<br>
On February 23, Santa Anna and some 3,000 Mexican troops besieged the<br>
Alamo, and the former mission was bombarded with cannon and rifle fire<br>
for 12 days. On February 24, in the chaos of the siege, Colonel Travis<br>
smuggled out a letter that read: "To the People of Texas and All<br>
Americans in the World.... I shall never surrender or retreat....<br>
Victory or Death!" On March 1, the last Texan reinforcements from<br>
nearby Gonzales broke through the enemy's lines and into the Alamo,<br>
bringing the total defenders to approximately 185. On March 2, Texas'<br>
revolutionary government formally declared its independence from<br>
Mexico.<br>
<br>
In the early morning of March 6, Santa Anna ordered his troops to<br>
storm the Alamo. Travis' artillery decimated the first and then the<br>
second Mexican charge, but in just over an hour the Texans were<br>
overwhelmed, and the Alamo was taken. Santa Anna had ordered that no<br>
prisoners be taken, and all the Texan and American defenders were<br>
killed in brutal hand-to-hand fighting. The only survivors of the<br>
Alamo were a handful of civilians, mostly women and children. Several<br>
hundred of Santa Anna's men died during the siege and storming of the<br>
Alamo.<br>
<br>
Six weeks later, a large Texan army under Sam Houston surprised Santa<br>
Anna's army at San Jacinto. Shouting "Remember the Alamo!" the Texans<br>
defeated the Mexicans and captured Santa Anna. The Mexican dictator<br>
was forced to recognize Texas' independence and withdrew his forces<br>
south of the Ro Grande.<br>
<br>
Texas sought annexation by the United States, but both Mexico and<br>
antislavery forces in the United States opposed its admission into the<br>
Union. For nearly a decade, Texas existed as an independent republic,<br>
and Houston was Texas' first elected president. In 1845, Texas joined<br>
the Union as the 28th state, leading to the outbreak of the<br>
Mexican-American War.<br>
