regarding Oregon (in case he doesn't lurk here as well):<br>
<br>
"All it takes is a group consensus to change the regions. You live <br>
there, so you probably have a lot better idea than I what's going <br>
on."<br>
<br>
and<br>
<br>
"It's not hard to reorganize counties into new regions.<br>
I'll send the Excel sheet to whoever wants it. All you need to do is <br>
fill in the region for each county, I put it in the database, and <br>
everything re-assigns itself."<br>
<br>
I assume the same thing would apply to Texas. <br>
