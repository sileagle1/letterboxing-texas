                    <div class="plaintext-content">To my amazement, we have already received orders for 30 patches, so ordering<br>
100 patches will not be as much of a stretch as I thought!<br>
TIME: I am corresponding right now with two companies, both of whom say they<br>
can turn the finalized order around in 14 days.<br>
SIZE: One company recommends enlarging the patch from 2 inches to 2 1/2<br>
inches, so the lettering will be clearer. <br>
EMBROIDERY: Both companies state we need to use at least 75 % embroidery<br>
(rather than the 50% I first received quotes on). But in checking archives,<br>
I see that Lucy may have been pursuing 100% embroidered patches. This means<br>
that everything, including the orange background would be embroidery. <br>
BACKING: I'm thinking about dropping the option of self-stick backing, since<br>
the patches don't really self-stick permanently, and those of us who have<br>
done scouting remember that it doesn't take a whole lot of skill to sew on a<br>
patch!<br>
<br>
Bottom line: if anyone has strong opinions on any of the above decisions<br>
about the patches, please email me offlist at:<br>
celticlions@comcast.net<br>
<br>
Otherwise, I'm going to just try to figure out an acceptable patch for well<br>
under $2.00 apiece and get them ordered!!! <br>
BTW I think these will sell like the proverbial hotcakes if I bring them to<br>
our barn-raising, so if you want to reserve patches, please send me an order<br>
now offlist.<br>
Thanks!<br>

patches: <br>
If you would like to order patches, please be aware that I'm not carrying<br>
forward any orders placed from previous posts to Lucy or on this group<br>
forum. The last time we had a discussion about patches was around January,<br>
so I don't want to assume that you guys are still interested in the same<br>
numbers eight months later!<br>
<br>
That means if you want patches, please write to me offlist now with your<br>
trailname, real name, address & number of patches.<br>
<br>
Thank you!<br>

<div>It all sounds ok to me. I think it's smart to not go with the stick on backing. That stuff never lasts. </div>
