I was SO close, but still couldn't attend. I live in Amarillo, but <br/>
was in San Antonio that weekend. I'd thought about driving over for <br/>
the 3-4 hrs, but by that weekend, I'd already been out driving about <br/>
1600 miles for spring break! I left Amarillo, cut through DFW to <br/>
Shreveport, then down to near New Orleans. Then we'd gone from there <br/>
through Houston to San Antonio- so we were actually in Sealy (near <br/>
Houston) on Thursday night before the Event!<br/>
<br/>
It's sad to know that I was SO close to the event, but couldn't <br/>
attend. :-( But I did have fun on Saturday in San Antonio- when I <br/>
went geocaching with a friend of mine. I introduced him to <br/>
letterboxing the last time I visited, and then this time it was <br/>
geocaching, but I'm still not sure if he's interested enough to sign <br/>
up himself. But at least he's interested enough to keep going out <br/>
for the bushwhacking adventures with me!<br/>
<br/>
I bet all the stamps were great to look at. That's always the most <br/>
fascinating part of finding a box- to flip through the log and <br/>
seeing all the various stamps! Glad everyone had such a great time, <br/>
despite the storm! I'll be looking forward to seeing what is planned <br/>
for the next one- hopefully things will work out for us to make that <br/>
one!<br/>
