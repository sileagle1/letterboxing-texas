<p>Well, Silver Eagle, being the younger sibling, I've always had Baby Bear's back. However, it doesn't seem fair that the competition ended with a "stroke of luck", so we may have to revisit this competition at Tale 11. Hmmmmm...... let the games begin.... again. Anyone have any ideas? Puddle Splasher</p>

</p><p>When you watch the video and see Baby Bear win a raffle prize, listen for the video person saying "Well, I guess he showed you up Silver Eagle".  There is a story behind that (of course).  <br/></p>

<p style="FONT-SIZE: 13px; FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-STYLE: normal; BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent">It all started when we went to try archery on Saturday.  Baby Bear went first and showed he had a natural talent by hitting a bull, but I couldn't quite get one.  Of course that sparked my competitive nature so I asked if we could try again.  Now Baby Bear hits two bulls and once again I don't get any, so now I'm really mad at myself (in the video it looks like Baby Bear hit several bulls, but that was staged).  I felt a little better when one of the archery instructors did not even do as well as Baby Bear and was convinced he had done archery before, but it still hurt to be outdone by my baby brother.  So I issued a challenge to continue the competition on the rock wall.  The video guy asked if he could come, so we met at the gym to climb the wall.  We both did the easy climb first to get warmed up, then skipped the moderate climb to go straight to the difficult one.  Baby Bear didn't make it to the top, but with great effort fueled by big brother ego and a "leap of faith" to get past a difficult part of the wall (you can see it on the video), I made it.  Score tied 1-1.  The video guy asked what we were going to do to break the tie and I said we would have to think about it.  Well, by the time the auction came around on Sunday we had not thought of a rubber match, so when Baby Bear won a raffle prize, the video guy and Baby Bear both figured that was the final competition and crowned Baby Bear the winner.  That is why Baby Bear appears unusually excited.  I protested to no avail that luck should not count as competition and am still waiting for the rubber match :)</p></div></zzz></div></div></body>
