<div>I have received quite a 
few e mails this week asking questions about this series.  Since I have 
been busy getting ready for Kindergarten Nursery Rhyme day I haven't had a 
chance to get back to all of you, so here goes....</div>
<div> </div>
<div>!.  My original 
plan was to hide the boxes in Sam Houston National forest.  Which seemed 
like a great idea, until I started thinking about checking on and repairing 
boxes.  So my new plan is to hide them in Terry Hershey park, a lovely park 
in West Houston that I walk 2 to 3 times a week.  It is a 15 mile loop (I 
don't walk the whole thing at once!) with plans for expansion.  There are 
several spots to park along the trail, so I will split the series into 3 parts, 
one part starting from each parking area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2.  BOX/LOG 
SIZE:  Smaller is better...about 4x6 would be about the largest box I think 
could be safely hidden there.  I will list the boxes as "Mythical Creature 
Series Box 1, box 2, etc."  if you would like to include the name of your 
particular stamp on your log that is fine.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3.  DO YOU NEED TO 
SEND A BOX?  If you would like to send me a box ready to go, I won't 
complain.  If you would rather just send the log and the stamp, that is 
fine too.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4.  E mail me off 
list for my address when you are ready to send your box, remember we are trying 
to have the boxes ready to go by March 1st.  I hope this covers the 
questions you all have had, if I have forgotten something, please let me 
know!  Thanks to all who have offered to help with this project!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Oh, darn, we're a little disappointed.  We thought our creatures <br/>
would find a home up here in our back yard and encourage visitors, <br/>
who might then find our local boxes.  There are 128 miles of Lone <br/>
Star Trail that could use more boxes (hint, hint) :-) !  We do have <br/>
a couple of stamps that will be on the way to you shortly.  By the <br/>
way, we were driving around the Big Thicket area this week and <br/>
noticed that there are a lot of spectacular trails in there that <br/>
don't have letterboxes, in case anyone is looking for a place to <br/>
hide new boxes.<br/>
