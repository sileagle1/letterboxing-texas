                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning we finally got to go on a letterboxing outing.  We found<br/>
these viewfinder boxes:<br/>
<br/>
Whistle Stop, #1-3 on the BCGB trail (creek crossing, wildflower<br/>
meadow, and autumn gift) before the heat got the kids, and Old Native.<br/>
 It was a great little outing, but it's so hot today, we should have<br/>
gone yesterday when the weather was better.  However, we just couldn't<br/>
do it yesterday.  Another hurricane refuge had been to all those boxes<br/>
the day before we got to them.<br/>
<br/>
Our plans are to head home tomorrow.  I want to at least do the<br/>
Mondrian series, but I'm not sure I'll get to.  LSS is anxious to get<br/>
home.  We got power back this morning--I had emptied out the fridge<br/>
and freezer before we left, so there's nothing to eat (except for my<br/>
hurricane supplies, but that's what they're for).  <br/>
<br/>
So thanks Viewfinder for providing a fun outing!<br/>

&gt; We  switched hotels because the Fort Worth air show was canceled and<br/>
&gt; better  digs were available.  So we are now near the Texas  Motor<br/>
&gt; Speedway.  Seeing as how we might be here a few days (depends on  gas<br/>
&gt; and traffic), contact me off list and let me know what might be  some<br/>
&gt; fun letterboxes.  I haven't even looked at the website, so  haven't<br/>
&gt; been able to do my usual printing reams of clues.  I've been  too<br/>
&gt; anxious, but once I know what the damage is (if any), I may be able  to<br/>
&gt; relax and have more fun.<br/>

&gt; If you're at TMS, you aren't that far from my LBs in NE Tarrant Co!<br/>
  Come <br/>
&gt; find them in Grapevine (2), Southlake (1), Keller - just south of<br/>
where you  are <br/>
&gt; (6), Colleyville (1), and Bedford (1).  And welcome to North Texas -<br/>
 that <br/>
&gt; Shawnee Trail LB is just one of the best, I think, as are all of<br/>
Kantexan's  in <br/>
&gt; Arlington.  -- Viewfinder (tx2chic) in Keller<br/>
