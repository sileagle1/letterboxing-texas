<div>Ahhh... My HH, "Hit the Road Jack" started his travels two years ago in that hostel and is still traveling around the state. In fact, I just heard "from him" recently through his host Wagtime, who gave him a lift, and GG just after that. Two years ago, I sat under that large cedar with several others boxers as we stamped all the visiting HH's from the hostel into our logbooks. Thanks for the fun.</div>

<div> </div>
<div>That cedar tree can hide a VW van full of folks!  I can just visualize a bunch of you sitting there stamping away with no one the wiser.  I have to say - it has caused my boss a few puzzled moments when he sees a car parked on the street and no one around...my co-workers and I snicker and go back to work.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm toying with turning it into a traveling hostel - going to gatherings or other brief stays so folks can trade out HH's and then it'll move along.  Maybe calling it "Mater on the Move"...Is this a good idea?  Any thoughts on how to make it work???</div>
