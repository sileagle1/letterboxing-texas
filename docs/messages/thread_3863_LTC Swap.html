                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know many of you don't participate in LTCs, and I would normally <br>
never promote a swap on this list, but since many of you know <br>
SoccerChik, I wanted to give you an opportunity to participate.<br>
<br>
I've just added a new LTC swap to Atlas Quest called "My Momma Told <br>
Me...". This tracker will serve two purposes:<br>
<br>
1. Mother's Day is May 10th. What advice did Mom give you that made a <br>
lasting impact on your life? Share your mother's words of wisdom with <br>
the rest of us. <br>
<br>
2. My only darling child, SoccerChik, will graduate from high school <br>
at the end of May. At the beginning of her senior year she received <br>
letters of encouragement from family and friends, which I put into a <br>
scrapbook. I want to add a collection of wisdom to the book to send <br>
with her to college in the fall. If you join, please send one extra <br>
card for SoccerChik's book. <br>
