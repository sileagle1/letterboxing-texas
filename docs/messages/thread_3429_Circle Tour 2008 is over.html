<p>Hi Gang!
<br/>JBKokopelli and I just got back from our second annual spring break Circle Tour.  She picked me up in DFW last Saturday and we set out for the hill country.  We were on the go constantly, had a blast and saw some great stuff, but are exhausted and ready to be in our respective homes and sleep in our respective beds with our respective four-legged kids.  JBK dropped me off in DFW a little while ago and is on the road headed back to ETX now.  More details to follow after we each recuperate a little, but this will have to suffice for now:</p>
<p>7 Days
<br/>2,150 Miles Driven
<br/>16 Boxes Planted
<br/>106 Boxed Found
</p>
<p>I've missed you guys!
<br/>Wag Time<br/>

<br/>PS - We found a wonderful long walking stick at a box site in Georgetown.  We think we know who it belongs to, but we're holding it for ransom because it's really nice!   :-)</p>
<p>PPS - Cross Mountain has an elevation of 1,923 feet and the trail is...long…all uphill...on rock.
</p>
<p>PPSS - Today is JBKokopelli's Birthday!!!!!

<div>Glad you're back! We'll be anxious to live vicariously through you sitrep.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know BT will be very happy to be reunited with his walking stick.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Happy Birthday JBK! Sleeping in your own bed may be your best gift!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Viewfinder and I are having our Excellent Adventure 2008 next weekend. We should travel about 600 miles, find about 20 letterboxes, visit with some really fun letterboxers at Dog Days at Double Lake, drink lots of Starbucks, eat lots of Sonic cheddar peppers, and consume a couple bottles of Pinot Grigio in our motel room each night.</div>
