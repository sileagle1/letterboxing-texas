Hello friends!  My husband and I are visiting family here in <br>
Onalaska TX.  We are from Canada where we letterbox; yesterday we <br>
found boxes at the Mercer Arboretum (found all 5)  Then we found 6 <br>
in Tomball, 3 parks 2 boxes in each.  We also picked up the <br>
Highstepping HH. Thank you for these great finds!  I hope to leave <br>
some orphan boxes behind so watch for a new placer in East Texas!<br>
Thanks again, Norasta and Guitarzan<br>
<br>

Welcome Winter Texans!  Glad you were able to find a few<br>
during your visit, and if you leave a few that would be<br>
even better.  <br>

boxes and leave a few behind... :)<br>
<br>
I was in Florida this past week and did some boxing. I<br>
only found one box. The ones that were missing were<br>
probably taken out by the hurricanes. I placed one box<br>
(watch for clues to "Texas Tourist") and left a HH<br>
with the box I found. After all the exploring, I'm<br>
much more familiar with the area and the parks. I'll<br>
be back in the area again next year, so I will be able<br>
to plant more boxes and (hopefully) find even more!<br>
