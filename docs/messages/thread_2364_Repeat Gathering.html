                    <html><body><div>I tried in the fall to get a small sort of a repeat gathering together in Rusk and just couldn't ever get a good date.  There are now even a few more folks in this area who would like to do that - folks who started letterboxing right about the time of the gathering or after and would like to go to Rusk because of its proximity in our area and because of the box density there.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While of course everyone is invited to come back to this area, I expect this gathering will be made up mostly of new folks from the East Texas area!  I'm shooting for mid-January, realizing the weather may be iff-y, but I would love to get them to one gathering so maybe they'll get the bug and head on to the annual gathering or some of the local gatherings.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My intent is to make it a day of box maintenance for myself while the other folks box, so if you are getting reports of needed maintenance or full logbooks or whatever, let me know specifically.  If you want to send me clean logbooks to replace at that time, I'll be glad to make the replacement and send you the full book.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now is a good time to add that it appears the Rusk State Park has a reprieve from closure right now (I know someone somewhere mentioned it, but I'm not sure if it is on this list or another list I belong to, so if this is old news I apologize).  It will be open at least until August.  Depending on how you feel about the likelihood of the park closing, you may want to think about retiring your box, and if you do that, I'll be glad to pick it up and send it to you.  Another option would be to move it to the Fairchild State Forest, which is near the RR Park and begging for more boxes.  Personally, I think this park will continue to get short-term reprieves, but I feel like we'll have a month or two notice before it actually closes.

<div>I have been trying to find a time to come back to your area to do some boxing, and check on my box down there. Hopefully I can make it when you have your local get-together! I'd love to see you again, and meet the new boxers in your area. By mid January, I'll be good and stir crazy and ready for a little road trip. Remember, it was the first week of January that I made my mad dash to Tatum for the Tour Bus. The weather was beautiful and I spent the rest of the morning hiking around the lake Martin State Park. Never know!</div>
