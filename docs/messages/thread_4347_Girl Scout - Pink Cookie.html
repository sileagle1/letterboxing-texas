Hi Fellow Letterboxers,<br>
<br>
Pink Cookie (Dixie) will start taking orders today - Friday, January 8th for Girl Scout Cookies.<br>
<br>
New this year is a e-card that Dixie can send out to Family & Friends asking for support on her cookie sales goal of 2,010 boxes...!!!  You will get a special link made just for you to a online site made available by our baker for Girl Scouts for you to make a Promise for ordering cookies. We're sorry, but no payment is made online ever, only at delivery.  If in the DFW area delivery late Feb or we will be at Tale7 in March and could deliver and get payment then.<br>
<br>
Our jurisdiction is in the council area of Girl Scouts of Northeast Texas that spans the 32 counties of: Anderson, Camp, Cherokee, Collin, Dallas, Denton, Ellis, Fannin, Franklin, Freestone, Grayson, Gregg, Harrison, Henderson, Hopkins, Hunt, Kaufman, Lamar, Marion, Morris, Navarro, Panola, Rains, Red River, Rockwall, Rusk, Smith, Titus, Upshur, Van Zandt and Wood.<br>
