summer was the worst, when I pulled a box from a log covered in PI.  I<br>

I carry Tecnu with me, and usually use it if I'm even possibly maybe<br>

It often grows on the edge of a tree line (a prime box planting<br>
location), usually not in the deep, deep forest.  It can appear<br>
differently at different times of the year and depending on where you<br>
are in the country.  In Texas, it almost always has notched leaves,<br>
but that's not true elsewhere!   In winter, look for the hairy vine,<br>
that's usually poison ivy (it can be a good 6 inches in diameter at<br>
times).  That will tell you whether you should plant in that location<br>
(please don't!).<br>

here's a quiz that helps you look at some of the different appearances<br>

<div><font size="2">Fun quiz! Whereas I got most of them, I am one who is highly allergic also. If in doubt, I just assume it IS poison ivy and steer clear of it. I also carry a bottle of Purel with me to rub into my exposed skin after wading through high weeds where I would spot poison ivy growing. I've read that works pretty well also. I used it earlier week under the same circumstance and it seemed to do the trick. I am going to pick up some Tecnu though to be on the safe side.</font></div>
