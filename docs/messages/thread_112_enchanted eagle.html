fine.  We had no luck locating the other two hidden in the park <br>
tho...too many "mushroom rocks" to know which one! Well, couldn't <br>
spend a ton of time on it with two antsy boys on my hands, we're <br>
glad we found one!  My son found an old (hard-boiled) Easter egg <br>
down in the park area and was so pleased with that find he smuggled <br>
it home.  All in all a good time had by everyone!<br>
<br>
I think that rock has grown since the last time I visited about 10 <br>
yrs ago.  I sure had a harder time getting to the top ;)<br>
