<div>You know, one thing about losing boxes is it gives you an opportunity to rethink the whole box - whether you would put one back where you had it, whether you would do a different image, whether the container worked, whether it accomplished what you wanted, all that sort of thing.  The field is open again and you get a new chance to play the game a different way!

There have been several times when I have been out boxing in some area and thought this could be a scary situation if the wrong type of people were to be present. Fortunately, most of the time that I go, I have PomPom bear with me and it is always during day light, but you can never be too unassuming or let your guard down these days.  We saw a rather LARGE snake in the creek this past weekend while at the Metroboxers meet in Duncanville. I promptly told the others to not let the kids over on that side of the creek. But I guess I have been lucky in that I haven't run into anything yet out on the trails.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was that incident in Nacogdoches where the jogger came up behind <br>
us on the trail and scared the daylights out of us... and in turn we <br>
scared the daylights out of him.  :)  That's been our only "people" <br>
scare.<br>
<br>
A few weeks later we were in Brenham looking for a box at Old Baylor <br>
Park.  I told Element to look for the box under a yellow rock next to <br>
the old well, while SoccerChik and I walked a short distance away to <br>
take wildflower photos (distraction for the muggles).  He called out to <br>
us, "Hey, there's a snake under this rock.  I think it's a <br>
copperhead."  Now bless his little heart, he's a sweet kid, but not the <br>
brightest crayon in the box, so SoccerChik and I figured he found a <br>
king snake or something and was overreacting.  We walk over to see, and <br>
sure enough there was a big ole 3-1/2 foot copperhead. (I've got a <br>
photo to prove it - taken with a zoom lense from a safe distance.) And <br>
Mr. Snake didn't look too happy at being disturbed.  I told Element he <br>
was in the wrong spot (understatement), and to slowly back away from <br>
the snake.  By this time we've drawn attention to ourselves (so much <br>
for discretion), and a mother and son came to see what the fuss was <br>
about.  In the meantime, Element retreats a safe distance away and <br>
picks up another yellow rock, which fortunately wasn't home to Mr. <br>
Snakes's brother or to the letterbox, since we still had mom and son <br>
watching. (I told you the kid wasn't too bright.)  Element <br>
said, "there's nothing under this yellow rock either."  The son <br>
asks "Do copperheads only like yellow rocks?"  Uh...yeah, they do seem <br>
to prefer them around here.<br>
Lessons learned... <br>
1. Believe the kid next time (I'm still feeling guilty and wondering <br>
what I would have told his mother had he been bitten)<br>
2. Use long, sturdy sticks to probe under rocks before lifting<br>
3. Remind kids about boxing etiquette (not to look for boxes with <br>
muggles around).<br>

There have been several times when I have been out boxing in some area <br>
and thought this could be a scary situation if the wrong type of people <br>
were to be present. Fortunately, most of the time that I go, I have <br>
PomPom bear with me and it is always during day light, but you can <br>
never be too unassuming or let your guard down these days.  We saw a <br>
rather LARGE snake in the creek this past weekend while at the <br>
Metroboxers meet in Duncanville. I promptly told the others to not let <br>
the kids over on that side of the creek. But I guess I have been lucky <br>
in that I haven't run into anything yet out on the trails. (Where that <br>
wood to knock on?).<br>

                    <html><body><div>Animals and so forth don't bother me too much, even snakes.  I have a bad knee that sometimes causes me concern, so that I wear a whistle on the outside of my backpack.  Even that, though, while it's given me problems on the trail, it's never let me down entirely.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have a way of running into odd people (my husband calls it my weirdo magnet), so that I long ago developed the habit of having an exit in mind most of the time, even if it's just to get away from some overly talkative mental patient in the grocery store.  I think because I stay pretty aware of my surroundings that I don't worry too much most of the time. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have, though, had a couple of people encounters that may have been entirely okay, but they made me uneasy.  The first happened soon after I started LB'ing, on one of the rare (RARE) summer days when I ventured out to go check my box at Fairfield State Park and couldn't convince anyone else in the house to come along.  As I parked at the trailhead, there were some guys on bicycles hanging out.  I was certain to lock up and I pretended to make a phone call telling someone where I was (no signal, or I would've for real).  I checked the box and continued the walk, which took awhile.  As I was leaving the woods, I could see ahead to the parking area and I could see that at least one of the bicyclists was still there.  I stopped for a minute on the premise of tying my shoe and rearranged my backpack so I was carrying it on my stronger arm and got my keys into my hand.  I also grabbed my cell phone again and began as though I was talking on it and telling them I was done hiking and would be right back to the campsite.  I exited the woods ready to swing my backpack if I had to, but he appeared to be ignoring me like I was appearing to ignore him.  I quickly got into my car and locked back 
up.and drove on out, but apparently he was waiting on someone because a couple of other bikers were rolling toward him as I was leaving.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The other incident really unnerved me, but it was probably nothing as well.  I was in Mother Neff State Park when I walked up on a man and a couple of women and a child.  I kept my head down and ignored them because I was following clues to a box.  I went up an incline and realized I must have passed a landmark, so I turned around and went back down.  Returning to where the people were was an odd move on my part and the man started talking to me.  I answered his questions vaguely and kept my distance.  He approached me directly and got inside my personal space (personal space is much wider outside, as I'm sure you know), and people don't usually strike up in-depth conversations with strangers in the woods) and began asking me questions about what I was doing and if I was alone and where my husband was, etc.  I avoided answering him or answered him with lies, and retreated back up the incline.  I had told him I was doing plant research (if you tell most folks you are doing any type of research, they will run like crazy in case you want to bore them to tears about your project), so I began examining the plants.  They moved on up the trail in the same direction I had gone, so that they had to pass me this time.  They went on, but then the man came back again.  By this time I was really a little freaked about his directness and the fact that he kept getting in my space, but also puzzled by the fact that he was accompanying two women and a kid, and yet was behaving oddly toward me.  I kept my eye on my exit, which at this time was straight up yet another incline to the paved road that came close to the trail at that point.  It would've been pure adrenalin that would've pushed me up that hill, but I think I could've managed.  He finally went on (but if I recall, he came back yet again).  It made me uneasy enough that I turned around and got in my car and left the park.  Really, he was probably just a concerned fellow who didn't get why a woman would be hiking alone and was worried about my welfare, but he himself in his actions sent me so many bad vibes that I went with my gut.  I don't think I could've enjoyed the rest of the trail anyway for worrying about rounding the turn and seeing him there.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One situation that happened to me, while not letterboxing, had me thinking I might've bit off more than I could chew for a few minutes:  I took SJZ and a friend of hers to Austin with me on a business trip when they were 13.  One evening, I took them down to 6th Street and I talked a bouncer into letting me take them into the bar to listen to music (it was early anyway).  SJZ's friend, a sheltered child and devoutly Baptist besides, had never been anywhere that served alcohol, much less into a bar.  She was stunned by the behavior of the female lead who was flirting heavily with a drunk guy close to the front, who was responding by tipping generously.  We haven't ever much sheltered our own kids, so while it wasn't something SJZ saw often, she wasn't shocked by any of what she saw and she got a kick out of how the woman was manipulating the man to empty his wallet into her tip jar.  Finally, we left the bar and continued along, and just as her friend was getting over the fact that she had just left a bar, a guy with serious mental issues sidled up beside her and began talking to her.  I started talking to him to distract him away from talking to her, so he began walking with us.  The girls were walking on either side of me and I could feel them both getting closer and closer to me as we walked further along.  Finally, I saw a fairly nice shop and just as we were about to cross the street with this guy in tow, I pulled the girls into the store and we got lost toward the back, leaving him in the crosswalk. I have to admit - I WAS a little worried about what I had gotten us into when I started talking to the guy in the first place.

<div>Actually, I won't know for sure until I swing out there to check it out, but I don't see that happening - it was under a hefty (10-12 pounds) piece of concrete that was a couple of feet inside the fence.  I've been watching that road develop for a few months now, to see if they were going to tear down the fence to widen it.  As of a couple weeks ago, it was a good three feet or so from the edge of the road, with the fence between it and the road.  It sounds as if it was out of its hiding place to begin with (maybe they were cleaning up that little corner), and got chopped up while they were blading. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - I won't rehide it there at the site of the monument.  That place is so remote and secluded and has a lot of notoriety, so that it attracts not just history buffs, but also the lower element.  When I first hid a box out there, I would almost never run into people, and if I did, it was people interested in the history of the site.  I had the pleasure one time of telling the Killough story to a family who was on a mission to visit a different county every weekend of the school summer and study the history in each.  They were a charming little family and it was a pleasure to happen to get to talk to them.  In fact, as I recall, I was out checking boxes because I was mad at my husband, and by the time I left them I couldn't be mad anymore.  But as time has gone by, the people I've run into out there haven't been at all interested in the monument - I've come up on what had to be a drug deal, one occasion that required quick dressing by the occupants of a pickup truck (and shall I just say - there was an odd number of occupants, AND it was more than one), and odd kinds of things.  I quit going alone about a year ago (and I'm not one to be particularly squeamish about going out alone).  I just don't feel good about putting people in a position of being distracted while looking for a box and possibly not as attentive to their surroundings as they should be.  I will put a new box in the vicinity so that it gets them out there (because it's hard enough to find it!), and they can go on in from there.  I still think it's a worthwhile place to visit, and safe enough during daylight hours with company, but I would suggest anyone going be alert. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Times change and circumstances change.  I had already been contemplating a change for this box and this has forced me to something I should've already done.<br/><br/> </div>

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've always been fond of Killough. It has been in place for a <br/>pretty long<br/>&gt; time and it's latest hiding spot has served it well for a good <br/>while. I'm<br/>&gt; sad about that one, but I think I'm sadder about Lightning's box.

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've always been pretty fortunate and have lost very few boxes over <br/>the<br/>&gt; years. What a shame to lose two at once.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

<p>There was that incident in Nacogdoches where the jogger came up behind <br/>us on the trail and scared the daylights out of us... and in turn we <br/>scared the daylights out of him. :) That's been our only "people" <br/>scare.<br/><br/>A few weeks later we were in Brenham looking for a box at Old Baylor <br/>Park. I told Element to look for the box under a yellow rock next to <br/>the old well, while SoccerChik and I walked a short distance away to <br/>take wildflower photos (distraction for the muggles). He called out to <br/>us, "Hey, there's a snake under this rock. I think it's a <br/>copperhead." Now bless his little heart, he's a sweet kid, but not the <br/>brightest crayon in the box, so SoccerChik and I figured he found a <br/>king snake or something and was overreacting. We walk over to see, and <br/>sure enough there was a big ole 3-1/2 foot copperhead. (I've got a <br/>photo to prove it - taken with a zoom lense from a safe distance.) And <br/>Mr. Snake didn't look too happy at being disturbed. I told Element he <br/>was in the wrong spot (understatement)<wbr>, and to slowly back away from <br/>the snake. By this time we've drawn attention to ourselves (so much <br/>for discretion), and a mother and son came to see what the fuss was <br/>about. In the meantime, Element retreats a safe distance away and <br/>picks up another yellow rock, which fortunately wasn't home to Mr. <br/>Snakes's brother or to the letterbox, since we still had mom and son <br/>watching. (I told you the kid wasn't too bright.) Element <br/>said, "there's nothing under this yellow rock either." The son <br/>asks "Do copperheads only like yellow rocks?" Uh...yeah, they do seem <br/>to prefer them around here.<br/>Lessons learned... <br/>1. Believe the kid next time (I'm still feeling guilty and wondering <br/>what I would have told his mother had he been bitten)<br/>2. Use long, sturdy sticks to probe under rocks before lifting<br/>3. Remind kids about boxing etiquette (not to look for boxes with <br/>muggles around).<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, Carolyn Ramirez <br/>&lt;danielcgarcia@<wbr>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Your story got me to thinking...has anyone ever come into a <br/>circumstance while out boxing that they would be scared or frightened? <br/>There have been several times when I have been out boxing in some area <br/>and thought this could be a scary situation if the wrong type of people <br/>were to be present. Fortunately, most of the time that I go, I have <br/>PomPom bear with me and it is always during day light, but you can <br/>never be too unassuming or let your guard down these days. We saw a <br/>rather LARGE snake in the creek this past weekend while at the <br/>Metroboxers meet in Duncanville. I promptly told the others to not let <br/>the kids over on that side of the creek.

</p><div>when we were out there so that wag time could get the box, the fence was still up and the concrete was still in place and about 3 feet from the fence.  the road was about a foot or so from the fence on the other side.  the remains of the lock n lock box was in the middle of the road.  i am not sure how the box got in the road or in the area that would become the road, and since we didnt find the stamp and book and rest of the box it really makes me wonder.  if you want me to go out there with you, just let me know when.

<div>Actually, I won't know for sure until I swing out there to check it out, but I don't see that happening - it was under a hefty (10-12 pounds) piece of concrete that was a couple of feet inside the fence.  I've been watching that road develop for a few months now, to see if they were going to tear down the fence to widen it.  As of a couple weeks ago, it was a good three feet or so from the edge of the road, with the fence between it and the road.  It sounds as if it was out of its hiding place to begin with (maybe they were cleaning up that little corner), and got chopped up while they were blading. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - I won't rehide it there at the site of the monument.  That place is so remote and secluded and has a lot of notoriety, so that it attracts not just history buffs, but also the lower element.  When I first hid a box out there, I would almost never run into people, and if I did, it was people interested in the history of the site.  I had the pleasure one time of telling the Killough story to a family who was on a mission to visit a different county every weekend of the school summer and study the history in each.  They were a charming little family and it was a pleasure to happen to get to talk to them.  In fact, as I recall, I was out checking boxes because I was mad at my husband, and by the time I left them I couldn't be mad anymore.  But as time has gone by, the people I've run into out there haven't been at all interested in the monument - I've come up on what had to be a drug deal, one occasion that required quick dressing by the occupants of a pickup truck (and shall I just say - there was an odd number of occupants, AND it was more than one), and odd kinds of things.  I quit going alone about a year ago (and I'm not one to be particularly squeamish about going out alone).  I just don't feel good about putting people in a position of being distracted while looking for a box and possibly not as attentive to their surroundings as they should be.  I will put a new box in the vicinity so that it gets them out there (because it's hard enough to find it!), and they can go on in from there.  I still think it's a worthwhile place to visit, and safe enough during daylight hours with company, but I would suggest anyone going be alert. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Times change and circumstances change.  I had already been contemplating a change for this box and this has forced me to something I should've already done.<br/><br/> </div>

 very <br/>special, as well<br/>&gt; it should have because HE is special. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've always been pretty fortunate and have lost very few boxes over <br/>the<br/>&gt; years.
