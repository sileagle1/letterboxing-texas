&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; In light of the fact that he has moved along in scouting and is now a<br/>&gt; &gt; member of the Dragon patrol, and that he has chosen to carve his own<br/>&gt; &gt; signature stamp in the image of a dragon, and to stamp said dragon in a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lovely emerald green shade, and further, because he has developed an<br/>&gt; &gt; interest in Latin and has long had an interest in astronomy, the letterboxer<br/>&gt; &gt; formerly known as Lightning has put much thought and consideration into a<br/>
&gt; &gt; new trail name and has arrived at this: Draconis viridis.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; As often happens, a familiar version of the name will work itself out; in<br/>&gt; &gt; the meantime, I will be proud to have Draconis viridis accompany me to the<br/>

<p>Wait until they turn 13  the sheer complexity of the combination of mathematics, physics, and biology in two 13 year old boys in the same vicinity is enough to lift Stephen Hawking out of his wheelchair and send him running for his life.</p>

<p>I've pondered the physics of how you can take two healthy boy brains and add them together and they become less than one. My two six year old grandsons become borderline idiots when they are together and can say in unison: "He did it" as they point at each other. It's like a little duet.<br/>
