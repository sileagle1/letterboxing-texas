If you have a large sig stamp with lots of inked area, you learn how to ink it up so it works well. <br/>
<br/>As to found stamps, I really don't care how big they are, it's just that larger stamps are hard to ink. <br/><br/>When I first started out, I read something about small logbooks are best, so I carried a very small logbook. Well into my first year, it suddenly dawned on me that whatever I was reading was referring to logbooks placed in boxes - why would it matter what size logbook I carry anyway? I felt really silly! I finished out my first year in that small logbook and started a new one that was a more amenable size. Now I carry one that is about 5x8, so I shouldn't run into too many stamps that are too big for my logbook!<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I'll weigh in on this one too -- I agree, extra-large stamps can be an annoyance, hard to ink and stamp well and take up an inordinate amount of space in a logbook.  Plus, they demand large containers to hold them and their logbooks, so the boxes have to be sort of big and thus, harder to find a really good hiding place for them.  That said, I'll admit that one of my own personal traveller stamps is LARGE!  But after I'd made it so big, on purpose because I liked the way the stamp looked in that size, I also made a smaller, more user-friendly verson, and I always offer both to whoever "finds" them.  I have found a few oversize stamps that were really impressive (some of Ruby Tuesday's come to mind, with their extraordinarily elaborate carving), but for the most part, I like stamps that fit more easily onto my inkpad or don't dry out before I finish inking them with markers and fit into my logbook -- that's about the size you both mentioned, 3x3 or in that general range.  Especially in that TTB2, some of those huge stamps, especially those backed with wood, took up a lot of space and made it really difficult to repack those passengers into that enormous container!  I'm hoping all the future-finders give enough time to that one to be sure all those passengers survive awhile longer!<br/>
<br/>
And about baggies in L&amp;L boxes -- definitely needed!  And I always like to add one of those little silica packets or packs inside the baggie with my logbook to help with moisture that sometimes accumulates inside all that good packing, too. Having tried to dry out a few wet &amp; stinky logbooks, wondering what wonderful stamps were gone forever from the water that got in the box (sometimes just left unsealed by a not-so-careful finder!), well, it's pretty sad.  A baggie and a couple of extra minutes time goes a long way toward keeping important things like logbooks dry and safe.  -- Viewfinder</p><div class="aol_ad_footer" id="MAILCIADB018-5c3c49f48b36371"><br/><font style="color:black;font:normal 10pt arial,san-serif;"> <hr style="margin-top:10px"/><b>An Excellent Credit Score is 750. <a href="http://pr.atwola.com/promoclk/100126575x1220814855x1201410739/aol?redir=http://www.freecreditreport.com/pm/default.aspx?sc=668072&amp;hmpgID=62&amp;bcd=AprilExcScore426NO62">See Yours in Just 2 Easy Steps!</a></b></font> </div>
