<br>
i am not actually a big fan of dogs (more for cats,<br>
me), but i agree with you, Mike, about the uncertainty<br>
of the end-product with kids.  but you sound very<br>
experienced......so here's an idea -- i'll send you<br>
one small boy, for training, and then you'll also have<br>
a new letterboxer in your area!  how about that for a<br>
great idea?!  : )<br>
<br>
and speaking of states, someone in an office told a<br>
friend the other day, that her last bill had to be<br>
sent to virginia (even though my friend is moving to<br>
West Virginia), because WV just did not exist in the<br>
list of states in the computer, so obviously, there<br>
was no such thing as west virginia, so she'd just send<br>
the mail to virginia, and that would be okay, right?  <br>
<br>
on my good days, i think people are interesting.  <br>
but on my bad days, i get discouraged.<br>

trying new things?  Not afraid of loud noises (with proper hearing 
protection of course)?  Likes dogs?  Likes to travel. explore, hike, 
camp?</span></font></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"><span class="543102922-19102006">If he can listen to a radio drama-show and/or read 
books and use his imagination, thats a plus.  If he likes to sit in 
front of the TV, thats a minus.  Computers are OK, but within reason.  
He must learn how to think for himself, and sometimes quickly.  He can't 
allow himself to be brainwashed by one source of information, but rather to look 
at it all and form his own opinion.  For everything.</span></font></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"><span class="543102922-19102006">In my circles, he is thought of as a good young 
man.  The advantage is when he is home, he never has to pay for a 
beer.  The down-side is he is never home enough.  Just about 
the time he started getting really interesting - he went off to defend the 
country.  I am proud of him, but I miss him too.  The sad part is that 
if the army would have me back, I would go join him.  Two snipers, a lefty 
and a righty, sharing the same foxhole.  What a combo.</span></font></div>
