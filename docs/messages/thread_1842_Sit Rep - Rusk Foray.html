                    <html><body><div>Knowing that I was going to be out of the LB'ing picture for a few weeks while I wrapped up the campout, I scheduled myself a boxing weekend for the weekend after the campout - this next one.  My sis-in-law is going with me, and we are planning it like a military operation.  I had hoped to make it a two day affair, but she has to be home Sunday morning, so we are limited to one day...Still though, I can't WAIT to hit the trail again!  The current plan is to go down to Coldspring and find Princess Aurora's box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, the weather cooled off dramatically in East Texas (still hot out there in El Paso, Mike?) and I had nothing pressing for this evening, so I hustled Lightning into the car for a shake down run and we headed down to Rusk to pick up some of the boxes we still hadn't gotten - about twelve boxes in Rusk - six from gathering time and five or six more that have been planted in the interim!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We decided it was time to do the last boxes in Rusk State Park, so we hit the trail and got to work.  Well, it appears they are doing some maintenance on some of the signs, or else someone has been taking them down, so it was quite entertaining trying to follow the clues based on the tree signs!  There are two boxes that key off the Honeysuckle sign, and it was wayyyy down the trail from where it should've been and wouldn't you know - it was near a trail that jots off to the left, just like the clues for one box says!  I swear I sat on every stinking fallen log I could find and squinted and angled my head and thumped my compass and even tried to pretend an oak tree was a pine tree (all the time wondering if I had any reason to believe Compass Points knew HER trees!) to see if I could make the clues work.  Finally, reluctantly, I had to admit defeat - except - Lightning had noticed a very large patch of honeysuckle (he's a honeysuckle buzzard) and we had earlier agreed it should've been so marked because of the size of the patch.  We began to suspect that we had been led astray, so we returned to that lovely patch and only then noticed the sign pole without the sign and remembered that we had seen the honeysuckle sign well up the path without a sign pole.  Hmmm...it doesn't take Inspector Bacon to confirm we had been duped!  We had a good laugh about that and we easily followed the clues on in and found the boxes we had despaired of finding.  It made us realize it is far more important to stop and read the signs and learn the trees so that we would know the trees at a later time when the signs weren't there!
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>It was a great little outing.  Unbelievable that we can now go letterboxing on a weekday evening instead of having to make it an all day thing to find one or two boxes!  We got six boxes and all were in perfect condition and well hidden:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>General Sherman</div>
<div>Underground Railroad</div>
<div>Boxcar Willie</div>
<div>Letterboxing Coyotes</div>
<div>Baja Oklahoma (not a bad rendition of the State of Texas - for an Okie)</div>
<div>and GG's WOM box.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I tried for JB Kokopelli's Scarlett and Rhett box, but there were folks there, right in the very area I was going to have to start homing in.  Must be something about the site - there is also a geocache there that has foiled me!  I'm going to have to go for kokopelli's boxes here soon...but it wasn't going to be tonight I guess!

<div>As far as changing clues, I would say wait and see if they get the signs sorted out.  It didn't appear they are re/moving all the signs, so it should be temporary.  You might note in your clues that the signs MAY not be where they ought to be - as far as I could tell, only Honeysuckle was not in place...
