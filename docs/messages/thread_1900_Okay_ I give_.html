<div> </div>
<div>In case you don' t know the story, those were the WOM clues we got at JEN!  I woke up the morning of the gathering in our campsite to find an envelope had been secretly deposited on our picnic table with a note not to open until 3 
p.m., the time the gathering was to start.  The handwriting gave away the author - Mr. Gryzzled Gryphon himself!  Lightning and I worried over that envelope all day long, keeping one eye on them the whole time, while Fearless Fox appeared to have successfully put them out of his mind.  Finally everyone got there and we agreed the time had come to open the envelope.  We found clues inside with plenty of copies to be passed around.  There was another smaller envelope inside the envelope telling us that if we needed additional help, we could open the smaller envelope.  Well, we (Ruby Tuesday and Stillwater, Strawberry, Cummins Clan, Delivery Girl, PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder, Catpawz 1 and 2, and Fearless Fox, Lightning and I) all stood around trying to figure it out and were too proud to use the last ditch envelope.  Eventually everyone decided to use the remaining light to find the boxes that had been planted for JEN.  Everyone went on home except us, as we had planned to camp another night.  Soon after everyone had left, a figure appeared at the edge of camp - Gryzzled Gryphon.  He came into our campsite and we began to get to know him - of a sort.  Even meeting him and talking to him doesn't mean you know him!  He asked why we hadn't used the last ditch envelope and we told him we were all too proud to take hints.  At his insistence, I opened the clue then and it told us to "find the cranberry PT cruiser and ask for help" - he had been there on hand to help if we needed it all afternoon!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That hour or so that my family got to spend getting to talk to Mr. Gryphon was one of the memorable highlights of my letterboxing experience.  What a bittersweet pleasure it was to meet the elusive subject of so many discussions on this list!  I was afraid that knowing who he was would take "something" away from the game, since he had become quite an enigma in Texas letterboxing.  I've found, though, that it has actually just added a new dimension to it.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, to finish the story, with a little help from Mr. Gryphon and Fearless Fox, who coincidentally happens to have an expertise in the particular method in the clues, we were able to solve the clues.  GG headed for home after he was assured we were going to finish it.  At about 9 
p.m., we ventured off to find the box and in the meantime attracted a little attention from someone near the box location, so we opted not to put it back until morning when we could be more discrete and hopefully they would have forgotten about us.  The following morning dawned windy and chilled, so we stayed in our tent an especially long time.  We eventually decided to get up and as I emerged, who came traipsing back through our campsite but Catpawz - 1 AND 2!  They had traveled all the way back to the gathering location from Greenville because they had solved the box in the wee hours and HAD to come back and stamp in.  Their faces were forelorn as they trudged back from the hiding spot, not knowing we had kept the box out so as not to risk putting it back after inadvertantly drawing attention to ourselves.  Their disappointment turned immediately when they learned they had indeed been correct.  But that's not all - Ruby Tuesday and Stillwater also showed back up!  And Viewfinder and PuddleSplasher returned too that same day!  All of those folks had not relented on that crazy set of clues and they DID prevail - and without the help we had!   So Batty, you too will prevail!

&gt; around.  There was another smaller envelope inside the envelope<br/>
telling us<br/>
&gt; that if we needed additional help, we could open the smaller envelope.<br/>
&gt; Well, we (Ruby Tuesday and Stillwater, Strawberry, Cummins Clan,<br/>
Delivery<br/>
&gt; Girl, PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder, Catpawz 1 and 2, and Fearless Fox,<br/>
&gt; Lightning and I) all stood around trying to figure it out and were<br/>
too proud<br/>
&gt; to use the last ditch envelope.  Eventually everyone decided to use the<br/>
&gt; remaining light to find the boxes that had been planted for JEN. <br/>
Everyone<br/>
&gt; went on home except us, as we had planned to camp another night. <br/>
Soon after<br/>
&gt; everyone had left, a figure appeared at the edge of camp - Gryzzled<br/>
&gt; Gryphon.  He came into our campsite and we began to get to know him<br/>
- of a<br/>
&gt; sort.  Even meeting him and talking to him doesn't mean you know<br/>
him!  He<br/>
&gt; asked why we hadn't used the last ditch envelope and we told him we<br/>
were all<br/>

and it<br/>
&gt; told us to "find the cranberry PT cruiser and ask for help" - he had<br/>

&gt; was one of the memorable highlights of my letterboxing experience. <br/>
What a<br/>
&gt; bittersweet pleasure it was to meet the elusive subject of so many<br/>

would take<br/>
&gt; "something" away from the game, since he had become quite an enigma<br/>
in Texas<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  I've found, though, that it has actually just added a new<br/>
&gt; dimension to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, to finish the story, with a little help from Mr. Gryphon and<br/>
&gt; Fearless Fox, who coincidentally happens to have an expertise in the<br/>
&gt; particular method in the clues, we were able to solve the clues.  GG<br/>
headed<br/>
&gt; for home after he was assured we were going to finish it.  At about<br/>
9 p.m.,<br/>
&gt; we ventured off to find the box and in the meantime attracted a little<br/>
&gt; attention from someone near the box location, so we opted not to put<br/>

so we<br/>

to get up<br/>
&gt; and as I emerged, who came traipsing back through our campsite but<br/>
Catpawz -<br/>
&gt; 1 AND 2!  They had traveled all the way back to the gathering<br/>
location from<br/>
&gt; Greenville because they had solved the box in the wee hours and HAD<br/>
to come<br/>
&gt; back and stamp in.  Their faces were forelorn as they trudged back<br/>
from the<br/>
&gt; hiding spot, not knowing we had kept the box out so as not to risk<br/>

All of<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Should you feel guilty if you stumble across a box by accident?  We <br/>
(Lone Star Quilter and myself) couldn't make it to the gathering, <br/>
but we went up the week before and planted a couple of boxes.  Then, <br/>
the week after, we went back to check our logbooks because we <br/>
thought we hadn't put in enough pages (because of the many finds <br/>
during the gathering).  She mentioned that other boxes had been <br/>
placed during the gathering, and maybe we would come across some if <br/>
we looked for "likely" spots.  About that time, she looked down at <br/>
the base of a tree and said,"This looks like it might be hiding a <br/>
box."  It was indeed a box, placed by GG and titled with the name of <br/>
an old railroad song.  Since we didn't get the clues, I don't know <br/>
if this is the box you're talking about, but we stamped it and we <br/>
count it as a find, although there's no way to log it on the LbNA <br/>
site.<br/>

&gt; That one was fun to solve.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; In case you don' t know the story, those were the WOM clues we got <br/>
at JEN!<br/>
&gt; I woke up the morning of the gathering in our campsite to find an <br/>
envelope<br/>
&gt; had been secretly deposited on our picnic table with a note not to <br/>
open<br/>
&gt; until 3 p.m., the time the gathering was to start.  The <br/>
handwriting gave<br/>
&gt; away the author - Mr. Gryzzled Gryphon himself!  Lightning and I <br/>
worried<br/>
&gt; over that envelope all day long, keeping one eye on them the whole<br/>
&gt; time, while Fearless Fox appeared to have successfully put them <br/>
out of his<br/>
&gt; mind.  Finally everyone got there and we agreed the time had come <br/>
to open<br/>
&gt; the envelope.  We found clues inside with plenty of copies to be <br/>
passed<br/>
&gt; around.  There was another smaller envelope inside the envelope <br/>
telling us<br/>
&gt; that if we needed additional help, we could open the smaller <br/>
envelope.<br/>
&gt; Well, we (Ruby Tuesday and Stillwater, Strawberry, Cummins Clan, <br/>
Delivery<br/>
&gt; Girl, PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder, Catpawz 1 and 2, and Fearless <br/>
Fox,<br/>
&gt; Lightning and I) all stood around trying to figure it out and were <br/>
too proud<br/>
&gt; to use the last ditch envelope.  Eventually everyone decided to <br/>
use the<br/>
&gt; remaining light to find the boxes that had been planted for JEN.  <br/>
Everyone<br/>
&gt; went on home except us, as we had planned to camp another night.  <br/>
Soon after<br/>
&gt; everyone had left, a figure appeared at the edge of camp - Gryzzled<br/>
&gt; Gryphon.  He came into our campsite and we began to get to know <br/>
him - of a<br/>
&gt; sort.  Even meeting him and talking to him doesn't mean you know <br/>
him!  He<br/>
&gt; asked why we hadn't used the last ditch envelope and we told him <br/>
we were all<br/>
&gt; too proud to take hints.  At his insistence, I opened the clue <br/>
then and it<br/>
&gt; told us to "find the cranberry PT cruiser and ask for help" - he <br/>
had been<br/>
&gt; there on hand to help if we needed it all afternoon!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; That hour or so that my family got to spend getting to talk to Mr. <br/>
Gryphon<br/>
&gt; was one of the memorable highlights of my letterboxing <br/>
experience.  What a<br/>
&gt; bittersweet pleasure it was to meet the elusive subject of so many<br/>
&gt; discussions on this list!  I was afraid that knowing who he was <br/>
would take<br/>
&gt; "something" away from the game, since he had become quite an <br/>
enigma in Texas<br/>
&gt; letterboxing.  I've found, though, that it has actually just added <br/>
a new<br/>
&gt; dimension to it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Anyway, to finish the story, with a little help from Mr. Gryphon <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; Fearless Fox, who coincidentally happens to have an expertise in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; particular method in the clues, we were able to solve the clues.  <br/>
GG headed<br/>
&gt; for home after he was assured we were going to finish it.  At <br/>
about 9 p.m.,<br/>
&gt; we ventured off to find the box and in the meantime attracted a <br/>
little<br/>
&gt; attention from someone near the box location, so we opted not to <br/>
put it back<br/>
&gt; until morning when we could be more discrete and hopefully they <br/>
would have<br/>
&gt; forgotten about us.  The following morning dawned windy and <br/>
chilled, so we<br/>
&gt; stayed in our tent an especially long time.  We eventually decided <br/>
to get up<br/>
&gt; and as I emerged, who came traipsing back through our campsite but <br/>
Catpawz -<br/>
&gt; 1 AND 2!  They had traveled all the way back to the gathering <br/>
location from<br/>
&gt; Greenville because they had solved the box in the wee hours and <br/>
HAD to come<br/>
&gt; back and stamp in.  Their faces were forelorn as they trudged back <br/>
from the<br/>
&gt; hiding spot, not knowing we had kept the box out so as not to risk <br/>
putting<br/>
&gt; it back after inadvertantly drawing attention to ourselves.  Their<br/>
&gt; disappointment turned immediately when they learned they had <br/>
indeed been<br/>
&gt; correct.  But that's not all - Ruby Tuesday and Stillwater also <br/>
showed back<br/>
&gt; up!  And Viewfinder and PuddleSplasher returned too that same <br/>
day!  All of<br/>
&gt; those folks had not relented on that crazy set of clues and they <br/>
DID prevail<br/>
&gt; - and without the help we had!   So Batty, you too will prevail!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And to anyone else who hasn't yet seen those WOM clues, you are in <br/>
for a<br/>
&gt; special treat when you get them.<br/>
