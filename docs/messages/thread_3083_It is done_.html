The letterboxes for Hudspeth County and Hueco Tanks are both done.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow morning I will be taking my dog Parker to an event sponsored for<br/>
children who's (one or both) parents are in prison.  Yes - all my dogs work!<br/>
Not sure how long we will be there.<br/>
<br/>
Tomorrow evening I am invited to a banquet put on by the State of Texas for<br/>
the park volunteers.  It will be at the Magoffin Home in El Paso.<br/>
http://www.tpwd.state.tx.us/publications/parkguide/rgn_bb_007.phtml<br/>
<br/>
In between those - I may - that's  -MAY-  make it out to hide the Hudspeth<br/>
County box.  BUT - our microwave radio beacon has died, so if the parts are<br/>
repaired I need to hike the mountain to place it back in service.  I am the<br/>
only one in our group that can hope to hike in and out in one afternoon.<br/>
<br/>
Sunday is a dog show in Las Cruces NM.  My wife and Sammy both need the<br/>
practice.<br/>
http://www.vonbonehenge.com/Sammy/sammy.htm<br/>
<br/>
Of course Parker and I are on the front page!<br/>
http://www.vonbonehenge.com/<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - soon... Very soon.....  Two more letterboxes in the area, one<br/>
returning and one new county.<br/>
<br/>
Y-all have a GREAT weekend.<br/>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">Hmmmm - well - first - it is a dinner, not a meeting.  
Second - it will be with the local WEST Texas area folks - I don't need to prove 
anything to them.  We already work well here.  The problems are in 
Austin.  However, if the opportunity to chat with someone above the local 
level is available, you can be sure I will do my best to represent geocaching 
and letterboxing to the benefit of all.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">The problem we have in the park I volunteer in is 
simple.  The park is 37 square miles of desert mountain range.  
Probably 5-% served by roads.  There are 3 rangers to cover that 
park.  Each ranger works 5 days and has 2 days off.  So on all but one 
day a week there are really only two rangers covering the park.  Add 
split-shifts for the extended summer hours and often there is only one ranger 
covering the park.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">Volunteers take up the slack.  Mostly I patrol the 
high places.  I carry a radio and much other gear - for safety, security, 
and defense.  I wear camouflage - I can be seen if I want to, but sometimes 
stealth is important.  I write a weekly SITREP and E-mail/FAX it to the 
local HQ, reporting trail conditions and other matters of interest.  If an 
event requires immediate attention, I use the radio.  Sitting high on a 
ridge line talking the rangers in to nab some ATVers is almost as much fun as 
calling for artillery, but slower.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">After a while the rangers learn who's judgment they can 
trust, and who's they cannot.  This is how I got them to give geocaching 
and letterboxing the freedom we have out here.  That - and I sorta act as a 
go-between smoothing out any problems.  So far it has worked.  If it 
gets too demanding I will pull out and the "rules" will apply from that point 
on.  So far no one has made it that difficult.  That's the thing about 
being a volunteer.  You can always UN-volunteer too.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">As has been pointed out, having a "local agreement" is 
good, but having a mutual understanding at HQ is better.  Unfortunately, it 
would be easier for me to travel El Paso to Los Angeles than El Paso to Austin 
as mileage goes.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">I guess what I am saying is that while I have done and will 
continue to do what I can from this end, someone closer to Austin needs to ride 
that horse.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007"></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="181524104-15092007">Believe it or not, letterboxing and geocaching are not the 
only groups that I represent with the parks folks.  Being a ham operator, 
we are very interested in getting permission to add a linked-system in the 
Diablo Mountains to the park service tower.  This is the weak link that 
will allow us to tie our radio network in to the rest of Texas.  While most 
of you don't give a hoot about it, just remember that when there is an 
emergency, somehow hams continue to communicate even when the phones etc are 
out.  So if an opportunity does open, that tower site and permission to use 
it is my first priority this year.</span></div>
