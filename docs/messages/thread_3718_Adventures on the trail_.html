<div align="left" dir="ltr"><br/>September 29, 2002 by Salvo (Salvo) (291 
found)<br/>#153 9/29/2002 @1045hrs -I arrived at the park and was immediately 
impressed with this jem of a park. The state had gone to some measure to make it 
a nice place to visit. I found the info boards very informative as I hiked 
towards the cache.<br/><br/>Along the way, I spied a big box turtle making his way 
across the path. I briefly thought about picking him up to bring home to my 
kids, but then thought better of it. 1 turtle, and 11 kids equal an instant 
fight. Besides there wouldn't be enough of him to go around. Move along little 
fella...<br/><br/>I get into the general vicinity of the cache, and my GPS starts 
going bonkers due to tree cover. I line up and get cross bearings from a number 
of different compass points, and after marching around a bit, and 45 minutes 
later, I spot the cache and am about to pull the cache when I hear a snap. I 
come out of my cache find euphoria and look in the direction to see what.. a 
dog? No.. <span class="262311604-14082008">a RAZORBACK</span>!!<br/><br/>He's 
about 40ft from me. My first thought is the yell ''GIT!'', and I threw my GPS at 
him (Looking back on that, WHAT was I thinking!), then I threw my Cellular at 
him, then I threw my green cache bag at him -all missing the 
pig.<br/><br/>SNORT!!! He's already mad at me for being in his turf, and now he's 
madder. All I see are tusks, fur, and leaves flying as he charges. I back 
pedaled around a tree behind me, and this sucker's fast, and can spin on a dime. 
As I have nothing left to use, my ''fight'' instincts now shifted over to 
''flight''. I turned and jumped for this wide tree behind me.<br/><br/>(TIME 
FREEZE)<br/>Have you ever had this happen to you when you did something really 
stupid? This happened at this time. As soon as I made contact with the tree, the 
base of the tree snapped, and down she went. While on the way down... I had 
plenty of time to reflect on the stupidity of this act, as well as had the 
thought that this was going to hurt... Seemed like I was falling for 5 
minutes.<br/><br/>(TIME Continue)<br/>The tree and I hit the ground together, at 
which time I took a shot to the jewels from the trunk. As the tree hits, there's 
a crash, and twigs and sticks are flying. In between the stars and black spots 
I'm seeing, I hear a loud ''Sqweeeeee!!!'' as the <span class="262311604-14082008">razorback </span>runs off.<br/><br/>I extracated myself 
from the tree, and limped around in a daze for a moment. Ow!! I'm mad now, and 
am about to give out one of those Arnold Schwartzenegger/Preditor War yells, but 
decide better of it, as it'd probably come out sounding more like a shrill 
schoolgirl squeal, given my current condition. That'll leave a mark...<br/><br/>I 
picked up my GPS, Phone, and Bag and walked back out to the paved trail and back 
to my truck. I'm in shock. Once back at the truck, I realized that I hadn't 
opened the cache. Hmmm, I'm not going back IN there, not without some Artillary 
and Heavy Hardware!<br/><br/>A little later in the day, I was exhausted and called 
my wife to let her know I was on my way back early. I hadn't told her this 
story. When I got home, she had my dinner ready ..Pork Chops! My wife ...I gotta 
love her!<br/><br/>Took nothing, but left a bunch of small items that flew out of 
my bag.<br/><br/>-----------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I am 
ROTFLMAO again, and I have read this before. What an adventure. And then people 
ask me why I carry so much gear with me on every hike. WHAT IF?????<br/><br/>And 
then his DINNER... Squeeeeeeee!!!!!!!<br/><br/></div>
