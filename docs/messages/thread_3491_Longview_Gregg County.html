    Now that my box is back in place and the number of boxers in this <br>
area are growing, thought I would see if I could get others to place  <br>
boxes there also. I would gladly help maintain those that are left <br>
behind. Here is a link to the parks in Longview:<br>

<br>
There is one other box at Kidsview Park, but it is listed as missing. <br>
Kidsview is closed due to construction of the baseball fields and <br>
updates. This is a great place for the kids and hopefully, it will be <br>
re-opened by summmer.<br>
Thanks!<br>

                    <html><body><div>I've been thinking it would be nice to do a planting initiative in the greater Longview area since we have so many new boxers over that way.  Doing an initiative there would also serve to tie Shreveport and that little oasis of boxers there in with a larger group until Louisiana fills out a little bit.  It would also bring Carthage and Marshall in a little closer to a box-populated area, and I know there are some waiting boxers over there.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The nice thing about doing an "initiative" instead of a gathering, is that folks can make a jaunt through there at their leisure and plant a box or two.  It also makes it easier to cover a wider area.  If you recall, last year I tried to get a gathering up for the area north of I-20, but several folks (myself included - that was when my husband had surgery) wound up having to back out.  Instead we declared a range of counties and a period of time and encourage boxers to focus on that area.  It was quite a broad area, but we got it done and it was because of that initiative that we actually filled in our section of the state on the LBNA map.  At that time I did an "event" stamp and sent it to anyone who planted a box in the area (although I apparently missed sending one to someone, because I still have one in my stuff - let me know if I promised to send you one and you never got it).  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So what does anyone think about that idea?</div>

<div>As far as stamps, what Blue Butterfly said is by far the general concensus - plant what ya got because everyone has been there and appreciates a new carver's efforts.  And YOU will appreciate it when you go back to check your first boxes and see how much your carving has improved.  Thing is, no matter how long you've been carving, you can always get better in some way.  I've been getting quite a thrill out of my own carving lately because my lighted magnifying lamp has helped me take a step forward carving-wise.<br/>

where certain areas have certain reputations. I have a<br>
couple of friends who live on the south side and they<br>
say it's wonderful and they have never had any<br>
problems at all. Then you hear other's say they<br>
wouldn't go there by themselves at night b/c they<br>
heard about such and such happening there.<br>
<br>
Alot of times you can get a sense if an area is good<br>
or not. Just trust your judgement. :)<br>

<p>I think that's a great idea! I was telling Blue<br/>Butterfly that I've been working on my first 3 plants<br/>here in Harleton, but have been getting discouraged<br/>b/c my stamps look so bad. She told me to go ahead and<br/>
plant them anyway, that with time I'll get better. :)<br/>After Harleton, I was going to hit Longview. I've been<br/>scoping out places to plant for sometime now. If there<br/>was an intiative then that will give me the motivation<br/>
I need to get busy! <br/>I know of 3 new boxers that just began within the past<br/>month or so that live in Longview, so things should<br/>start picking up around here. :)<br/><br/>By the way, for those who don't know, Harleton is<br/>
about 20 minutes NE of Longview between Marshall and<br/>Longview. :)<br/><br/>Perky P<br/><br/>__________________________________________________________<br/>Be a better friend, newshound, and <br/>know-it-all with Yahoo!
