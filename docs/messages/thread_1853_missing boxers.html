<div>I have been thinking 
about this question, and I don't see the harm in adopting a box if you are 
willing to take care of it.  Yes, the boxes are the creations of 
individuals of many different ways of thinking, but they are all created for the 
same purpose, so that they can be found by other letterboxers.  I 
agree with Lucy that a box can always be turned back over to its creator if 
they ever re surface.  It just seems to me that if someone were to become 
upset over someone else taking care of a box they abandoned they most likely 
would never have abandoned it in the first place...if that makes any 
sense.  If it doesn't you can blame it on the fact that we went to the 
Arboretum today with 9  (yes, 9) children aged 10 and under.

there!)</div></body></html>

<div>What you say does make sense - and I think the proof is in the fact that we routinely call on one another to care for our boxes.  How many requests have gone out on this list to rescue a box that is about to be overtaken by construction work, or has been confiscated by officials, or has met some other difficulty?  I think that's indicative of the attitude of folks who wouldn't care if someone did a bit of maintenance for one of their boxes - of someone who wouldn't abandon their boxes.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I tend to care for all the boxes in my area because I know that unless it belongs to Lucy Locket or Blue Butterfly or TxLuvBug and now to JB Kokopelli, their owners are pretty far afield.  If I'm in the area of a box, I'll stop in to see how it's looking, and I consider that part of being a good letterboxer, and it is for me a form of "thank you" to the placers who have left boxes in my area.   And I know anyone else would do the same for my distant boxes.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess what is really at the crux of my thoughts is communication - there is no means to go around the placer to communicate a status.  And not that I really want there to be - I see that as being a dangerous tool easily abused.  But sometimes it just doesn't seem right that boxers are exercising good practices in using the Contact the Placer feature, but because the placer no longer monitors the account or responds to inquiries, their good efforts are wasted and they join the ranks of the folks who have already figured out the hard way that no one is going to be checking up or fixing a problem.  Maybe there isn't a real answer to this problem.  Maybe this has just been a rant about the problem.  Unfortunately, the ones who need to hear this rant are the ones I'm ranting about!

owner hasn't logged into AQ for a year.  This won't affect LBNA of<br/>
course, but it would allow someone to adopt a box and change the<br/>
status of it on Atlasquest. <br/>
<br/>
This does affect us here, as there is one relatively prolific Texas<br/>
boxer who will have been MIA for about a year on May 22nd.  At that<br/>
point, the boxes on AQ will be "adoptable."<br/>
<br/>
I'm not sure how I feel about it.  It's a good idea to have the status<br/>
updated, but I struggle to keep up with maintenance on my own boxes<br/>
(everybody, pretty please carry a box-repair kit in their lbing bag),<br/>
so am not sure I'd want to be responsible for someone else's.  <br/>
<br/>
However, I do think that it could be very frustrating for a new boxer<br/>
to find missing box after missing box--that gets old quickly.  So, I'd<br/>
like the status updated!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">One good aspect of it, is that for your own boxes, you can list them<br/>
as "up for adoption."  In fact, you should see that box currently on<br/>
your own clue page (others won't see it).  I may do that for some of<br/>
the boxes I've planted in far-flung locales--it would be great if a<br/>
local boxer would want to maintain them, because some are in places<br/>
I'm not likely to return to, at least for a looooong time.<br/>
<br/>
When we were in San Diego over Thanksgiving, we planted two boxes. <br/>
One was in a GREAT place; one was practically dumped into a mini-urban<br/>
flower bed.  Guess what, from all accounts, the one in the good hiding<br/>
place is gone; I get regular find reports on the other.  Just shows<br/>
the unpredictability of hides at times.<br/>
