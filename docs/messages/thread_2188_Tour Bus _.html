<br/>
My hubby worked on him yesterday until called away to the greens and <br/>
worked again today- he is finished but Howard is nothing like what I <br/>
had hoped for. His image is not inverse as I had hoped. More inking <br/>
and some refining and the image is better but nothing like the <br/>
fabulous Joan Crawford or Carol Burnett.Now delima, I can not hurt <br/>
hubby's feelings and kick Howard off the bus, as this was quite a <br/>
challenge and Howard's hair is amazing- a definate hair club for men <br/>
poster child - but after consultation with a trusted source I have <br/>
decided it is best if the bus remains parked until another passenger <br/>
joins Howard (he never gets out anyway- old hypochondriac) . So we <br/>
will add a new rider more representative of Mike's true carving skills.<br/>
<br/>
I will head it on soon to new territories.The driver is confused, he <br/>
called "All Aboard" and there is no gas available so everyone hoped <br/>
off to enjoy a day in the beautiful East Texas sunshine- not a one of <br/>
them has offered to help clean the shed though.<br/>
