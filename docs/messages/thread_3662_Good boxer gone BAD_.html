                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay! When good boxers go bad, it's an ugly thing. I woke up early <br>
this morning and went into the living room to finish knitting a hat I <br>
was working on. I love to be in there early when the birds are <br>
singing and the light is just right and there's NO TV blaring in the <br>
background. I noticed my backpack slung over the back of a dining <br>
room chair, where I hung it yesterday when I came in from finding a <br>
couple of really cool boxes in Denton (35 miles from my house). I <br>
picked it up to take it to my workroom, but paused and decided to <br>
look at my logbook at the two new stamps I got yesterday. Then I <br>
pulled the items out of my little plastic bag inside the backpack to <br>
reorganize it (which is something I rarely do). In fact my regular <br>
routine is to leave my backpack in the back of the Jeep for a few <br>
days before bringing it in and throwing it on a chair in my workroom <br>
for a few weeks before grabbing in one day to rush out the door to <br>
find a box that caught my interest (like the ones yesterday). I guess <br>
the universe was telling me I needed to take a closer look in my <br>
backpack this morning because to my great surprise, I found I had not <br>
only my Puddle Splasher stamp, but also one of the stamps from the <br>
boxes I found yesterday. NO WAY! Did I say these boxes were 35 miles <br>
from my house? That's 70 miles round trip! Since these boxes had only <br>
been planted a few days ago, I could imagine a disappointed <br>
letterboxer holding a box in their hand, dismay on their face, as <br>
they sadly realized there was no stamp in the box. Obviously, I had <br>
no choice but to hop back in the Jeep, stamp in hand, and after a <br>
stop at the gas station, join the traffic heading west on 380 for <br>
THIRTY FIVE MILES and return the stamp to it's hiding spot! Mission <br>
accomplished, but I hope no one came searching for that box between <br>
the hours of 6:00 p.m. last night to 8:30 this morning! I realized <br>
what I had done when I opened the box. I had taken the nicely folded <br>
paper towel which was supposed to be wrapped around the stamp and <br>
placed it back inside the plastic bag... not realizing the stamp was <br>
not inside the towel! So by the time I drove the 35 miles BACK to <br>
McKinney after replacing the stamp, the morning light was gone, the <br>
birds weren't singing and the TV was blaring, and I'd been putting up <br>
with heavy truck traffic for an hour and a half on 380! It's sad when <br>
a good boxer goes bad!<br>

<p>Okay! When good boxers go bad, it's an ugly thing. I woke up early <br/>this

<p>Okay! When good boxers go bad, it's an ugly thing. I woke up early <br/>this morning and went into the living room to finish knitting a hat I <br/>was working on. I love to be in there early when the birds are <br/>singing and the light is just right and there's NO TV blaring in the <br/>
background. I noticed my backpack slung over the back of a dining <br/>room chair, where I hung it yesterday when I came in from finding a <br/>couple of really cool boxes in Denton (35 miles from my house). I <br/>picked it up to take it to my workroom, but paused and decided to <br/>
look at my logbook at the two new stamps I got yesterday. Then I <br/>pulled the items out of my little plastic bag inside the backpack to <br/>reorganize it (which is something I rarely do). In fact my regular <br/>routine is to leave my backpack in the back of the Jeep for a few <br/>
days before bringing it in and throwing it on a chair in my workroom <br/>for a few weeks before grabbing in one day to rush out the door to <br/>find a box that caught my interest (like the ones yesterday). I guess <br/>the universe was telling me I needed to take a closer look in my <br/>
backpack this morning because to my great surprise, I found I had not <br/>only my Puddle Splasher stamp, but also one of the stamps from the <br/>boxes I found yesterday. NO WAY! Did I say these boxes were 35 miles <br/>from my house? That's 70 miles round trip! Since these boxes had only <br/>
been planted a few days ago, I could imagine a disappointed <br/>letterboxer holding a box in their hand, dismay on their face, as <br/>they sadly realized there was no stamp in the box. Obviously, I had <br/>no choice but to hop back in the Jeep, stamp in hand, and after a <br/>

<div><font size="2">I grew tomato plants from seed this year - started them in January. It's been a real learning curve. What I didn't realize is the spot I'd picked for the garden (by watching it last July and August) didn't get much sun in May and June. Now it's getting lots of sun, but it's so hot the tomatoes are slowing down (according to the farmer I talked to at the farmers market last weekend). I do have some green tomatoes though, and lots of blossoms, so maybe the plants will hang in there long enough to give me a few. It's been fun, but I think I may have to stick with buying my tomatoes from the farmers who know what they're doing. Also, all the tomatoes I planted were heirloom variety tomatoes, and my organic farmer guy told me heirlooms don't produce a lot of tomatoes in this region. I'm not sure I'm willing to accept that though.</font></div>

I guess <br/>&gt; the universe was telling me I needed to take a closer look in my <br/>&gt; backpack this morning because to my great surprise, I found I had not <br/> &gt; only my Puddle Splasher stamp, but also one of the stamps from the <br/>&gt; boxes I found yesterday. NO WAY! Did I say these boxes were 35 miles <br/>&gt; from my house? That's 70 miles round trip! Since these boxes had only <br/> &gt; been planted a few days ago, I could imagine a disappointed <br/>&gt; letterboxer holding a box in their hand, dismay on their face, as <br/>&gt; they sadly realized there was no stamp in the box. Obviously, I had <br/> &gt; no choice but to hop back in the Jeep, stamp in hand, and after a <br/>&gt; stop at the gas station, join the traffic
 heading west on 380 for <br/>&gt; THIRTY FIVE MILES and return the stamp to it's hiding spot! Mission <br/> &gt; accomplished, but I hope no one came searching for that box between <br/>&gt; the hours of 6:00 p.m. last night to 8:30 this morning! I realized <br/>&gt; what I had done when I opened the box. I had taken the nicely folded <br/> &gt; paper towel which was supposed to be wrapped around the stamp and <br/>&gt; placed it back inside the plastic bag... not realizing the stamp was <br/>&gt; not inside the towel! So by the time I drove the 35 miles BACK to <br/> &gt; McKinney after replacing the stamp, the morning light was gone, the <br/>&gt; birds weren't singing and the TV was blaring, and I'd been putting up <br/>&gt; with heavy truck traffic for an hour and a half on 380!

<p>I'm on my way BL. My tomatoes have been few and far between (the grape variety). I'm still waiting for the regular size ones to get regular sized and green. <br/><br/>But, I've gotten three small zucchini off my one bush. If I had known they would take this long, I'd've planted more. <br/>
<br/>Good thing I wasn't planning on living off this garden. I'd starve to death.<br/><br/>Ohhhhh, I can taste one of those juicy peaches now. I bet it's cold as ice from the fridge to, huh?<br/><br/>Janet

<div>I have not yet had to buy a tomato this season because my co-worker has had a garden that has turned out a bumper crop of the sweetest, juiciest tomatoes I think I have EVER eaten!  They are so sweet, we've been eating them for dessert, and the added bonus of not having to worry about them being tained because they are homegrown makes them that much better...and - the peaches just came into season with a vengeance, so now she's loading my desk up with them too!</div>

Sounds like something that just happened to us this past week.  After a second attempt at a HH Hostel in our area, and taking advantage of the cool evening air, we finally found it - 10 minutes before the park was closed.  We were spotlighted by a park security guard and told that we needed to collect our things and leave.  As soon as the officer left to chase off the other rowdies, we quickly finished stamping in, stashed our stuff back in our bag and rehid the box.  The next day, I emptied out our bag only to discover that we had taken the last HH from the box, but had failed to leave our HH, leaving no HHs in the HH Hostel.  So back we went to plant our HH.  A couple of days later I decided to do some stamp clean up and trade out some ink colors in our stash that we carry with us - only to discover the box stamp in the
 smaller bag with our stamps!  Since I had it right in my house, I gave it some extra TLC, cleaning it up, giving it a new paper towel and fresh baggie before we went back for the 4th (and I hope final) time!  <br/><br/>-JavaMama<br/><br/></td></tr></table><br/>
