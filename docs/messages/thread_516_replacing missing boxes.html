Ok all you Houston boxers!  My goal this week is to replace all my <br>
missing boxes, and to plant at least one more.  "Happy Birthday" has <br>
been replaced...clues have changed, so if you are going to hunt you <br>
will need to re-print them.  I'll let you know if I actually get to <br>
the others or not.  I'm busy solving Hawk's crazy bird clues, so I <br>
can't make any promises.  -Mother of Four<br>

looking forward to finding your boxes. I am hoping one<br>
of the boxes you will be replacing is Owl Be Seeing<br>
You. I really liked the Edith Moore Nature Sanctuary<br>
when I was there.<br>
