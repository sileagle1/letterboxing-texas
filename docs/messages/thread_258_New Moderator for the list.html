Even though you guys are so undemanding of me that I<br>
feel like the Maytag man sometimes (this is NOT a<br>
complaint, by the way!), I like to operate on the "hit<br>
by a bus" theory and felt like we needed to have an<br>
another moderator.  <br>
<br>
So, if you have any problems with the list, you can<br>
contact either him or me and we will help you out!<br>
<br>
Let me take this moment to let y'all know what a great<br>
group y'all are.  You are all really awesome and it is<br>
so easy being List Mom here - I wish my own kids were<br>
as easy as y'all are!  <br>
<br>
And remember, this is YOUR list!<br>
<br>
Thanks again, and special thanks to Silver Eagle for<br>
helping me out with the list!<br>

Thanks for your kind words - it makes doing this all<br>
worthwhile (that and I get a front row seat to learn<br>
more about letterboxing!).<br>
<br>
I'll keep an eye out for buses...fortunately, living<br>
in a small town the only buses we have are school<br>
buses!<br>
