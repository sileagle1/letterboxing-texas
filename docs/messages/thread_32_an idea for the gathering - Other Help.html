Great, thanks.  So far I am expecting over 30 people at<br>
the Event, so I may need people to bring some extra food.<br>
Maybe just snacks or other simple things to go with chili.<br>
I have to say that I am pleasantly surprised how many have<br>
said they are coming, and how many have joined this Talklist.  <br>
I had no idea there were that many Texas letterboxers!<br>

Just wondering.  We're gonna be there!<br>

As far as food goes, I'll be glad to do whatever you<br>
need. I guess that goes for not just food, but<br>
anything else that needs to happen to make this event<br>
come off without being too much burden on you!<br>

That would be great if you could bring bowls, spoons & napkins.<br>
I plan to bring some but we may need lots.  Everyone is<br>
bringing their own drinks so we may not need cups.<br>
