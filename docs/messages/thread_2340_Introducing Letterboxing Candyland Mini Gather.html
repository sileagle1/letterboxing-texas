&gt; From the slightly-warped brain of Mother of Five, comes a rip-<br/>
roaring<br/>
&gt; raucous idea:  Let's get together and play a real-life version of<br/>
&gt; Letterboxing Candyland.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This one day mini event will be held December 30, 2006 at Mercer<br/>
&gt; Arboretum and Botanical Gardens (the west side, the playground <br/>
side).<br/>
&gt;  Festivities start at 11am, and wind down when we're finished. If <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; rains, we'll do it December 31st.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All details here:<br/>
&gt; http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=263<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For this game, you will play in teams of 2 to 6 players.  Every 15<br/>
&gt; minutes, two teams will start (to get spaced out).  You are <br/>
welcome to<br/>
&gt; put together your own team, or if you're a single, we'll try to <br/>
group<br/>
&gt; a few letterboxers together.  Unfortunately, we are limiting the<br/>
&gt; number of teams to 12.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, before new year's resolutions day actually hits, come revel in <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; sweet stuff with us!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There will be special appearances by a number of sweet boxes,<br/>
&gt; including Dewberry's Breakfast Cereal Characters, loads of<br/>
&gt; candy-themed fun &amp; more.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; There are also a slew of boxes already at Mercer, so there will be<br/>
&gt; plenty to do while you are waiting for your start or after you've<br/>
&gt; finished.  Although this is a kid-oriented event, we are happy to <br/>
have<br/>
&gt; adults come.  Who doesn't love candyland?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; RSVP on AQ and let us know if you have a time preference, first <br/>
come,<br/>
&gt; first served and all that.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This event was going to be December 17th (and I may have mentioned<br/>
&gt; that date to some folks), but Dewberry's littlest is going to have<br/>
&gt; minor surgery a few days before, so we had to push it back until <br/>
later<br/>
&gt; in the month.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Hope you can join us!<br/>

Hi MO5 &amp; Dewberry!<br/>
<br/>
The BusyBeesFamily has already RSVP'd on AQ, but we'd like to put <br/>
our dibs in for 12:00, if not already taken.  Can't wait to see the <br/>
fun you've planned for this time!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks, Batty B<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This will be much more low-key than our last adventure. To clarify a<br/>
couple of things,<br/>
<br/>
You do not need kids to play or to come, although this is a<br/>
kid-oriented event.  <br/>
You can get together with other letterboxers and form a team, or we<br/>
will try to form one for you.<br/>
If you are still paying their bills (no matter their age), your child<br/>
counts as a kid.<br/>
