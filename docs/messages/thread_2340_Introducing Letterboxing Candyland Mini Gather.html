Hi MO5 & Dewberry!<br>
<br>
The BusyBeesFamily has already RSVP'd on AQ, but we'd like to put <br>
our dibs in for 12:00, if not already taken.  Can't wait to see the <br>
fun you've planned for this time!<br>
<br>
Thanks, Batty B<br>

<br>
You do not need kids to play or to come, although this is a<br>
kid-oriented event.  <br>
You can get together with other letterboxers and form a team, or we<br>
will try to form one for you.<br>
If you are still paying their bills (no matter their age), your child<br>
counts as a kid.<br>
