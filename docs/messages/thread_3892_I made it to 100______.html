I've been sitting at 99 traditional finds since October. If you look at my AQ log, there are 100, but the ribbon says 99, so I don't know what is really going on.<br/><br/>I decided to go with oldest daughter Kristi to River Legacy Park in Arlington. I figured out of the 10 boxes listed out there, surely I could find at least one. <br/><br/>Luckily, we started at the top of the list with Haunted Waters. We got there around 4pm and headed down the trail. I am not a small person, nor do I have long legs, so it took us a little bit of time to get there. <br/><br/>We found the box exactly where it was supposed to be and took it to a bench near the dirt trail.<br/><br/>One of my favorite parts of boxing is reading all the notes from previous finders. I was not able to do that
 because Kristi kept saying, "Mom, do you really want to be on this trail at dark." Or, "Did you think it was going to get dark so soon." Then, finally, "Hurry up, we have to go." <br/><br/>Before closing up shop, I was able to see a note from August 2005, don't remember who, no stamp. But, the note said something to the effect that he really enjoyed finding the box. Something about God, whichever one you believe in and hoping to find love. And that he would come back one day to visit the box.<br/><br/>Well, later in the logbook, August of 2008, he writes again and said that he had found love, her name was Shirley and he had brought her to find the box again and changed out the bags.<br/><br/>How cool is that? Every pain in my body right now is worth having the opportunity to read those notes, three years apart.<br/><br/>As we were heading back to the parking lot I was commenting on a painted spot on the ground. It was white and had smudges. I said, "Look a
 painted face, it almost looks like a ghost. Oh %$#&amp;#, this is the park the neighbor told me is haunted." I don't think my fat, short legs have walked that fast in over 10 years. We made it safe out of the park around 6, definitely dark. We were so scared that every noise made us hurry even faster. By the end of the trail she was carrying my messenger bag and we were almost running. I did, however, refuse to walk over a wooden bridge through the trees, an obvious shortcut. One noise in those trees and I would have had a heart attack.<br/><br/>I don't think I will be going on a boxing trip that late in the day without Gary. Too scary.<br/><br/>Hope everyone else had an exciting New Year's Day too :)<br/><br/>Janet<br/></td></tr></table><br/>
