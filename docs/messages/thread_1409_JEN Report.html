                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fresh in from Bardwell Lake.  Nice little park -<br/>
nothing like a state park, but quiet and secluded, and<br/>
apparently the staff there considers it to be a pretty<br/>
exclusive resort-type place - you gotta really want to<br/>
get in to get in...more on that later!<br/>
<br/>
My family rolled in to Bardwell at 8:30 or so Friday<br/>
evening, got set up, sat around and watched a<br/>
phenomenally beautiful sunset, and I finally retired<br/>
with a good book.  LSS retired well after midnight.  I<br/>
arose bright and early (7 a.m.) and stumbled out of<br/>
the tent to put in my contacts, only to find a<br/>
mysterious envelope on our picnic table!  Hadn't found<br/>
my contacts yet, so I had to work to read "Please<br/>
don't open before 3:30!".  Well fine.  I woke LSS up<br/>
to see if he knew how it had gotten there, but he just<br/>
groaned and went back to sleep.  My son helpfully<br/>
suggested maybe it meant 3:30 a.m. and we pondered<br/>
that for a moment, until I heard a voice from the tent<br/>
say "You DO know what Trustworthy means, don't you?" <br/>
I'm not sure if it was LSS or my conscience, but since<br/>
my son heard it too, I'm thinking it was probably not<br/>
my conscience.  Blasted scout oath.  <br/>
<br/>
We spent the day getting ready and relaxing and<br/>
finally, went to plant our own box.  When we returned,<br/>
PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder and Catpawz 1 and 2 were<br/>
there visiting.  I showed them the envelope and we all<br/>
pondered our watches (well, I didn't have a watch so I<br/>
pondered the meaning of Trustworthy).  Lightning (my<br/>
son) and LSS (Fearless Fox) took off for a Walmart run<br/>
and Ruby Tuesday and her LSS, Stillwater, showed up<br/>
soon after and Lena arrived right about the same time<br/>
(go Lena!  She didn't want to make the road trip solo,<br/>
but she did!).  Again, I pondered the first point of<br/>
the scout oath while they examined the envelope.  The<br/>
Cummins Clan and Delivery Girl rolled in shortly<br/>
thereafter and everyone watches showed 3:30, but<br/>
Lightning wasn't back yet and he had been so patient<br/>
with me all day that we had to wait for him. <br/>
Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long before<br/>
Lightning and FF arrived and we opened the envelope.  <br/>
<br/>
The food was really good and everyone brought<br/>
something wonderful!  It was fun getting to know<br/>
everyone and - what?  You want to know what was in the<br/>
envelope?  <br/>
<br/>
The envelope had a very nice letter from our esteemed<br/>
Gryzzled Gryphon, letting us know that he was gracing<br/>
us with the clues to his very first plant!  Woo Hoo! <br/>
He also mentioned that if we needed a further clue, we<br/>
should open a second sealed envelope enclosed in the<br/>
bigger one.  I pulled out the clues - and we<br/>
discovered that they looked just like his signature! <br/>
For those of you who have seen his stamp, you know<br/>
what that means - we were still worlds away from<br/>
finding the box!  I was confident though, and felt<br/>
certain that the great letterboxing minds in<br/>
attendance would be able to figure it out.  And it<br/>
really was kind of scary to watch these minds in<br/>
motion - we Texas letterboxers are a formidable force!<br/>
 After all that thinking, we did have to take a break<br/>
to eat, but it wasn't long before we were back to the<br/>
clues.  Catpawz#1 was going to town and she was fairly<br/>
certain she had figured out several words.  Turns out<br/>
she was right on one particular word, but for the<br/>
wrong reason.  Huh?  you say?  We did too!  Just as<br/>
one of us thought we had it going, Stillwater would<br/>
pipe in with his unerring logic and ask a question or<br/>
two about "why" or "why not"?  And we would find<br/>
ourselves redirected yet again.  I'm thinking he<br/>
would've enjoyed studying under Socrates, but that's<br/>
another story.  We were all so focused on solving the<br/>
clues that I don't think a single person seriously<br/>
considered asking for the sealed clue.  In fact, at<br/>
one point we discussed when and how to open it, and we<br/>
all agreed we didn't want extra help.  We also agreed<br/>
that the first person to solve the clue and find the<br/>
box would receive the extra clue to open to determine<br/>
the value of it to everyone else.  In retrospect, that<br/>
decision was a critical error on our parts.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, at about 6:00 p.m. everyone realized they had<br/>
better head out and find the boxes in the park before<br/>
it got dark.  So off everyone went!  Lena had been<br/>
down earlier in the week and planted boxes and my crew<br/>
and I had gone out and planted one, so there were four<br/>
boxes in the part with the distinct possibility of a<br/>
fifth - if we could ever figure out GG's clues!  The<br/>
highly astute Collins Clan and Delivery Girl (that is<br/>
one high energy bunch - all smiles and energy) noticed<br/>
a cranberry PT Cruiser in the parking lot and they<br/>
approached the driver and found that it was indeed the<br/>
esteemed Gryzzled Gryphon!  They got a clue from him<br/>
about the clues.<br/>
<br/>
As things were settling down and we were beginning to<br/>
clean up, a stranger approached our campsite and asked<br/>
us "Why aren't you at the party?"  I asked him if he<br/>
meant the "hunting party"...we invited him into our<br/>
campsite and we had a wonderful visit with Gryzzled<br/>
Gryphon.  I invited him to log in to the event book<br/>
and our personal book, but he had to go and get a<br/>
different log book to record the event stamp.  While<br/>
he was gone, my LSS chastised Lightning and me for<br/>
asking so many questions, so we tried to lighten up a<br/>
bit when GG returned, but there was just so much to<br/>
learn!  I finally mentioned that we hadn't opened the<br/>
extra clue because we all agreed we wanted to decipher<br/>
the clues the hard way, but he told me the extra clue<br/>
was no good anymore and invited me to open it.  Sure<br/>
enough, the clue was "to look for the cranberry PT<br/>
Cruiser for a clue".   And that, you see, was the<br/>
tactical error on our parts!  Gryzzled Gryphon gave me<br/>
a clue to solving the box clues and oddly enough, the<br/>
clue involved a specialty of my LSS while he was in<br/>
the Navy, so he set to work figuring it out.  He had a<br/>
couple of memory errors (it's been 20 years after<br/>
all!) which GG corrected for us and we were on our way<br/>
to having it figured out!  Once he was satisfied we<br/>
would have the clue solved before the end of the<br/>
night, he bid farewell.  On the one hand, it has been<br/>
a fun and interesting element of letterboxing to have<br/>
a mystery boxer and I'm sad that the mystery is now<br/>
over for me, but on the other hand, the pleasure of<br/>
meeting such an interesting fellow who has made my<br/>
letterboxing experience richer far outweighs the<br/>
sadness.<br/>
<br/>
We did indeed have the clues figured out by 8:30 p.m.<br/>
or so, so my LSS suggested we find it in the morning. <br/>
Morning?  Yeah right!  Lightning and I were heading<br/>
for it right then, so LSS headed out with us too.  It<br/>
was a clever location, but unfortunately, we attracted<br/>
attention with our flashlights while we were looking,<br/>
so between it being a little bit of a rugged spot and<br/>
the fact we didn't want to get them more interested,<br/>
we held on to the box until the following morning.  <br/>
<br/>
As we were emerging the following morning, who should<br/>
be approaching us but Catpawz - both of 'em!  They had<br/>
figured the clues out and driven all the way back down<br/>
to Bardwell to find it.  They were thoroughly<br/>
disappointed until they learned that we had kept the<br/>
box out until morning.  They knew exactly where it was<br/>
to have been, so we gave it to them to stamp in.  And<br/>
before we could get it back in place, Ruby Tuesday and<br/>
Stillwater drove back up and they had solved the clues<br/>
too!  I'm really sorry, y'all, that we had held on to<br/>
the box...I fully expected to be out so early that no<br/>
one could have gotten back before we replaced it.<br/>
<br/>
So, for the summary of the event:  <br/>
21 attendees<br/>
9 new boxes planted (not counting the four planted in<br/>
Johnson County since discussion of the event began).<br/>
As far as recipes go, I still haven't counted them up,<br/>
but I'm going to scan them in soon and make sort of an<br/>
electronic cookbook for us all from that!<br/>
<br/>
The only downfall of the event is that we didn't get<br/>
any boxes into Navarro County, but I have family over<br/>
there and plan to get a couple there soon (and it<br/>
gives me an excuse to visit Gander Mountain - I've<br/>
been wanting to get back there for months!).  I had<br/>
planned on planting one or two there on Sunday, but<br/>
with the winds being so high, we just wanted to get<br/>
home!<br/>

&gt; We got 2 boxes planted in Corsicana, which is in<br/>
&gt; Navarro Co., with clues now posted!  Consider the<br/>

&gt; to<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; My family rolled in to Bardwell at 8:30 or so Friday<br/>
&gt; evening, got set up, sat around and watched a<br/>
&gt; phenomenally beautiful sunset, and I finally retired<br/>
&gt; with a good book.  LSS retired well after midnight. <br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; arose bright and early (7 a.m.) and stumbled out of<br/>
&gt; the tent to put in my contacts, only to find a<br/>
&gt; mysterious envelope on our picnic table!  Hadn't<br/>
&gt; found<br/>
&gt; my contacts yet, so I had to work to read "Please<br/>
&gt; don't open before 3:30!".  Well fine.  I woke LSS up<br/>
&gt; to see if he knew how it had gotten there, but he<br/>
&gt; just<br/>
&gt; groaned and went back to sleep.  My son helpfully<br/>
&gt; suggested maybe it meant 3:30 a.m. and we pondered<br/>
&gt; that for a moment, until I heard a voice from the<br/>
&gt; tent<br/>
&gt; say "You DO know what Trustworthy means, don't you?"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'm not sure if it was LSS or my conscience, but<br/>
&gt; since<br/>
&gt; my son heard it too, I'm thinking it was probably<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; my conscience.  Blasted scout oath.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We spent the day getting ready and relaxing and<br/>
&gt; finally, went to plant our own box.  When we<br/>
&gt; returned,<br/>
&gt; PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder and Catpawz 1 and 2<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; there visiting.  I showed them the envelope and we<br/>
&gt; all<br/>
&gt; pondered our watches (well, I didn't have a watch so<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; pondered the meaning of Trustworthy).  Lightning (my<br/>
&gt; son) and LSS (Fearless Fox) took off for a Walmart<br/>
&gt; run<br/>
&gt; and Ruby Tuesday and her LSS, Stillwater, showed up<br/>
&gt; soon after and Lena arrived right about the same<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; (go Lena!  She didn't want to make the road trip<br/>
&gt; solo,<br/>
&gt; but she did!).  Again, I pondered the first point of<br/>
&gt; the scout oath while they examined the envelope. <br/>
&gt; The<br/>
&gt; Cummins Clan and Delivery Girl rolled in shortly<br/>
&gt; thereafter and everyone watches showed 3:30, but<br/>
&gt; Lightning wasn't back yet and he had been so patient<br/>
&gt; with me all day that we had to wait for him. <br/>
&gt; Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long before<br/>
&gt; Lightning and FF arrived and we opened the envelope.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The food was really good and everyone brought<br/>
&gt; something wonderful!  It was fun getting to know<br/>
&gt; everyone and - what?  You want to know what was in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; envelope?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The envelope had a very nice letter from our<br/>
&gt; esteemed<br/>
&gt; Gryzzled Gryphon, letting us know that he was<br/>
&gt; gracing<br/>
&gt; us with the clues to his very first plant!  Woo Hoo!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; He also mentioned that if we needed a further clue,<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; should open a second sealed envelope enclosed in the<br/>
&gt; bigger one.  I pulled out the clues - and we<br/>
&gt; discovered that they looked just like his signature!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those of you who have seen his stamp, you know<br/>
&gt; what that means - we were still worlds away from<br/>
&gt; finding the box!  I was confident though, and felt<br/>
&gt; certain that the great letterboxing minds in<br/>
&gt; attendance would be able to figure it out.  And it<br/>
&gt; really was kind of scary to watch these minds in<br/>
&gt; motion - we Texas letterboxers are a formidable<br/>
&gt; force!<br/>
&gt; After all that thinking, we did have to take a break<br/>
&gt; to eat, but it wasn't long before we were back to<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; clues.  Catpawz#1 was going to town and she was<br/>
&gt; fairly<br/>
&gt; certain she had figured out several words.  Turns<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; she was right on one particular word, but for the<br/>
&gt; wrong reason.  Huh?  you say?  We did too!  Just as<br/>
&gt; one of us thought we had it going, Stillwater would<br/>
&gt; pipe in with his unerring logic and ask a question<br/>
&gt; or<br/>
&gt; two about "why" or "why not"?  And we would find<br/>
&gt; ourselves redirected yet again.  I'm thinking he<br/>
&gt; would've enjoyed studying under Socrates, but that's<br/>
&gt; another story.  We were all so focused on solving<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; clues that I don't think a single person seriously<br/>
&gt; considered asking for the sealed clue.  In fact, at<br/>
&gt; one point we discussed when and how to open it, and<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; all agreed we didn't want extra help.  We also<br/>
&gt; agreed<br/>
&gt; that the first person to solve the clue and find the<br/>
&gt; box would receive the extra clue to open to<br/>
&gt; determine<br/>
&gt; the value of it to everyone else.  In retrospect,<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; decision was a critical error on our parts.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Finally, at about 6:00 p.m. everyone realized they<br/>
&gt; had<br/>
&gt; better head out and find the boxes in the park<br/>
&gt; before<br/>
&gt; it got dark.  So off everyone went!  Lena had been<br/>
&gt; down earlier in the week and planted boxes and my<br/>
&gt; crew<br/>
&gt; and I had gone out and planted one, so there were<br/>
&gt; four<br/>
&gt; boxes in the part with the distinct possibility of a<br/>
&gt; fifth - if we could ever figure out GG's clues!  The<br/>
&gt; highly astute Collins Clan and Delivery Girl (that<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; one high energy bunch - all smiles and energy)<br/>
&gt; noticed<br/>
&gt; a cranberry PT Cruiser in the parking lot and they<br/>
&gt; approached the driver and found that it was indeed<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; esteemed Gryzzled Gryphon!  They got a clue from him<br/>
&gt; about the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As things were settling down and we were beginning<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; clean up, a stranger approached our campsite and<br/>
&gt; asked<br/>
&gt; us "Why aren't you at the party?"  I asked him if he<br/>
&gt; meant the "hunting party"...we invited him into our<br/>
&gt; campsite and we had a wonderful visit with Gryzzled<br/>
&gt; Gryphon.  I invited him to log in to the event book<br/>
&gt; and our personal book, but he had to go and get a<br/>
&gt; different log book to record the event stamp.  While<br/>
&gt; he was gone, my LSS chastised Lightning and me for<br/>
&gt; asking so many questions, so we tried to lighten up<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; bit when GG returned, but there was just so much to<br/>
&gt; learn!  I finally mentioned that we hadn't opened<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; extra clue because we all agreed we wanted to<br/>
&gt; decipher<br/>
&gt; the clues the hard way, but he told me the extra<br/>
&gt; clue<br/>
&gt; was no good anymore and invited me to open it.  Sure<br/>
&gt; enough, the clue was "to look for the cranberry PT<br/>
&gt; Cruiser for a clue".   And that, you see, was the<br/>
&gt; tactical error on our parts!  Gryzzled Gryphon gave<br/>
&gt; me<br/>
&gt; a clue to solving the box clues and oddly enough,<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; clue involved a specialty of my LSS while he was in<br/>
&gt; the Navy, so he set to work figuring it out.  He had<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; couple of memory errors (it's been 20 years after<br/>
&gt; all!) which GG corrected for us and we were on our<br/>
&gt; way<br/>
&gt; to having it figured out!  Once he was satisfied we<br/>
&gt; would have the clue solved before the end of the<br/>
&gt; night, he bid farewell.  On the one hand, it has<br/>
&gt; been<br/>
&gt; a fun and interesting element of letterboxing to<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; a mystery boxer and I'm sad that the mystery is now<br/>
&gt; over for me, but on the other hand, the pleasure of<br/>
&gt; meeting such an interesting fellow who has made my<br/>
&gt; letterboxing experience richer far outweighs the<br/>
&gt; sadness.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We did indeed have the clues figured out by 8:30<br/>
&gt; p.m.<br/>
&gt; or so, so my LSS suggested we find it in the<br/>
&gt; morning. <br/>
&gt; Morning?  Yeah right!  Lightning and I were heading<br/>
&gt; for it right then, so LSS headed out with us too. <br/>
&gt; It<br/>
&gt; was a clever location, but unfortunately, we<br/>
&gt; attracted<br/>
