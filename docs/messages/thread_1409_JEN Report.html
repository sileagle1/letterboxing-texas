                    <div class="plaintext-content">Fresh in from Bardwell Lake.  Nice little park -<br>
nothing like a state park, but quiet and secluded, and<br>
apparently the staff there considers it to be a pretty<br>
exclusive resort-type place - you gotta really want to<br>
get in to get in...more on that later!<br>
<br>
My family rolled in to Bardwell at 8:30 or so Friday<br>
evening, got set up, sat around and watched a<br>
phenomenally beautiful sunset, and I finally retired<br>
with a good book.  LSS retired well after midnight.  I<br>
arose bright and early (7 a.m.) and stumbled out of<br>
the tent to put in my contacts, only to find a<br>
mysterious envelope on our picnic table!  Hadn't found<br>
my contacts yet, so I had to work to read "Please<br>
don't open before 3:30!".  Well fine.  I woke LSS up<br>
to see if he knew how it had gotten there, but he just<br>
groaned and went back to sleep.  My son helpfully<br>
suggested maybe it meant 3:30 a.m. and we pondered<br>
that for a moment, until I heard a voice from the tent<br>
say "You DO know what Trustworthy means, don't you?" <br>
I'm not sure if it was LSS or my conscience, but since<br>
my son heard it too, I'm thinking it was probably not<br>
my conscience.  Blasted scout oath.  <br>
<br>
We spent the day getting ready and relaxing and<br>
finally, went to plant our own box.  When we returned,<br>
PuddleSplasher and Viewfinder and Catpawz 1 and 2 were<br>
there visiting.  I showed them the envelope and we all<br>
pondered our watches (well, I didn't have a watch so I<br>
pondered the meaning of Trustworthy).  Lightning (my<br>
son) and LSS (Fearless Fox) took off for a Walmart run<br>
and Ruby Tuesday and her LSS, Stillwater, showed up<br>
soon after and Lena arrived right about the same time<br>
(go Lena!  She didn't want to make the road trip solo,<br>
but she did!).  Again, I pondered the first point of<br>
the scout oath while they examined the envelope.  The<br>
Cummins Clan and Delivery Girl rolled in shortly<br>
thereafter and everyone watches showed 3:30, but<br>
Lightning wasn't back yet and he had been so patient<br>
with me all day that we had to wait for him. <br>
Fortunately we didn't have to wait too long before<br>
Lightning and FF arrived and we opened the envelope.  <br>
<br>
The food was really good and everyone brought<br>
something wonderful!  It was fun getting to know<br>
everyone and - what?  You want to know what was in the<br>
envelope?  <br>
<br>
The envelope had a very nice letter from our esteemed<br>
Gryzzled Gryphon, letting us know that he was gracing<br>
us with the clues to his very first plant!  Woo Hoo! <br>
He also mentioned that if we needed a further clue, we<br>
should open a second sealed envelope enclosed in the<br>
bigger one.  I pulled out the clues - and we<br>
discovered that they looked just like his signature! <br>
For those of you who have seen his stamp, you know<br>
what that means - we were still worlds away from<br>
finding the box!  I was confident though, and felt<br>
certain that the great letterboxing minds in<br>
attendance would be able to figure it out.  And it<br>
really was kind of scary to watch these minds in<br>
motion - we Texas letterboxers are a formidable force!<br>
 After all that thinking, we did have to take a break<br>
to eat, but it wasn't long before we were back to the<br>
clues.  Catpawz#1 was going to town and she was fairly<br>
certain she had figured out several words.  Turns out<br>
she was right on one particular word, but for the<br>
wrong reason.  Huh?  you say?  We did too!  Just as<br>
one of us thought we had it going, Stillwater would<br>
pipe in with his unerring logic and ask a question or<br>
two about "why" or "why not"?  And we would find<br>
ourselves redirected yet again.  I'm thinking he<br>
would've enjoyed studying under Socrates, but that's<br>
another story.  We were all so focused on solving the<br>
clues that I don't think a single person seriously<br>
considered asking for the sealed clue.  In fact, at<br>
one point we discussed when and how to open it, and we<br>
all agreed we didn't want extra help.  We also agreed<br>
that the first person to solve the clue and find the<br>
box would receive the extra clue to open to determine<br>
the value of it to everyone else.  In retrospect, that<br>
decision was a critical error on our parts.<br>
<br>
Finally, at about 6:00 p.m. everyone realized they had<br>
better head out and find the boxes in the park before<br>
it got dark.  So off everyone went!  Lena had been<br>
down earlier in the week and planted boxes and my crew<br>
and I had gone out and planted one, so there were four<br>
boxes in the part with the distinct possibility of a<br>
fifth - if we could ever figure out GG's clues!  The<br>
highly astute Collins Clan and Delivery Girl (that is<br>
one high energy bunch - all smiles and energy) noticed<br>
a cranberry PT Cruiser in the parking lot and they<br>
approached the driver and found that it was indeed the<br>
esteemed Gryzzled Gryphon!  They got a clue from him<br>
about the clues.<br>
<br>
As things were settling down and we were beginning to<br>
clean up, a stranger approached our campsite and asked<br>
us "Why aren't you at the party?"  I asked him if he<br>
meant the "hunting party"...we invited him into our<br>
campsite and we had a wonderful visit with Gryzzled<br>
Gryphon.  I invited him to log in to the event book<br>
and our personal book, but he had to go and get a<br>
different log book to record the event stamp.  While<br>
he was gone, my LSS chastised Lightning and me for<br>
asking so many questions, so we tried to lighten up a<br>
bit when GG returned, but there was just so much to<br>
learn!  I finally mentioned that we hadn't opened the<br>
extra clue because we all agreed we wanted to decipher<br>
the clues the hard way, but he told me the extra clue<br>
was no good anymore and invited me to open it.  Sure<br>
enough, the clue was "to look for the cranberry PT<br>
Cruiser for a clue".   And that, you see, was the<br>
tactical error on our parts!  Gryzzled Gryphon gave me<br>
a clue to solving the box clues and oddly enough, the<br>
clue involved a specialty of my LSS while he was in<br>
the Navy, so he set to work figuring it out.  He had a<br>
couple of memory errors (it's been 20 years after<br>
all!) which GG corrected for us and we were on our way<br>
to having it figured out!  Once he was satisfied we<br>
would have the clue solved before the end of the<br>
night, he bid farewell.  On the one hand, it has been<br>
a fun and interesting element of letterboxing to have<br>
a mystery boxer and I'm sad that the mystery is now<br>
over for me, but on the other hand, the pleasure of<br>
meeting such an interesting fellow who has made my<br>
letterboxing experience richer far outweighs the<br>
sadness.<br>
<br>
We did indeed have the clues figured out by 8:30 p.m.<br>
or so, so my LSS suggested we find it in the morning. <br>
Morning?  Yeah right!  Lightning and I were heading<br>
for it right then, so LSS headed out with us too.  It<br>
was a clever location, but unfortunately, we attracted<br>
attention with our flashlights while we were looking,<br>
so between it being a little bit of a rugged spot and<br>
the fact we didn't want to get them more interested,<br>
we held on to the box until the following morning.  <br>
<br>
As we were emerging the following morning, who should<br>
be approaching us but Catpawz - both of 'em!  They had<br>
figured the clues out and driven all the way back down<br>
to Bardwell to find it.  They were thoroughly<br>
disappointed until they learned that we had kept the<br>
box out until morning.  They knew exactly where it was<br>
to have been, so we gave it to them to stamp in.  And<br>
before we could get it back in place, Ruby Tuesday and<br>
Stillwater drove back up and they had solved the clues<br>
too!  I'm really sorry, y'all, that we had held on to<br>
the box...I fully expected to be out so early that no<br>
one could have gotten back before we replaced it.<br>
<br>
So, for the summary of the event:  <br>
21 attendees<br>
9 new boxes planted (not counting the four planted in<br>
Johnson County since discussion of the event began).<br>
As far as recipes go, I still haven't counted them up,<br>
but I'm going to scan them in soon and make sort of an<br>
electronic cookbook for us all from that!<br>
<br>
The only downfall of the event is that we didn't get<br>
any boxes into Navarro County, but I have family over<br>
there and plan to get a couple there soon (and it<br>
gives me an excuse to visit Gander Mountain - I've<br>
been wanting to get back there for months!).  I had<br>
planned on planting one or two there on Sunday, but<br>
with the winds being so high, we just wanted to get<br>
home!<br>
