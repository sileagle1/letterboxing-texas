<br>
This summer I planted a box in Asheville, N.C., and one of the boxers <br>
wrote me to let me know she had found my box. We struck up an e-mail <br>
conversation, and the result is that she has sent us a stamp for our event!<br>
<br>
Today I received _*Jack Aubrey: H.M.S. Surprise*_ from The Little Foxes <br>
in Leicester, N.C. The stamp is beautiful!<br>
<br>
So, now, I need to know what y'all think I should do, as Mama Fox of The <br>
Little Foxes has left it up to me- should I hide the box or set it out <br>
for an exchange? Is it too late to work this box into one of the book <br>
walks?<br>

wanted to hide your own, you could post clues on the bulletin board<br>
located at (or near?) the pavilion.  There will be other boxes at the<br>
tables, too, though, so espeecially if you don't live in the Houston<br>
area, I am sure that would be okay.  I can't wait to see it!! <br>

Selfishly speaking, you should definitely hide it, as we (the<br>
organizers) would love to have some to find that we didn't hide<br>
ourselves.  (although I hid some, Mother of Five hid some, and<br>
TeamKing hid some).<br>
<br>
The clues for the walks are all finalized.  But there is plenty of<br>
room in the park--it's a big one.  You may pin a clue up on the<br>
bulletin board for others to copy down.<br>
<br>
To anyone lurking who's interested in coming, we'd love to have you! <br>
But, please RSVP at atlasquest.  It will really help TeamKing know how<br>
many clue packets to make up.  <br>
<br>
Thanks!  Fingers crossed that the rain STOPS. . .before all our boxes<br>
float away. . .<br>

<br>
If you plant it, it's not really an event box.  Event boxes are out on<br>
the table for all to find.  You are eligible to receive them by virtue<br>
of having come.  They don't really count as finds, but they're still<br>
cool.  The Event Stamp for the GBA is humongous, and took me quite a<br>
while to carve.  There is also a smaller version if you only stamp on<br>
notecards.<br>
<br>
If you plant it, just for the day, it's a temporary box.  There will<br>
be lots of those.<br>
<br>
This brings up a point I was just discussing with someone else.  Many<br>
of the boxes have been sent from afar.  Some of the logs will be going<br>
back to their owners.  Please take the time to write a little note,<br>
even if it's brief in each log.  It means a lot to the people who took<br>
the time to carve a stamp for us to enjoy.<br>
