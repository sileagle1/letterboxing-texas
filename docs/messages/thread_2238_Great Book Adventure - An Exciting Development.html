<br/>
This summer I planted a box in Asheville, N.C., and one of the boxers <br/>
wrote me to let me know she had found my box. We struck up an e-mail <br/>
conversation, and the result is that she has sent us a stamp for our event!<br/>
<br/>
Today I received _*Jack Aubrey: H.M.S. Surprise*_ from The Little Foxes <br/>
in Leicester, N.C. The stamp is beautiful!<br/>
<br/>
So, now, I need to know what y'all think I should do, as Mama Fox of The <br/>
Little Foxes has left it up to me- should I hide the box or set it out <br/>
for an exchange? Is it too late to work this box into one of the book <br/>
walks?<br/>

&gt; Well, your hostesses were out in Tomball again this morning, and one<br/>

&gt;<br/>
&gt; The Pavilion is in the very back of the park, if you keep driving,<br/>
&gt; you'll find it easily. There are volleyball nets and an area for<br/>
&gt; recreation. If someone wants to bring balls and get a game going,<br/>
&gt; they are welcome to. There is also a catch and release small lake<br/>
&gt; (pond really) stocked with rainbow trout, we always see lots of kids<br/>
&gt; fishing out there. You are required to follow the TPWD fishing regs<br/>
&gt; if you want to fish.<br/>

&gt; To be honest, the trails are NOT very well marked, meaning that they<br/>
&gt; do not have individual names or colors. There are lots of signs that<br/>
&gt; direct you back to the parking area, so that if you were to become a<br/>
&gt; bit disoriented, you can easily make your way back.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; Most of the trails are stroller friendly, there is one that you have<br/>
&gt; to go uphill through sand where a stroller would be tough. Good shoes<br/>
&gt; are a smart idea, as is an adequate amount of water.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; So far, they're forecasting pretty good weather for next weekend. The<br/>
&gt; pavilion is rather large, so it will provide great shelter in the<br/>
&gt; event of a passing shower.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; If someone wants to grill, there are barbecue pits.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; I think that's all. They are hosting a big event out there this<br/>
&gt; weekend, Sunday in the Park, so we are crossing our fingers that the<br/>
&gt; boxes already hidden will be okay.<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt; We can't wait to see you all! The stamps are truly amazing and I<br/>
&gt; think it's going to be great fun for all ages and abilities!<br/>

wanted to hide your own, you could post clues on the bulletin board<br/>
located at (or near?) the pavilion.  There will be other boxes at the<br/>

Selfishly speaking, you should definitely hide it, as we (the<br/>
organizers) would love to have some to find that we didn't hide<br/>
ourselves.  (although I hid some, Mother of Five hid some, and<br/>
TeamKing hid some).<br/>
<br/>
The clues for the walks are all finalized.  But there is plenty of<br/>
room in the park--it's a big one.  You may pin a clue up on the<br/>
bulletin board for others to copy down.<br/>
<br/>
To anyone lurking who's interested in coming, we'd love to have you! <br/>
But, please RSVP at atlasquest.  It will really help TeamKing know how<br/>
many clue packets to make up.  <br/>
<br/>
Thanks!  Fingers crossed that the rain STOPS. . .before all our boxes<br/>
float away. . .<br/>

If you plant it, it's not really an event box.  Event boxes are out on<br/>
the table for all to find.  You are eligible to receive them by virtue<br/>
of having come.  They don't really count as finds, but they're still<br/>
cool.  The Event Stamp for the GBA is humongous, and took me quite a<br/>
while to carve.  There is also a smaller version if you only stamp on<br/>
notecards.<br/>
<br/>
If you plant it, just for the day, it's a temporary box.  There will<br/>
be lots of those.<br/>
<br/>
This brings up a point I was just discussing with someone else.  Many<br/>
of the boxes have been sent from afar.  Some of the logs will be going<br/>
back to their owners.  Please take the time to write a little note,<br/>
even if it's brief in each log.  It means a lot to the people who took<br/>
the time to carve a stamp for us to enjoy.<br/>

&gt; Ok, I will plant it. I'm going to try to plant it before Saturday, and <br/>
&gt; Mama Fox will post the clues. This will most likely be an event box.<br/>
The <br/>
&gt; stamp is really nice- you don't want to miss this one. I'll let you<br/>
know <br/>
&gt; when the clues are posted, so stay tuned.....<br/>

&gt; &gt; How great!<br/>

&gt; &gt; Selfishly speaking, you should definitely hide it, as we (the<br/>
&gt; &gt; organizers) would love to have some to find that we didn't hide<br/>
&gt; &gt; ourselves. (although I hid some, Mother of Five hid some, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; TeamKing hid some).<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; The clues for the walks are all finalized. But there is plenty of<br/>
&gt; &gt; room in the park--it's a big one. You may pin a clue up on the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bulletin board for others to copy down.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; To anyone lurking who's interested in coming, we'd love to have you!<br/>
&gt; &gt; But, please RSVP at atlasquest. It will really help TeamKing know how<br/>
&gt; &gt; many clue packets to make up.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Thanks! Fingers crossed that the rain STOPS. . .before all our boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; float away. . .<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; HI, all!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; This summer I planted a box in Asheville, N.C., and one of the<br/>
boxers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote me to let me know she had found my box. We struck up an e-mail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; conversation, and the result is that she has sent us a stamp for our<br/>
&gt; &gt; event!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Today I received _*Jack Aubrey: H.M.S. Surprise*_ from The<br/>
Little Foxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in Leicester, N.C. The stamp is beautiful!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So, now, I need to know what y'all think I should do, as Mama Fox of<br/>
&gt; &gt; The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Little Foxes has left it up to me- should I hide the box or set<br/>
it out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; for an exchange? Is it too late to work this box into one of the<br/>
book<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; walks?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, your hostesses were out in Tomball again this morning,<br/>
and one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing to report is that our recent rains have brought the<br/>
mosquitos<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out in force! Bring spray.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Pavilion is in the very back of the park, if you keep driving,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you'll find it easily. There are volleyball nets and an area for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recreation. If someone wants to bring balls and get a game going,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are welcome to. There is also a catch and release small lake<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (pond really) stocked with rainbow trout, we always see lots<br/>
of kids<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fishing out there. You are required to follow the TPWD fishing<br/>
regs<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if you want to fish.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To be honest, the trails are NOT very well marked, meaning<br/>
that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; do not have individual names or colors. There are lots of<br/>
signs that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; direct you back to the parking area, so that if you were to<br/>
become a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bit disoriented, you can easily make your way back.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Most of the trails are stroller friendly, there is one that<br/>
you have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to go uphill through sand where a stroller would be tough.<br/>
Good shoes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are a smart idea, as is an adequate amount of water.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So far, they're forecasting pretty good weather for next<br/>
weekend. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pavilion is rather large, so it will provide great shelter in the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; event of a passing shower.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If someone wants to grill, there are barbecue pits.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that's all. They are hosting a big event out there this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weekend, Sunday in the Park, so we are crossing our fingers<br/>
that the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes already hidden will be okay.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We can't wait to see you all! The stamps are truly amazing and I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think it's going to be great fun for all ages and abilities!<br/>
