and it brought back fond memories of our Event last March.<br>
Even though the weather was much hotter, it did provide us<br>
with another Texas-size storm last night, just like we had<br>
at our Event.  I was too busy with Scout activities to even<br>
check on my box in the park, but my memories of last March<br>
kept my letterboxing spirit alive while swatting mosquitoes<br>
and sweating in my tent.  Thanks to all TX Letterboxers for<br>
helping me survive the weekend!<br>

You didn't get to do any letterboxing, but did y'all<br>
do any night hiking???<br>

evening.  The storm prevented us from being able to<br>
see anything in the sky, but it was beautiful to watch<br>
from the top of the observatory.<br>
<br>
I don't think he or I will ever forget that gathering<br>
- the wind actually pulled our tent stakes up, which<br>
wouldn't have been so bad except that we also had a<br>
very small slit in the side of our tent that has never<br>
mattered in three or four years of camping with it -<br>
until that night!  We wound up spending the last half<br>
of the night in the car.  It was a beautiful storm<br>
though!<br>
<br>
It looks like it may be him and me on our own again<br>
for the JEN gathering....<br>
