You didn't get to do any letterboxing, but did y'all<br/>
do any night hiking???<br/>

gathering, but we did go to the observatory Saturday<br/>
evening.  The storm prevented us from being able to<br/>
see anything in the sky, but it was beautiful to watch<br/>
from the top of the observatory.<br/>
<br/>
I don't think he or I will ever forget that gathering<br/>
- the wind actually pulled our tent stakes up, which<br/>
wouldn't have been so bad except that we also had a<br/>
very small slit in the side of our tent that has never<br/>
mattered in three or four years of camping with it -<br/>
until that night!  We wound up spending the last half<br/>
of the night in the car.  It was a beautiful storm<br/>
though!<br/>
<br/>
It looks like it may be him and me on our own again<br/>
for the JEN gathering....<br/>
