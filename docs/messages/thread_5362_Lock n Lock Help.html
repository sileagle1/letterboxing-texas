Hello everyone!  I feel like I've been in and  out talking to the group.  I think I just get busier with the family some months more than others! <br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I have hesitated to make my first letterbox and want to get started on one.  I found what looks like a good deal on 1.5 cup lock n lock boxes online, but the shipping is almost as much as the total cost of the boxes :(. Is there any way I could go in with someone on ordering?  Or, what do y'all normally do in this situation?<br/>
<br/>
Thank you!<br/>
