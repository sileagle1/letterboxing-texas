great once her little ones were just a bit older.  She recently<br>

to attempt to find a box or two.  After our first day out, we were<br>
hooked.  Two Tall Texan boxes were all we needed to jump start our new<br>
obsession.  Since, we have found that it is a great way for two busy<br>

Hopefully in the next few months, we will put our own little treasures<br>

here.  Logan went to his first Twilight Camp this year and banged out<br>
a whole mess of pins and belt loops so he's been okay to take a break.<br>
 I think he's read through his Wolf handbook twice already though.<br>

Take care,<br>
