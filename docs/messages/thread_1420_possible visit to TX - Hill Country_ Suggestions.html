First of all, great choice for your Thanksgiving vacation!<br/>
The scenery, hiking and letterboxes will be great, and the<br/>
weather should be, too.  Unless a cold front comes through<br/>
that week, the weather will be sunny, dry and 60's or 70's<br/>
during the day, 50's or 60's at night.  This is a great time<br/>
of year to visit TX and I hope you enjoy it.<br/>
If you start in San Antonio, definitely visit the Alamo<br/>
and Riverwalk, but when you are ready to hike, I really<br/>
like the Friedrich Wilderness Park on the northwest side.<br/>
There is only 1 box in the park, so for more boxes in an <br/>
urban park, try McAllister Park on the east side.  Then<br/>
drive up I35 to Austin, stopping in San Marcos if you<br/>
want to visit Aquarena Springs and the Outlet Mall.  The<br/>
Austin area has many boxes, some in the city and others<br/>
out in parks with trails.  My favorite places are Mt.<br/>
Bonnell, Zilker Park and Hamilton Pool Preserve.  Then drive<br/>
west on Hwy 290 towards Johnson City and visit Pedernales Falls<br/>
SP.  It has several boxes and a good trail overlooking the falls.<br/>
Continue on Hwy 290 to Fredericksburg, stopping at several<br/>
fine TX wineries if you are so inclined.  There is great<br/>
food and shopping in Fredericksburg, along with many B&amp;Bs.<br/>
Just north of town is Enchanted Rock SP, with a trail up<br/>
the second-highest granite dome in U.S. and a few boxes.<br/>
Then head south on Hwy 16 to Kerrville and on to Kerrville-<br/>
Schreiner Park.  More good trails and a couple boxes.  Continue<br/>
south to Medina and stop at the Cider Mill for all things<br/>
apple from Love Creek Orchard.  Their apple ice cream is<br/>
the best!  Then head west to Lost Maples SP for more good<br/>
trails, one box and possibly some late fall foliage.  Then<br/>
head east, back to your starting point of San Antonio.<br/>
Have fun!  <br/>

&gt; Hey, thanks for all the quick replies!  I'm researching Hill <br/>
Country now<br/>
&gt; (and did hope to include San Antonio in our plans if we go to <br/>
Texas, because<br/>
&gt; of course we've heard of the riverwalk).  We're not campers, but <br/>
instead<br/>
&gt; look for lodging in or near parks.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Any info on what the weather might be like over Thanksgiving?  Must <br/>
not be<br/>
&gt; too bad if some of you are planning to camp....<br/>
