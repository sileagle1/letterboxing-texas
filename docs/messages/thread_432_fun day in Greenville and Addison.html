Hey all,<br/>
We had a fun (but rainy) day in Greenville yesterday finding all <br/>
four of Catpawz' boxes.  If you live in the Metroplex, Greenville is <br/>
an easy 1 hour drive on I30.  I wish the Cotton Museum was open, but <br/>
it is closed on Sundays and yesterday was the only day I could go.  <br/>
Oh well, still worth the trip to see the neat Audie Murphy Statue <br/>
and the beautiful sculpture in Forest Park.<br/>
I walked through a web trying to get Greenville Sports Park and <br/>
thought I had escaped unharmed until I bent down to stamp in and a <br/>
HUGE garden spider fell out of my hair on a web onto the ground.  <br/>
EEEWWWWWWW.  The Pikachu Ponderer kept laughing at me the whole way <br/>
home because I kept flinching and twisting thinking there was still <br/>
a spider on me!  Thanks Catpawz for the great boxes!<br/>
Ruby's Pretty in Pink was fun too.  I was about to give up when <br/>
Pikachu Ponderer found it.  He kept gloating about how he read the <br/>
clues better than I did!  And he was right.  Even though he didn't <br/>
stamp in I let him keep the First Finders Certificate!<br/>
Now I have to get started on some new boxes for the area.<br/>
