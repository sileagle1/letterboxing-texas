What size book is in the box that Rachel refered to recently?<br>

So happy to know that some of Eoghan and my boxes are on your list <br>
for Colorado!  It would be really nice if we could see you again <br>
too - sure do miss our Texas connections!  Safe travels to the <br>
Rockies!<br>
<br>
P.S.  The logbook in "The Rockies" is a micro camera film <br>
container.  So it's several sheets of paper wrapped around the stamp <br>
the size of the film containeer.  Good luck!  If you don't get to <br>
it, I told Baby Bear that we would be back again so no worries.  <br>
After all, we did get married in Estes Park and we are going back to <br>
celebrate our 1 year anniversary during the Longs Peak Scotfest - so <br>
excited!<br>
