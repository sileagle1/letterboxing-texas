A lot has happened in TX LBing since I last passed through <br>
Austin a year ago. It's great to see. Thanks to all for the status <br>
reports during the year. I've completed all necessary <br>
maintenance on my Austin boxes and updated the clues. Here's <br>
the update:<br>
1. Mt Bonnell: new box, new stamp, very fat logbook. To those <br>
who left notes on slips of paper, thanks, but now there's a stamp <br>
and logbook for you. And I found a much bigger rock to hold the <br>
box in the crevice during the torrential rains. So if you were one of <br>
the disappointed boxers, please revisit this one. The view is <br>
great!<br>
2. Barton Creek Greenbelt: new, very fat logbook.<br>
3. 360 Bridge: "LB alert" note to geocachers (so they won't <br>
mistakenly take the stamp).<br>
4. Gunslinger: fatter logbook <br>
If anyone needs me to check an Austin LB for them, let me know <br>
and I'll see what I can do. Got a little more time here. The Brown <br>
Knight<br>
