Maybe I should check on ebay to see if someone is trying to sell an original "work of art"!  But it's not just me, they've also taken some of IRA Boxer's stamps. Of course, he thinks that's the deeds of a certain juvenile delinquent varmint (bear). :) <br/>

<div>Not recently, but occasionally in the past, and I usually suspected either a kid accidentally happening on the box and liking the contents, or perhaps someone who mistook it for a geocache (although, then you'd think they'd have left something behind in exchange)</div>

<div>I share your opinion, Boots.Â  I'm always grateful when someone "supplements" my logbooks until I can replace them, but I wouldn't want someone to replace my stamps.Â  Finders will assume the stamp they find is the original stamp, and I agree with your statement about the stamp being the soul of the box.Â  That's the original creative expression of the person who made that box and should be up to the planter to replace it -- or not.</div>

<blockquote>It's not a good idea to replace a stamp, at least in my opinion, although that's a very generous thought. If a logbook is missing or ruined, then putting a replacement log in the box is the thing to do, if you have one with you. But a stamp is the soul of the box. It's what you take with you (the image) to remember the beautiful or historic place or the wonderful hand-made logbook. I don't think it would be considered proper etiqutette to leave a replacement stamp. You should contact the placer and let them know the situation, but it would be up to them to replace the stamp if they so choose. Does anyone else have an opinion on the subject?<br/>

&gt; I found a box with nothing inside twice now. No log books no stamp. Just a box in its hiding place. I added a sheet for people to log into and wrote the placer of the box. I figure it might be the cemetery cleaning people. But that doesn't explain why the box is left and the insides taken out...<br/>
&gt; I'm going to start bringing my carving materials along so on boxes like this I can just replace everything. I will still let the placer know and it will be up to them if they want to replace my log and stamp with there own once again, but until then at least other finders will have a stamp and log to do. <br/>

&gt; It's not a good idea to replace a stamp, at least in my opinion, although that's a very generous thought.  If a logbook is missing or ruined, then putting a replacement log in the box is the thing to do, if you have one with you.  But a stamp is the soul of the box.  It's what you take with you (the image) to remember the beautiful or historic place or the wonderful hand-made logbook.  I don't think it would be considered proper etiqutette to leave a replacement stamp. You should contact the placer and let them know the situation, but it would be up to them to replace the stamp if they so choose.  Does anyone else have an opinion on the subject?<br/>

<div>Â I guess I've just ran across a bunch or boxes latelyÂ where the stampÂ had been replaced by someone else who came along and had an extra stamp. The original stamp that was missing had been cached. One box in Oatmeal was this was. Anyway, I thought it was kind of the person to have replaced the stamp seeing that the original placer hadn't gotten around to it (jb kokopelli). Here in Austin wilhime has a box cached and missing a stamp, and Bloomin Gramma Jo has one on the 360 bridgeÂ missing the stamp.Â There are a few others I just can't remember... But it anoyed me when there was no stamp. I wanted to recarve the original stamp to replace it but held back for fear of offending someone. So I left a HH in that box. At least someone will get a stamp out of it when they find it next.</div>
<div>Anyway, opps stamps sound like a great idea.</div>

<div>
<div>Dear D.A. (devil's advocate - and by the way, why is it so easy to picture you as the devil's advocate?),</div>
<div>My thought? I would much prefer someone just let me know my stamp was missing and let me choose to replace it or retire it. I've hadÂ the stamp taken from some of my boxes, and I chose toÂ retired most of those boxes. The reason was because the stamps that went missing (quite a few in a matter of a couple of months last year, which did make me suspicious) were the stars of the boxes. They were the stamps I was most pleased with, very detailed and in a couple of cases, took a long time to carve, so I chose not to replace them.</div>
<div>Other than a HH, I don't really like the idea of anything being added to my boxes. </div>
<div>I've only found a few boxes that had the stamp missing, and it is what it is. A little disappointing, but it's a <em>game,</em> so.... move on to the next box! I'm also a little disappointed when I land on Boardwalk and someone else's hotel is sitting on it, but I pay the price and roll the dice.</div>

<p>Because y'all know I like to play devil's advocate ---<br/><br/>What if.Â  A boxer were to carry a special sort of stamp they carve to place in a box where the stamp is gone or destroyed - say, an OOPS! stamp.Â  When they find a box with a missing stamp, they leave their OOPS stamp in the box as a temporary stop gap until the placer can replace the stamp.Â  Perhaps they could then keep the OOPS stamp for a similar occasion when they are out boxing, or they could return it to the carver.Â  <br/><br/>This makes it very clear that the stamp in the box isn't the intended stamp, but it gives a finder something to stamp in with when they find the box before the placer can replace the original.<br/><br/>I know a lot of folks get really disappointed if they can't stamp in because the stamp is gone. <br/><br/>I think the idea of leaving behind a temporary stamp until the placer can replace is a thoughtful gesture, but I also get why it isn't a good idea.Â  I don't think I would be offended if someone were to leave a stamp behind in one of my boxes so the next finder has a stamp to stamp in with, although I wouldn't really want them to try to emulate the spirit of the box.Â  <br/><br/>BUT THEN - if someone were to do this, would the next finder be able to consider the box a find because they didn't find the box/stamp/logbook combination they were looking for?Â  Hmmmm.....interesti<wbr/>ng.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/></p></div><!-- end group email --></blockquote></body></html>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My "Simple as Snow" box, stamp, and logbook all went missing at Hohlt Park in Brenham, but my "Please do not destroy" disclaimer had been thrown on the ground nearby.  D:  I think our hiding spot may not have been good, so we're going to try again.  The big downside is that I have to re-work the whole puzzle code for that one if I change its location.<br/>
<br/>
The Yellow Fever stamp and log has been gone both times we went, so we left a few sheets in the empty back in July, I think.  It's right up the street from us so I might check on it again.<br/>

&gt; It has been reported that the stamp and logbook are missing from my governor box in Bastrop, The Last Reb.  The empty box is still there.  Has this happened to anyone else lately?  It looks like whoever took the contents would have just taken the box as well.<br/>

<div>Interestingly enough, since I'm usually very opinionated, I find I don't have particular feelings one way or the other on this. I would NOT want someone carving a stamp intended to be a replacement for mine that went missing, and I would certainly want to be told my stamp is gone so I can make a decision for myself (and, like you, I would probably retire it because I don't really care to recarve something I've already carved - it never turns out like it did the first time, does it?). But I could see the kindness <span class="056553217-15042010">intended if someone were to put a simple "placeholder" stamp in my box until I could get to it, and I wouldn't be offended.</span>

<div><span class="056553217-15042010">And as y'all should well know, I'm not of the "all about the stamp" camp - I can be happy with the journey even if the stamp isn't there. </span></div>
