<div>Nooooo!  You had to bring up fabric scraps!   My mom 
had an entire ROOM stacked floor to ceiling with fabric scraps, including some 
pinned-and-cut-out sewing patterns for clothes for me that never got made, 
dating back to my teen-age years  (which would really make them 
antiques!).  Fortunately, I have a simple solution for fabric 
scraps - give them to PuddleSplasher!  She'll take anything and make 
something incredibly beautiful out of it and then sell it in an antique booth, 
stuffed with lavender or pieced into a quilt or throw or upholster furniture 
with it or something crafty!  So I personally only keep one, maybe two 
drawers, plus maybe a few shelves in a closet full of fabric scraps at any given 
time for my own possible future use.  </div>

<div><font size="2">One nice thing about the kids being grown and out of the house.... you can finally designate one of the rooms as a crafts room (at least if you're good and selfish like me). Problem is: my present craft room doesn't hold ALL my interests - painting, letterboxing, jewelry making, knitting, fabrics, yada, yada, yada! Almost two years ago, I remodeled my parents house and moved into it while waiting for my husband to retire from his job in Connecticut. He's been back since November, and now we are house hunting. I get a gleam in my eye every time I walk into a house with one of those big "whatever" rooms because I can see that soon I will be able to bring all those lovely plastic bins of fabric out of the garage and into the light!</font></div>

                    <html><body><div>I've said it before and I'll say it again - you have a wicked streak MO5!  Fabric scraps!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fabric isn't something I much use with Cub Scouts, but I keep all sorts of scraps on the eventuality that I will have a life outside of scouts one day - I even buy remnants at Walmart that I really like - because I have this idea that I can decoupage with fabric.  I used to sew quite well when I was younger (actually took sewing lessons!) and loved going to the store to pick a pattern and select a fabric, then prepare the fabric to sew.  The smell of the fabric running through the sewing machine was wonderful because the sewing machine would eventually warm up and make that smell that much more distinctive.  Now the extent of my sewing is stapling two pieces of fabric together if I have to.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night when She Who Reads and I were in Hobby Lobby, we strolled through the fabric section so I could buy a yard of brown felt to wrap stamps in.  While we were waiting to get it cut, two ladies were ahead of us with some exquisite silky stuff and they were very animated in their discussion of some decorating idea for a wedding in which that fabric was to be used.  I turned to SWR and said "Does it seem a little ironic that we are standing next to these women who are buying fabrics for a beautiful wedding and we are buying felt so that I can hide it in the woods?"

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Time for me to chime in too on this one.  I am the queen of too much <br>
craft stuff!  I have so many scraps and containers of all kinds it <br>
takes TWO rooms to hold them.  One is my stamp office - yeah, a whole <br>
room for stamping!  Paper racks and file cabinets and an entire tall <br>
cupboard for nothing but STAMPS!  All sorts of markers and ink pads <br>
and scrapbook acccesories galore.   Who needs a fancy dining room <br>
anyway.   I got so addicted that I had to make stamping into a job!  <br>
Now those cool beans spiral binding machine, laminating macines, and <br>
die-cutters are TAX writeoffs, yippee.    Brownie troop needs a last <br>
minute craft project? No problem and certainly no need to visit a <br>
store.<br>
<br>
Then there is my Quilt Studio also known as The-room-overflowing-with-<br>
fabric-and-other-miscellaneous-craft-stuff.  I have 3 machines, a <br>
flannel wall for projects in progress and a huge floor to ceiling <br>
stash of quilt fabric.   My dear sweet husband even built me a <br>
cutting table storage unit just like one a pro quilter had in her <br>
book!   Who needs guests anyway.  They can just sleep in one of the <br>
kids beds right?<br>
<br>
And sadly, I'm a sucker for boxes, jars, containers, and tins of all <br>
sizes too.  I have about 47 formula cans in the scary room just <br>
waiting for a project.  Plus an entire bin full of AOL CD cases,  <br>
Altoid tins, and International Coffee tins, that I just can't bear to <br>
pitch.  And those really cool Laughing cow cheese wedge circle <br>
boxes.  Oh the fun!<br>
<br>
Thank goodness for Flylady.  She has kept me in somewhat control.  <br>
She says you can't organize clutter.  True, but my craft goodies <br>
aren't clutter!!!!!<br>
