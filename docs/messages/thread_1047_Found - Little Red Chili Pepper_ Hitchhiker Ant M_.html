get out and box in spite of the heat.  Y'all have just<br/>
made it too good to resist!<br/>
<br/>
Was going to go out last night and find several, but<br/>
there were storms brewing overhead and we decided to<br/>
stay in.  My husband, the LSS, kept calling us<br/>
chickens and wimps until we verrrry patiently (NOT)<br/>
explained to him that it wasnt ourselves we were<br/>
worried about, but the log books.   Sheeshthe things<br/>
we have to explain to the unconvinced.  LOL<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, skies were clear this morning but work loomed,<br/>
so I managed to get out of the house really early,<br/>
stopped by Jack in the Box and grabbed something for<br/>
breakfast so I could hit a box, Little Red Chili<br/>
Pepper, between my house and my office in a neat<br/>
little rest area.  I landed myself at the rest area 20<br/>
minutes before I had to be at work and work was less<br/>
than a minute away  plenty of time!  I stepped out of<br/>
the car and heard the all-too-familiar cry of a<br/>
stranded kitten (my daughter, Elmo, is a stray animal<br/>
magnet).  Sure enough, out trotted a small abandoned<br/>
kitten and I began telling myself Im not gonna take<br/>
it ANYWHERE! like a mantra.  I had my doubts.<br/>
<br/>
I got myself to the box with kitten underfoot and I<br/>
dug it (the box  not the kitten) out of a very nice<br/>
little hiding spot.  Carried it to the nearby picnic<br/>
table and began unbuttoning it, only to find  a<br/>
hitchhiker - Ant M.  YEA!  I love finding HHs  like<br/>
who doesnt, right?  <br/>
<br/>
Ive figured out that TexasLuvBug (it was her box with<br/>
the kitten) carves nice stamps that need color, so I<br/>
had brought my markers with me.  Well, the kitten had<br/>
very kindly been going through my markers while I was<br/>
going through the box and most of my colors were on<br/>
the ground.  As I got down on my hands and knees to<br/>
pick up my markers, the kitten began crawling up on my<br/>
back and down my arms, like I was monkey bars.  Hmph.<br/>
<br/>
Finally, finally, I had everything I needed gathered<br/>
up to begin stamping in.  I started coloring my own<br/>
stamp so I could get the boxs logbook put away before<br/>
the kitten tracked its dirty little paws all over the<br/>
book (yes the same little paws it had been using to<br/>
climb all over my back).  I had to put the kitten on<br/>
the ground no less than 30 times in the stamping in<br/>
process and in the meantime, it was clawing its way up<br/>
my pants legs.  Finally got the boxs book stamped in<br/>
and put away, then I started on the boxs stamp in my<br/>
own logbook  and after another 30 or 40 times of<br/>
putting the kitten (who by the way, had eaten at least<br/>
half my breakfast by this point!) on the ground I<br/>
finally managed to finish stamping in!  I wasnt<br/>
having to chant my mantra any longer, because I knew<br/>
without a doubt that kitten wasnt going anywhere with<br/>
me!<br/>
<br/>
So nothing left but to hide the box back.  After the<br/>
stamping process, hiding should be easy.  Yes?  Right.<br/>
 I went back to the nice little hiding spot and began<br/>
sewing the box back in.  As I did, my hair hung down<br/>
in front of me and the kitten began using it to get up<br/>
close to my face  climbing my hair like it would<br/>
climb a tree.  Now that really was a little much!  I<br/>
at last got it hidden back in well enough, and Ill<br/>
have to go back later today after work to make it<br/>
right.  <br/>
Finally, I stood up and took a look at myself  a<br/>
hundred dirty little kitty tracks all over my light<br/>
khaki pants and my pale green shirt (not counting the<br/>
ones on my back  AND I was now running late.  I<br/>
brushed off as best I could (especially since the<br/>
kitten was still trying to climb my leg) and jumped in<br/>
my car to get on to work.  I got there one minute<br/>
late!  Fell in the door and my punctual co-workers<br/>
thought I mustve been chased by thieves or had a car<br/>
accident or something because I was so bedraggled<br/>
looking.  Who knew a tiny kitten could do so much<br/>
damage?<br/>
<br/>
Two things Ive learned from this experience:  First<br/>
and most important for all of us to know, apparently<br/>
TexasLuvBug and her boxes have an affinity to animals.<br/>
 First the one with the armadillo and now this one<br/>
with a kitten.  Im almost afraid to go hunt her next<br/>
one for fear Ill run into a rare East Texas Giant<br/>
Gorilla or something!<br/>
<br/>
Secondly, letterboxing before work is great!  <br/>
However, I suggest taking along a change of clothes<br/>
