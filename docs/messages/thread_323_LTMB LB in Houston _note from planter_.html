boxes (only 2 in TX). I try to keep my clues up to date with the <br/>
latest known status but as I live in Oregon, my status is only as <br/>
good as the reports I get, which so far have been pretty good - <br/>
thanks!<br/>
<br/>
There is opportunity for confusion with part of the deciphered clues <br/>
and I intend to add a note to my clues to clarify, as my intention <br/>
is that the clues should be pretty easy, once deciphered. I hope <br/>
this is the reason GroverMac didn't find the box, and not that it is <br/>
missing. Someone did report a find ~2 weeks ago. In any case the <br/>
clarification is as follows for those folks hunting before I update <br/>
my clue:<br/>
<br/>
I've gotten a report that there are two signs which match the <br/>
criteria in the clues. Start from the more westerly of the two signs.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Good Luck!<br/>
