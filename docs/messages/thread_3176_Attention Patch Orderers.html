                    <html><body><p>No, don't say that. I just went to the post office today and mailed a package that was a couple of weeks late as it is. <br/><br/>When I was driving to there, I was planning my day (remember, I get up no earlier than 3pm). I pictured walking into the post office, mailing my package and walking out. WRONG. I was there at least a half hour. I had to pull out all my patience skills. These people were mailing 5-10 packages each. I had one little letterbox (really 2 in one envelope because I'm smarter than these other people). What could they possibly be mailing in so many packages. Don't they know that the post office is for postals and Netflix? The absolute nerve of some people. And then, to show up at the same time as me. We won't even begin that rant and rave.<br/><br/>When did the world stop revolving around me? Why wasn't I informed of this catastrophe?<br/><br/>Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/><br/><b><i>Barefoot Lucy &lt;barefootlucy@gmail.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:</p><blockquote> <div id="ygrp-text"> <div></div><div>Well - I wasn't going to say this, but I think it's far more sinister than just a USPS mess up.  I think it was BEA's at work.  Think Men in Black and it all starts to make sense.  I hope all those postal letterboxers out there do a good job of disguising the boxes they mail. </div> <div> </div> <div> </div> <div><br/><br/> </div> <div class="gmail_quote">On Nov 12, 2007 11:41 PM, janet clark &lt;<a href="mailto:jayceeinbedford@yahoo.com">jayceeinbedford@<wbr/>yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/> <blockquote> <div> <div> <div> <div> <div> </div><div>Sad little patches.
