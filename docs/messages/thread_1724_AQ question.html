<div>Hey all!  I planted a new box today, and the clues 
include a photo.  I am trying to upload the photo to the clue page on AQ, 
but can't seem to get it to work.  Anyone out there have any 
suggestions?  Thanks for any help you can give...I am excited about this 
box, and can't wait to get the clues out there!

<div>Ok all you AQ users out 
there, I need some help.  I listed a box on AQ (Spinning in Circles) and I 
thought I had checked the box to link to LBNA (I did NOT actually check the box) 
can I go back and fix it now?  AQ has so many features it has me just a 
little confused.  (Of course, living in the total chaos that is my life 
could have something to do with the confusion as well!)  Thanks in advance 
for you help!  MO5</div></body></html>

Add a letterbox.  Copy the URL to your clue on atlasquest.com (make<br/>
sure you are copying the actual AQ clue page, not just aq.com) into<br/>
the link section of the "add a letterbox" page that comes up on<br/>
letterboxing.org.  If you check the little box that says link to this<br/>
automatically, it'll go straight from the page of clue listings to the<br/>
clue on AQ.  Otherwise, it'll create an LBNA page for your box and<br/>
there will be a clickable link on it that will take you to atlasquest.<br/>
<br/>
Clear?<br/>
<br/>
You can also do it the other way and create a link on atlasquest if<br/>
you want to keep the primary clue on LBNA.  All my older box clues are<br/>
on LBNA, most of my new ones are on Atlasquest.<br/>

No, that option only works when you enter your clue on AQ -- when <br/>
you're finished there, it takes you to the LbNA site where it <br/>
pre-populates many of the fields to help you list it there. Since <br/>
you've already entered it on AQ, you have to enter it again from <br/>
scratch on LbNA.<br/>
