                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey guys- I had the occasion to LB in the Kerrville area this past <br/>
weekend! What fun!!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, Silver Eagle- I found your 13th Floor Musicians box without <br/>
any trouble. The logbook though- was damp and unfortunately most of <br/>
the images have melted away into smears of rainbow colors. :-( I <br/>
guess any of you LBers who have been to this box- you might just <br/>
have to go back and stamp your image again. ;-) But otherwise, the <br/>
box is intact and doing fine.<br/>
<br/>
Baby Bear- I found your Honest Abe box too- great stamp! The box was <br/>
just laying on the ground in plain sight by the tree- and the lid is <br/>
cracked (with a hole in it) but everything inside was completely dry <br/>
and fine. I put it back up 'in' the tree and off the ground when I <br/>
left it.  And is your "Park Ranger" LB gone? I had the clues printed <br/>
out from the computer awhile back so I went to look for it on this <br/>
trip, but didn't find it. And now it seems that the clues aren't <br/>
online anymore anyway (If I'm not confusing your box with something <br/>
else I looked at)- so I assume maybe it's been MIA for awhile. <br/>
<br/>
And Baby Bear- are you Angi too? I found the Stonehenge II box on my <br/>
trip, too. The baggie covering the whole thing needs to be replaced, <br/>
but the box itself and the contents are fine. I thought I had some <br/>
extra baggies with me to replace it, but all my ziplocks were the <br/>
smaller size. The location was a neat place. And the whole <br/>
Stonehenge thing was crazy! So many neat things I'd never see if it <br/>
weren't for LB (or geocaching) to take me out there. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks for your boxes, guys!! They were all fun. :-)<br/>
