<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Don't be discouraged Stargazer, boxes do go 
missing.  It is an awful feeling, believe me, I know.  Sometimes they 
can be washed away, sometimes animals find them, sometimes they are found by 
accident, and who knows what else happens to them.  Just about everyone who 
has planted a box has also lost a box.  All you can do is try to find a 
more secure hiding spot the next time, but remember that boxes can disappear 
from even the perfect hiding spot.  I was so tired of losing boxes that I 
hid one so "well" that several veteran boxers couldn't find it...I wouldn't 
recommend that as a solution though!  Sorry for your box...I bet many on 
this list will blame it on the BEAs.  -Mother of 
Five</font></div></body></html>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Speaking of....</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">We went to many of the Terrors of Telge boxes on 
Sunday and had a wonderful time, and especially liked putting Mr. Bones back 
together...  Though an animal of some sort had gotten a hold of his arm and 
the box as open with the pieces scattered...  There are teeth marks on the 
box, but we were able to find all of the pieces and put the box where it 
belonged (after stamping, of course!!)..  So just a word of warning..  
Hopefully the animal that had it is done messing with it!!  And I have to 
say that I like Bananas but I'll settle for some bugs was very clever!  And 
another word of warning...  The Telge Tarantula is being guarded by some 
fire ants that were not real happy about giving it up.... ouch...  Anyway, 
thanks to everyone that put that together, we still have a few boxes to find and 
hope to do so by this weekend...</font></div>

<div>Most people get better at hiding boxes with experience, but it will almost always happen at some point. It can be really upsetting, but it's something that sometimes comes along with the territory. If you truly love the hobby, ya gotta deal with it! Stinks, but whataya gonna do? &lt;s&gt; </div>
