I get the biggest kick out of coming back to my computer after a weekend<br>
away and finding out that we have even more NEW boxes around Texas! Thank<br>
you, Hawk, Kantexan, Gingercat and a special thanks to the Cupcake Kid! <br>
Our weekend was absolutely gorgeous - we went camping in Possum Kingdom<br>
State park. My husband and sons had all camped there with Indian Guides and<br>
Scouts and at the YMCA camp Grady Spruce, but I hadn't - it's a beautiful<br>
area and well worth the trip. We loved all the delicate little deer<br>
wandering around, and the scent of the cedar trees was wonderful. (And<br>
Cactus Licker found several varieties of cactus to interest him!)<br>
We placed one letterbox in Possum Kingdom (imaginatively titled "Possum<br>
Kingdom";-))one in the Caddo Cemetery nearby and one in a truly fascinating<br>
State Park about an hour further west: Fort Griffin...how could anyone<br>
resist walking the grounds of the saloon where Wyatt Earp first met Doc<br>
Holliday???<br>
One thing that struck us forcibly all over again was how completely<br>
different Texas is when you drive in any direction - we are so lucky to live<br>
in a state that has such contrasts! A couple of weeks ago we did a tour of<br>
East Texas pineywoods and a couple of months earlier we were down on the<br>
Gulf Coast. And we're very much looking forward to alligator country in<br>
March! <br>
