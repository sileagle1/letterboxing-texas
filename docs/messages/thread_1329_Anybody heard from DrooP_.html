myself.<br/>
<br/>
We lost power about 11 a.m. yesterday and expect to be<br/>
without it until Tuesday, according to the power<br/>
company.  I feel much worse today than I did<br/>
yesterday, probably because of the heat and the<br/>
humidity at home.  I'm at my husband's office right<br/>
now and will stay and hang out here until fairly late<br/>
this evening.  I'm going to go take a nap on the couch<br/>
after I hit send...<br/>
<br/>
Lots of trees in our town were broken, and several<br/>
were even uprooted.  Lots of tree damage everywhere,<br/>
although not nearly as much as we usually see during a<br/>
winter storm.  We were fortunate, I guess, because we<br/>
have a yard full of big old oaks and pecans and didn't<br/>
lose a single limb - not even any large branches.<br/>
<br/>
My sister-in-law lives where Blue Butterfly lives and<br/>
they apparently got the worst of all of us up in this<br/>
area.  I talked to her this morning and she said they<br/>
are going to be without power until Tuesday also.  She<br/>
had a houseful of evacuees (her husband's family all<br/>
live down along the coast), and it sounded pretty<br/>
chaotic when I talked to her.<br/>
<br/>
My mother-in-law and my husband wound up being in<br/>
charge of the ARC shelter and they started running<br/>
into problems with folks wanting to leave and go home<br/>
first thing yesterday morning after it was clear the<br/>
hurricane had missed Houston.  They didn't understand<br/>
that DPS had roads closed not too far south of here<br/>
and that there was no gas on the way either.  Some of<br/>
them stayed after they were told about the situation,<br/>
but others left only to return a few hours later.  I'm<br/>
particularly worried about my mother-in-law, who<br/>
suffers from fibromyalgia.  She has been going for<br/>
pretty much three days solid now, and if you know<br/>
anything about fibro, you know that rest is of<br/>
critical importance to staying healthy with that<br/>
disease.  I talked to her yesterday and she says she<br/>
is listening to her body, so hopefully she won't<br/>
crater after this is said and done.  I really admire<br/>
her - she has a huge heart for people and this sort of<br/>
thing is right up her alley.  She has a way of making<br/>
people feel better about their situation no matter<br/>
what it is.<br/>

&gt; No power until Tuesday is really rough! That was my<br/>
&gt; greatest worry: did I<br/>
&gt; have enough water to keep everyone half-way<br/>
&gt; comfortable if we lost power and<br/>
&gt; had to deal with the heat and humidity. Take care of<br/>
&gt; yourself and try to<br/>
&gt; stay cool.<br/>

&gt; I was hoping to log on and find DrooP had checked in<br/>
&gt; myself.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We lost power about 11 a.m. yesterday and expect to<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; without it until Tuesday, according to the power<br/>
&gt; company.  I feel much worse today than I did<br/>
&gt; yesterday, probably because of the heat and the<br/>
&gt; humidity at home.  I'm at my husband's office right<br/>
&gt; now and will stay and hang out here until fairly<br/>
&gt; late<br/>
&gt; this evening.  I'm going to go take a nap on the<br/>
&gt; couch<br/>
&gt; after I hit send...<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lots of trees in our town were broken, and several<br/>
&gt; were even uprooted.  Lots of tree damage everywhere,<br/>
&gt; although not nearly as much as we usually see during<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; winter storm.  We were fortunate, I guess, because<br/>
&gt; we<br/>
&gt; have a yard full of big old oaks and pecans and<br/>
&gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; lose a single limb - not even any large branches.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My sister-in-law lives where Blue Butterfly lives<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; they apparently got the worst of all of us up in<br/>
&gt; this<br/>
&gt; area.  ! I talked to her this morning and she said<br/>
&gt; they<br/>
&gt; are going to be without power until Tuesday also. <br/>
&gt; She<br/>
&gt; had a houseful of evacuees (her husband's family all<br/>
&gt; live down along the coast), and it sounded pretty<br/>
&gt; chaotic when I talked to her.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; My mother-in-law and my husband wound up being in<br/>
&gt; charge of the ARC shelter and they started running<br/>
&gt; into problems with folks wanting to leave and go<br/>
&gt; home<br/>
&gt; first thing yesterday morning after it was clear the<br/>
&gt; hurricane had missed Houston.  They didn't<br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; that DPS had roads closed not too far south of here<br/>
&gt; and that there was no gas on the way either.  Some<br/>
&gt; of<br/>
&gt; them stayed after they were told about the<br/>
&gt; situation,<br/>
&gt; but others left only to return a few hours later. <br/>
&gt; I'm<br/>
&gt; particularly worried about my mother-in-law, who<br/>
&gt; suffers from fibromyalgia.  She has been going for<br/>
&gt; pretty much three days solid now, and if you know<br/>
&gt; anything about fibro, you know that rest is of<br/>
&gt; criti! cal importance to staying healthy with that<br/>
&gt; disease.  I talked to her yesterday and she says she<br/>
&gt; is listening to her body, so hopefully she won't<br/>
