                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was hoping to log on and find DrooP had checked in<br>
myself.<br>
<br>
We lost power about 11 a.m. yesterday and expect to be<br>
without it until Tuesday, according to the power<br>
company.  I feel much worse today than I did<br>
yesterday, probably because of the heat and the<br>
humidity at home.  I'm at my husband's office right<br>
now and will stay and hang out here until fairly late<br>
this evening.  I'm going to go take a nap on the couch<br>
after I hit send...<br>
<br>
Lots of trees in our town were broken, and several<br>
were even uprooted.  Lots of tree damage everywhere,<br>
although not nearly as much as we usually see during a<br>
winter storm.  We were fortunate, I guess, because we<br>
have a yard full of big old oaks and pecans and didn't<br>
lose a single limb - not even any large branches.<br>
<br>
My sister-in-law lives where Blue Butterfly lives and<br>
they apparently got the worst of all of us up in this<br>
area.  I talked to her this morning and she said they<br>
are going to be without power until Tuesday also.  She<br>
had a houseful of evacuees (her husband's family all<br>
live down along the coast), and it sounded pretty<br>
chaotic when I talked to her.<br>
<br>
My mother-in-law and my husband wound up being in<br>
charge of the ARC shelter and they started running<br>
into problems with folks wanting to leave and go home<br>
first thing yesterday morning after it was clear the<br>
hurricane had missed Houston.  They didn't understand<br>
that DPS had roads closed not too far south of here<br>
and that there was no gas on the way either.  Some of<br>
them stayed after they were told about the situation,<br>
but others left only to return a few hours later.  I'm<br>
particularly worried about my mother-in-law, who<br>
suffers from fibromyalgia.  She has been going for<br>
pretty much three days solid now, and if you know<br>
anything about fibro, you know that rest is of<br>
critical importance to staying healthy with that<br>
disease.  I talked to her yesterday and she says she<br>
is listening to her body, so hopefully she won't<br>
crater after this is said and done.  I really admire<br>
her - she has a huge heart for people and this sort of<br>
thing is right up her alley.  She has a way of making<br>
people feel better about their situation no matter<br>
what it is.<br>

<div>No power until Tuesday is really rough! That was my greatest worry: did I have enough water to keep everyone half-way comfortable if we lost power and had to deal with the heat and humidity. Take care of yourself and try to stay cool.</div>
