<div>Whiz Gee and I went on a letterboxing adventure this 
weekend.  It all started when I deciphered the clues to the Original 
Gryzzled Gryphon Box.   This emboldened me to try to decipher other 
Gryzzled Gryphon box clues, and I figured out a few more.  Whiz Gee decided 
that we should plan a letterboxing trip around finding Gryzzled Gryphon 
boxes.  Since one of our most fun letterboxing days was spent driving 
300 miles in one day to find boxes by Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter, this 
sounded like a great idea.  I decided to add other Mystery Boxes to our 
quest, so it became the Great Gryzzled Gryphon/Magical Mystery Box Tour of 
2010.</div>
<div>We traveled 800 miles in three and a half 
days, and hiked for miles on trails.  We discovered parts of Texas we 
never would have visited otherwise, and Texas State Parks that we'd never heard 
of, including Fort Parker State Park -- a wonderful jewel.  It was fun 
to be on a quest, even if it was comically quixotic at times.  We 
only found three of the six Gryzzled Gryphon boxes that we had set our sights 
on, and only four out of the other seven Mystery Boxes we hunted.  However, 
in all we found 37 letterboxes, and enjoyed our Texas tour.  But, I have to 
admit we are really tired today!</div>

<div>It IS enormously satisfying to finally figure out a 
tricky mystery clue, as well as enormously frustrating to be 
unable to figure out a mystery clue!  I flat out do not have the tools 
to figure out some of these mystery box clues.  However, it is truly 
obvious that you will never figure them out if you dont try!  "You 
must play to win."  I wish I had started trying sooner!</div>
