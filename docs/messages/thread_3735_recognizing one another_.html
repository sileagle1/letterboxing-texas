<br/>
not that I have ever met another boxer on the trail, not as far as I know, but in case I might some day, I want to be ready and know what to do, or what to look for!<br/>

<div>I've never asked the "north" question either, because so few people know about it, I don't think it means someone is a letterboxer or not. I've sometimes asked people out-right if they were letterboxing, because if they weren't.... what difference does it make? They'd have no idea what I was talking about. I had someone ask me once of the trail if I were geocaching and I told her no, but I'd read about it. Then I asked her if she'd heard of letterboxing, and she said she'd "read about it". Kind of funny.</div>

were called, they said the Smith family.  He said oh, we are the <br/>
Jones, but we also go by The Duck Ducks.  The guy just looked at us <br/>
funny.  The one other time we ran into this, we just flat out asked if <br/>
they were boxing and they said yes.  We got our first and only <br/>
