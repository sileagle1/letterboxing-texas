This is a travelling box that will be found and re hidden in various locations of Houston. If you find it, grab it and take it home, enjoy it, then carve you own stamp and re-hide it in your favorite spot in Houston! Once found please e mail me asap so I can update the clue page. <br/>
<br/>
The box has been re-planted!!!! It is at The Flower Man's House, 2305 Frances. <br/>
<br/>
The Flower Man was lost in an alcoholic haze for years. Then, when he got really sick and spent a week or so in the hospital, he had an epiphany and saw a vision of a beautiful house covered with flower folk art. He determined never to drink again and to spend his time creating his vision. Some 20 or so years later, he is still sober and creating wild and wacky folk art! <br/>
