<div>Just returned from a little drive to Southlake for some box maintenance on two of my older boxes:  Lonesome Dove and Bat! Back at the Bathouse!.  Both had suffered from exposure (box left unsealed or top missing, baggies unsealed, logs soaked, but stamps still in great shape).  </div>
<div> Bat! -- A recent finder of Bat had generously replaced the container and logbook (was it you, Basketcase?), so I just replaced the baggies.  The box is now resting UNDER the cedar tree on the ground, where apparently it prefers to be, rather than wedged in the branches, and clues have been changed accordingly.</div>
<div>Lonesome Dove -- This is one of my first boxes, planted in spring 2005, when this little historic cemetery was pretty much in the country out there in the small area known as Southlake.  Now, of course, that's not the case!  But it's still a quiet, peaceful, and interesting place.  I replaced the box, baggies, and new logbook.  Also a small correction to clues: one of the references was to Vallie Ada, which, now that the tombstone has been cleaned somewhat, I noted should be WIllie Ada.  Apparently it makes no difference in finding the box, as it has been found many many times over the years.  I will correct the clues, though, for future finders.</div>

<div>Thanks, Basketcase!  Apparently the container at Lonesome Dove wasn't watertight, then, because that little logbook was completely soaked too (I wondered why it hadn't been stamped since the last time I'd replaced it, except by you.  Duh.)  Good thing I replaced the container, too, this time.  Thanks for your thoughtfulness.  Now I wonder about that Bat container!  Did I just forget about replacing it before, or did some other kind letterboxer replace it for me?  One of the little mysteries of letterboxing!</div>
