                    <html><body><p>This is the weirdest thing ever. The bus, according to my sources, has been <i>abducted by aliens</i>. I have no idea where it is now, but I heard that it was last seen near the site of an alien spaceship pilot's grave in Aurora. Rumor has it that in this cemetery (Cemetery Road, off of E Highway 114) near the spaceship pilot's crash site, there is an outdoor chapel with pews and a lectern. Just southwest of this chapel is the Logan family plot.

<br/>IN ADDITION: the space alien itself may just be hiding somewhere in this cemetery as well. You can read about the space alien on the sign near the main pedestrian entrance to the cemetery (along with some other fascinating information about the cemetery's bizarre history). After getting yer edumacashun there, you just might want to traipse along eastwards through the gate and up the path until you see Clarence Harmon's headstone. Due north of there, you will observe (if you are observant) a crape myrtle giving some shade to Litha and Simeon. This myrtle has a lot of rubbish nestled down in its base, and just might be hiding a... Space Alien!<br/>
<br/>So there you have it. A tour bus and an alien, all in one fell swoop. The tour bus is of course wanting to continue touring. The alien is happy where it is and would like to remain in the cemetery, so please recover and hide it well. <br/>

I know you haven't heard from me in quite a while....that's because I was abducted by aliens! Yes, I know thats hard to believe but why else would you not have heard from me for so long!!!! As luck would have it, I have extolled the virtues of letterboxing with out far out friends and they were so kind as to send me back to earth right where they dropped off their friend. They told me they would have a bus full of rowdy Texans that I could catch a ride with. So here I am back in Cowtown!  They said we would be staying here for a night or two and then heading out. I will let you know where we end up.   Monarch B<br/><br/>--- On <b>Fri, 5/22/09, M Duff <i>&lt;allyall@yahoo.com&gt;</i></b> wrote:<br/>
