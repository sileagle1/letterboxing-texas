                    <html><body><div><a href="http://letterboxing.org/" target="_blank">Letterboxing.org</a> (LBNA) and Atlasquest (AQ) are different in their core philosophy.  LBNA is what was eventually borne out of the need to be able to put clues where other folks could find them (to put this in historical terms, we're sort of starting with the discovery of fire here and forgetting that there was life before fire).  Silver Eagle and Baby Bear remember the time before LBNA as we know it, which came along well before AQ.  The whole sum purpose of LBNA was, and is, to be a clue repository.  Over time they've added a few features for tracking and logging, but by and large these functions are secondary on LBNA.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>AQ was created by Ryan as a response to the cries of finders primarily who wanted to be able to keep online logbooks.  What he has created has wound up being a whole community - chat boards, mapping features, a mail function, listings for all the variations of letterboxing that have come along, extensive listings for both placers and finders, flagging opportunities, articles about letterboxing - you name it.  It's slick and appealing.  Ryan has done a great job with it!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So why would someone want to use LBNA anymore?  Well in my case, I am too much of a computer geek to use AQ - I could spend hours there and never even know it, AND never go letterboxing.  When I want to go letterboxing, I simply want to go to the database and get the clues.  I want to do my own thinking beyond that.  The bells and whistles are nice, but they keep me from letterboxing.  Other LBNA folks feel strongly about keeping the game "the way it was".  I kinda like the way it was myself, but I'm not terribly averse to change, as long as it makes sense and it isn't change for the sake of change.  Some LBNA folks prefer county searches over city searches - this seems to be a rural vs. urban issue.  Some folks were on LBNA before there was AQ and it is a matter of loyalty.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's good to know them both and eventually you will develop a preference for one or the other.  Just don't forget how to use the other one!</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"
