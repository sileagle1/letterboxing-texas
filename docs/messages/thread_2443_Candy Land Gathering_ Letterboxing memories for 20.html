finding the gingerbreadmen and playing Candy Land. My kids were<br/>
impressed with the number of stamps we were able to put into our<br/>
logbook. We also found two other boxes(the reason we went to the<br/>
park)and over all had a great day!<br/>
<br/>
Memories of our Letterboxing adventure for 2006<br/>
1. Finding out about letterboxing from a dieting site<br/>
2. Our first find at Meyer Park.<br/>
3. Being able to find cool places on our spring break driving trip to<br/>
the 4 corners. Especially Rock City!!!<br/>
4. Spending time with my husband and kids doing something different<br/>
and fun.<br/>
Letterboxing Resolutions for 2007<br/>
1. Plant our first box<br/>
2. Introduce letterboxing to my daughters girl scout troop<br/>
3. Have fun....<br/>
<br/>
See you all on the trails<br/>
