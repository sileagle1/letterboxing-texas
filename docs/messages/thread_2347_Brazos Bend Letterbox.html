                    <div class="plaintext-content">I was at Brazos Bend SP yesterday with my Boy Scout to enjoy the Old <br>
Time Christmas celebration.  There were people dressed in 1800's garb <br>
showing old-time kid games and toys, and homemade dutch oven cobbler to <br>
go with hot cider.  It was fun and I barely had time to check on my box <br>
before dark.  It was laying out in the open, full of water, but at <br>
least still there.  This is my second placed box and first carved <br>
stamp, so I'm glad the stamp is still there (even though it isn't <br>
great, the first one you carve is special).  I was not able to dry the <br>
log very much, so I rebagged it and rehid the box.  I will try to <br>
replace the log next time I'm out there.  I hope the log is readable <br>
when it drys since there are many entries in the 4 years it has been <br>
out there.<br>

P.S.  Here is an example of a post that might have gone to the Houston-<br>
area List intead of the TX list.  I'm still not sure which one I would <br>
have posted to.<br>
