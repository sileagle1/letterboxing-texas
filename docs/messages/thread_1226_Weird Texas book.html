&gt;On another note, if you guys haven't been to a book store lately,<br/>
&gt;there is a new book out by the two Marks on TV that have that Weird<br/>
&gt;U.S. show called Weird Texas!<br/>
&gt;I bought it two days ago and can't put it down.  I think practically<br/>
&gt;every place mentioned in the book is just screaming for a letterbox!<br/>
&gt;Ruby Tuesday will even chuckle when she sees the page dedicated to<br/>
&gt;Goff's Hamburgers and the Lenin statue!  There are quirky things in<br/>
&gt;there from all over the state.  Now I finally know what the Houston<br/>
&gt;boxers were talking about when they mentioned the Orange Show.<br/>
