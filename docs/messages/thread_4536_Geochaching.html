                    <div class="plaintext-content">My experience has been that State Parks are not even aware of the existence of letterboxing until they come across a box or someone, like me, approaches them about it.  They all know about geocaching, though, and, as you can see, are seemingly embracing it.  I guess those guys have a better PR department than we do.  But, in my opinion, that's a good thing. I have a hard time with the fact that rules are in place concerning letterboxes and permits are required by regulation, and that by ignoring the rules I am somehow in violation.  On the other hand, it has been sometimes difficult to get park rangers and employees to respect our hobby, mostly because, as Silver Eagle said, they don't understand it.  I have tried to get someone on the state level at TPWD to give me audience to discuss the concept of letterboxing, but haven't been succussful.  I have come to the conclusion that, again as SE said, we should carry on letterboxing as usual and be as stealthy as we can, which is in the tradition of the game.  If they catch on amd think it's worth their time and effort to clamp down on us by insisting on permits or confiscating boxes, then maybe that will be our opportunity to talk to them about letterboxing.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mike, I posted my first response before I read yours, but let me say this:  I agree with what you say, but what has worked for you in El Paso, has not worked for me in East Texas.  I have tried to open up a dialog with Rangers in four state parks in my area and have been met mostly with apathy.  I have been told that I just need to permit my letterboxes, but when I try to schedule a meeting, they are always too busy or refer me to an underling who again brushes me off.  It took me 3 months to get a permit for my boxes at Huntsville State Park.  I tried to explain why that wouldn't work for most people and that if a permit was required, it should be granted (or not) in a timely manner.  I am aware that I don't have your presence and authority and don't have as much in common with park rangers as you do, but they have not been cooperative with me.  To them, letterboxing is too trivial to be bothered with.  I have come prepared with a new letterbox to show them what a letterbox looks like and how it can bring people to the park and most of them don't even give me the courtesy of looking at it.  If they won't talk to you, how can you make them see the difference between a letterbox and a geocache?  Would you be willing, and I'm being serious, to represent letterboxing on a state level as our liason to Texas Parks and Wildlife?  <br/>

&gt; Mike, I posted my first response before I read yours, but let me say this:  I agree with what you say, but what has worked for you in El Paso, has not worked for me in East Texas.  I have tried to open up a dialog with Rangers in four state parks in my area and have been met mostly with apathy.  I have been told that I just need to permit my letterboxes, but when I try to schedule a meeting, they are always too busy or refer me to an underling who again brushes me off.  It took me 3 months to get a permit for my boxes at Huntsville State Park.  I tried to explain why that wouldn't work for most people and that if a permit was required, it should be granted (or not) in a timely manner.  I am aware that I don't have your presence and authority and don't have as much in common with park rangers as you do, but they have not been cooperative with me.  To them, letterboxing is too trivial to be bothered with.  I have come prepared with a new letterbox to show them what a letterbox looks like and how it can bring people to the park and most of them don't even give me the courtesy of looking at it.  If they won't talk to you, how can you make them see the difference between a letterbox and a geocache?  Would you be willing, and I'm being serious, to represent letterboxing on a state level as our liason to Texas Parks and Wildlife?  <br/>
