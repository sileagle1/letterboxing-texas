P.S.  I think the map is a good idea for the Event, but could be controversial for future use.  I guess if you post it to your Blog and maybe the Files section of this list, then only those people willing to dig for it will use it.  Maybe you could put a Spoiler Alert at the top of it.<br/>

&gt; Wow! You've gone to a lot of effort to make the most out of maintenance<br/>
&gt; time. Kudos! I think it's great to keep an eye on your boxes (and help take<br/>
&gt; care of those whose owners have not kept up on their own). Ones in<br/>
&gt; disrepair are just litter and it's extremely irritating to see un-archived<br/>
&gt; listings for boxes that are obviously missing or the stamp is in such bad<br/>
&gt; shape that it can't be used. Use it or lose it, right? :)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If boxes have directional clues and are not meant to be hard puzzles or<br/>
&gt; specifically say "do not share this clue", then I think all is good with<br/>
&gt; your map. It just gives a general idea of the area anyway. If someone has<br/>
&gt; issues, they can come check on their own.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I hope it works out that I can join y'all, but I'm not sure yet.<br/>
