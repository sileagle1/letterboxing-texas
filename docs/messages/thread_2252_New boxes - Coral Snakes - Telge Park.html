As for coral snakes in the area of Telge Park - they are there. 
The last time we were there, there was one on the main trail that
someone had killed.  Scared me to no end - even if it was dead -
my kids thought it was really cool though - YUCK!!<br/>

&gt;Has anyone heard from Frye Team  lately?  We tried to contact &gt;them about the logbook, but haven't heard back.

separate the pages and dry it out, but some of the images were lost.  And of <br/>
course the pages don't want to lay flat, although placing them under a stack <br/>
of books might help.   I can bring it tomorrow or mail it to you.  Or I <br/>
could try to flaten the pages, then put it back into the box.  Just let me <br/>
know.<br/>

Most of what I really need to know about how to live, and what to do, and <br/>
how to be, I learned in Kindergarten. Wisdom was not at the top of the <br/>
graduate school mountain, but there in the sandbox at nursery school. -- <br/>
