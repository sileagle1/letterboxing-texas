letterbox hidden at the pavilion during the GBA?<br/>
<br/>
A true, but funny story.  I forgot to pick up this particular box<br/>
after the event.  It was an altoids tin, wrapped in BROWN duct tape<br/>
and attached via magnets to one of the pavilion pillars.  It was not<br/>
immediately obvious, but the box didn't exactly blend into the pillar<br/>
either.  <br/>
<br/>
So, when I finally got back there, more than 6 weeks later, it was<br/>
still there, hanging on the pillar, just waiting for me to find it.  I<br/>
was curious how many other events had happened at that pavilion.  I<br/>
was really curious how long it might stay, but I picked it up anyway.<br/>
<br/>
No one had stamped in, so I'm curious if anyone found it or if it went<br/>
unfound.<br/>
<br/>
I may have to use this hiding method again--it seemed to work very well!<br/>
