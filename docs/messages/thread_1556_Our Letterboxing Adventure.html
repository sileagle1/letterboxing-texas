<div>Today, the Frye Team girls and I went on a letterboxing adventure!  It 
was my last day off before school starts up again next week, so we went in 
search of several letterboxes!  <br/></div>
<div>Ones we found:</div>
<div>San Jacinto Letterbox- walking through waist high to shoulder high weeds 
with one of the Frye girls on my back was my strength workout for the day!  
We did find the letterbox, although it was opened and the contents were strewn 
about.  The logbook was totally waterlogged so we weren't able to stamp 
in.  We dried off the stamp and replaced the bag, cleaned out the box and 
put it back where it was supposed to be.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Peanuts: Tickling the Ivories Letterbox - Anything involving the Peanuts 
characters is right up my alley!  Cute stamp and a nice place to sit and 
stamp in!  While walking back to the car, we saw dozens of Roseate 
Spoonbills flying around.  Awesome!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Jerry Letterbox- great hiding spot!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Strawberry Fields Forever- the girls liked the stamp!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Don Key- since we had already eaten lunch, we stopped in for chips and 
salsa to go!  Fun place and we will have to go back!  The stamp was in 
good condition but the logbook was waterlogged and very dirty to the point that 
the paper was crumbling inside the microbox.  Looks like the back lamp post 
where the letterbox resides is also the dumping grounds for the plastic plant 
containers used for landscaping!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Long Tall Texan- First Finders and a WAY cool stamp!!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We were unable to get the Battleship Texas letterbox.  It seemed to be 
missing from it's location.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Tomorrow, my husband and I are going out to Austin to run, plant a 
letterbox and search for letterboxes in the Austin area.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Enjoy the rest of 2005!</div>

I just want to mention one thing, that in a previous sitrep Lightnin<br/>
Bug had mentioned that they had closed the trail in the section of the<br/>
park where the San  Jacinto box is and were letting it revert to its<br/>
natural prairie state.  I am of course glad that the girl power team<br/>
rescued the box, but I would urge others to consider carefully before<br/>
going after this one.  (haven't seen for myself, so can't say for sure)<br/>
<br/>
I am always worried that the state park officials will come down hard<br/>
on our little fun activity, and I think as long as we're respectful of<br/>
delicate environments we can better defend our hobby as a responsible<br/>
one.  Of course the trampling that the prairie took from the buffalo<br/>
helped it grow stronger, but I doubt park officials would see it that way!<br/>
<br/>
Always a balancing act, huh?  Protecting and enjoying nature. . .<br/>

I always like the points you make - and I think it<br/>
would be good to get a wider range of views on what<br/>
you mention.<br/>
<br/>
I've been thinking about regulatory type officials<br/>
quite a lot lately.  We are very fortunate that we<br/>
have virtually no regulation, but I have to wonder how<br/>
much longer we have to enjoy that privilege.  <br/>
<br/>
I think that if we as a community present ourselves in<br/>
a responsible, considerate manner, we'll go further<br/>
without rules than if we consider ourselves as "just<br/>
folks out for a walk".  I think it's really important<br/>
that we are environmentally aware both as we plant and<br/>
as we find, and that we have a broader view of the<br/>
effect of our hobby beyond just what we ourselves as<br/>
individuals are doing on a day to day basis.  I think<br/>
we are basically there, that most of us know we don't<br/>
want to cause harm and we want to be smarter about how<br/>
we go about letterboxing.  I'm still not sure we are<br/>
thinking "big picture" though.<br/>
<br/>
Can we prove to outsiders that we think along<br/>
conservation-related lines?  If someone were to hold a<br/>
hearing tomorrow to determine whether letterboxing<br/>
should be regulated in state parks, how would we as a<br/>
group defend ourselves against regulation?  What<br/>
evidence could we use to demonstrate our care for the<br/>
environment and our efforts to minimize our effect? <br/>
How many of us know the principles of Leave No Trace -<br/>
and follow them?<br/>
<br/>
Just a few questions to throw out on a Saturday<br/>
morning...and now I'm off to clean house for an hour<br/>
before I reward myself with getting out and about and<br/>
maybe even finding another box or two.  I got a new<br/>
logbook for Christmas from SJZ, but I promised myself<br/>
I would use the one I have until the end of the year,<br/>
so today is the last day!<br/>

I think this is a very interesting point, also!  How WOULD we show <br/>
that as we letterbox, we are actively enjoying AND protecting the <br/>
environment?  Just yesterday, my children and I went to find Spring <br/>
letterbox in Georgetown.  Along the way, the trail was literally <br/>
STREWN with garbage!!!  We picked up garbage as we went and put it <br/>
into the trash receptacles, both to and from the box, but could we <br/>
have done more?  Perhaps if we make a habit of cleaning up the areas <br/>
around letterboxes it would be appreciated by park officials?  I <br/>
think from now on whenever I go out letterboxing, I will include a <br/>
few garbage bags in my letterboxing backpack.  Just a thought.<br/>
<br/>
Also, as a girl-scout leader, I have lots of questions about "leave <br/>
no trace".  It is highly encouraged by Girl Scouts and it seems <br/>
there is a LOT of emphasis on it, but there are no good training <br/>
manuals on it.  Could you share the points of LNT with us?<br/>

*****The LNT organization has a pretty good website<br/>
and several very good training programs.  I'm<br/>
considering getting qualified as a LNT trainer, if I<br/>
can ever find a course for it.  The website is<br/>
www.lnt.org<br/>
<br/>
I think most of us think of LNT as a restrictive list<br/>
of don't's, but actually, it's a set of principles<br/>
that help us to enjoy the outdoors harmoniously.  It<br/>
reminds us to take care of ourselves when we get ready<br/>
to go out as well as preparing ourselves to take care<br/>
of the environment.  <br/>
<br/>
The six principles of Frontcountry LNT are:<br/>
<br/>
1) Plan Ahead.<br/>
2) Stick to Trails.<br/>
3) Leave what you find.<br/>
4) Manage your pet.<br/>
5) Respect other visitors.<br/>
6) Tote your trash.<br/>
<br/>
(And FYI, I've been working on a program for LNT for<br/>
our Cub Scouts this Spring, so I've made a sentence<br/>
out of the first letters of each element - Proper<br/>
Scouts Leave More Respectable Trails)<br/>
<br/>
Frontcountry is what most of us do.  We visit parks<br/>
that have established trails and are intended for<br/>
heavier traffic.  Backcountry is geared to backpackers<br/>
and wilderness hikers and overnight primitive camping,<br/>
so the principles for that are a little more<br/>
complicated.  <br/>
<br/>
The Backcountry principles are:<br/>
<br/>
1) Plan ahead and prepare.<br/>
2) Travel and camp on durable surfaces.<br/>
3) Dispose of waste properly.<br/>
4) Leave what you find.<br/>
5) Minimize campfire impacts.<br/>
6) Respect wildlife.<br/>
7) Be considerate of other visitors.<br/>
<br/>
If you check the website, you'll see that some of the<br/>
suggestions they put forth include:<br/>
<br/>
1. Know the regulations and special concerns for the<br/>
area you are visiting.<br/>
2. Schedule your trip to avoid times of high usage.<br/>
3. Visit in small groups.<br/>
4. Use a map and compass to eliminate the need to use<br/>
marking paint, etc.<br/>
5. Walk single file and stay in the middle of the<br/>
path, even when wet or muddy (won't our kids love<br/>
this???)<br/>
6. Avoid places where impact is just beginning.<br/>
7. Pack out all trash, leftover food, and litter.  <br/>
8. Examine, but do not touch, cultural or historic<br/>
structures and artifacts.<br/>
9. Do not build structures, furniture, or dig<br/>
trenches.<br/>
10. Avoid wildlife during sensitive times like<br/>
breeding, nesting, feeding. <br/>
11. Observe wildlife from a distance.  <br/>
12. Let nature sounds prevail.  Avoid loud noises and<br/>
loud voices.<br/>
<br/>
Don't these things all sound like things we try to do<br/>
as letterboxers?  But do we know how to verbalize it<br/>
if someone were to ask us?  What if a park ranger<br/>
approached us and got a little bristly about what we<br/>
are doing?  Could we explain to him on his own terms<br/>
that what we are doing is not harmful, and that we<br/>
are, in fact, often helpful?<br/>
<br/>
The deeper into Scouting that my husband and I have<br/>
gotten, the more convinced I've become that we really<br/>
need to practice LNT, so for awhile I struggled with<br/>
letterboxing while embracing LNT.  I've eventually<br/>
come to the belief that I CAN letterbox and not<br/>
materially violate LNT principles.  The biggest reason<br/>
I can justify the two together is that once I plant a<br/>
box, I'm committed to checking on it fairly often and<br/>
I know that as a regular visitor, I'll be picking up<br/>
trash and generally looking after the area it is in. <br/>
I considered for awhile going to micro boxes only, but<br/>
one thing I've wondered is if going smaller really is<br/>
more LNT, or if tiny boxes just enable animals to<br/>
handle them more easily.  I'm not sure about that -<br/>
I'm still thinking it one through.  <br/>
<br/>
I really don't see myself as a militant<br/>
environmentalist, more as a conservationist.  I once<br/>
heard someone talk about the difference between<br/>
preservation and conservation.  Preservation is the<br/>
maintenance of resources exactly as they are now. <br/>
Conservation is the wise use of resources while at the<br/>
same time ensuring the continuity of resources.  I<br/>
sometimes wonder where the parks services see<br/>
themselves - as preservers or conservers.<br/>

<div>I think that since boxing is not an organized hobby in the sense that anyone is in charge, and because there are so many different people in so many different places, it would be difficult to prove to a hearing that the Leave No Trace "rule" is always adhered to. </div>

<div>I don't think "Leave No Trace" should need a training manual. Those words should speak for themselves. Respect nature and leave no trace. I think those are pretty simple and easy to follow principles, certainly for adults, and those adults then pass it on by doing it and showing kids that this is what you do. I think kids learn just as much, if not more by watching the behavior of adults than by reading manuels. And I think most of us do the right thing when we box. If a person isn't going to, a manual isn't going to change that. </div>

<div><tt>&gt; Also, as a girl-scout leader, I have lots of<br/>&gt; questions about "leave <br/>&gt; no trace".  It is highly encouraged by Girl Scouts<br/>&gt; and it seems <br/>&gt; there is a LOT of emphasis on it, but there are no<br/>&gt; good training <br/>&gt; manuals on it.  Could you share the points of LNT<br/>&gt; with us?<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Thanks, Batty B of Busybeesfamily<br/>&gt; <br/></tt></div>

<div>I think that's a hard thing to prove, that we shouldn't be regulated. I suppose we could refer people to various individual boxing sites that stress the Leave No Trace guidelines, tell them to look at some of the smaller area lists (NOT the big one for pete's sake or they'll think we''re all a bunch of angry nuts!-lol) and see how people are concerned with not harming the surrounding area. We could invite them to gatherings so they could meet some of the people involved in boxing. Though I suppose that might not be practical....them coming I mean. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess taken on the surface, boxing looks to an outsider like something that needs to be regulated. </div>
