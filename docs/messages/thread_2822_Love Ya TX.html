People can letterbox in and around Austin and then come back for the <br/>
potluck if they like.  And there are plenty of hotels for those who <br/>
don't want/can't camp.  <br/>
<br/>
As for us, we won't know if we come until we know when the Odyssey of <br/>
the Mind regional &amp; state tournaments are.  That and baseball season <br/>
will make all the difference in our availability!  But I don't want <br/>
to think about what is going to be an overly-busy spring (again) <br/>
right now.  Today, the kids are still in their pjs and we're having <br/>
the utmost in lazy summer days.  <br/>
<br/>
And I can't get the Rice Owls baseball stamp I'm carving to turn out <br/>
right.  I hate to scrap it, but I'm just not happy with it.  (this <br/>
will be a temporary box for during the CWS).<br/>
