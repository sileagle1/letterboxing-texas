<div>My TALE weekend started on Friday morning.I had made plans to meet up with deniserows in Waco for a day of boxing. But first I was meeting up with Mosaic butterfly in Salado to box a new series. I was a little early so I hunted out another Salado box and found it after a little confusion in the clues. The air was a little chilly and misty but I didn't let it get to me. I drove to the cemetery and just couldn't wait for Mosaic butterfly. She drove in as I was stamping into the box. I was first finder and got a nice little necklace and first finder certificate. (My oldest will enjoy the necklace.) After having Mosaic stamp in we went back to my first box find in Salado so she could find it and then headed to Belton for the 2nd box in the series. We had been beaten by Grizzled Griffin the day before. The stamp was a repeat as well as the 3rd in the series in
 Killeen (We later found out GG was 20 minutes late in getting the Salado box which is why we were first finders) We headed to Waco a little late and found denise eating at ihop so we joined her for a late breakfast. The weather changed for the better and we took off the jackets and sweaters. We then headed out to find boxes. There wasn't one missing box in all the boxes we searched for. Traveling T had some fun boxes that we found in the University libraries. One we didn't even decipher and with some smart thinking from Mosaic butterfly (asking the librarian for help looking for a book, he gave her the call number) we found the box. At one box I even saw a small gray fox! We had a lot of fun getting boxes and after 14 we called it a day parted ways and headed to Mexia to check in to Fort Parker. I was so excited. There were other boxers checking in when I got there, and I beat them out the door singing and dancing. I quickly started
 setting up camp but my phone wouldn't stop ringing. It was PiJoe letting me know I was doing good on putting up my tent. I called him over so he could help. Normally I can set it up by myself but the sandy ground wasn't helping me at all. He grabbed a pole and in minutes I was set up. I was happy to see PiJoe. He was going to miss TALE but was able to make it because his son had broken a foot. I was very happy. (not for his sons misfortune but that he could join us after all.) PiJoe convinced me that we should head to the Native Feast to get seats and warn the dinner we were coming. When we got there the host was baffled and looked none to pleased when we let them know more people were coming than they expected. Oh well. We set up tables and people started rolling in. Dreamwalker finally arrived (he had to work a half day) It was a fun night with great food and great friends. After a few hours we were kicked out of the dinner. They had locals waiting to
 sit and eat. (Poor locals probably had never seen it so crowded.) We left and headed back to camp. PiJoe took us on our first boxing trip in the dark. We found Native American Church and GG's box Apaches and was once again FF! We hiked back to camp and called it a night. In the wee hours of morning the storm hit. High winds and rain with the occasional thunder. Our tent tried blowing away but we held it down. Early in the morning we made breakfast and headed out to plant our boxes. The weather was cold and windy. I found the Pill Head box while looking for a spot for my box and so continued on the trail to a spring on the map that looked promising. It was very nice and so we placed a box (what I thought was Una but turned out to be Nidhi) near by. Heading back it started to rain and hail on us... I still needed to plant Nidhi (Una) and so we just made it a drive by for the event, placing it near the other side of the dam. It was destined to go down
 trail but the hail stooped me from going any further than the parking lot. We then headed back to camp and to the covered pavilion. We sat in the car wondering how we would all fit under that and survive the rain when we found out that Open Space had rented the enclosed building next door for us! Yeah! A kitchen and a fireplace! I was a happy girl. I claimed my spot in the kitchen and slaved over a hot stove cooking my southwestern eggrolls, and trying to help set people up with a place to put food. Dreamwalker found a circus and we were allowed to stamp in the few new stamps we didn't have since the circus left us in June. Then as mysteriously as it appeared it was gone again. We joined the mayhem in the main room and got to work on exchanges, Pt's and event boxes. We all ate and the weather cleared up allowing everyone to disburse after the raffle and group picture. We headed out with Open Space and her crew and found a few boxes. Her
 husband was lost on the trail and we parted ways. We finished up all the boxes in the park. Earlier Bell Motel graciously offered us a spot in her shelter (They had a space heater and we didn't want to freeze). So we moved our bed into their room and took them into town to grab dinner. We then rejoined everyone in the meeting room. Mosaic Butterfly set up a night hike of owls and we quickly left to hunt them down. At the first box we were joined by PiJoe and deniserows and we finished up the night hike with them. It was a great evening with a stellar performance from GG. I wish I still had a dollar to throw in his waste band.. lol  We called it a night after that and despite the space heater we still were very cold all night long. I braved the cold in the morning and took a hot shower, broke down camp, made breakfast, and we said goodbye to our friends. We picked up Una and took it down trail about
 2 miles before doubling back and planting it in a spot to remember. I left circle of sticks with an arrow pointed at the tree right in the middle of the trail so Bell Motel could find it later. I had warned her I would be moving it. I guess I should have warned more people because I've got a lot of inquires about it missing Sunday. Sorry guys but it would never survive if I left it in that tree. We headed out to get the last 3 boxes near by in Mexia and Grosebeck and then we headed home. </div>
<div>I still need a vacation from that trip... I'm so exhausted. It was a lot of fun and I want to thank everyone for making it the best TALE yet!</div>
