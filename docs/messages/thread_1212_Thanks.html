<div>I'm glad you liked the box Runs for Chocolate, and 
thanks for letting me know you found it! </div>

<div>It seems like latley people are logging their finds 
on the letterboxing websites, and not always contacting the placer to let them 
know when they have found a box.  Personally, I love getting e mails when 
someone finds one of my boxes, not only is it fun to hear what peoiple think, 
but it helps to know whether or not matience needs to be done on a box.  
Whenever I find a box I like to write the placer and tell them what I thought 
about the box, and to thank them for placing it.  What do you all think 
about letting placers know you have found their boxes?

I like about AtlasQuest - it's easy to send a short<br/>

<br/>
BUT-if I've been on a longer excursion and found<br/>
several boxes, I try to do a sitrep first and if the<br/>
placer reads it, they'll get the gist of my visit to<br/>
their box.  However, if I find something I need to<br/>
tell them about, like needed maintenance or if I did<br/>
some maintenance, or if it looks like it might be<br/>
missing, I email the placer privately.  In any case, I<br/>
like to send a message, but it may be a few days<br/>
before I get it done!<br/>

<div></div>I think it's really neat how the Geocaching.com site is set up in 
  regards to this. . .you can mark the cache found/not found and leave a little 
  message. Then you have the whole history of all who have been there with the 
  status for EVERYONE to read - not just a note to the placer. It's fun to read 
  and review everyone's comments. Sort of like an online logbook for the box.

<p>Good morning, </p>
<p>    I wanted to thank you for the 
cooperation you and your staff provided in the recovery of the lost 
Letterbox known to us as Hueco Tanks #1.  I sent an after action 
report to the Texas Letterboxing community about the search.  I was very 
clear in stating that without this cooperation, the successful conclusion of 
this search would not have been possible.  I got several short replies of 
thanks and gratitude.  One reply, from one whom I consider the foremost 
Letterboxer in Texas is particularly interesting.  This is all the 
information I have been able to gather on this Letterbox.  This is his 
reply. </p>
<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p><br/>        Mike, great job!  
You have confirmed the existence of the oldest current letterbox in TX (Hueco 
Tanks #1). I don't know anything else about the boxes, just what is written in 
the clues, since they were placed before my letterboxing days.  I was not 
even sure you could get to the area described by Hueco #2 since it requires some 
rock climbing, so that is amazing you came so close. </p>
<p>        
That will be great if you can rehide the #1 box, even if it is outside the 
park.  Do you think the rangers would be receptive to other boxes being 
placed in that park with their approval? </p>
<p>        
Thanks again for going above and beyond the call of duty! </p>
<p>Silver Eagle </p>
<p>
<hr/>
</p>
<p>    Since the suspected location of the 
Hueco Tanks #2 Letterbox is on the North Mountain near the large oak tree, I 
would like to verify  with you that this is a place open to self-guided 
hikes.  If this is true, I would like to return to that spot in the near 
future for a more extensive search.  I would be accompanied by at least one 
other accomplished hiker/Letterboxer, so I would not be alone on the 
mountain.  This way it would pose no additional load to your staff, nor 
would it require Ken to put in yet another day acting as a guide. Possibly our 
wives would come along and set up a picnic while we hike and search.  It is 
unlikely either of the wives would follow us all the way in to the tree. 
</p>
<p>    I realize that should this trek be 
possible, we will need to make reservations the usual way.  I will work on 
that just as soon as I get an affirmative reply from you. </p>
<p>    I also hope we can work together in 
placing Hueco Tanks #1 in a "safe" TPWD approved location.  And should 
recovery of Hueco Tanks #2 be realized, I hope we can also work to re-plant that 
one.  I am willing to take responsibility for the maintenance of these 
boxes.  If you have any concerns about my sincerity, any of the Franklin 
Mountain Rangers or Danny Lee on your staff know me well enough to answer 
questions.</p>
<p>    Once again, thank you for your 
assistance.  So far - mainly because of your assistance - this has 
been a pleasure and an adventure.  I will be waiting to hear from 
you.  Have a great day.</p>
<p> </p>

letterboxing stuff. Can't believe it took us so long to discover it. <br/>
Sorry we missed the gathering earlier this year in the Rusk area. It's <br/>
amazing to see the creativity people put into their stamps. Our <br/>
logbook is looking pretty good already - and we're just getting <br/>
started! We actually planted our first stamps over the weekend. Kind <br/>
of like taking that first step by just jumping in. <br/>

I wrote you, but think I sent email to JKC by accident. Here is <br/>
basically what happened:<br/>
We drove up thru New London Thurs and found the Explosion box. Wow! <br/>
We were so moved by the experience of seeing all those graves with <br/>
the same date of death. And then visiting the monument. Very <br/>
sobering. (My father was in a horrendous forest fire as a small boy. <br/>
Serveral hundred died, but his family survived by huddling in a <br/>
plowed field under blankets. (Norther Minn 1918), so I'm especially <br/>
sensitive to disasters involving children.<br/>
Anyway, unfortunately your box was soaked. It had hole in box and <br/>
baggie, with evidence of rodent nest in stump. Looks like hungry 4-<br/>
footed friend was busy. The logbook was pretty much ruined. We <br/>
replaced box with extra one I had in back pack, and put in some log <br/>
pages from extra log book. I took the soaked book back to our cabin; <br/>
the pages are drying out and I can send them to you, or save until we <br/>
meet at another gathering. Some lovely sentiments on those pages I <br/>
think you will enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
And now 14 more boxes. How do you people in east Texas do it?<br/>

</p><div>after i sent that last message, i also wanted to tell you about the first time i actually went there.  we took a group of students to the cemetery and to the museum downtown new london.  our guide for the museum was a survivor of the explosion when she was a student at the school.  several of her friends were killed in the explosion and a couple of times she actually teared up when she was discussing some of the people who lost their lives.  she is a wonderful lady to talk to and it just so happened that the day we were there was the anniversary of the explosion.  the local news was there interviewing her and a gentleman who is currently planning on making a movie about the explosion.  i am not sure of the progress of the movie, but thought that would definitely be a movie that i would want to see.</div>

<div>Yeah JB, that was Bird Dog and I messin' with your box in New London. <br/>I wrote you, but think I sent email to JKC by accident. Here is <br/>basically what happened:<br/>We drove up thru New London Thurs and found the Explosion box. Wow! <br/>
We were so moved by the experience of seeing all those graves with <br/>the same date of death. And then visiting the monument. Very <br/>sobering. (My father was in a horrendous forest fire as a small boy. <br/>Serveral hundred died, but his family survived by huddling in a <br/>
plowed field under blankets. (Norther Minn 1918), so I'm especially <br/>sensitive to disasters involving children.<br/>Anyway, unfortunately your box was soaked. It had hole in box and <br/>baggie, with evidence of rodent nest in stump. Looks like hungry 4-<br/>
footed friend was busy. The logbook was pretty much ruined. We <br/>replaced box with extra one I had in back pack, and put in some log <br/>pages from extra log book. I took the soaked book back to our cabin; <br/>the pages are drying out and I can send them to you, or save until we <br/>
meet at another gathering. Some lovely sentiments on those pages I <br/>think you will enjoy.<br/><br/>And now 14 more boxes.
