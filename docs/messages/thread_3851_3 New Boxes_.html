memories boxes today that have been driving around with me since<br/>
February! only one left now!!<br/>
 they are all kind of close to the Moneola area. just thought i'd let<br/>
you know incase it close to you, or near your next planned<br/>
letterboxing trip!! <br/>
<br/>
oh and I got gas for $1.88 at the brookshires in Mineola today too...<br/>
though taht was pretty exciting!<br/>
<br/>
oh and my Thomas the tank engine one still needs a small child or a<br/>
long stick to get it out from all the way under that ramp! (theres a<br/>
brick under there too... so if you can get both box and brick.. the<br/>
brick could be usefull for keeping the box inplace in the future!<br/>

Walmart that has this problem.. but i get Way worse Gas mielage out of<br/>
gas bought at Walmart... like up to 150 miles less per tank worse!! it<br/>
might be cheaper sometimes... but so not worth it!  my little car gets<br/>
me 30 -45 miles per gallon.. depending on if i'm doing run around<br/>
driving or hwy driving ... walmart gas i only get about 20-35 MPG! <br/>
