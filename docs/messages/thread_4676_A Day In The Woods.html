                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today was so nice I decided to go letterboxing in Cypress since I have not been boxing in that area in over a year.  My first stop was Telge Park where I found several boxes, including my favorites:  A Ghostly Wedding and Cool Ghoul.  I was laughing so hard that I'm thankful nobody else was in the park yet.  If you haven't been to Telge yet or for quite a while, you need to go.  The creativity of the boxes there is amazing and there were no mosquitoes!<br/>
<br/>
Next I went to Little Cypress Preserve to find a box but my search was cut short before I found it.  I didn't realize the park is only open on weekends since the gate was open when I got there.  However, it was only open because there were volunteers working in the park and they were leaving soon after I got there, so I had to leave, too.  It is a great little park and can stand a few more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
After finding 2 cemetery boxes by Baby Bear I ended up at Zube park where my day had a sad and challenging finish.  I had gotten a report that my first placed letterbox, Zube Zephyr, was missing its stamp and logbook, so I was there to verify and place a new one.  As I was walking toward the place in the trees where the box is hidden, I noticed a police car patrolling across the creek in the park.  I slowed down to give them a chance to leave, but they ended up parking in the lot facing me.  I decided to continue walking past my box until the trees on the other side hid me from view.  Then I entered the trees on my side and worked my way back to my box.  It was rough going through briars and low branches but I finally made it.  Sure enough, the box was empty.  I had placed that box in September, 2002 and I really hated that it was gone.  It was my only store-bought stamp, so instead of replacing it, I carved a new stamp and created a new box to take its place.  Hopefully it will last even longer.<br/>
<br/>
Now this whole time I assumed the police were still parked across the way and possibly wondering what I was doing and when I would reappear.  I did not want to let them see me come out of the woods by my box, so I backtracked through the woods, getting more stickers and cuts as I went, and emerged where I thought it was safe;  right in front of the police across the creek!  I guess I was gone too long and they got curious where I went, so they drove on the grass to the far end across from me.  I hesitated for a second debating what to do.  I could just continue walking back toward my car, but I did not want to have to explain what I was doing in the woods, so I impulsively scurried back into the woods.  Now I really looked suspicious, so I needed to avoid them at all costs.  I decided to work my way through the woods all the way to the train area of the park, then go behind the buildings to the road.  More stickers and cuts, but I made it to the road without being seen.  However, I now had to cross into their field of view to get to my car, and even though they were over 200 yards away I figured they would recognize me.  So I took off my shirt and started running, pretending to be a local runner just jogging down the street.  I guess the letterbox Gods were with me because I made it to the car and out of the park without the police coming after me.  They may still be waiting for me to come out of the woods.  All in all it was an exciting day!<br/>

&gt; I think if you were to take your shirt off and jog past a police car, they<br/>
&gt; may show interest in you for other reasons.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I am beginning to question my commitment to this hobby.  I have to admit<br/>
&gt; &gt; that I would never take off my shirt and jog past a police car to keep a<br/>
&gt; &gt; policeman from finding a letterbox!  -- (Vicki) Bell Motel<br/>

&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Today was so nice I decided to go letterboxing in Cypress since I have not<br/>
&gt; &gt; been boxing in that area in over a year. My first stop was Telge Park where<br/>
&gt; &gt; I found several boxes, including my favorites: A Ghostly Wedding and Cool<br/>
&gt; &gt; Ghoul. I was laughing so hard that I'm thankful nobody else was in the park<br/>
&gt; &gt; yet. If you haven't been to Telge yet or for quite a while, you need to go.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The creativity of the boxes there is amazing and there were no mosquitoes!<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Next I went to Little Cypress Preserve to find a box but my search was cut<br/>
&gt; &gt; short before I found it. I didn't realize the park is only open on weekends<br/>
&gt; &gt; since the gate was open when I got there. However, it was only open because<br/>
&gt; &gt; there were volunteers working in the park and they were leaving soon after I<br/>
&gt; &gt; got there, so I had to leave, too. It is a great little park and can stand a<br/>
&gt; &gt; few more boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; After finding 2 cemetery boxes by Baby Bear I ended up at Zube park where<br/>
&gt; &gt; my day had a sad and challenging finish. I had gotten a report that my first<br/>
&gt; &gt; placed letterbox, Zube Zephyr, was missing its stamp and logbook, so I was<br/>
&gt; &gt; there to verify and place a new one. As I was walking toward the place in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the trees where the box is hidden, I noticed a police car patrolling across<br/>
&gt; &gt; the creek in the park. I slowed down to give them a chance to leave, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; they ended up parking in the lot facing me. I decided to continue walking<br/>
&gt; &gt; past my box until the trees on the other side hid me from view. Then I<br/>
&gt; &gt; entered the trees on my side and worked my way back to my box. It was rough<br/>
&gt; &gt; going through briars and low branches but I finally made it. Sure enough,<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box was empty. I had placed that box in September, 2002 and I really<br/>
&gt; &gt; hated that it was gone. It was my only store-bought stamp, so instead of<br/>
&gt; &gt; replacing it, I carved a new stamp and created a new box to take its place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hopefully it will last even longer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Now this whole time I assumed the police were still parked across the way<br/>
&gt; &gt; and possibly wondering what I was doing and when I would reappear. I did not<br/>
&gt; &gt; want to let them see me come out of the woods by my box, so I backtracked<br/>
&gt; &gt; through the woods, getting more stickers and cuts as I went, and emerged<br/>
&gt; &gt; where I thought it was safe; right in front of the police across the creek!<br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess I was gone too long and they got curious where I went, so they drove<br/>
&gt; &gt; on the grass to the far end across from me. I hesitated for a second<br/>
&gt; &gt; debating what to do. I could just continue walking back toward my car, but I<br/>
&gt; &gt; did not want to have to explain what I was doing in the woods, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; impulsively scurried back into the woods. Now I really looked suspicious, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I needed to avoid them at all costs. I decided to work my way through the<br/>
&gt; &gt; woods all the way to the train area of the park, then go behind the<br/>
&gt; &gt; buildings to the road. More stickers and cuts, but I made it to the road<br/>
&gt; &gt; without being seen. However, I now had to cross into their field of view to<br/>
&gt; &gt; get to my car, and even though they were over 200 yards away I figured they<br/>
&gt; &gt; would recognize me. So I took off my shirt and started running, pretending<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be a local runner just jogging down the street. I guess the letterbox<br/>
&gt; &gt; Gods were with me because I made it to the car and out of the park without<br/>
&gt; &gt; the police coming after me. They may still be waiting for me to come out of<br/>
&gt; &gt; the woods. All in all it was an exciting day!<br/>
