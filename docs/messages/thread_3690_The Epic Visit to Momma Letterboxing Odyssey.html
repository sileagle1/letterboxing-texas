the "Epic Visit to Momma Letterboxing Odyssey".  My mother lives in Big <br/>
Spring and we live in Uvalde. Starting July 30th with one in <br/>
Rocksprings and concluding today with one in Leakey, we found a total <br/>
of 26 boxes.  All of them were great!  Only one box that we sought was <br/>
missing and there was only one box on our "agenda" that we decided not <br/>
to search for because it required a hike.  We had the Jeep overheat and <br/>
have to be worked on in Abilene and it was after 2 pm when we got back <br/>
on the road. Another reason for skipping it is that another attraction <br/>
that the clue to the box references is closed on Monday.  We want to <br/>
visit the first site and then move on to find the box (when it's <br/>
cooler).  Letterboxing made a long, boring drive so much fun.  We get <br/>
to see places/things that we normally wouldn't see.  We went one route <br/>
there and another back.  We scoped out a few places along the route <br/>
that we want to place our boxes.  Now to get carving until we can <br/>
afford another expedition.  <br/>

through Rocksprings on our way to BS.  My husband likes to look for <br/>
Veterans graves when we visit cemeteries so he never objects to a <br/>

I have to amend my post.  There were three ones that were missing.  I <br/>
forgot about two missing in Odessa.  <br/>
