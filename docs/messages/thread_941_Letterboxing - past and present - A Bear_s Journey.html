<div> </div>
<div>After the trip to Spokane, and finding our first box, we picked names on the flight home.   Unfortunately I did not give much thought to it, not realizing this would become a name that would brand me for the rest of my letterboxing life.  So, Silver Eagle chose his name for reasons give, and I decided to use a name he had called me on many earlier camping trips with our father.  Thus I became Baby Bear  (as my father was Papa Bear and Silver Eagle was Bubba Bear on our camping outings). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Soon after arriving home I decided to carve my first stamp for trip I was had planned for the next week to Louisiana.   So I bought an eraser and an exacto, drew the picture, and carved it out.  Yes, I'm sure some of you have done the same thing, the letters were all backwards (forgot about reverse image).   Recarved the stamp and placed it in Many, LA (unfortunately this box is now gone).  I believe my first placed stamp in Texas was either Texas Birth, Old 300 or Star Gazer.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also started participating in the national talk list at this time.  This is when the name thing first surfaced as a problem.   Within the year, it was assumed I was a girl or Silver Eagle and I were "partners".  Also, I quickly got tired of the negative postings on main talk list, so I quit participating.  I later joined the Rocky Mountain talk list, and was please to join the new Texas list when developed!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I believe I now have close to 200 placed boxes in about 20 states.  Unfortunately many have been coming up missing, damaged, or vandalized (someone actually pooped in one of my boxes this year).  I still enjoy Letterboxing, but have slowed down a bit, due to starting a business and someone (I believe Hawk) getting me caught up in Treasure Trove nightmare.  Also still trying to clear up a problem with the park service (Don't hide boxes in National Parks!!!!!!!).  I guess one of the biggest frustrations I have at this point is continually hearing that my found box was "laying out in the open".   On the flip side, many kind people have helped in fixing damaged boxes and rehiding them better when found in open.  Texas letterboxers are the kindest in the country!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am over joyed to see the growth in Texas letterboxing, and plan on continuing the hobby.  We have come a long way in 3 years, from finding my brother's boxes to now running into other letterboxers on the trail!   Keep up the good work, and have FUN!</div>

<div>Bubba Bear? Silver Eagle is definitely "loftier" and more regal, but Bubba Bear &amp; Baby Bear conjure up an image of rowdy boys on a camp out! I can picture it..... oh, no!</div>
<div>I love reading the stories of how people first got involved in LBing. I think a lot of us share a common experience after we actually located our first box and somehow found ourselves immediately addicted and craving more, but the different experiences that led us to our first box are unique!</div>

to your virtual story-telling into the night!  Thanks for sharing <br>
with the newbies out there.  I find this hobby to be fascinating <br>
and consider myself more enlightened each time I venture out on <br>
the trail.  As MAGS and I constantly remind our kids during the <br>
hunt, "it is not the find so much as the journey to get there".  <br>
The sentiment is old and borrowed, but still true.  Please <br>
continue to share your letterboxing musings with us!<br>
