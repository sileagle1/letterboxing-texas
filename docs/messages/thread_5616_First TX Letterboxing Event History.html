That was indeed a very exciting time in Texas letterboxing. I was still lurking from Connecticut during that first TALE, but got here as soon as I could. Have a wonderful TALE 15 and I hope to join y’all again next time. ❤️ Puddle Splasher<br/><div><br/><blockquote type="cite"><div class="">On Feb 21, 2018, at 12:50 PM, <a href="mailto:sileagle1@yahoo.com">sileagle1@yahoo.com</a> [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] &lt;<a href="mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com">LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com</a>&gt; wrote:</div><br/><div class=""><div class="" id="ygrp-mlmsg"><div class="" id="ygrp-msg"><div class="" id="ygrp-text"><div class=""><br/></div><div class=""><span class="">Since TALE 15 is less than a month away and will be held at the same park as the first Event, I thought it would be fun to reminisce about what was going on in TX letterboxing back in early 2004. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/><br/>When I started letterboxing in 2002, there was only one discussion forum for letterboxers to communicate:  the US Yahoo Group, the same one that exists today but is seldom used anymore.  Then in 2003 some regional groups were created so letterboxers in that area could talk about things relative to them and not bore the rest of the country.  I thought about creating one for Texas, but didn't think there were enough letterboxers in our state to warrant one yet. If I needed to talk about something specific to Texas I would use the US Group and preface my post with the word TEXAS, or just email the few boxers I had heard from.  One of the boxers I heard from was Busy Bee in Beeville, who really wanted to attend an Event in Texas and wanted me to organize one.  Once again I didn't think there were enough boxers to make it work, but Baby Bear and I started planning one anyway and I contacted the few boxers I knew via email to let them know it would be in March, 2004.  We decided to have it in a central location and Bastrop SP fit the bill.  Now to get the word out.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span><br/><br/>I posted about it on the US Group but didn't get much response.  Then in late 2003, Barefoot Lucy from east TX created the TX Group (this very one) and we slowly attracted members and started talking about the upcoming Event.  You can read some of the posts starting with this one:<br/><br/></span><a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/conversations/messages/18" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/conversations/messages/18</span></a><span class=""><br/><br/>By the time of the Event I still didn't know how many (if any) would show up, so imagine my surprise when we ended up with over 30 attendees!  The place I reserved was just a shelter for 2 picnic tables and would only seat about 16 people, but the weather was great and people brought chairs so it worked out.  Some of those original attendees still participate and include:  PI Joe (his trail name back then was TX Hipower), Corazon, and Sea Dove from Birds of a Feather (a friend of mine from work).    You can read posts about it starting with this one:<br/><br/></span><a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/conversations/messages/169" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/conversations/messages/169</span></a><span class=""><br/><br/>One of the posts was from Pumpkin Princess (the wife of Eoghan, an early TX letterboxer who has the oldest box in TX) who said they almost came to the Event.  I still hold out some hope that they will come in the future.<br/><br/>If you want to look at more old posts on this Group, click on Conversations at the top, then Actions drop down list to the right and choose Message History.  It will show a calendar with the number of posts for each month per year and you can click on the one you are interested in.<br/><br/>It is hard to believe we are now having our 15th Event, and I hope this has whet your appetite for it!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>P.S.  Here are photos from that first Event:<br/><br/></span><a href="https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/photos/albums/748353355" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><span class="">https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/LETTERBOXINGTEXAS/photos/albums/748353355</span></a><span class=""><br/><br/></span></div><p><span class=""><br/><br/></span></p><div class=""><br/></div></div><div class=""></div></div></div><br/></div></blockquote></div></body></html>
