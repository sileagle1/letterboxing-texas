                    <div class="plaintext-content">Didn't it turn out great?! My granddaughter, Shabree, and I had a <br/>
terrific time. We rode up with Calico Rose on Friday and 'camped' at <br/>
the Best Western. Saturday, I woke up with one of my special <br/>
headaches,which lasted all day, so wasn't at my best, but still had <br/>
a lot of fun. It was wonderful meeting everyone. What an exceptional <br/>
group of people! <br/>
<br/>
The boxes I/we found were DrooP's Skinny Pine, Baby Bear's Trail <br/>
Rider and Park Pest, and on the way home, the Mattke Family's TCM - <br/>
and on that one, enjoyed the symbolism of the 'item' placed near the <br/>
box. ;) I still need to look the background up on the internet to <br/>
understand more about the box subject....being probably the only <br/>
person around who is not very familiar with the subject this box <br/>
refers to.<br/>
<br/>
Shabree really enjoyed playing with all the other children. <br/>
<br/>
DrooP, TWO spider bites???? AND poison ivy???? YIKES!!! <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all so much for making this a fantastic weekend. I am <br/>
already looking forward to the next one. A special thanks goes to <br/>
the organizers, too!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The gathering was wonderful wasn't it?  My family had<br/>
a great time - even my husband, who made a very brief<br/>
appearance, then retreated to our campsite (he's not a<br/>
big group person).  He did, though, go out boxing with<br/>
us.<br/>
<br/>
We found the 10th Mountain Infantry box, Skinny Pine,<br/>
Trail Rider, Lost Pines, and Park Pest.  All were a<br/>
lot of fun, but I think we especially enjoyed the Lost<br/>
Pines.  It was quite a trek!<br/>
<br/>
We did have a bit of an adventure at Skinny Pine -<br/>
Alex was following his dad across the waterfall when<br/>
he stepped on slick mud instead of dry rock and went<br/>
sliding feet first on his belly!  His feet were<br/>
hanging over the waterfall and he caught himself by<br/>
his fingertips.  He pulled himself up a bit, then<br/>
hollered for my husband to hold the walking stick out<br/>
for him to grab.  He grabbed hold and pulled himself a<br/>
little closer, then my husband pulled him on out.  He<br/>
was a muddy mess!  OH MY!  It was a little tense for a<br/>
moment or so, but I was glad to see that he can think<br/>
on his feet if he has to - I've had my doubts at<br/>
times!<br/>
<br/>
I loved meeting everyone and learning a little more<br/>
about all.  The food was great - but the company was<br/>
even better!  Thanks, Silver Eagle, for making all the<br/>
plans and getting us all together - it was memorable!<br/>
<br/>
Lucy<br/>
<br/>
P.S.  I'd love to get Silver Eagle's chili recipe and<br/>
the Mattkes' Thai Chicken Wraps!<br/>

<div>Thanks too, to Silver Eagle for organizing 
everything. It turned out terrific. A little more space might be needed next 
time- especially if the next gathering draws more folks (and if the weather 
isn't as cooperative as it was this weekend).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was really nice to see some of the faces behind 
the stamps we've been seeing. We're all lucky such talented folks are active in 
the hobby so close to our stomping grounds.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We're working to get our latest box clues online. 
For those of you who took the drive to our TCM box but didn't completely get the 
reference or couldn't understand why we put a box at a seedy old gas station, 
email us and we'll fill you in on the details. BTW, Wanda- that 'item' was 
already there, we didn't plant it with the box. Creepy, eh?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A series of boxes is coming soon, themed around 
movies shot in and around Austin/CenTex. Plus a historical series we have been 
meaning to plant for over a year. It'll be worth the wait if you like a 
challenge in your letterbox quest.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Thai Chicken wraps are part of the Mattke 
family camping staple diet. The recipe we copped from the Food Network's 
30Minute meals- here's the <a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/recipes/recipe/0,1977,FOOD_9936_25866,00.html">link 
to the recipe</a>. The trick to the peanut sauce is to start with peanut butter, 
but don't skimp on this one: that leftover half-empty jar of Skippy you've 
had in the cupboard for ("when did we buy that?") months isn't going to work 
:-}. </div>
<div>We found "Laura Scudder's" brand Old Fashioned 
Smooth to be the best (weird stuff you actually refrigerate), or you can try the 
local health-food store if they make the stuff fresh (try HEB Central Market if 
you're in Austin). Also- gotta do the *fresh* basil and mint. You can get it 
dried, but resist- resist! Go for the flavor, it really makes a 
difference.</div>
<div> </div>

&gt; Thanks too, to Silver Eagle for organizing everything. It turned <br/>
out terrific. A little more space might be needed next time- <br/>
especially if the next gathering draws more folks (and if the <br/>
weather isn't as cooperative as it was this weekend).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; It was really nice to see some of the faces behind the stamps <br/>
we've been seeing. We're all lucky such talented folks are active in <br/>
the hobby so close to our stomping grounds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We're working to get our latest box clues online. For those of you <br/>
who took the drive to our TCM box but didn't completely get the <br/>
reference or couldn't understand why we put a box at a seedy old gas <br/>
station, email us and we'll fill you in on the details. BTW, Wanda- <br/>
that 'item' was already there, we didn't plant it with the box. <br/>
Creepy, eh?<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A series of boxes is coming soon, themed around movies shot in and <br/>
around Austin/CenTex. Plus a historical series we have been meaning <br/>
to plant for over a year. It'll be worth the wait if you like a <br/>
challenge in your letterbox quest.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Thai Chicken wraps are part of the Mattke family camping <br/>
staple diet. The recipe we copped from the Food Network's 30Minute <br/>
meals- here's the link to the recipe. The trick to the peanut sauce <br/>
is to start with peanut butter, but don't skimp on this one: that <br/>
leftover half-empty jar of Skippy you've had in the cupboard for <br/>
("when did we buy that?") months isn't going to work :-}. <br/>
&gt; We found "Laura Scudder's" brand Old Fashioned Smooth to be the <br/>
best (weird stuff you actually refrigerate), or you can try the <br/>
local health-food store if they make the stuff fresh (try HEB <br/>
Central Market if you're in Austin). Also- gotta do the *fresh* <br/>
basil and mint. You can get it dried, but resist- resist! Go for the <br/>
flavor, it really makes a difference.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At the next event, be prepared to be introduced to the subtle <br/>
nuances of the Runza.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
