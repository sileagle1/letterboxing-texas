<div> </div>
<div>SJZ went into labor for a time on Thursday, only to fall out of labor and get sent home.  Not sure exactly how that works, but it did.  She was very discouraged and is quite disgusted with being pregnant.  Since we were already en route to Denton when she called to tell us she was going home, we went on ahead and I stayed through today to help her keep her mind off her misery.  Her doctor suggested that she walk a lot this weekend, so RXKaffee and I kept her on her feet and marching onward! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got out Friday morning and ran a few errands, then went garage saling.  Found a few good buys, and in the meantime spotted some key letterboxing streets.  We noted for ourselves where they were so we could come back properly armed for attack. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Late Friday afternoon, we decided to venture outdoors (repeat after me - BarefootLucy HATES the heat!) and go do a little sightseeing and letterboxing.  We decided first to go downtown to a wonderful little candy shop they have and get a few sweets to cheer her up.  We then roamed around the courthouse and contemplated where the trap door to the inside must be, then read the historical marker about John B Denton and made a note to read up on the Village Creek attack which resulted in his death (and which we promptly forgot to read up on after we got back to the apartment).  We wandered through a mini-mall there and I very nearly bought a dulcimer for Fearless Fox (he's been wanting to learn to play an instrument, but he doesn't want to play guitar because I play it) but decided I had better save my money.  After landing in Jupiter House, the coffee shop on the square, and fortifying ourselves there for awhile, we decided it was time to go letterboxing.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got our stuff together, and headed out to take RXKaffee on his first box run.  He drove and SJZ navigated (which, in hindsight, I should've known better than to let that happen!) and I read the clues.  By the time we made it to our first box, Support Our Troops by rzaruba, night was falling fast and it was dark when we finished stamping in.  Still and all, we found ourselves in a nice little neighborhood park with a community garden, which we would have never found if not for letterboxing since it is overpowered by its near neighbor, North Lakes Park.  It was so nice that we went back Saturday and checked it out again - very cool in daylight too.  After sufficiently making a mess of ourselves in the dark with all that ink going around, we headed to the downtown area for a box at Quakertown Park.  I had at one time known there were two boxes in that park, but for some reason only had clues to one of them, so off we went to find that one - Sesquicentennial.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Realize - it was truly pitch dark when we got there!  We roamed around trying to figure out the most advantageous parking spot.  They tried to recall what was where from their one visit to the park during daylight, during the Jazz Festival, when thousands of people had been roaming around and vendors had been set up and things looked entirely different than they did at this moment.  Finally, RXKaffee got tired of worrying about it and parked the car, noting that our purpose was to walk SJZ anyway.  We then roamed around on foot trying to figure out what was where, until we eventually got our bearings.  Turns out we had parked on the WRONG end of the park, but oh well.  We had a nice walk anyway.  As we roamed aimlessly through the park, we stumbled upon a small toad hopping around as aimlessly as we were walking.  SJZ immediately insisted we MUST have that toad because it is a cousin to their toad Marley and Marley needed to have family near him as he adjusts to the new baby.  RXKaffee and I start scrambling to catch the toad, but mostly it was RXKaffee trying to catch him before I managed to step on him.  No one was wounded by my clodhoppers before the capture of the new toad and our next mission became figuring out where to put him.  Well now - no good letterboxer goes out without an extra container, but I wasn't about to sacrifice a LNL because RXKaffee intended to punch holes in it.  I dug around a bit and found a cheapo something I would never hide a box in.  In went the little toad aptly named Ziggy and off we went again in search of the box.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We finally had it all figured out and it made perfect sense, as we likely would have learned more quickly in daylight.  We secured the box while RXKaffee tried to explain to his mother, who had called him on his cell, what we were doing.  Between the toad talk and the letterboxing thing and SJZ's and my normal nonsensical banter in the background, I think she hung up thoroughly confused and convinced that her son has been badly influenced by our family.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As we left the box, I had the bright idea to follow the road back to the parking lot we were in, and I convinced them that it would be much shorter to go that way.  Turns out I was really, REALLY turned around (I loaned my compass to Lightning and he still hasn't returned it to me, so I am relying on my keen sense of direction and my innate ability to read the stars and sun) and we wound up walking all the way around the block instead of walking straight across the park as we came, which would have cut off about half the distance.  But remember - our purpose was to walk SJZ.  
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>After all that toad-catching and boxing, we were tired and hungry, so we set about to find something for supper, only to discover that most eating establishments closed at 10:00 p.m. - and it was 10:15.  Finally we found an open Pizza Hut and took pizza back to their apartment and watched Eragon until 1:30 am.  They turned Ziggy into Marley's enclosure, and you will be happy to know that Marley didn't eat Ziggy.  It was a good night for all.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The next morning SJZ and I got up and went garage saling again and ran a few errands and returned to the apartment just at the crack of Too Hot for Lucy.  We hibernated until RXKaffee got up (he's a night-owl computer geek who does contract programming, so he goes to bed when early risers are getting up), and we again plotted our plan of attack.  Our first item on the agenda was to figure out how to install the car seat in the car, and then we were to go check out a love seat someone had offered as free for the taking.  RXKaffee, in addition to being a computer geek, is an insatiable collector of other people's junk and a rabid negotiator, so while "free" doesn't really serve his need to dicker, he DOES like the price.  SJZ quickly negotiated with him to lose an extra TV or two out of their living room if they got the love seat, but to no avail because when we got there, the couch was gone.  The TVs won a reprieve but the choice of seating in their living room is still - interesting.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After scoping out the furniture, we decided to go for Beneficus Rex' box at Denton Regional Hospital.  As we were driving up, I was reading ahead on the clues and had the location narrowed down with my finely honed letterboxing radar.  I spotted trouble.  I didn't say anything until we were out of the car, but I laid out the book on the trunk of the car and asked them if THEY saw any problems.  RXKaffee, newbie that he is, also spotted where he thought the box would be, but he didn't recognize the guy standing a few feet from it smoking and talking on the phone as a problem, so SJZ and I filled him in.  We stood around the car for a few minutes as though we were debating what to do.  Meanwhile, a security car drove by and then another car pulled in between us and the box.  It was getting crowded around there!  Finally, we decided I would grab my backpack and RXKaffee would gently walk the very pregnant SJZ by the arm into the hospital and I would follow as though carrying luggage for the happy occasion.  We pulled that off and SJZ took advantage of our proximity to the bathroom while RXK and I discussed our next move.  We decided all we could do was walk back out and hope for the best and that's what we did when SJZ rejoined us.  But it wasn't to be - the guy was still smoking and still talking, so we loudly protested the difficulties of there being two hospitals in town and how were we to know she was supposed to go to the other hospital.  We got in the car and left, leaving the box unfound.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I contemplated whether we should venture out on the South Lakes Park nature trail with her, but decided it might be a little rough for her in the fading light and we went and walked the track instead and then went and found supper BEFORE 10 
p.m.  Much better choices that way.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ and I went out in search of a good spot to hide a new box this morning, and came away with some ideas. Meanwhile, Fearless Fox and Lightning returned to Denton with FF's dad to pick me up and we tanked SJZ and RXK up on Mexican food before we left with hopes of inducing labor via spicy food.  I figured they would call when we were halfway home to tell us she was in labor, but they didn't, so I guess the Mexican food didn't work either!
