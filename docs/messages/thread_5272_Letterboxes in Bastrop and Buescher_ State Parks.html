I have no issue with SPs (do have some issues with geocachers based having had some of my boxes destroyed by cachers, but that's another story) - but I do find it irritating when anyone tries to micromanage a group that's been rolling along doing very well long before they discovered it.  Especially annoying when they want to "improve" the game by imposing rules of a different game.  Love hiking, always mindful of safety and ecology &amp; always LNT.  Can't speak for others and don't want to do so.  Just like finding good boxes in interest ing or scenic locations.   </div><div>Viewfinder</div><div><br/></div><div><br/></div><div><div>Sent via the Samsung Galaxy S™ III, an AT&amp;T 4G LTE smartphone</div></div> <br/><br/><br/>-------- Original message --------<br/>From: bluebutterflytexas@yahoo.com <br/>Date: 10/05/2013  10:45 AM  (GMT-06:00) <br/>To: letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com <br/>Subject: RE: RE: Re: [letterboxingtexas] Letterboxes in Bastrop and Buescher State Parks <br/> <br/><br/>

<p>Most SP that I visit, will ask you what your plans are for the day. Unless, they are super busy. A parked car is also a clue as to where you are if you are only there for the day. Yes, cell phones are hard to use in some SP's, and when I box alone, some one (usually LL) knows where I am going and what boxes I am going for. Stormie, I know you don't have this option, but what about having a short conversation with the Ranger when you "check in", let them know you are planning on hiking that day, or the time you are there. Just a suggestion. I am against permits. I don't have the time or resources to follow through on the paper work or visiting the park again on a regular basis. Some parks do require you to visit and maintain the boxes you have placed. It is discouraging that we can't place boxes in these beautiful parks that we all support and love. this subject is always a hot topic, which, (in my opinion) will never be settled. I have said 
 this before, and once again I will say, I very rarely see a "social trail" to a letterbox. I have never left a park, looked back and said,there must have been letterboxers here, you can tell by the mess they left! I always try to "leave no trace" when letterboxing, and do my best to leave the park better than I found it. I love this hobby, and as I type, I am planning a trip to a SP to find some treasures. Just my two cents!<br/>Happy trails to all!<br/>Blue Butterfly<br/><br/>PS....Congratulations and Thank-you Baby Bear for your 600th box!<br/><br/> </p><div class="ygroups-quoted"><br/><br/>---In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/><div id="ygrps-yiv-305385391">I totally agree with Wry Me but won't bore you with my reasons that I have given here many times over the years.  I no longer place boxes in State Parks because I am against permitting, but don't want to go against policy, however I am fine 
 with whatever each of you decides to do.  My only concern is how this affects events like TALE.  State Parks are about our only option for big events and it would be a shame if no boxes were placed during one.  The only options I see are for people to either permit or go renegade.  Kind of fits right in with next year's TALE theme of naughty or nice!<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><div class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygroups-quoted"><br/><br/>---In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, &lt;letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com&gt; wrote:<br/><br/><div id="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv-2142796465"><div><div><span>Um, ... what?  Permitting your boxes is their attempt to keep you safe?  So they know where you are in the park?  That's a huge stretch.  Plus, it makes me wonder what happens to the poor noxers with nothing registered at all.</span>

 non-letterboxers where your boxes are hidden is not the preferred way of doing things, with varying levels of resistance or support.  The permitting process doesn't have much respect for this idea and makes no distinction between geocaching and letterboxing, a point made multiple times.  My point was that caching has long been managed by organizers while letterboxing is managed by boxers themselves.  They're asking us, no REQUIRING us, as nonplayers of the game, to change the rules to our game to accommodate their program, effectively cutting us out of the parks where, let's face it, there was boxing long before there was caching, and where, ironically, Boots Tex, et. al. had tried to promote letterboxing as a way of getting people in the parks long before they finally resigned themselves to embracing geocaching.  That's ironic.</div><div> </div><div>I think Open Space put it best when she pointed out that in
 letterboxing the organization "owns" the listing, whereas in boxing, the box belongs to the planter who controls where and when it's listed, marked retired, relocated, etc.  The owners of Geocaching.com own the hobby, control and monitor it.  Our websites facilitate the hobby, but they don't manage it.</div><div> </div><div>I'm opposed to the whole permitting thing, not because it's like geocaching, but because the ways in which it is like geocaching are at odds with established protocols and don't fit with the hobby.  These aren't letterboxers determining the perameters of the hobby, but, yes, bureaucrats from outside the hobby with no understanding of the hobby.  It's not a coincidence that those staunchly in favor are predominantly geocachers.  This feels familiar to you, but not to me.</div><div>  </div><div>I won't even get started on how clues leading directly to an exact, but not public 
 location -- versus a
 20-foot radius of upended flora and fauna at the end of a four-foot wide social trail -- might be the preferred method of protecting the environment more efficiently.  To me, the fact that the parks support geocaching is the height of irony. If they notified people of sensitive areas, made it clear that no hiking even was permitted and asked not to have boxes or caches planted, I would honor it in a heartbeat, or if they showed even a speck of comprehension that the games are different. This is the park managing and sponsoring a hobby, rather than the individuals who use the park playing a game of their own.  That feels infinitely different to me.  And I think their time could be better spent managing the dingalings I see at every state park: </div><div>cutting down trees and collecting deadfall for campfires</div><div>using lighter fluid on their already-burning campfires</div><div>having pets off-leash on the
 trails</div><div>throwing trash all over the park, something I see at every park</div><div> </div><div>I understand their point of view perfectly.  Part of me is even a petty bureaucrat. I feel certain I'm not hurting anything with my little boxes.  I choose not to humor them and take my chances accordingly.</div>  <div> <div> <div dir="ltr"> <div class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv-2142796465hr"></div>  <b><span>From:</span></b> ~Stormie~ aka Lorelei Reed &lt;sandstorm_62@...&gt;<br/> <b><span>To:</span></b> "letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com"

<div><div>The subject about Texas State Parks and letterbox permits. Some of our State Parks are requiring that one fills out a permit which is free in order to hide a letterbox. A few are upset because they are being included with geocaching and I insert a comment: " I just don't care for the hobby being micro-managed by park bureaucrats who just don't get it."  Now normally I would just let it go but... The park bureaucrats are not trying to micro manage these hobbies (letterboxing and geocaching) they are trying to keep it "safety first" really. If you follow "Government guidelines for parks, yes the parks are government land" and check in with the office telling them you are there to letterbox or geocache, will help the employees know the general area you will be in... with that said
 , note
 that a few state parks
 do not get cellphone reception and if you should get hurt they would know the area where you were going and if you had not checked out and could send search and rescue. A lot of us do not have "buddies" and are alone when we do this... So I do not feel that this is a bad idea. I am not on a soap box just trying to give another view point.</div><div></div><div> </div><div><div class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv-2142796465yiv9657436281MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><div class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv-2142796465yiv9657436281MsoNormal" dir="ltr"><span class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv-2142796465yiv9657436281yui_3_2_0_19_134183447550164"><i>~Stormie~  DSS (DustySandStorm)   <img/></i></span></div><div class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv- 2142796465yiv9657436281MsoNormal"><span class="ygrps-yiv-305385391ygrps-yiv-2142796465yiv9657436281yui_3_2_0_19_134183447550168"><i>"It's not the dry heat or the winds of Texas that bother me so much, it's the sand in the crack that chaps my butt when I am geocaching or/and letterboxing!"</i></span></div></div></div></div>
