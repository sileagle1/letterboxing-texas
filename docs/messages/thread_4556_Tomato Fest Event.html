I received an email yesterday that said some people were not being able to sign up for the Tomato Fest Event in Jacksonville on June 12th.  I did some checking on it and I think I figured out what the problem was.  So if you are wanting to come to the event and couldnt sign up, go back and try again.  If you still have problems, please email me and let me know.  There will be info about the event that will only be sent to those who are signed up.  Hope to see you there.<br>
