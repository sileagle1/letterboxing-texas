                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got an email this week from an out-of-towner who found our <br>
Labyrinth box.  She was very emphatic that I needed to update the <br>
clues to say that there might be poison ivy in the area.  I didn't <br>
see any when I planted, and believe me I check as I have a newly-<br>
developed PI complete intolerance.  I did see thorns, lots o thorns, <br>
so I put a specific warning about being careful when reaching in the <br>
clue.<br>
<br>
How much handholding does there need to be in the clues?  I feel <br>
that finders need to be vigilant and assume responsiblity for risk.  <br>
They need to look for PI, snakes, muddy areas, ponds to fall into, <br>
hills, non-boxers, spiders, thorns, nasty critters, etc.  I can't <br>
possibly warn about every hazard.  Are you careful when you LB?  <br>
Don't you pretty much assume that every box you go to there's going <br>
to be something that you need to watch out for?  <br>
<br>
And of course, this time of year you can't get away from PI.  I had <br>
to give up looking for Tweety because I couldn't safely get to the <br>
tree where it was hidden.  I'll go back in the winter.  Hopefully <br>
the PI is guarding it and keeping it safe.<br>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I think the finder is responsible for their own 
safety.  It is quite frankly impossible for the placer to know all of the 
hazards that will be there.  I usually write to watch for thornbushes, but 
honestly if you are there you can see them, so the warning is kind of 
pointless.  I guess it would help to know to bring some leather gloves, but 
I plan on adding those to my boxing bag anyway, cause you just never know what 
you will run into!!  If you are going to be out in the woods, you are 
probably going to run into something on your journey...  We have heard a 
lot about poison ivy and snakes lately.</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Now that said, I do think it is a good idea if you 
go to a particular box that is being guarded by a snake or poison ivy to go 
ahead and post it here so others are aware to be cautious and plan 
accordingly.  However putting it in the clues I don't think is neccessary 
because in a few months there won't be any poison ivy and that snake may have 
moved on.....  There may be an entirely different thing lurking near the 
box, this is just the way nature works and part of what makes being in nature so 
fun!!</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi,<br>
<br>
In my opinion, if it's an unusual hazard, it should be noted in the clues.  <br>
<br>
For example, my Bridget Bishop box (Salem, MA) was near a fairly steep<br>
and unexpected drop-off, so I mentioned that for letterboxing families<br>
with unruly toddlers.<br>
<br>
I also post a notice if a park doesn't allow pets on leashes,<br>
because--in my opinion--that's unusual and can affect a letterboxer's<br>
plans.<br>
<br>
However, outside of urban areas, poison ivy is common.  Snakes,<br>
sometimes poisonous ones, are the norm in warm-weather states.  Ditto<br>
black widows and, in Florida especially, scorpions.<br>
<br>
It's all relative to your own experiences.  My sister-in-law (from<br>
sunny California) had to live in snow country for a couple of years,<br>
and I thought she was going to have a nervous breakdown when she<br>
discovered that frostbite can be a hazard in winter.<br>
<br>
Having lived all over the U.S., I feel that anyone who is going to<br>
explore a new area should spend some time at that state's Official<br>
Welcome/Visitors' Center.  Many of them have a free brochure listing<br>
what hikers should watch for.<br>
<br>
If the site has unusual hazards or challenges, I think that we need to<br>
list them with the clues.  If it's something that every hiker should<br>
expect on a trail in that particular area, I don't feel that we should<br>
clutter our webpages with warnings.<br>
<br>
That's my two cents, anyway.<br>
<br>
Cheerfully,<br>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Book Antiqua">I feel that Letterboxing (and all 
that goes with it) appeals to certain types of individuals/groups that are 
looking to enhance their daily lives with knowledge of history, geography, art, 
nature, etc. (the list of virtues could go on and on).  I choose 
to believe that people who dedicate themselves to this enriching 
pastime are able-bodies who think on a different plane than the masses.  
Part of the problem today is that everyone expects their hand to be held rather 
than figuring things out on their own.  I have had two uncomfortable rounds 
with PI since I have begun LBing and even though it is frustrating and painful, 
I wear it as a badge of courage that I was out in my beloved Houston finding 
virtual forests that I never knew were there.  What challenge is it if we 
are told about every single thing that might be encountered out there?  
Knowledge is power, but the power is stronger when obtained through first-hand 
experience.  While I don't wish to exclude anyone, I think we should make 
people step-up their abilities rather than lower the hobby down to 
a lackadaisical level.  <font color="#000080" face="Book Antiqua">I feel 
strongly that this is such an enriching experience--why clutter the clues with 
the obvious precautions?</font></font></div>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">I can see that if you posted about the thorns, someone<br>
would think you should have posted about the PI as<br>
well.  Kind of a "legal-ish" interpretation of "if you<br>
warned me about one hazard, you accepted<br>
responsibility to warn me of all hazards."  <br>
<br>
I tend to think that posting about ANY hazards might<br>
tend to make the finder more complacent about other<br>
hazards not mentioned.  I can see, as Ais mentioned,<br>
that it might be important to post about deadly<br>
hazards like a steep drop-off.  In a case such as that<br>
though, I might write it into my clue more than<br>
drawing special attention to it by saying "this is a<br>
hazard".<br>
<br>
I can see possibly writing a disclaimer such as the<br>
one you are supposed to read from the LBNA site before<br>
you go hunting and putting it at the bottom of all<br>
your clues - maybe something that pertains more<br>
directly to Texas letterboxing that includes poison<br>
ivy, rattlesnakes and fire ants.  I don't think I'M<br>
going to do it, but I could see where someone might<br>
want to.<br>
<br>
I guess I'm fed up and frustrated with folks who want<br>
everything spelled out (in life in general, not on<br>
this board).  If YOU are allergic to PI, then YOU<br>
should know to watch out for PI.  My daughter is<br>
dreadfully allergic and believe me, she avoids it like<br>
the plague - I think the girl can smell it.  I, on the<br>
other hand, am not the least bit allergic (I<br>
occasionally get a bit of a blister, nothing more),<br>
but I do like to trip over roots.  Does that mean that<br>
other boxers should warn me if there are exposed roots<br>
in the area?  I think not - what I think is that I<br>
should know to be cautious of roots.  <br>
<br>
I mean really, why wouldn't we write something into<br>
our clues warning about wearing sunscreen too?<br>
<br>
I think that when we become too focused on getting the<br>
stamp, we find ourselves not giving proper heed to<br>
hazards.  Sometimes, you just have to walk away and<br>
leave the box behind until the circumstances are<br>
better.  If that is the case, count the trip as your<br>
reward and be happy with that.<br>
<br>
While I'm all in favor of making boxes<br>
finder-friendly, especially in areas where there are<br>
lots of new boxers, I frankly don't care to see folks<br>
who aren't willing to show some common sense and<br>
awareness get involved in letterboxing.  It probably<br>
isn't their kind of thing anyway and they won't be an<br>
asset to the activity.<br>

<div>If any of you are letterboxing out in the wilderness of Texas and are a bit 
timid about the surroundings ( poison ivy, snakes etc...) feel free to borrow my 
husband!  He will bushwhack through ANYTHING!  I recently took him out 
with me to Washington on the Brazos state park where after misreading the clues, 
I came face to face with a water moccasin curled up in the perfect letterboxing 
hideout!  I quickly backed away feeling defeated that a stupid reptile 
was going to keep me from finding a letterbox. My husband took the clues from me 
and laughed because I was in the wrong spot.  After that, my clue 
interpretation duties were taken away from me and he took over-much to my 
relief, as I was still creeped out from the snake!   I stared in 
disbelief as he blazed off the trails in search of letterboxes ( I was too busy 
watching out for fire ants and snakes!) and would come back to the trail with a 
smile on his face, twigs in his hair and scratches all over his legs.  But 
he would be victorious and secretively show me that he found the box!   We 
would discretely stamp in and then he would go back and replace the box!  I 
think he is as hooked as I am!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I guess poison ivy is a temporary "souvenir"and snake bites would leave a 
cool scar.  Imagine how fun the letterboxing stories could be?!?

<div>Personally, I think the "general disclaimer" thingy is fine. I'm careful, and figure if I get PI or bit or scratched, it's just part of the outdoors experience, lol!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Have you tried washing with Tec-Nu after exposure? It has really helped me, and I'm so sensitive I can get is second- or third-hand! Once I got it on the backs of my legs. I was wearing shorts and sat on my girlfriend's couch. Turns out her husband had just got back from hunting, and had sat on the couch a few minutes before me. He, apparently, had the PI oil on his jeans, transferred it to the couch, which transferred it to me!</div>

<div> </div>
<div>I got an email this week from an out-of-towner who found our</div>
<div>Labyrinth box.  She was very emphatic that I needed to update the</div>
<div>clues to say that there might be poison ivy in the area.  I didn't</div>
<div>see any when I planted, and believe me I check as I have a newly-</div>
<div>developed PI complete intolerance.  I did see thorns, lots o thorns,</div>
<div>so I put a specific warning about being careful when reaching in the</div>
<div>clue.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>How much handholding does there need to be in the clues?  I feel</div>
<div>that finders need to be vigilant and assume responsiblity for risk.</div>
<div>They need to look for PI, snakes, muddy areas, ponds to fall into,</div>
<div>hills, non-boxers, spiders, thorns, nasty critters, etc.  I can't</div>
<div>possibly warn about every hazard.  Are you careful when you LB?</div>
<div>Don't you pretty much assume that every box you go to there's going</div>
<div>to be something that you need to watch out for?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And of course, this time of year you can't get away from PI.  I had</div>
<div>to give up looking for Tweety because I couldn't safely get to the</div>
<div>tree where it was hidden.  I'll go back in the winter.  Hopefully</div>
<div>the PI is guarding it and keeping it safe.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do you all think?</div>
