<div>I wrote to the person that posted the message on AQ and I asked what they 
did with the box.  I also invited them to Open Space’s Artistic License 
event later this month.  They haven’t been back on AQ yet.</div>

I  was hoping someone might recognize it from the description of the stamp. I didn't have time to research anything at the time, but will see what I can find too. Did you look at the archives?<br/>
Thanks! <br/>
