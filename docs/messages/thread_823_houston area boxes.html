Hi,<br/>
Can anyone offer me some help?  You Houstonians have such a plethera <br/>
of boxes that I am having trouble sorting through all of them.  I am <br/>
going to be in Fulshear on Saturaday and Sunday for a wedding.  Can <br/>
anyone tell me of any boxes that are near this area?  Also, I would <br/>
love to meet any letterboxers in the area if time permits to exchange <br/>
a stamp or two.  Also traveling with us is a seal that likes to play <br/>
with balls who is looking for a temporary stop before continuing his <br/>
travels.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks in advance for any help<br/>

Depending on how much available time you have, you might find the <br/>
boxes in the Katy area, the ones at George Bush park in West Houston, <br/>
or perhaps some of the ones in the Sugar Land area.<br/>
<br/>
I recommend using the Texas Letterbox Atlas on the Birds of A Feather <br/>
Letterboxing website.  This will help you figure out what boxes are <br/>
closest to where you'll be.  I have found this tool to be extremely <br/>
helpful when planning lbing road trips.  A big thanks to the birds of <br/>
a feather for maintaining it!<br/>
