<div>I think the heat has fried our brains!!  :)  We were in the 
Dallas area yesterday for a triathlon.  My husband did the full Olympic 
distance race and I did a triathlon relay with a couple of friends.  The 
temperature during the run portion of the tri (my part of the relay) was already 
95 degrees!  It wasn't too bad, but we were too tired afterwards to do any 
letterboxing in the area!</div>

to place a box in Tom Green County.  He likes to find boxes as well as <br>
place them, only there aren't enough out there to find.  He would like <br>
to see at least one in every West Texas county, but he doesn't need to <br>
be the first placer.  I would say more power to you, West Texas has <br>
room for a lot more boxes.  What do you say, El Lobo?<br>

<p>Hi, young lady, how have you been? I think El Lobo would love for you <br/>to place a box in Tom Green County. He likes to find boxes as well as <br/>place them, only there aren't enough out there to find. He would like 
<br/>to see at least one in every West Texas county, but he doesn't need to <br/>be the first placer. I would say more power to you, West Texas has <br/>room for a lot more boxes. What do you say, El Lobo?<br/><br/>Boots Tex</p>

                    <html><body><div>Hi Lore!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would like to caution you about getting publicity from the newspaper.  While it sounds like a quick fix to an obvious problem, it does present its own pitfalls and it doesn't solve the problem as quickly as you might think.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>A local reporter did an article about letterboxing here in my town, and I firmly believe that article had a direct impact on letterboxing picking up around here.  HOWEVER, those of us who were interviewed by the reporter (Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, and me - because we were the boxers with boxes in my county) were diligent to make it very clear to her that she would be violating the spirit of letterboxing if she were to hand readers information on a platter.  She did a pretty good job of presenting the hobby and respecting the secrecy of it, and she took some time to go with my family to hide a box we had made and to talk to us about finding boxes.  She got a pretty good grip on the spirit of things, and overall we were pleased with the article - I think if one of us had written it, it would've been better, but we didn't.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The article was very good, and there WAS an influx of boxers.  Many of them, though, only found one or two boxes and then lost interest because of the scarcity of the boxes and because they were only marginally interested.  Some of them approached it with the wrong attitude and expected that those of us who were already in the game should've handed it up to them and made it easy.  Others just never quite got it (I do believe letterboxers are of above average intelligence).  The long and short was we increased our boxer count by "1".  There were a few others who got involved right around the same time, and perhaps the article reinforced what they had learned elsewhere.  We still have very few boxes, even though we have a lot of boxes now!
<br/><br/>The biggest point to be made is this - scope out reporters before you drop the idea in someone's ear.  Find one you like and whose style seems to be compatible to the letterboxing mentality.  Then approach them directly.  Set a very clear framework for what you expect from the article - no secrets revealed, no spoilers, no gimme.  Ask them to broaden the scope of the article and to focus on the benefits of letterboxing rather than on letterboxing itself.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>But before you go to the paper, I really suggest you plant a good six or eight boxes so they are ready to be found when the article goes out.  As you are probably aware, no matter how intrigued you become by letterboxing, it's really hard to stay interested if there isn't anything around to sink your teeth into.  Once you plant though, realize that by publicizing letterboxing, you may be exposing your boxes to half-hearted care until the new boxers get a feel for good boxing.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Before I went to the paper, I might consider going to Barnes and Noble and putting out a flyer to invite folks to a meeting about treasure hunting/letterboxing, or maybe to a local college or learning facility.  Try to think of places that cerebral outdoorsy folk might hang out.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By no means do I say don't publicize, but think broadly enough about it that you are covering the possible unintended consequences that could come of publicity.  It CAN be a good thing, but you have to keep control of the process!

<div><font size="2">Perhaps you could try working with a local outfitters/sporting goods store to set up a display. At the Eastern Mountain Sports (EMS) store where I used to shop in Connecticut, they had set up a display with Doug's book, compasses, water bottles, backpacks, local maps etc and a stack of flyers. The store has even hidden a box in their location (clues on LBNA I think). That was kind of a win/win situation where the letterboxing info was made available, and the store could make a sale! Usually the folks in those stores who are buying hiking and kayaking type supplies are the type that would appreciate the "art of letterboxing".</font></div>

I live in Amarillo!  A couple of homeschoolers have learned about <br>
Lbing, so the interest is building in this area. Although both of them <br>
have had some family medical issues, so Lbing has come to a stand <br>
still for now.  My niece, LittleLeisa, is doing an AWESOME job <br>
planting boxes around the area.  I believe she is doing a series in <br>
the Canyon as well as some others.  I have all kinds of plans for <br>
boxes, but seem to keep getting sidetracked with planning the kids <br>
curriculums for this year and this addictive Precious Metal Clay.  <br>
