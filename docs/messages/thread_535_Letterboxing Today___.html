My daughter-in-law, Amy (Ladybug), grandson, Mathieu, and I went <br>
letterboxing this morning. We found Calico Rose's Dancing Ducks <br>
letterbox, but it was full of stagnant water. The ziplock bag inside <br>
was filled with water, too. The stamp was intact, but the booklet is <br>
ruined. I am drying it out for you now, but I think only one stamp <br>
image can be even faintly made out. I dried out the box, and put the <br>
stamp with clean index cards inside of a fresh ziplock bag and put <br>
it all back in the box. I didn't have an extra box with me, but the <br>
one it's in should keep it safe until we have a heavy rain. <br>
<br>
After that we went on to Calliham and looked for Baby Bear's <br>
Southern Magnolia but failed to find it. It may have been the wrong <br>
tree, but we looked around three different ones. I hope it is still <br>
there and someone else can find it. <br>
<br>
We saw lots of deer and birds in the park - my favorite being the <br>
green jay! :) And with Mathieu along we stopped at several anthills <br>
to watch the ants working dilligently. We liked all those birdhouses <br>
and birdfeeders along the trail too. Mathieu and I were both really <br>
intrigued by the huge ones that I'm guessing are meant for owls. One <br>
was down on the ground so we stopped to look at it more closely, <br>
first making sure that no one was home. ;) <br>
<br>
Ladybug, who just decided yesterday that she wanted to start <br>
letterboxing, placed her first box today - on the same birding trail <br>
as Baby Bear's letterbox. Hopefully she can post the clues this <br>
evening. It's a nice one, commemerating our foot of snowfall over <br>
Christmas. ...Now why didn't I think of doing that...? <br>
<br>
We have tentative plans tomorrow to go letterboxing in Sinton. <br>
Ladybug hasn't found the boxes there, and the ones of mine there <br>
need checking. Or we may go to Goliad instead. Either way we plan to <br>
go to all the nearer places soon. <br>
<br>
If anyone wants to go with us on our forays, you are welcome. I <br>
don't know if anyone is near enough ....Calico Rose? Corazon?...but <br>
if you don't mind having a 2 year old along, and having to drop <br>
everything to be home by 3:15, you are welcome to join us. <br>

Well, Connie and Susan, - Amy and I didn't go letterboxing today <br>
after all. It was just too darn cold for me. We won't get to for the <br>
next few days either. So...<br>
<br>
I'm relieved that Amy's first letterbox is finally on the list. She <br>
said she posted it first thing this morning, but the list was all <br>
messed up today, so it didn't look like it was there. Then after the <br>
list straightened out, it still wasn't there. I guess she reposted. <br>
<br>
No, at Tip's Park, we didn't talk to anyone. It was fairly cool and <br>
a little drizzley, so there was no one in evidence. We did see one <br>
man far across the park, and one man in a car by the river, but that <br>
was it.<br>
