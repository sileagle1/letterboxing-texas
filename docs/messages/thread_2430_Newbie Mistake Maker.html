<div>I am sorry I have offended you, purpleintexKim. I see that letterboxing is very important to you and I can appreciate that. There is no reason for you to not attend the gathering in Rusk. In fact, it is certainly more in your region than mine anyway. Go to the gathering. Have fun!</div>

picking up the destroyed boxes. You have to ask yourself what you<br/>
would want done if roles were revearsed. I personally would be very<br/>
greatful for someone going out of their way to inform me as well as<br/>
send any shreds that were left. Celtic Lions evidentally appreciates<br/>
it as well. If nothing else I thank you for picking up the trash<br/>
because we all call this earth our home. Unfortunately it seems like<br/>
there were harsh words somewhere and misunderstandings. This can<br/>
happen when we don't have all the information before we jump to<br/>
conclusions and advice. I'm sorry you weren't able to express your<br/>
reasoning before judgement was cast. I don't know what's been said to<br/>
you to hurt your feelings. I do know that there are MANY MANY very<br/>
nice and considerate LBer's in Texas and I've been blessed to meet a<br/>
few of them. Please reconsider this situation. Step back and try to<br/>
put it all in perspective. This ONE person does not speak for<br/>
everyone. Your motives were just and honest. I truely believe that<br/>
it's the motives behind the actions that mean the most, most of the<br/>
time. People can do the wrong thing with loving intentions... we do<br/>
not live in a black and white world... rather we must navigate the<br/>
shades of gray. Some situations just don't have an answer. This was<br/>
an unfortunate event. I think I'd be much more concerned with what<br/>
the owners of the boxes thought about your actions than someone who<br/>
probably was just trying to protect boxes from future mishaps because<br/>
they love letterboxing as well.<br/>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <html><body><div>There seems to be quite a bit of confusion about what's going on here, and I believe we all may need to step back a pace (that would be a two step pace - LOL) or two and try to see both sides of the situation.  My comments are, as always, open for discussion or dive bombing or using for toilet paper, whatever you please.  I would ask that everyone with a stake in this particular matter read them through all the way before they dispose of them as they see fit.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I believe, and I think many others believe this too, that a very strong rule of thumb would be that a box should not ever be removed from its location.  And as with any rule, there ARE exceptions.  Here are some possible scenarios that would call for a decision, and how I personally would handle them:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) If I go and find a box that is waterlogged, I might remove the logbook and replace it with a few index cards or other paperstock so that anyone following behind me can log in.  After all, we just don't know anymore if the next finder is an hour or a month behind us, and we don't want to cause them to make a search to no avail.  I would then try to dry the book out as best I could and either replace it in the box or contact the sender and ask if they want me to send it to them, with a very forthright description of its condition so they can make an informed decision about whether they want it or not.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) If the stamp were missing, but the logbook were there, I would leave the log and contact the placer.  Again, we don't know if the next finder is right on our heels or not, and at least if they find the box and the book, they can stamp in and they know they got to the right place.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) If the stamp were there and the logbook was there, but the container was damaged, I would replace the container with the one I carry in my backpack, or I would put it in a heavy duty Ziploc like I also carry in my backpack and notify the placer of the action I took and also would tell them it is only temporarily fixed if I had to go the baggie route.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>4) If the stamp is gone and the logbook is gone, the container regardless of the condition is junk and I would take it and notify the sender to see if they want their container back and to let them know the box is essentially gone.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>5) If the location is destroyed but the box or any part of it is intact, by all means remove the box and report to the placer.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I try to consider what is to be gained or risked by removing a box and what is to be gained or risked by leaving it.  99% of the time the scale tips to leaving it in place and asking the owner.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I don't think it is ever necessary to leave and go ask the owner if they want you to do first aid, but I do think you should always, if possible, ask before you remove the box or its contents.  I would be a lot quicker about removing a logbook and leaving pages for logins later because the logbook is the most fragile part of the box and also the history of the box.  For one thing, think of following finders.  Also, realize that by removing the box, you do not know what the future brings and with respect to that box you aren't the one to decide the box's future - and I'll tell you a story from my own mistakes on that in a moment.  I even once had an occasion when I was on my way, that very day, to do box repair and when I got there, someone had already done it for me.  What if, instead, they had decided to remove my box?  My own trip would've been for naught and I (in the case of that box) would have gone home and recreated it, again for naught.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Okay, I promised a story from my own library of mistakes, and I even have a reciprocal story from Silver Eagle's repertoire of good deeds.  Several months ago (long after I should've known better than this), I was boxing with my sis-in-law and Lightning.  We had to curtail our trip because I had developed a migraine and we were heading back home going up Highway 69.  We stopped in Lufkin so my SIL could get Silver Eagle's box there, and I stayed in the car while she and Lightning went for it.  They returned to the car and showed me some problem the box had (I don't recall now what it was).  In my defense, my headache was excruciating, but that doesn't fully excuse what I did next - I told them to just bring it with us and we would fix it and return it.  It was going to take awhile to fix it there and I just didn't want to wait.  So I felt better the next day and realized I had done wrong, so I emailed Silver Eagle and apologized right away, and promised to get it re-placed soon. I did get it replaced quickly, but in the meantime a geocacher had apparently discovered the box's hiding spot and chose it for his own, unknowingly.  Someone also reported the box missing to SE in that short time (less than a week, as I recall).  Apparently, the gc'er later found the box and took it with him and got in touch with SE, but I don't think he ever put it back because that box is now listed as missing/retired.  Had we simply left the box where it was supposed to be, very possibly the gc'er would've moved on and the subsequent finder could've found the box.  I still feel terribly that I tweaked SE's box in such a way.  Since that incident, SE was passing through my neck of the woods and went to find my Killough box.  What he found was shocking-the logbook was torn up and appeared to have been ground underfoot.  The stamp was gone and in its place was a shotgun shell.  He kept a calm mind about him, and rather than taking the box, he emailed me about it so I could go tend to it and so I would be prepared for what I would find.  Similar situations, handled differently.  For myself, I always look to Silver Eagle and Baby Bear for an example of how to handle situations, and if he had found my box before I found his, I might have done differently and he might still have a box in Lufkin.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As to the specifics of the current situation - Kim had contacted me about Texas Pecan Festival some time ago and she promised to return it to me.  I don't recall what she had told me at the time (I somehow think the actual location was gone due to renovations they've been doing), but it came to the top of my mind as the gathering in Rusk approaches.  I learned yesterday that she had also retrieved Cherokee Nation and Gephyrophobia and had been able to reach Ruby Tuesday but hadn't been able to get Catpawz (who, by the way, I actually ran into in Tyler today!).  Since she had been unable to reach Catpawz and since I had committed to them and other distant placers in Cherokee County to tend their boxes here, I asked Kim to let me have Gephy also so I could get a new box for it and for Texas Pecan Festival and replace them before the gathering.  She readily agreed, but apparently didn't realize my intent was to use the stamps she had to get those boxes back out there, or I'm sure she would've told me then that they were in many pieces.  I, for one, am really bummed because I made the boxes up last night and was going to try to get them from her this weekend.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>For Kim - I don't believe anyone thinks you were doing anything maliciously in taking those boxes from their locations.  However, perhaps you could have temporarily repaired the box with a baggie and then attempted to let the owners know they needed to decide what they wanted to do.  In the case of Catpawz, trying to reach them for two weeks (assuming you started trying on December 15th, the date you logged the find) is really not very long, especially given the holidays.  And if you don't get an answer, you can always post to this list to see if anyone knows how to get in touch with a missing placer.  This group is surprisingly close-knit and very likely several folks would've had ideas about them.  Or I would've let you know that I was helping them with that particular box and you could've told me what you found.  Or for that matter, you can always post sitreps and then someone - anyone might have a thought you haven't considered too!  I've always found this group of folks to be very innovative and creative in solving letterboxing problems.  These are the sorts of things this group is great for, but you can't get defensive when someone offers you advice.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As several have said, I'm grateful to have other letterboxers who are willing to help me take care of my boxes, and it is refreshing when new letterboxers come to our area.  However, we ALL have to respect one another!
