                    <div class="plaintext-content">   'Tis been half a fortnight now since I came into possession of your great barrel of treasure. That's what I thought of it when I first laid eyes on it, anyway. Made a fool of me to find it filled with not gold, silver, or gems but bags of cloth, rubber images, and a book!<br>
<br>
   Oh, but what a journal. Filled with tales of costumed performers and fancifully presented animals and such. At first I was inclined to discard the whole lot of it and be done with the trouble but the imagination of those who must have toiled mightily to produce such a journal and the efforts and talent that must have gone into it humbled me.<br>
<br>
   Therefore I've decided not to discard this barrel but to hold it up for ransom. Select from amongst your numbers a brave few. From this group select your champion. Have this person come to my secret camp and be prepared to exchange a carved rubber image made in my honor for your precious treasure. If I am pleased with your tribute I will allow you return of the Circus.<br>
<br>
   Finding my campsite will not be easy. It is hidden deep in hilly country that lies at the heart of the former Spanish lands known as Tejas. In the county named from the good King Billy's firstborn heir lays a vast man-made sea. A great wall of stone dams the river, forming a place good for its fish and the leisure of it's citizens and a great place it is for a hidden camp. The king's Royal Engineers have built encampments all around this pond and connected then with a rough path stretching over eight leagues while encircling the entire area. I've no idea why they made such a way as this, perhaps they were searching for good water. Whatever the reason, the path is marked every half-hour's march with steel, stone, and wood. My secret base in lies along this path, hidden along the southern shores five miles from the cedar breaks and six miles from the camp of the Tejas. From the fifth milepost head north down towards the shoreline for 10-20 paces and you will find my camp, hidden amongst the great stones and rocks of the area.<br>
<br>
   For those approaching on foot from one of the King's encampments 'tis quite a journey but, if you study well the maps of the area, you will see that one can shorten the march considerably with a the use of a ship or one of those new-fangled horseless carriages. This is all that I have to say. The rest is up to you!<br>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Finding my campsite will not be easy. It is hidden deep in hilly country that lies at the heart of the former Spanish lands known as Tejas. In the county named from the good King Billy's firstborn heir lays a vast man-made sea. A great wall of stone dams the river, forming a place good for its fish and the leisure of it's citizens and a great place it is for a hidden camp. The king's Royal Engineers have built encampments all around this pond and connected then with a rough path stretching over eight leagues while encircling the entire area. I've no idea why they made such a way as this, perhaps they were searching for good water. Whatever the reason, the path is marked every half-hour's march with steel, stone, and wood. My secret base in lies along this path, hidden along the southern shores five miles from the cedar breaks and six miles from the camp of the Tejas. From the fifth milepost head north down towards the shoreline for 10-20 paces and you will find my camp, hidden amongst the great stones and rocks of the area.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; For those approaching on foot from one of the King's encampments 'tis quite a journey but, if you study well the maps of the area, you will see that one can shorten the march considerably with a the use of a ship or one of those new-fangled horseless carriages. This is all that I have to say. The rest is up to you!<br/>
