Nothing like having your priorities in order...our new baby was <br>
scheduled to be baptised this Sunday, and we got a call from the <br>
church today, since Sunday is Palm Sunday there will be no <br>
baptisims...they are re scheduled for...you guessed it...THIS <br>
SATURDAY.  Or we can wait until next month, which for a moment I <br>
seriously considered doing:).  We should be able to make it out to <br>
Brazos later in the afternoon...everyone keep you fingers crossed <br>
that all goes well, because I cannot wait to meet you all!  -Mother <br>
of Five<br>
