<div>I agree with Perky Pam that you shouldn't have to write that in your clues. I think it should be pretty obvious that anything attached to the logbook is not free for the taking. However, that's the way it is with letterboxes: you put them out there, then you have to hope people will respect your time and effort enough to take care of them. If they or any part of them go missing, it's a loss to the letterboxing community. I have a little series of holiday boxes that I've planted in Plano and I actually do put some little prizes in them to "celebrate" the holiday. I put the prizes in a plastic bag and write on the bag for everyone to take one. One box had about 35 prizes, but after only about 15 visitors, they were all gone. Apparantly someone liked them enough to take all of them. The way I saw it, the prizes were there for people to take, so when they were gone... they were gone. I'd have been pretty upset if they had helped themselves to a decoration on my logbook though! I guess you'll have to deter future finders from taking you charms by putting a dot of clue on the string (or whatever) where they are attached. That way there would be no misunderstanding (but hopefully someone wouldn't tear up your logbook to get it).</div>
