rounds, and I thought it would be a perfect box to add to the<br/>
gathering.  However, my local letterboxing pals are probably not going<br/>
to make it and there's just no way I can get up there before hand.  <br/>
<br/>
If you want to plant the box for me, will you contact me off list, and<br/>
I'll mail you the box all ready to go?<br/>
<br/>
You guys have fun and plant lots of boxes in an area of Texas that can<br/>
use them!  We may come by the next Saturday to scoop up all the boxes<br/>
the gatherers leave behind.<br/>
