                    <div class="plaintext-content">Great idea, Lucy!<br>
It's so exciting every time I check our home page to see more new<br>
members! SEVENTY-ONE!!! Now if each person could make just one new<br>
box....;-)<br>
<br>
I find it takes us about 3 weeks to get a box created & planted - so our<br>
REALISTIC goal (for our family!) could be a minimum of one a month...not<br>
counting PLBs and HHs. That would guarantee at least 5 new CelticLions<br>
boxes before the gathering.<br>
<br>
So I'm all for your challenge, Lucy!<br>
<br>
(Of course, unless my personal carving skills improve, you guys may want<br>
to challenge me to stop carving and take up knitting...;-))<br>
<br>

( Hope your football team is relatively unscathed & victorious, even if<br>
their fans are voiceless!) <br>

*****You put it that way, it doesn't sound so<br>
difficult.<br>

*****Once it cools off just a little more, and once we<br>
get past a mega-campout we're planning for our<br>
scouting district, we'll be hitting the trails with<br>
several boxes we've put together over the summer.  We<br>
tend to create in fits and starts, I've found.  My<br>
husband and son aren't too much into carving (although<br>
they are great for ideas), so my daughter and I<br>
usually do the carving.  She and I both do our best<br>
work when we work together, but I keep wondering how<br>
that's going to work out when she graduates this year<br>
and leaves for college. {{{sigh}}}<br>
> <br>
I had hoped to do a football mania series this<br>
football season, but I'm getting a late start on it. <br>
I thought to place a box in the town of each of our<br>
out of town games, placing them before our games.  I<br>
may still do it, but I'm going to have to forget<br>
placing them before games-too hectic.  I thought it<br>
would be cool to place one in every town we play, with<br>
their mascot.  I had considered making them a<br>
combination of our mascot and theirs, but I think that<br>
might be a little too tempting as possible targets for<br>
disappearance if accidentally found - we've put up a<br>
winning team for the past several years and they may<br>
not care to honor the rivalry. These little East Texas<br>
towns take their football very seriously (is there any<br>
Texas town that doesn't???)!<br>
<br>
I'm also needing to get some advance carving done for<br>
some cub scout excursions that are coming up, since<br>
our boys believe it is a requirement to plant a box<br>
when we go somewhere (sure makes planting easier when<br>
we can piggyback planting with another activity!).  My<br>
son's den will get their whittling chips this year, so<br>
maybe they can even carve their own stamps and stamp<br>
in!<br>
<br>
Well, lots of plans, we'll see how they go!<br>
<br>
Lucy<br>
