I just went out to the back yard and happened to look at a lock &amp; lock I<br/>
have had laying out in the sunlight for about 3 months now.<br/>
<br/>
It still works well, but the plastic is beginning to get that tint to it<br/>
indicating that the good old West Texas summer UV rays are hard at work on<br/>
it.  I will leave it out till it falls apart.<br/>
<br/>
Still - I like them enough that I will try to use it in those applications<br/>
where exposure to UV will be minimal.  In that note, I just ordered 8 or<br/>
them for $28.  What a deal... I got 8 of these.<br/>

Perfect for a logbook, stamp, and ink pad.  As you might guess, Hueco Tanks<br/>
#1 will end up in one of them.  Still pushing forward on that.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I found a good online source for Lock &amp; Lock boxes called www.reuseit.com.  It was mentioned on an Atlas Quest board.  I checked it out and it's very good.  I bought some of the small 6 oz. rectanglular boxes for $1.95 each, but they have all sizes.  They are dedicated to environmentally-friendly products.<br/>
