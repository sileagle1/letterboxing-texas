                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sorry for all the boxes that showed up as new on the LBNA site.  I did <br/>
not check that option, but it did it anyway.   What I was doing is re-<br/>
adding the old boxes of mine that had gone missing years ago, and I <br/>
erased.  Now that you can log finds I thought these should be available <br/>
for those who found them before they went missing.   Anyway, they have <br/>
now all been added back to LBNA.  Thanks!<br/>
