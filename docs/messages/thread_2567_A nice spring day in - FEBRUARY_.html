                    <html><body><div>In my job about ten years ago, I had to complete an annual pension summary report that had to be submitted to our corporate offices in New Jersey in the first week of February each year - no leeway, no flexibility, no question, no doubt.  It had to be turned in OR I needed to be dead or looking for another job.  Three years in a row, I was the only soul working in my offices for two or three days of that particular week because the weather was so bad that no one else could get in.  I drove 30 miles to show up at a dead office for the sake of that stinking report.  In MY mind at least, the first week of February is supposed to be rotten weather.
<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>But not today.  It was beautiful!  I had great hopes yesterday of getting to go look for JBK's February series out at Love's Lookout, one of my favorite local parks.  It didn't work out for yesterday, so I was determined that nothing would stand in our way today!  And nothing did...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I have had the miserable, horrible, terribly unpleasant respiratory crud for most of the last ten days, and Fearless Fox, my midnight walking partner, had it for the two weeks previous.  Consequently, between not walking lately and being sick, I was ready for some fresh air.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lightning and I arrived out at Love's Lookout  about 5:15 and took a few minutes to gaze out over the distant horizon, commenting as we did about how far down the valley beneath Love's Lookout is.  It's one of those places that takes my breath away (even when I haven't been sick!) every time I visit it.  I even often whip in to LL on my way home from Tyler, just to sneak a view.  You can see forever, mostly because Love's Lookout is so high up compared to the rest of the surrounding terrain.  Bookmark this note.  It's important.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>After we finished gazing, we stepped off, me throwing my backpack up onto my back and him throwing some rocks over the edge.  Thankfully we didn't get that backward.  Clues in hand, I began reading and we quickly realized that JBK was taking us down into the valley beneath Love's Lookout - cool!  I had often thought I wanted to put a box out in the valley, but I hadn't been down there since they revamped the whole place.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now Love's Lookout is a mainstay in the lives of Jacksonville-ites.  What I remember from my childhood is when the old WPA amphitheater was there, and me and my friends ran up and down the steps tirelessly and stood down on the stage and pretended to be stars singing to huge crowds.  I also remember summer concerts on the Fourth of July, when the local trying-to-make-it-big gospel band called first Spirit and Understanding and later, Damascus Road, played at the amphitheater and sang on the stage for real as local stars and singing for huge crowds of us-folk.  We would crowd into the seats and sweat and clap and sing and go home smelly, yet strangely rejuvenated.  That was back when lightning bugs reigned - pre-fire ant days - I swear fire ants killed off the lightning bugs.  But I jump ahead.  Anyway, we could see lightning bugs lighting up over the heads of the band and off across the valley, and I felt a deep peace as the country girl roots grew a little deeper with each song.   such do I remember from 30+ years ago.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And that was where Lightning and I found ourselves today.  Walking down into the valley where the long gone amphitheater used to be.  I tried to squint and remember where the edges of it ran, but as much as I remember some things about it, I don't remember others.  So we started following the clues and finding boxes.  Lightning was filling in his first logbook - eek!  He started it upside and backward - he's my boy!  And I was still trying to be neat and clean with my new logbook.  JBK was leading us down a path I had never been down before - I had always sort of imagined that when I went down into the valley, I would follow the tree line.  The first thing we noticed at the first box was that we were following Gryzzled Gryphon, who had logged in earlier today.  We speculated whether we would run into him on the trail or not, and decided we would invite him to go have pizza with us after we finished, if we did run into him.  It was not the first time we've found ourselves following his footsteps on a given day.  Of course PTK and TaterTexas had been through before us, sometime last week while I was in a state of not caring about letterboxing and wishing I could amputate from the neck up. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We got to the third box, appropriately the Valentine's box, and we were pleased to see a nice little sitting spot to rest while we did our logs.  I hadn't been sitting a minute even until I realized that my backpack and I were both covered with fire ants and they were showing their love.  I mean, they were swarming my backpack and somehow they had already managed to travel up to my t-shirt and my arms.  I would no sooner think I had them all swatted off when the next wave would attack.  It was all I could do to stand still long enough to log in, and I kept yelling at Lightning who, for some unknown reason, felt the need to carry on a conversation there.  Okay, it's not so unknown, if you know Lightning.  He carries on conversation no matter where he is.  Anyone who finds this box subsequently will notice that I did not sign the log, did not write our names, did not write my ditty, and barely pressed my stamp into the book.  Very possibly, you will even see a squished ant somewhere among my log entry.  Why the heck are fire ants out in FEBRUARY???  We still have no idea where the ants came from, so to anyone going to find this series, be wary of fire ants on the third box.  I believe they were very close to the box, as that was where I was sitting and Lightning got hardly an ant on him - and those were probably because I was flinging ants.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We continued on to the next two boxes, no fire ants except the ones that had hitched rides with me from the third box, but also no GG - sorry GG, you missed out on a free meal with us this evening!  Of course, we also missed out on your company too!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So we got to the bottom of the trail and the last box, the one celebrating the much renowned International Polar Bear Day -  (HUH?) and zipped up and decided to head on back.  We turned, and suddenly realized that we had to go ALL the way back up to the TOP of the lookout.  It looked much steeper than it had as we descended!  Just so you know - the view looking up is nice, but not nearly as nice as the view looking down.  There was nothing to do but start walking (although I briefly considered sending Lightning for the car, but him being not-quite-11, I thought that might not be such a good idea), so walk we did.  My poor lungs were screaming that I had not allowed them time to fully recuperate and that further, I had not taken them walking in a good three weeks or so, and they threatened rebellion.  I finally got them to the top and we sat down to rest.  Thankfully, my lungs don't harbor bitterness for long and we were ready to go again.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Lightning and I once again gazed out over the horizon as the sun set and the colors were graying before us, then got in the car and headed to dinner.  It felt GREAT to get out and walk, and to do another nice series on a day that by all rights should be nasty cold.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While we were at dinner, my mom, Trailcat, called to tell us she and my stepdad had been letterboxing too - in Tyler!  I think she's gotten the bug.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One item of business - I've set Lightning up with his own AQ account, so if you see Lightning of Texas, that's him.  A pseudo Lightning usurped the name already, so we had to improvise.  <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy

<div>It truly was a beautiful day around the metroplex area on Tuesday, and 
PuddleSplasher and I took the opportunity to do some hiking and letterboxing, 
too. Our main excuse was planting Boots Tex's Old Leathercoat letterbox for 
him in McKinney, and since there were area letterboxes that one or the other of 
us hadn't yet looked for, we made a day of it.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>We detoured by the Arbor Hills Nature Center in Plano to find Queen 
Beeloved's Houston Toad and PS' Welcome to the World Baby Girls, and enjoyed a 
very pleasant hike around the trails there to start our day - great views across 
the area, woodsy and wild in the center of a busy urban area not far from North 
Dallas Tollway.  Love the irony. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>PuddleSplasher also had a new letterbox for McKinney (Worst Driver in the 
World), so after locating a good place for Boots Tex's box and while I made 
notes for Leathercoat's clues, she found a resting place (appropriately) for the 
WDITW, and then I found it!  Then, still in McKinney, we looked for Baby 
Bear's Tamale Good (our only disappointment of the day - too much water has gone 
under that bridge - literally, apparently taking TG along with it!  Didn't 
find that one), and then we hiked the trails at the Heard Nature Center so I 
could find QB's Horned Lizard.  I don't know what his original colors were 
supposed to be, but as the Mom of a TCU Horned Frog, I had to color him purple, 
of course!  Another very pleasant hike through a lovely area.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>After a high-protein lunch (Whataburger with jalapeno &amp; fries), we 
decided to see what we could do along the Ray Roberts Corridor Greenbelt Trail 
near Denton, although QB warns in the clues that to find both letterboxes the 
distance is a 2.7 mile hike ONE WAY.  No matter, we decided we could do it, 
although we'd already explored all over the Pecan Grove Cemetery in McKinney and 
done two other nature trail hikes earlier.  First owl box was near a 
railroad trestle about a mile down the trail, and there we were, sitting in a 
nice wooded glade stamping in while a passing train roared by!  Cool!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We did have the wisdom to at least consider whether or not to continue, 
like there was even a remote chance we'd quit at this point,  but of 
course on we went, realizing somewhere after about another 1/2 mile that 
our total hiking distance on this day would be around 8 miles, but hey - it WAS 
a beautiful day, the sun was not too hot, it was a nice, level trail, there were 
lovely tall trees all around and birds everywhere, and we were having a great 
day finding wonderful letterboxes and beautiful stamps.  We also remembered 
previous challenges we've undertaken that seemed like a good idea at the time, 
and were just grateful that we can still do these things!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>As the sun was disappearing behind the tallest trees and the vultures were 
settling themselves into their roosting trees (foretunately, not too interested 
in us), we completed our 5.4 mile round-trip hike, having found both boxes, 
congratulated ourselves and then set off in PS' jeep for the REAL endurance 
test: getting back to Bedford and Keller through the rush-hour traffic north of 
the airport.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So there you are:  QB's letterboxes were all where they should be with 
beautiful stamps, if you've got the endurance for the hikes; BB's TG letterbox 
escaped us but we enjoyed the walk anyway; PS and Boots Tex have new letterboxes 
out there waiting discovery, and we got a little excercise in the 
sunshine. Don't you just LOVE letterboxing?  How else would we have 
found all these great nature trails!</div>

When I got to this one, I am happy to report, you had me sitting here laughing and wishing it wasn't freezing outside so that I could go do som letterboxing. I have to agree with the rest of the gang when saying you have a gift for writing. I think one of the best things about letterboxing is sharing it with family and friends (especially the little ones). My little one, PomPom Bear, loves to go.  Usually the hunt is great exercise.  There are so many new boxes coming out and I can't wait for the weather to get a little bit warmer so that we can go hunting again. Thanks for sharing your story.

 this evening!  Of course, we also missed out on your company too! </div> <div> </div> <div>So we got to the bottom of the trail and the last box, the one celebrating the much renowned International Polar Bear Day -  (HUH?) and zipped up and decided to head on back.  We turned, and suddenly realized that we had to go ALL the way back up to the TOP of the lookout.  It looked much steeper than it had as we descended!  Just so you know - the view looking up is nice, but not nearly as nice as the view looking down.  There was nothing to do but start walking (although I briefly considered sending Lightning for the car, but him being not-quite-11, I thought that might not be such a good idea), so walk we did.  My poor lungs were screaming that I had not allowed them time to fully recuperate and that further, I had not taken them walking in a good three weeks or so, and they threatened rebellion.  I finally got them to the top and we
 sat down to rest.  Thankfully, my lungs don't harbor bitterness for long and we were ready to go again. </div> <div> </div> <div>Lightning and I once again gazed out over the horizon as the sun set and the colors were graying before us, then got in the car and headed to dinner.  It felt GREAT to get out and walk, and to do another nice series on a day that by all rights should be nasty cold. </div> <div> </div> <div>While we were at dinner, my mom, Trailcat, called to tell us she and my stepdad had been letterboxing too - in Tyler!  I think she's gotten the bug.</div> <div> </div> <div>One item of business - I've set Lightning up with his own AQ account, so if you see Lightning of Texas, that's him.  A pseudo Lightning usurped the name already, so we had to improvise.  <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy <br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/></div></blockquote></body></html>
