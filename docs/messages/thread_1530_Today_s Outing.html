didn't try for any either...<br/>
<br/>
I did, though, go out with Fearless Fox and Lightning<br/>
and hike a new part of I D Fairchild State Forest in<br/>
Maydelle (which is just a few miles from Rusk).  The<br/>
forest has twelve miles of trail (that's the number I<br/>
got today - I've heard different counts).  Hiking<br/>
there is a new experience each and every time.  I had<br/>
in mind scoping out a place to plant a box, but I kept<br/>
getting distracted by the beautiful scenery.  Oh well.<br/>
 There will be at least one there by gathering time!<br/>
<br/>
We followed that up with a trip to a small winery<br/>
there in Maydelle (little hiking, a little<br/>
tasting...of course!).  It was quite an experience. <br/>
If you are looking for a serious winery, this one<br/>
isn't the place to go, but if you like quirky unusual<br/>
wines, you might want to bring your own barstool<br/>
because he only has two in his cozy little tasting<br/>
room!  We used to go to the wineries in Temecula, CA,<br/>
when we lived in San Diego and we were accustomed to<br/>
being shown only four or five of the best wines of the<br/>
house - not in Maydelle!  He proudly met us on the<br/>
front porch and rolled out every wine he made - and<br/>
opened up a fresh bag of Hershey's Kisses for<br/>
Lightning.  Friendly guy, friendly wines - if you like<br/>
to try new wines and you plan to be at the gathering,<br/>
you might make a little time to visit the winery. <br/>
It's not terribly far from Rusk!<br/>
