                    <div class="plaintext-content">After traveling around the state for one year this month, the tour  <br/>
bus box came home for a little maintenance after the gathering. I  <br/>
think I had the only non-Texan passenger, so she stepped off and I  <br/>
replaced. Now the bus is ready for it's second year moving around the  <br/>
state.<br/>
<br/>
The box currently contains: 2 box stamps and 18 passenger stamps<br/>
<br/>
To find the box:<br/>
<br/>
Visit Telge Park in Cypress. Once through the entrance gate, walk  <br/>
straight back to the wooden bridge. You'll see a new wooden scout  <br/>
marker here. From the marker, walk left along the woods line until  <br/>
you come to the gray electrical box sticking out of the ground. From  <br/>
here continue walking along the woods line, but take the first right  <br/>
in the woods. Just down on the left is a large pine all by itself.  <br/>
The tree is approx 54 steps from the gray box. Box is slightly behind  <br/>
and to the right of the tree. It's a big tupperware so you shouldn't  <br/>
miss it!<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
Don't forget this box is listed on AQ if you want to log it.<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">strawberry6703 and I recently picked up the bus in Mansfield. It has<br/>
since made its way a bit north to Flower Mound, TX after picking up a<br/>
new passenger: the important, if somewhat eccentric singer/musician<br/>
Gibby Haynes. The Bus has made its next stop at Murrell Park on<br/>
Grapevine Lake.<br/>
<br/>
To find the box head west on FM 3040 (Roundgrove Rd.) from I-35E into<br/>
Flower Mound, TX. Continue west on 3040 until you come to McKamy Creek<br/>
Rd. Turn onto McKamy Creek (you can only turn one way presently) and<br/>
keep going until you reach Simmons. Take a left on Simmons and<br/>
continue until you reach Murrell Park. Follow the road as it curves to<br/>
the right. After the picnic areas you will turn left into Fishing<br/>
Trail #2. Pull to the left of the grass covered circle and past the<br/>
first parking area. At the second parking area on your left park in<br/>
the South Eastern most spot. At the corner of the large wooden poles<br/>
you will see a small trail heading off toward the lake. Follow the<br/>
trail and soon you will come to a clearing. Directly in front of you<br/>
will be a nice Cedar Tree. Just past this tree and to the left will be<br/>
a larger Cedar. The Tour Bus is hidden at the base of this tree on the<br/>
lake side of the trunk.<br/>
