it was well done.  They even vaguely referred to a box<br/>
I just found on my trip to Washington D.C. last week (The<br/>
Inventor, which is "near the Lincoln Memorial").  The placer<br/>
of that box is a little worried the authorities may track<br/>
it down and get rid of it, but otherwise was pleased with<br/>
the article.  It will be interesting to see if the article<br/>
procuces another wave of new letterboxers.<br/>
