<div>Wow, that is kinda scary. HPD is usually all over memorial park. On bikes, in patrol cars, I'm suprised you did not see an officer to report it to. I would not list it as a 911 call but police need to know (and citizens who frequent the park) to be on the look out. This guy may not have wanted to bother you, but maybe he was out to hurt someone else? </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Maybe a call to HPD just to make them aware would be helpful to others.<br/>

<div>I went to Memorial Park today to find some boxes and do some maintenance on my NADA CLUE boxes, and I saw something that made me think of IRA Boxer's event box at the TALE8 event last year. It was called "Running Bare". I was on the purple trail down near where it goes down to Buffalo Bayou and a man ran by me, literally running bare. As in, nothing on but running shoes. So, wouldn't that be considered illegal? Should I have called the cops? He ran on down the trail until he was out of sight (thank goodness) and I never saw him again. The trails are marked as "closed", but I ignored that and had already seen a lady walking her dog on the red trail. I don't know if this guy had a plan in case he saw someone, but he basically ignored me and kept on running. I just thought you should be warned.<br/>

He was carrying something in his hand, probably a pair of shorts, but I didn't notice if they were red with white hearts.  I remember Green Tortuga talking about a "Hike Naked Day" and claimed to actually have done it on one of his treks in California.  I was alone, but it could have easily been a woman with children.  I went from there to the Houston Arboretum and there were school buses and the place was full of young kids, so that would of been pretty serious.<br>

<div>I went to Memorial Park today to find some boxes and do some maintenance on my NADA CLUE boxes, and I saw something that made me think of IRA Boxer's event box at the TALE8 event last year. It was called "Running Bare". I was on the purple trail down near where it goes down to Buffalo Bayou and a man ran by me, literally running bare. As in, nothing on but running shoes. So, wouldn't that be considered illegal? Should I have called the cops? He ran on down the trail until he was out of sight (thank goodness) and I never saw him again. The trails are marked as "closed", but I ignored that and had already seen a lady walking her dog on the red trail. I don't know if this guy had a plan in case he saw someone, but he basically ignored me and kept on running. I just thought you should be warned.<br/>

                          &gt; Wow, that is kinda scary. HPD is usually
                          all over memorial park. On bikes, in patrol
                          cars, I'm suprised you did not see an officer
                          to report it to. I would not list it as a 911
                          call but police need to know (and citizens who
                          frequent the park) to be on the look out. This
                          guy may not have wanted to bother you, but
                          maybe he was out to hurt someone else? <br/>

                          &gt; I went to Memorial Park today to find
                          some boxes and do some maintenance on my NADA
                          CLUE boxes, and I saw something that made me
                          think of IRA Boxer's event box at the TALE8
                          event last year. It was called "Running Bare".
                          I was on the purple trail down near where it
                          goes down to Buffalo Bayou and a man ran by
                          me, literally running bare. As in, nothing on
                          but running shoes. So, wouldn't that be
                          considered illegal? Should I have called the
                          cops? He ran on down the trail until he was
                          out of sight (thank goodness) and I never saw
                          him again. The trails are marked as "closed",
                          but I ignored that and had already seen a lady
                          walking her dog on the red trail. I don't know
                          if this guy had a plan in case he saw someone,
                          but he basically ignored me and kept on
                          running. I just thought you should be warned.<br/>

Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Running Bare<br>
<br>
I went to Memorial Park today to find some boxes and do some maintenance on my NADA CLUE boxes, and I saw something that made me think of IRA Boxer's event box at the TALE8 event last year.  It was called "Running Bare".  I was on the purple trail down near where it goes down to Buffalo Bayou and a man ran by me, literally running bare.  As in, nothing on but running shoes  So, wouldn't that be considered illegal?  Should I have called the cops?  He ran on down the trail until he was out of sight (thank goodness) and I never saw him again.  The trails are marked as "closed", but I ignored that and had already seen a lady walking her dog on the red trail.  I don't know if this guy had a plan in case he saw someone, but he basically ignored me and kept on running.  I just thought you should be warned.<br>

But it does bring up the question:  Is it safe to venture back to Memorial Park?  Are they still doing construction work behind the baseball fields?  I really need to work on this series.<br>
