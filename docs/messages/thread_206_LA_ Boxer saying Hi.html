I'm BOXDN from New Orleans,Louisiana and I've been boxing since DEC <br/>
1999.  Just getting around to joining this group and am going to be <br/>
staying close to the Beaumont area at the end of this month.  I'll <br/>
be working all over Cameron Parish LA starting on July 19th.  I was <br/>
hoping for some help locating active boxes in the area.  My F count <br/>
is hurting due to the lack of boxers in my area.  Hopefully I can do <br/>
some hunting while so close to our nieghbors.  I will return the <br/>
favor with a few plants of my own. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks<br/>

<br/>
Glad to have you in our group!  It makes sense to<br/>
think of Louisiana when we think of the Eastern side<br/>
of Texas.  We are all in a challenging situation<br/>
boxwise, so maybe pooling our resources will help<br/>
boxers in both states.<br/>
<br/>
I'm in Northeast Texas (closer to Shreveport), so I<br/>
can't shed much light on boxes around Beaumont, but we<br/>
have quite a few Houston area boxers who have probably<br/>
ventured toward Beaumont.<br/>
<br/>
Good luck in your stay in our area!<br/>
<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Glad you found us and looking forward to finding more of your<br/>
boxes (I found one while in New Orleans).  For those that don't <br/>
know, BOXDN placed the first box in Louisiana way back in 2000, <br/>
and has been waiting patiently for the rest of us to catch up.<br/>
I live about 100 miles from Beaumont, but I have found or placed<br/>
most of the boxes in that area.  Droop lives in that area and<br/>
might give more help, but I will take a stab at it.<br/>
First of all, you can use our Texas LB Atlas, developed by Sea <br/>
Dove, to graphically display most Texas Letterboxes on a map to <br/>
see how close various boxes are.  The link is:<br/>
<br/>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi?<br/>
<br/>
The boxes I suggest are:<br/>
<br/>
Lake Charles, LA - Mudbug<br/>
Vinton, LA - Louisiana Welcome<br/>
Beaumont, TX - Spindletop, Secret Garden &amp; Myrtle Tyrtle<br/>
Port Arthur, TX - Janis Joplin, Dowling<br/>
Sabine Pass, TX - Sea Rim Gator<br/>
Orange, TX - Texas Welcome<br/>
Vidor, TX - Roo Dreamer, Tall Pine<br/>
<br/>
Hope this helps and good luck!<br/>

Talklist, go to:<br/>

Hey, Steve, I tried my best to improve the box population in LA back <br/>
in May!  Honest!  ;)  Unfortunately, I haven't had a chance to go <br/>
back through Texas (outside of DFW) since I learned about <br/>
letterboxing a few years back.  ;)  Boy, do I have a bunch of places <br/>
in mind for Texas letterboxes--after having lived in 4 different <br/>
parts (Lubbock, Galveston, Copperas Cove &amp; El Paso) of the state for <br/>
11-1/2 years off and on from 1972 on through 2000--yes, I can think <br/>
of a few spots that would merit a box or two.  So many spots just <br/>
begging for boxes, so little time...  :(  <br/>
<br/>
I presume the 1,500 mile separation doesn't help, either!<br/>
