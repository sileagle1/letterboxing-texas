                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got a log report on a Geocache I have hidden in the Franklin Mountains.<br>
It is called The Lost Aztec Treasure.  This cache is still reported to be the<br>
toughest cache in El Paso.  Not because it is so well hidden, but because the<br>
hike is of epic proportions.  There are 5 points to find, the last one being the<br>
cache.  A number of people have taken more than one outing to complete the<br>
adventure.<br>
<br>
BTW - as an explanation - the word MUGGLE is a word from the Harry Potter movies<br>
- it refers to a person who is a member of the non-magical community, the<br>
Muggles are simply ordinary human beings rather than witches and wizards.  As<br>
for the Geocaching meaning, it is a person who doesn't play or understand<br>
Geocaching, and hence is likely to destroy or steal the cache.<br>
<br>
The common cache clue theme is WOOD.  All the clues are hand-printed signs<br>
screwed into WOOD.  The first one is at the trailhead to Mundy's Gap - screwed<br>
into the back of the trailhead kiosk.  It points you about 1.5 miles north<br>
cross-country to the Aztec Cave trailhead kiosk.  That one sends you up the<br>
Aztec Cave trail.  Here is where it gets tricky.  So far the hiking has been<br>
relatively easy, mostly the alluvial fan around the base of the mountains or<br>
actual trails.  http://www.uoregon.edu/~millerm/fan.html<br>
<br>
Most searchers go to the EXACT location on the GPS and look around.  And they<br>
fail.  Remember the WOOD theme?  200 feet straight below - inside the cave -<br>
there is a wooden bench.  Screwed to the bottom of the bench is the third clue.<br>
You have to lay on your back and look at the bottom of the bench to read the<br>
clues.  Hey - did I mention the clues are not written in English?  They are<br>
written in the Aztec Alphabet.  So on top of finding the clue, you have to<br>
translate it.  One team forgot to print the page with the alphabet translation,<br>
so they worked each clue as a puzzle.  And they got it!<br>
<br>
Anyway - this gives you coords to clue #4.  Number 4 is easy to find, it is a<br>
bench right in the saddle of Mundy's Gap.  But getting from Aztec Cave to<br>
Mundy's Gap isn't an easy trek.  After that hike, they deserve an easy find.<br>
You have to lay on your back and look at the bottom of the bench again, but the<br>
rest probably feels good.  <br>
<br>
Clue #4 sends you to West Cottonwood Spring.  The cache is a good bit away from<br>
and above the spring, hidden in a natural hole in the rock with more rock stuck<br>
in to hide it.  If you take a compass heading and start walking, it is a tough<br>
hike.  If you have a map or slow down to look a little, you find there are two<br>
trails to take you from Mundy's Gap to W. Cottonwood Spring.  <br>
<br>
The final part - the ammo can is locked to a chain.  It is a combination lock,<br>
and the combination is engraved on the lock - in Aztec numbers.  Yeah - you got<br>
to decode the combination too.  <grin>.  There are nice cottonwood trees around<br>
the spring, a nice place to sit and rest after the rugged hike.<br>
<br>
<br>
You can see the cache listing here:<br>
http://www.geocaching.com/seek/cache_details.aspx?wp=gcabd4<br>
<br>
Just above the logs there are two photos.  One of a young Parker proudly wearing<br>
his Park Volunteer patch and patrolling the trails.  The other photo is of the<br>
Aztec Alphabet.  Look it over.  If you find it interesting - there is a line to<br>
clock on the bottom for more logs - There are more logs. View Them All on One<br>
Page.  <br>
<br>
This cache has only been found 24 times!  This is the lowest number of visitors<br>
to any of my caches.  OTOH - the highest is 192.<br>
<br>
Anyway - some amusing reading for a Saturday morning.<br>

<p style="margin-bottom:12.0pt">I just got a log report on a Geocache I have
hidden in the Franklin Mountains.<br/>
It is called The Lost Aztec Treasure. This cache is still reported to be the<br/>
toughest cache in El Paso. Not because it is so well hidden, but because the<br/>
hike is of epic proportions. There are 5 points to find, the last one being the<br/>
cache. A number of people have taken more than one outing to complete the<br/>
adventure.<br/>
<br/>
BTW - as an explanation - the word MUGGLE is a word from the Harry Potter
movies<br/>
- it refers to a person who is a member of the non-magical community, the<br/>
Muggles are simply ordinary human beings rather than witches and wizards. As<br/>
for the Geocaching meaning, it is a person who doesn't play or understand<br/>
Geocaching, and hence is likely to destroy or steal the cache.<br/>
<br/>
The common cache clue theme is WOOD. All the clues are hand-printed signs<br/>
screwed into WOOD. The first one is at the trailhead to Mundy's Gap - screwed<br/>
into the back of the trailhead kiosk. It points you about 1.5 miles north<br/>
cross-country to the Aztec Cave trailhead kiosk. That one sends you up the<br/>
Aztec Cave trail. Here is where it gets tricky. So far the hiking has been<br/>
relatively easy, mostly the alluvial fan around the base of the mountains or<br/>
actual trails. <a href="http://www.uoregon.edu/~millerm/fan.html">http://www.uoregon.edu/~millerm/fan.html</a><br/>
<br/>
Most searchers go to the EXACT location on the GPS and look around. And they<br/>
fail. Remember the WOOD theme? 200 feet straight below - inside the cave -<br/>
there is a wooden bench. Screwed to the bottom of the bench is the third clue.<br/>
You have to lay on your back and look at the bottom of the bench to read the<br/>
clues. Hey - did I mention the clues are not written in English? They are<br/>
written in the Aztec Alphabet. So on top of finding the clue, you have to<br/>
translate it. One team forgot to print the page with the alphabet translation,<br/>
so they worked each clue as a puzzle. And they got it!<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - this gives you coords to clue #4. Number 4 is easy to find, it is a<br/>
bench right in the saddle of Mundy's Gap. But getting from Aztec Cave to<br/>
Mundy's Gap isn't an easy trek. After that hike, they deserve an easy find.<br/>
You have to lay on your back and look at the bottom of the bench again, but the<br/>
rest probably feels good. <br/>
<br/>
Clue #4 sends you to West Cottonwood Spring. The cache is a good bit away from<br/>
and above the spring, hidden in a natural hole in the rock with more rock stuck<br/>
in to hide it. If you take a compass heading and start walking, it is a tough<br/>
hike. If you have a map or slow down to look a little, you find there are two<br/>
trails to take you from Mundy's Gap to W. Cottonwood Spring. <br/>
<br/>
The final part - the ammo can is locked to a chain. It is a combination lock,<br/>
and the combination is engraved on the lock - in Aztec numbers. Yeah - you got<br/>
to decode the combination too. &lt;grin&gt;. There are nice cottonwood trees
around<br/>
the spring, a nice place to sit and rest after the rugged hike.<br/>
<br/>
You can see the cache listing here:<br/>

<br/>
Just above the logs there are two photos. One of a young Parker proudly wearing<br/>
his Park Volunteer patch and patrolling the trails. The other photo is of the<br/>
Aztec Alphabet. Look it over. If you find it interesting - there is a line to<br/>
clock on the bottom for more logs - There are more logs. View Them All on One<br/>
Page. <br/>
<br/>
This cache has only been found 24 times! This is the lowest number of visitors<br/>
to any of my caches. OTOH - the highest is 192.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway - some amusing reading for a Saturday morning.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm not aware of any letterbox that involves screwing wooden clues into signs and benches as well as ammo boxes with chains and padlocks, or am I missing something?  If I wanted to place a letterbox in that park and showed up at the ranger station with these items in hand and asked for a permit to place a letterbox, would it be approved?  I'm not trying to be provocative, but if the rules are the same for letterboxers as for geocachers, and I've been told that they are, and everyone is treated equally, as I think they should be, then I have been overly concerned about my little plastic camo boxes.<br>
