<div>Hey - Way to go Lucy! That's huge! Congratulations!</div>

<div>I have FINALLY started recording my finds on Atlas Quest. What a pain it is to go back through my old logbooks and try to find all these boxes. Many of them are not listed so I am spending way too much time searching for non-listed boxes or trying to find the dates I found the boxes.  I have close to 400 finds, but so far have only managed to record about 25 on Atlas Quest! So if any of you are getting messages that I have recently found your boxes, the truth is that it may have been a year or so ago!</div>

<div>CONGRATS!  When we were researching your PT - we did learn of the significant undertaking involved in getting your Wood Badge.  And of course - celebrating by boxing is always a great thing.  Should make your upcoming gathering even sweeter!  Enjoy!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Take care, The Boxalots</div>

<div>I know, Mike! I told my husband that one of the first places I want to go when he retires is out to west Texas to the Davis Mountains and El Paso area, so I'll definitely find your boxes (or at least search for them) before too long!</div>

<div>I'm not good at sitting and waiting. I guess I'm used to life on the fast track. Shortly before I flew to CT, my grandson (almost three years old) had a four hour surgery to have a defective cochlear implant removed and replaced with a new one (he was born deaf but by the miracle of modern science and technology, he can hear - amazing). Also that same day, my beautiful eight year old ragdoll cat had a heart attack and died right under the kitchen table and moments later the doorbell rang and it was the air conditioner repairman who had come to fix my air conditioner that had gone out the night before. I think he thought he had arrived at the Twilight Zone, because it only took him twenty minutes to do his job and get out. The day before I left for CT, my eleven year old lab suddenly couldn'd walk and I had to take him to the emergency vet and start him on some medication for his deteriorating hips. While I was in CT packing our apartment, my daughter called to tell me she was having strong labor pains and was on her way to the doctor (her baby is due any minute), so I basically told her to knock it off until I got home - for once she listened to me. The day I flew back to Texas, my two month old granddaughter had surgery to repair her cleft lip, so I went straight from the airport to the hospital where I spent the night. So now.... I am home and waiting for the arrival of the newest baby before I can go back to CT and finish packing and drive back to Texas with my husband - who will be freshly retired and not knowing what to do with himself. When we left Texas and moved to CT six years ago, one daughter was newly married and the other had just become engaged - now there are "almost" four grandchildren! I think my husband may go into shock when he learns what all that entails! To add to the excitment - I remodeled the house that used to belong to my parents and that is where I've been living for the past year. It's pretty small and totally full of furniture, etc. However, we have a truck load of furniture coming from CT and NO PLACE in this house for any of it. My husband wants to look for a new house, and I want to stick my head in the sand.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So besides clearing out the garage to store our furniture, I am spending my time waiting for the newest member of our family by logging my letterbox finds on the Atlas Quest site - something I've been intending to do for a long time now. I would love to go letterboxing this week because there are so many new boxes in the DFW area that are calling me, but I promised Viewfinder that I would wait until she gets back from Colorado! Maybe I could cheat and just find one or two........</div>

<p>
</p><div>As some of you know (mainly you folks who are either also scouters, or who have figured out my PT), I've been working on earning my Wood Badge beads for a year and a half.  Wood Badge is called "the pinnacle of scouter training" .  You have to spend two intense weekends camping with your patrol and then you have to set five goals for yourself and have to complete them within 18 months  I finished my goals two weeks ago, got them all written up and submitted and run up the chain of command, just in time for the deadline of yesterday - nothing like pushing the window! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I received my beads tonight, and although I knew I would be relieved to be done, I had no idea how great it would feel to stand up and be awarded the token of completion.  <br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I got home to my house (y'all have heard about my house!) - strewn with numerous craft projects and scout stuff and camping gear and, in one tiny little corner, my letterboxing gear.  I suddenly realized how stressed I had been over getting these scouting deadlines out of the way when I stopped and realized I had not carved in over a month, and haven't seriously letterboxed in longer than that!  It's TIME! <br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>

<div>I'm not good at sitting and waiting. I guess I'm used to life on the fast track. Shortly before I flew to CT, my grandson (almost three years old) had a four hour surgery to have a defective cochlear implant removed and replaced with a new one (he was born deaf but by the miracle of modern science and technology, he can hear - amazing). Also that same day, my beautiful eight year old ragdoll cat had a heart attack and died right under the kitchen table and moments later the doorbell rang and it was the air conditioner repairman who had come to fix my air conditioner that had gone out the night before. I think he thought he had arrived at the Twilight Zone, because it only took him twenty minutes to do his job and get out. The day before I left for CT, my eleven year old lab suddenly couldn'd walk and I had to take him to the emergency vet and start him on some medication for his deteriorating hips. While I was in CT packing our apartment, my daughter called to tell me she was having strong labor pains and was on her way to the doctor (her baby is due any minute), so I basically told her to knock it off until I got home - for once she listened to me. The day I flew back to Texas, my two month old granddaughter had surgery to repair her cleft lip, so I went straight from the airport to the hospital where I spent the night. So now.... I am home and waiting for the arrival of the newest baby before I can go back to CT and finish packing and drive back to Texas with my husband - who will be freshly retired and not knowing what to do with himself. When we left Texas and moved to CT six years ago, one daughter was newly married and the other had just become engaged - now there are "almost" four grandchildren! I think my husband may go into shock when he learns what all that entails! To add to the excitment - I remodeled the house that used to belong to my parents and that is where I've been living for the past year. It's pretty small and totally full of furniture, etc. However, we have a truck load of furniture coming from CT and NO PLACE in this house for any of it. My husband wants to look for a new house, and I want to stick my head in the sand.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So besides clearing out the garage to store our furniture, I am spending my time waiting for the newest member of our family by logging my letterbox finds on the Atlas Quest site - something I've been intending to do for a long time now. I would love to go letterboxing this week because there are so many new boxes in the DFW area that are calling me, but I promised Viewfinder that I would wait until she gets back from Colorado! Maybe I could cheat and just find one or two........

<div>Well.... since I wrote this crazy account this morning, I've had to take my dog back to the vet for the pain in his hips. So he is now hospitalized for the weekend, as they give him fluids and pain killers and see if they can get him back up and walking!  Of course my vet and the emergency vet are both closed today so I had to find a NEW vet.  I'm about to go pick up my grandson from his school; he is going to spend the night with me so we can plaaaaaaay! Wonder if a three year old would like to find couple of LBs?</div>

<div>I've done some pretty intensive long hikes on the Appalachian Trail and the Pacific Crest Trail. I love a challenge, but I'm not a rock climber.</div>

<div>I know, Mike! I told my husband that one of the first places I want to go when he retires is out to west Texas to the Davis Mountains and El Paso area, so I'll definitely find your boxes (or at least search for them) before too long!</div>

<div>Well.... since I wrote this crazy account this morning, I've had to take my dog back to the vet for the pain in his hips. So he is now hospitalized for the weekend, as they give him fluids and pain killers and see if they can get him back up and walking!  Of course my vet and the emergency vet are both closed today so I had to find a NEW vet.  I'm about to go pick up my grandson from his school; he is going to spend the night with me so we can plaaaaaaay! Wonder if a three year old would like to find couple of LBs?

<div>I'm not good at sitting and waiting. I guess I'm used to life on the fast track. Shortly before I flew to CT, my grandson (almost three years old) had a four hour surgery to have a defective cochlear implant removed and replaced with a new one (he was born deaf but by the miracle of modern science and technology, he can hear - amazing). Also that same day, my beautiful eight year old ragdoll cat had a heart attack and died right under the kitchen table and moments later the doorbell rang and it was the air conditioner repairman who had come to fix my air conditioner that had gone out the night before. I think he thought he had arrived at the Twilight Zone, because it only took him twenty minutes to do his job and get out. The day before I left for CT, my eleven year old lab suddenly couldn'd walk and I had to take him to the emergency vet and start him on some medication for his deteriorating hips. While I was in CT packing our apartment, my daughter called to tell me she was having strong labor pains and was on her way to the doctor (her baby is due any minute), so I basically told her to knock it off until I got home - for once she listened to me. The day I flew back to Texas, my two month old granddaughter had surgery to repair her cleft lip, so I went straight from the airport to the hospital where I spent the night. So now.... I am home and waiting for the arrival of the newest baby before I can go back to CT and finish packing and drive back to Texas with my husband - who will be freshly retired and not knowing what to do with himself. When we left Texas and moved to CT six years ago, one daughter was newly married and the other had just become engaged - now there are "almost" four grandchildren! I think my husband may go into shock when he learns what all that entails! To add to the excitment - I remodeled the house that used to belong to my parents and that is where I've been living for the past year. It's pretty small and totally full of furniture, etc. However, we have a truck load of furniture coming from CT and NO PLACE in this house for any of it. My husband wants to look for a new house, and I want to stick my head in the sand. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So besides clearing out the garage to store our furniture, I am spending my time waiting for the newest member of our family by logging my letterbox finds on the Atlas Quest site - something I've been intending to do for a long time now. I would love to go letterboxing this week because there are so many new boxes in the DFW area that are calling me, but I promised Viewfinder that I would wait until she gets back from Colorado! Maybe I could cheat and just find one or two........

<div>Hey - Way to go Lucy! That's huge! Congratulations!</div>
<div> </div></span></span>
<div>I have FINALLY started recording my finds on Atlas Quest. What a pain it is to go back through my old logbooks and try to find all these boxes. Many of them are not listed so I am spending way too much time searching for non-listed boxes or trying to find the dates I found the boxes.  I have close to 400 finds, but so far have only managed to record about 25 on Atlas Quest! So if any of you are getting messages that I have recently found your boxes, the truth is that it may have been a year or so ago!

</p><div>As some of you know (mainly you folks who are either also scouters, or who have figured out my PT), I've been working on earning my Wood Badge beads for a year and a half.  Wood Badge is called "the pinnacle of scouter training" .  You have to spend two intense weekends camping with your patrol and then you have to set five goals for yourself and have to complete them within 18 months  I finished my goals two weeks ago, got them all written up and submitted and run up the chain of command, just in time for the deadline of yesterday - nothing like pushing the window! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I received my beads tonight, and although I knew I would be relieved to be done, I had no idea how great it would feel to stand up and be awarded the token of completion.  <br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I got home to my house (y'all have heard about my house!) - strewn with numerous craft projects and scout stuff and camping gear and, in one tiny little corner, my letterboxing gear.  I suddenly realized how stressed I had been over getting these scouting deadlines out of the way when I stopped and realized I had not carved in over a month, and haven't seriously letterboxed in longer than that!  It's TIME!
