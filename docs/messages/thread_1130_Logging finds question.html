                    <div class="plaintext-content">Last night I was trying to email the placers of our recent finds and<br>
log them in.  But I was becoming more befuddled by the minute.<br>
<br>
In what order or how do you log your finds?  Do you go to<br>
letterboxing.org first and email through the contact the placer, then<br>
go to atlasquest, or vice versa?  Some of the boxes we found were not<br>
in both places.  Then do you also email the placer directly with the<br>
email address found in the box??<br>
<br>
I guess I am wondering what is the most beneficial to the placer??  Do<br>
these sites keep running counts for you of how many times your boxes<br>
have been found or do you just like to know the box is still there and<br>
when the last time someone was there?  I would love to be the most<br>
beneficial to the placer for their work in getting these out there. <br>
Just confused as to the most efficient way to get it done.<br>
<br>
Just to make it more interesting, we are going to go find some more today!!<br>

It's a great day for boxing (only getting up in low 90's)  WooHoo!!- <br>

                    <html><body><div> Julie,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As you have found, what boxes are listed varies between the two sites letterboxing.org (LBNA) and AtlasQuest (AQ).   Both sites can host the clues or they can just have a link to where the actual clues reside. Our family has chosen to have our own website for the clues to our personal letterboxes and have registered on both sites so to maximize the audience for our boxes.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>LBNA has been the main letterboxing site and has the most clues.  AQ just started in the last year or so.  LBNA has going through some changes through the years as various folks served as webmasters for it.  Both sites have been making changes and enhancements which is nice to see.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>As a placer, I always like to hear when someone visits one of our boxes.  For me that is more important then a list that shows everyone that has found it.  We have placed boxes which are not close to where we live so the update emails are definitely appreciated. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>If a box is listed on both sites, I just pick one site to send the update through.  One difference between the two is the LBNA sends an email to the placer/maintainer directly while AQ generally just holds the mail till the person logs in (unless they have requested to be notified when they have AQ mail).  Registering your find on the websites does not automatically notify the placer.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope this helps. </div>

I don't care how it's done or through what site, I just like to know <br>
that someone has found my boxes.  I do not keep track of who found <br>
them or when.  If it's been awhile since I've done maintenance, it <br>
serves to remind me that I have active boxes out there.  <br>
<br>
As a finder, I do not log a find electronically.  The stamp in my <br>
book is good enough for me.  I think both AQ and LBNA let you do <br>
this now, but I just use them to print off clues.  After I <br>
(hopefully) find the box, I'll send them an individual email and <br>
then post my adventures on this list.<br>

about our boxes is fine.<br>
In the beginning, when we were the only boxers in Dallas, getting notes from<br>
folks who had found our boxes was a HUGE incentive to keep planting<br>
them...and it still is. <br>
As a finder, I try very hard to write to each owner to update them on the<br>
condition and to thank them for planting a box. Atlasquest is the easiest<br>
for me, since I can log my find and write the note at the same time, saving<br>
one extra step.<br>
As an owner, I try very hard to respond to anyone who writes to us - and to<br>
thank them for filling us in.<br>
Now if Dallas ever has 100 boxers all logging in finds at once, my<br>
Martha-Stewart-letter-etiquette might fall by the wayside, but for now I'll<br>
do anything I can to encourage everyone!<br>
