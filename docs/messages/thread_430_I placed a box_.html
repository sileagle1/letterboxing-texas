Hey,<br/>
<br/>
I placed a new box, kind of appropriate for us here on the Texas <br/>
list. It is where "Birds of a Feather" like to flock together, and <br/>
it even has a "Hawk" observation tower! Yes, that's me up there <br/>
waiting for new boxes to come my way. (maybe your kids will <br/>
say "WOWMOM" too) <br/>
Look for the clues to the World Birding Center box on the <br/>
Letterboxing.org site.<br/>
<br/>
Better go hunt for it soon, I am the planter of doomed boxes. I hope <br/>
this one lasts through the next few months. At least it's close <br/>
enough to home to check on often.<br/>
<br/>
Let me know if you find it.<br/>
<br/>
WOW<br/>

Maybe you could create a box called "DOOM" and break the curse? Kind of<br/>

Yes, I'm all excited about my new baby. Just to let you know, we did <br/>
see lots of "Busy Bee"s but no "lions", celtic or otherwise, nor any <br/>
tigers. Any Butterflies on this list? <br/>
<br/>
PS to my box, just found out you can rent surrey bikes, 2 or 4 <br/>
person, there for the day. Guess what we're doing next weekend! Look <br/>
for another box from me soon. Can you believe I've lived here for <br/>
years and never went into this park?<br/>
