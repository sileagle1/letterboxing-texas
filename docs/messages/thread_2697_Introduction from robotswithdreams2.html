                    <div class="plaintext-content">Heyall.  So, I just got into letterboxing recently with a friend of<br>
mine.  I found out about letterboxing, oddly enough, on a crafting<br>
website I frequent: craftster.org<br>
This was the post that introduced me to the hobby:<br>
http://www.craftster.org/forum/index.php?topic=5191.0<br>
<br>
When I read it I just knew letterboxing was for me.  My friend and I<br>
had already been visiting all these parks and historical places in our<br>
area unawares there were treasures to be found in the very spots we<br>
had stood!  <br>
<br>
We made our stamps the day after we found out about letterboxing, but<br>
we were really dumb and made these stamps that were like three inches<br>
long each!  Well, they look neat, but after we found our first box<br>
(which was a microbox) in Landa Park (New Braunfels) we ended up<br>
having to go home and make smaller stamps.  <br>
<br>
We just placed our first box the other day, locally (we live in New<br>
Braunfels), and Corazon found it today and introduced me to this Yahoo<br>
group.  It seems you all have quite a community!  I hope you'll<br>
welcome me in!  <br>
<br>
Besides placing our first box we have found quite a few in the area. <br>
Also, my friend (robotswithdreams1) went to OK to visit family and<br>
found some there, and she brought back a hitchhiker, which we placed <br>
. . . somewhere local (but not in NB).  Hope it falls into good hands.  <br>

                    <html><body><div>I had that same sensation when I got started - I had walked a particular trail a hundred times, probably even stopped to rest on a particular log, and when I discovered letterboxing I could not believe there was a box right there on that very trail!  I knew the trail so well I could visualize the exact location of the box based on the directions.  I could scarcely wait to go look behind that log to see if there was really something there - there was!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If you really like your big stamps, hold onto them and carry them with you if you want!  Not all boxes are micros, and some boxes will take a larger stamp.  Sometimes boxers use more than one image, especially depending on the size of the box.
