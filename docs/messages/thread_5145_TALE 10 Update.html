He said it should be done or done enough to not affect us so we should be ok.  Also, I asked about reduced entrance fees and he said for those coming on Saturday, just say you are going to the Rec Hall and the fee will only be $2.00.  If you come Friday, tell them the next day you will be at the Hall and they should reduce that day.  See you in 2 weeks!<br/>
