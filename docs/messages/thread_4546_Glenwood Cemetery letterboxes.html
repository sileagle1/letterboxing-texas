                    <div class="plaintext-content">We visited Glenwood Cemetery in Houston today to find Silver Eagle's box, "King of the Wildcatters", to replace a missing box and to place a new box.  We accomplished all three things on the agenda.  SE's box, as always, was very nice, with a very interesting bit of Houston history and a location near the grave of the great actress Gene Tierney.  I replaced my tribute box "A Lullaby for Naomi", which had gone missing, and I placed it in a different location not too far from its original spot.  This box has been a word-of-mouth box, but I am making it a standard box in an effort to encourage other finders to this beautiful cemetery.  LSQ placed a new box, "Angel Band", her second in the Weeping Angel series of boxes.  By the way, if you've seen the Glenwood Weeping Angel, you probably noticed that her left hand is missing.  Not any more; it has been beautifully restored.  You have to look close to see where it has been repaired.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, phoenix8.  I posted a couple of pictures of the Angel.  The stamp for LSQ's box, Angel Band, depicts the Angel without the left hand.  I'd like to know how they made the new hand.  It must be a casting, but they did a great job.  Maybe they'll repair the one in Scottsville.  There's another similar Angel in a cemetery near Denton that has the hand intact and I've found one in Dallas and another in Waco that are similar.<br>
