at Moorhead's Blueberry Farm:<br/>
http://www.moorheadsblueberryfarm.com/<br/>
It was so fun and tasty (we ate as much as we kept) I talked<br/>
them into going after a few letterboxes on the way home.  After<br/>
a stop at Old Town Spring (to appease the wife), we headed to<br/>
Cullen Park where I found Cullen Cycle and Farmer's Lair doing<br/>
fine.  We then went to Terry Hershey Park and found Blessing<br/>
Box.  I looked for Hershey Kiss, but as Baby Bear already<br/>
said, it appears to be missing.  We then went to nearby Lupe<br/>
Tortillas restraurant for some great Mexican Food before<br/>
heading home.  Now I'm going to have blueberries on ice cream!<br/>
