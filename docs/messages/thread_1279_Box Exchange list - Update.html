&gt; Hi all<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I created a new database that has the results of the draw, so you <br/>
&gt; should know who you are sending to.  When I get a chance later <br/>
today, <br/>
&gt; I will try to email everyone whatever contact info I have.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Lucy Locket, no one signed up just to create a box, so I'd be <br/>
&gt; delighted to send you one, but it may be a little later than <br/>
September <br/>
&gt; 15th.  I'm thinking Muleshoe Mule Days.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Thank you all so much for your eager participation.  I'm looking <br/>
&gt; forward to getting these boxes out there.  <br/>

Miss Moon mails to Mother of Five, who mails to Monkeytoes.  I must <br/>
have gotten my Mmmmms mixed up.  Should be straight now, but let me <br/>
know if it's not.  I could only get the entries to sort <br/>
alphabetically, and I wanted them sorted in a different way.  Argh.<br/>
