soups | Naturally low-in-fat buttermilk gives this<br/>
soup its creamy texture. Serve it as a refreshing side<br/>
to our Tuscan Tuna Wraps. <br/>
Ingredients <br/>
<br/>
6 medium tomato(es), cut into chunks (about 8 cups) <br/>
4 cup fat-free chicken broth, reduced-sodium <br/>
3 large onion(s), cut into chunks (about 3 cups) <br/>
1/4 cup canned tomato paste <br/>
3 large garlic clove(s), peeled <br/>
1 1/2 tsp table salt <br/>
1/4 tsp black pepper <br/>
2 1/2 cup buttermilk <br/>
1/3 cup dill, fresh, leaves, chopped (stems removed) <br/>
<br/>
Instructions <br/>
In a large pot, bring tomatoes, broth, onions, tomato<br/>
paste, garlic, salt and pepper to a boil over<br/>
medium-high heat. Cover, reduce heat to low and simmer<br/>
until onions are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes.<br/>
Remove from heat; cool slightly.<br/>
<br/>
Using a slotted spoon, lift solids from pot and<br/>
transfer to a food processor or blender (you'll need<br/>
to do this in a few batches); puree until smooth. Or<br/>
puree soup in pot with an immersion blender.<br/>
<br/>
Pour pureed ingredients into a large bowl along with<br/>
any liquid left in pot; stir in buttermilk and dill.<br/>
Refrigerate until chilled (can be refrigerated for up<br/>
to 5 days). Yields about 1 1/2 cups per serving.<br/>
<br/>
This Mix and Match recipe is part of our Make Ahead<br/>
series, in which we give you a week's worth of recipes<br/>
intended to save you time in the kitchen. We show you<br/>
how to swap dishes to create quick and easy meals<br/>
throughout the week. This week, we highlight dishes<br/>
that feature fresh summer produce. Pair the cold<br/>
Tomato-Dill Soup with the Tuscan Tuna Wraps or the<br/>
Santa-Fe Salad, use the Grilled Summer Vegetables in<br/>
both the wrap and with the Cuban Chicken Skewers, and<br/>
top virtually anything with the Tropical Fruit Salsa.<br/>
The options are endless!<br/>
