                    <div class="plaintext-content">Of the 25 letterboxes listed on LBNA in El Paso, 20 are placed by people other than you or your wife, so no, half are not yours.  They were placed by letterboxers who felt sorry for you since you used to complain of having no boxes to find.  Seems a shame that you are now too busy to find them.  Just because they are in your own town doesn't mean they aren't in special places worth exploring.<br>
Just sayin.<br>
