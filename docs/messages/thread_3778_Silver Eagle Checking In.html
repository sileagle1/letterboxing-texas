<div><font size="2">Good hearing from you. I loved the part about playing Hide and Seek with neighbors. I attended a seminar once where the presenter made the point that the loss of our sense of neighborhoods was due to three elemental things: TV, Air Conditioners and Loss of Front Porches. TV and air conditioning drove everyone inside their homes with closed doors, and houses weren't built with front porches anymore where people used to sit and chat with passing neighbors. I guess that's being proven as true since the lack of TV and AC has driven everyone outside to "play" with their neighbors again.</font></div>
