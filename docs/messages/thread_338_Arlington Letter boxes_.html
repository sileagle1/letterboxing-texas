Thanks to Kantexan and the Samuraistampers, we had a great time boxing<br/>
on Saturday! I am so grateful that there are energetic folks like you<br/>
guys out there increasing our pleasure!<br/>
We started with Green Oaks - another one of those neat little places we<br/>
never would have stumbled upon without letterboxing. Cute stamp! Good<br/>
job, Pikachu Ponderer!<br/>
We ended the day with a truly spectacular walk through River Legacy Park<br/>
to look for Haunted by Waters- I can't believe we're lived here 20 years<br/>
and never knew that park was there. I can't wait to tell our oldest<br/>
about the great biking trail - he's getting pretty tired of training<br/>
around White Rock - it'll make a lovely change of scenery for him!<br/>
StillWaters &amp; Cactus Licker stumbled upon a really gorgeous long huge<br/>
copperhead on the hunt, and they are still talking about its beautiful<br/>
coloring. (I have to admit I was taking a time out sitting &amp; bird<br/>
watching at "Stonehenge" when they found it).<br/>
But the most fun was tracking down Kantexan's mystery box &amp; first Hitch<br/>
Hiker!!! Loved it - and Jean Lafitte has the coolest HH box I've ever<br/>
seen! I won't give anything away, because it's really good - but I think<br/>
I'll make sure we keep it on Texas for a while so we all can enjoy it!<br/>
