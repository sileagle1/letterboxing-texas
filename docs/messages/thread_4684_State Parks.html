<br/>
&gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening.  I have been<br/>
reading the<br/>
&gt; postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much time to reply,<br/>
so I<br/>
&gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I noticed that<br/>
Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I discussed the<br/>
lack of<br/>
&gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>
standard<br/>
&gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware of<br/>
letterboxing, <br/>
<br/>
Yup - should be.  However, the distinction will be lost on many/most.<br/>
Geocaching is much more popular, and to the untrained eye, the two are so<br/>
similar.  All hide and seek - just the tools differ.  Some parks will just have<br/>
too little staff and too much work to worry or care about the minutia.  But we<br/>
should still try.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; but<br/>
&gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own as to<br/>
how to carry<br/>
&gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy and<br/>
procedures at<br/>
&gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying to do<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I don't<br/>
think anyone<br/>
&gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for geocaching,<br/>
but we should<br/>
&gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I think the<br/>
park<br/>
&gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.  <br/>
<br/>
JMHO - they will.  Those who care to see anyway.  But it will take time too.<br/>
Again, as above, some will never see the difference.  It is a small matter in<br/>
the big picture for them.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We have to prove to<br/>
&gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the policy.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
BINGO.  One bad apple CAN spoil the whole bunch.  Almost happened with<br/>
geocaching.  Problem is, the people you are reaching on this list are mostly NOT<br/>
the problem!  I hesitate to push an agenda here, but "perhaps" everyone might<br/>
consider adding a note to each letterbox listing directing them to a message<br/>
somewhere about this very subject.  I would agree to post a message or at least<br/>
a LINK in all or my clues.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; We are<br/>
&gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that were<br/>
placed before the<br/>
&gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr. Owen is<br/>
&gt; considering the request.  <br/>
<br/>
I have heard them discussed as "Legacy Boxes".  Great idea.  I feel the only box<br/>
in my area that should fit this is the Hueco Tanks Letterbox.  But I will leave<br/>
that for the more experienced to decide.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I would like to say that I appreciate the encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in spite of<br/>
Silver<br/>
&gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is no one<br/>
whose opinion<br/>
&gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
believe that will<br/>
&gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our boxes<br/>
responsibly<br/>
&gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and may,<br/>
with our good<br/>
&gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the parks.  <br/>
<br/>
Exactly - Times change.  Geocaching brought a bad light to our hobby even though<br/>
we are not them.  When we were few and flying under the radar, it was easy.  As<br/>
letterboxing became more popular, and some hiders were not as stealthy as silver<br/>
Eagle and others, the hobby was "discovered".<br/>
<br/>
&gt; I don't want<br/>
&gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't set the<br/>
best example<br/>
&gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  <br/>
<br/>
BINGO again!  We as letterboxers have to do it better and cleaner just to prove<br/>
we are different.  I have said this all along.  This is one of the reasons I<br/>
volunteer in the park.  I needed to prove that the troublemakers were the<br/>
exception, NOT the rule.  I was successfully, but only on a local level.<br/>
<br/>
May I also add the B.T. cannot do this alone.  Everyone will need to step up and<br/>
set the example so to speak.  As this develops, perhaps B.T. will ask for<br/>
volunteers to get with a local state park in their area and do what you need to<br/>
in order to get the difference recognized.  Sure - it means work.  How much to<br/>
you love letterboxing?<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Okay, maybe I do feel some bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, that we<br/>
will not only<br/>
&gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we have<br/>
our own<br/>
&gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes in<br/>
State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we can<br/>
prove our right<br/>
&gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>
<br/>
Yup - again - local contact.<br/>
<br/>
&gt; Boots Tex<br/>
<br/>
You have done a great job sir.  Although I have been quite inactive as other<br/>
things in my life have over-ridden our travels, I thank you for your work.  I<br/>
know it wasn't easy.  It was difficult several years ago when I started working<br/>
with the local rangers.  But in the end it was worth it.  I hope it goes as well<br/>
for you sir.<br/>

<br/>
Remember - TPWD is out to do what is most economical, easiest and best for TPWD.<br/>
Less work, less cost, less people.  Unless a volunteer steps forward with a way<br/>
to make that work without any input from TPWD, I don't see it happening.  I am<br/>
not saying it isn't a good idea....  I just don't see TPWD doing it with the<br/>

Again - perhaps a volunteer?<br/>

I am willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also.  Self regulation on our part would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then each park would need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can not be used for letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along with instructions and rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make sure they are not in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be aware of, but then we can make them aware of it).    Boots - do you think this would be something worth presenting to your new contact, vs the permit system which is a pain for everyone involved.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening.  I have been<br/>
&gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much time to<br/>
&gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I noticed that<br/>
&gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I discussed the<br/>
&gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>
&gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware of<br/>
&gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own as to<br/>
&gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy and<br/>
&gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying to do<br/>
&gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I don't<br/>
&gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for geocaching,<br/>
&gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I think the<br/>
&gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.  We<br/>
&gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the policy.<br/>
&gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that were<br/>
&gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr. Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in spite of<br/>
&gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is no one<br/>
&gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
&gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
&gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our boxes<br/>
&gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and may,<br/>
&gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the parks.  I<br/>
&gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't set the<br/>
&gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel some<br/>
&gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, that we<br/>
&gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we have<br/>
&gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes in<br/>
&gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we can<br/>
&gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

They have stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at least make the point that we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about how we could do that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't want to give up the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on a moments notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the right to delegate that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can understand their position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would have to leave the box as you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when they get around to checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either have to go back and move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because then they'd have to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying to resolve and so far, we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would satisfy both them and us?<br/>

&gt; That is what I was saying.  We develope the database and store it on this talk list.   I am willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also.  Self regulation on our part would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then each park would need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can not be used for letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along with instructions and rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make sure they are not in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be aware of, but then we can make them aware of it).

<br/>
I have been doing this here in El Paso for several years already.  It is called<br/>
PARK VOLUNTEER.  When they have a Geocache to approve, they call me.  I hike out<br/>
and check it out.  In the last 7 years, there has only been one geocache<br/>
disapproved, and one that required special instructions on the clues.<br/>
<br/>
Since I am the only letterboxer who has gone through the permitting process in<br/>
El Paso, that was easy.  Not to say there are not other letterboxes - just none<br/>
officially permitted.<br/>
<br/>
So the short answer is yes.  But it takes work.  This has not done away with the<br/>
paperwork.  But at least in El Paso, it is mostly self-policing.  The rangers<br/>
appreciate not needing to do it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening.  I<br/>
have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much time<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I noticed<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I<br/>
discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware<br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own<br/>
as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying<br/>
to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I<br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for<br/>
geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I<br/>
think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.<br/>
We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the<br/>
policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that<br/>
were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr.<br/>
Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in<br/>
spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is<br/>
no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our<br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and<br/>
may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the<br/>
parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't<br/>
set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel<br/>
some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal,<br/>
that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

Let me ask you a question.  What do the rangers do about the boxes that are not permitted?  Do they contact the placer?  Do they confiscate the boxes?  Or, do they even know about them?  I'm just curious, because it would help to know how serious the park rangers take non-permitted boxes.<br/>

&gt; I have an answer.  But it means work.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have been doing this here in El Paso for several years already.  It is called<br/>
&gt; PARK VOLUNTEER.  When they have a Geocache to approve, they call me.  I hike out<br/>
&gt; and check it out.  In the last 7 years, there has only been one geocache<br/>
&gt; disapproved, and one that required special instructions on the clues.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Since I am the only letterboxer who has gone through the permitting process in<br/>
&gt; El Paso, that was easy.  Not to say there are not other letterboxes - just none<br/>
&gt; officially permitted.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So the short answer is yes.  But it takes work.  This has not done away with the<br/>
&gt; paperwork.  But at least in El Paso, it is mostly self-policing.  The rangers<br/>
&gt; appreciate not needing to do it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Subject: [letterboxingtexas] Re: State Parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they already have<br/>
&gt; park maps<br/>
&gt; &gt; showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this purpose.<br/>
&gt; I'm sure I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the time being, if we ask the<br/>
&gt; park manager,<br/>
&gt; &gt; when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that are<br/>
&gt; sensitive or<br/>
&gt; &gt; protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us.  I don't think<br/>
&gt; there is any way<br/>
&gt; &gt; we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely.  I have pointed out<br/>
&gt; to Mr. Owen<br/>
&gt; &gt; that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing any<br/>
&gt; trouble and,<br/>
&gt; &gt; in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That tells me<br/>
&gt; that they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these little points<br/>
&gt; add up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our boxes.<br/>
&gt; They have<br/>
&gt; &gt; stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at least make<br/>
&gt; the point that<br/>
&gt; &gt; we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about how<br/>
&gt; we could do<br/>
&gt; &gt; that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't want<br/>
&gt; to give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on a<br/>
&gt; moments<br/>
&gt; &gt; notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the right<br/>
&gt; to delegate<br/>
&gt; &gt; that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can understand<br/>
&gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would have to<br/>
&gt; leave the box as<br/>
&gt; &gt; you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when they get<br/>
&gt; around to<br/>
&gt; &gt; checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either have to<br/>
&gt; go back and<br/>
&gt; &gt; move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because then<br/>
&gt; they'd have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying to<br/>
&gt; resolve and so far,<br/>
&gt; &gt; we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would satisfy<br/>
&gt; both them<br/>
&gt; &gt; and us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also.  Self<br/>
&gt; regulation on our part<br/>
&gt; &gt; would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then<br/>
&gt; each park would<br/>
&gt; &gt; need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can not<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for<br/>
&gt; geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I<br/>
&gt; think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.<br/>
&gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the<br/>
&gt; policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that<br/>
&gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr.<br/>
&gt; Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in<br/>
&gt; spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is<br/>
&gt; no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and<br/>
&gt; may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the<br/>
&gt; parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't<br/>
&gt; set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal,<br/>
&gt; that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we<br/>
&gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You are right - and I did say it wouldn't be easy.  But it is one suggestion.  I<br/>
do understand your point.<br/>
<br/>
Unpermitted boxes?  That would depend on each park.  As said - if it is<br/>
well-hidden, and nothing brings it to their attention, it might go forever.  If<br/>
it is placed poorly, or a ranger either finds it or sees a finder going to it,<br/>
or a patron complains, it may be gone right away.  <br/>
<br/>
OTOH, I have known of rangers who have actually registered, checked out the park<br/>
on-line, and then contacted placers and had them pick up the offending box.<br/>
<br/>
I know of at least one instance where this has happened to a letterboxer too.<br/>
<br/>
I have three state parks within 50 miles of my home.  I help out in all three,<br/>
although as protected as it is, Hueco Tanks doesn't take a lot of work.  There<br/>
are about 400 letterboxers on this list.  Do you think there are 400 state parks<br/>
in Texas?  Some of the more remote ones might have to do without a volunteer.<br/>
<br/>
One suggestion.  Find a POC for each park, work it out with a ranger in the park<br/>
ahead of time for a few hours of visit with that ranger on the day you intend to<br/>
visit that park.  Perhaps that ranger might even have a known hiding place to<br/>
share with you.  You could fill out most of the application and E-mail it, then<br/>
complete the final bits in person.  I know - still not a perfect plan - but it<br/>
is the best idea I have had yet.<br/>
<br/>
A secret - you are never going to make everyone happy.  No matter what happens,<br/>
someone will not like it.  You can blame the permitting on geocaching - it was<br/>
their exploding growth that caused this.  But eventually it would have happened<br/>
with letterboxing too.  It may still have been in the future.... or maybe not.<br/>
Truly - it doesn't matter now.  It is what it is and it is something to be dealt<br/>
with.<br/>

&gt; That might work for you and maybe for someone who lived close to a park, but<br/>
there are<br/>
&gt; too many state parks and too few letterboxers that live near a park for this<br/>
to be practical.<br/>
&gt; Let me ask you a question.  What do the rangers do about the boxes that are<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; permitted?  Do they contact the placer?  Do they confiscate the boxes?  Or, do<br/>
they even<br/>
&gt; know about them?  I'm just curious, because it would help to know how serious<br/>
the park<br/>
&gt; rangers take non-permitted boxes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I have an answer.  But it means work.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have been doing this here in El Paso for several years already.  It is<br/>
called<br/>
&gt; &gt; PARK VOLUNTEER.  When they have a Geocache to approve, they call me.  I hike<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt; and check it out.  In the last 7 years, there has only been one geocache<br/>
&gt; &gt; disapproved, and one that required special instructions on the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Since I am the only letterboxer who has gone through the permitting process<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; El Paso, that was easy.  Not to say there are not other letterboxes - just<br/>
none<br/>
&gt; &gt; officially permitted.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; So the short answer is yes.  But it takes work.  This has not done away with<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; paperwork.  But at least in El Paso, it is mostly self-policing.  The<br/>
rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; appreciate not needing to do it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they already<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; park maps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm sure I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the time being, if we ask<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; park manager,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that are<br/>
&gt; &gt; sensitive or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us.  I don't<br/>
think<br/>
&gt; &gt; there is any way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely.  I have pointed<br/>
out<br/>
&gt; &gt; to Mr. Owen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing<br/>
any<br/>
&gt; &gt; trouble and,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That tells me<br/>
&gt; &gt; that they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these little<br/>
points<br/>
&gt; &gt; add up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our<br/>
boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; They have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at least<br/>
make<br/>
&gt; &gt; the point that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about<br/>
how<br/>
&gt; &gt; we could do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't<br/>
want<br/>
&gt; &gt; to give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on<br/>
a<br/>
&gt; &gt; moments<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the<br/>
right<br/>
&gt; &gt; to delegate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can<br/>
understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would have<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; leave the box as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when they<br/>
get<br/>
&gt; &gt; around to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either<br/>
have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; go back and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; they'd have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; resolve and so far,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would<br/>
satisfy<br/>
&gt; &gt; both them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is what I was saying.  We develope the database and store it on<br/>
this<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also.  Self<br/>
&gt; &gt; regulation on our part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then<br/>
&gt; &gt; each park would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can<br/>
not<br/>
&gt; &gt; be used for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; instructions and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make<br/>
sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; they are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be aware<br/>
of,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; can make them aware of it).    Boots - do you think this would be<br/>
something<br/>
&gt; &gt; worth<br/>

parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing what "areas"<br/>

if<br/>
&gt; &gt; we know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want boxes placed we can avoid and monitor this ourselves,<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end I have no problem with rules, just would like to work<br/>
towards a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than permits.   We clearly state in the clues where the box is, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; permit<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his<br/>
own<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching<br/>
policy<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're<br/>
trying<br/>

&gt; &gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for<br/>
&gt; &gt; geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two<br/>
activities.<br/>
&gt; &gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that<br/>
&gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but<br/>
Mr.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There<br/>
is<br/>
&gt; &gt; no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I<br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place<br/>
our<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they<br/>
didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my<br/>
appeal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.<br/>
Until we<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing<br/>
boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this<br/>
way, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

&gt; You are right - and I did say it wouldn't be easy.  But it is one suggestion.  I<br/>
&gt; do understand your point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unpermitted boxes?  That would depend on each park.  As said - if it is<br/>
&gt; well-hidden, and nothing brings it to their attention, it might go forever.  If<br/>
&gt; it is placed poorly, or a ranger either finds it or sees a finder going to it,<br/>
&gt; or a patron complains, it may be gone right away.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; OTOH, I have known of rangers who have actually registered, checked out the park<br/>
&gt; on-line, and then contacted placers and had them pick up the offending box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I know of at least one instance where this has happened to a letterboxer too.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I have three state parks within 50 miles of my home.  I help out in all three,<br/>
&gt; although as protected as it is, Hueco Tanks doesn't take a lot of work.  There<br/>
&gt; are about 400 letterboxers on this list.  Do you think there are 400 state parks<br/>
&gt; in Texas?  Some of the more remote ones might have to do without a volunteer.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One suggestion.  Find a POC for each park, work it out with a ranger in the park<br/>
&gt; ahead of time for a few hours of visit with that ranger on the day you intend to<br/>
&gt; visit that park.  Perhaps that ranger might even have a known hiding place to<br/>
&gt; share with you.  You could fill out most of the application and E-mail it, then<br/>
&gt; complete the final bits in person.  I know - still not a perfect plan - but it<br/>
&gt; is the best idea I have had yet.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A secret - you are never going to make everyone happy.  No matter what happens,<br/>
&gt; someone will not like it.  You can blame the permitting on geocaching - it was<br/>
&gt; their exploding growth that caused this.  But eventually it would have happened<br/>
&gt; with letterboxing too.  It may still have been in the future.... or maybe not.<br/>
&gt; Truly - it doesn't matter now.  It is what it is and it is something to be dealt<br/>
&gt; with.<br/>

&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; That might work for you and maybe for someone who lived close to a park, but<br/>
&gt; there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; too many state parks and too few letterboxers that live near a park for this<br/>
&gt; to be practical.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Let me ask you a question.  What do the rangers do about the boxes that are<br/>
&gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; permitted?  Do they contact the placer?  Do they confiscate the boxes?  Or, do<br/>
&gt; they even<br/>
&gt; &gt; know about them?  I'm just curious, because it would help to know how serious<br/>
&gt; the park<br/>
&gt; &gt; rangers take non-permitted boxes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I have an answer.  But it means work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I have been doing this here in El Paso for several years already.  It is<br/>
&gt; called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; PARK VOLUNTEER.  When they have a Geocache to approve, they call me.  I hike<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and check it out.  In the last 7 years, there has only been one geocache<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; disapproved, and one that required special instructions on the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Since I am the only letterboxer who has gone through the permitting process<br/>
&gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; El Paso, that was easy.  Not to say there are not other letterboxes - just<br/>
&gt; none<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; officially permitted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So the short answer is yes.  But it takes work.  This has not done away with<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork.  But at least in El Paso, it is mostly self-policing.  The<br/>
&gt; rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate not needing to do it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they already<br/>
&gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park maps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the time being, if we ask<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park manager,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us.  I don't<br/>
&gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; there is any way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely.  I have pointed<br/>
&gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to Mr. Owen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing<br/>
&gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; trouble and,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That tells me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these little<br/>
&gt; points<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; add up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our<br/>
&gt; boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; They have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at least<br/>
&gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the point that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about<br/>
&gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; we could do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't<br/>
&gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; moments<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the<br/>
&gt; right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to delegate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can<br/>
&gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would have<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; leave the box as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when they<br/>
&gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; around to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either<br/>
&gt; have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; go back and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because<br/>
&gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; they'd have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying<br/>
&gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; resolve and so far,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would<br/>
&gt; satisfy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; both them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; regulation on our part<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; worth<br/>

&gt; helping<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park staff.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end I have no problem with rules, just would like to work<br/>
&gt; towards a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than permits.   We clearly state in the clues where the box is, so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; permit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork for all to waste time on.   I would encourage (and would<br/>
&gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; willing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to go with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to any meetings) trying to partner with the park system to self<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; police<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if a problem occurs they contact one of us to resolve it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much<br/>
&gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I<br/>
&gt; noticed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with<br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be<br/>
&gt; aware<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his<br/>
&gt; own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching<br/>
&gt; policy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're<br/>
&gt; trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.<br/>
&gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two<br/>
&gt; activities.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in<br/>
&gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but<br/>
&gt; Mr.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There<br/>
&gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking<br/>
&gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I<br/>
&gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place<br/>
&gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run<br/>
&gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they<br/>
&gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my<br/>
&gt; appeal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.<br/>
&gt; Until we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing<br/>
&gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this<br/>
&gt; way, we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; You are right - and I did say it wouldn't be easy.  But it is one<br/>
suggestion.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; do understand your point.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Unpermitted boxes?  That would depend on each park.  As said - if it is<br/>
&gt; &gt; well-hidden, and nothing brings it to their attention, it might go forever.<br/>
If<br/>
&gt; &gt; it is placed poorly, or a ranger either finds it or sees a finder going to<br/>
it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; or a patron complains, it may be gone right away.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; OTOH, I have known of rangers who have actually registered, checked out the<br/>
park<br/>
&gt; &gt; on-line, and then contacted placers and had them pick up the offending box.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I know of at least one instance where this has happened to a letterboxer<br/>
too.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I have three state parks within 50 miles of my home.  I help out in all<br/>
three,<br/>
&gt; &gt; although as protected as it is, Hueco Tanks doesn't take a lot of work.<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; &gt; are about 400 letterboxers on this list.  Do you think there are 400 state<br/>
parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; in Texas?  Some of the more remote ones might have to do without a<br/>
volunteer.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; One suggestion.  Find a POC for each park, work it out with a ranger in the<br/>
park<br/>
&gt; &gt; ahead of time for a few hours of visit with that ranger on the day you<br/>
intend to<br/>
&gt; &gt; visit that park.  Perhaps that ranger might even have a known hiding place<br/>
to<br/>
&gt; &gt; share with you.  You could fill out most of the application and E-mail it,<br/>
then<br/>
&gt; &gt; complete the final bits in person.  I know - still not a perfect plan - but<br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; is the best idea I have had yet.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; A secret - you are never going to make everyone happy.  No matter what<br/>
happens,<br/>
&gt; &gt; someone will not like it.  You can blame the permitting on geocaching - it<br/>
was<br/>
&gt; &gt; their exploding growth that caused this.  But eventually it would have<br/>
happened<br/>
&gt; &gt; with letterboxing too.  It may still have been in the future.... or maybe<br/>
not.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Truly - it doesn't matter now.  It is what it is and it is something to be<br/>
dealt<br/>
&gt; &gt; with.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; That might work for you and maybe for someone who lived close to a park,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; there are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; too many state parks and too few letterboxers that live near a park for<br/>
this<br/>
&gt; &gt; to be practical.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me ask you a question.  What do the rangers do about the boxes that<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; permitted?  Do they contact the placer?  Do they confiscate the boxes?<br/>
Or, do<br/>
&gt; &gt; they even<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; know about them?  I'm just curious, because it would help to know how<br/>
serious<br/>
&gt; &gt; the park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; rangers take non-permitted boxes.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have an answer.  But it means work.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have been doing this here in El Paso for several years already.  It is<br/>
&gt; &gt; called<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PARK VOLUNTEER.  When they have a Geocache to approve, they call me.  I<br/>
hike<br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and check it out.  In the last 7 years, there has only been one geocache<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disapproved, and one that required special instructions on the clues.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since I am the only letterboxer who has gone through the permitting<br/>
process<br/>
&gt; &gt; in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; El Paso, that was easy.  Not to say there are not other letterboxes -<br/>
just<br/>
&gt; &gt; none<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; officially permitted.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So the short answer is yes.  But it takes work.  This has not done away<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork.  But at least in El Paso, it is mostly self-policing.  The<br/>
&gt; &gt; rangers<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; appreciate not needing to do it too.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they<br/>
already<br/>
&gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park maps<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this<br/>
purpose.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I'm sure I could<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the time being, if we<br/>
ask<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park manager,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that<br/>
are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sensitive or<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us.  I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is any way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely.  I have<br/>
pointed<br/>
&gt; &gt; out<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Mr. Owen<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without<br/>
causing<br/>
&gt; &gt; any<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trouble and,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That<br/>
tells me<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that they have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these little<br/>
&gt; &gt; points<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; add up and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at<br/>
least<br/>
&gt; &gt; make<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the point that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think<br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt; how<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we could do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they<br/>
don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to give up<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your<br/>
box on<br/>
&gt; &gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moments<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the<br/>
&gt; &gt; right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to delegate<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can<br/>
&gt; &gt; understand<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would<br/>
have<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leave the box as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when<br/>
they<br/>
&gt; &gt; get<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; around to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either<br/>
&gt; &gt; have to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go back and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want,<br/>
because<br/>
&gt; &gt; then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they'd have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're<br/>
trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; resolve and so far,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would<br/>
&gt; &gt; satisfy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both them<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and us?<br/>

Self<br/>

then<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each park would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that<br/>
can<br/>
&gt; &gt; not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be used for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list<br/>
along<br/>
&gt; &gt; with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instructions and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make<br/>
&gt; &gt; sure<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they are not<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be<br/>
aware<br/>
&gt; &gt; of,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but then we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can make them aware of it).    Boots - do you think this would be<br/>
&gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worth<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presenting to your new contact, vs the permit system which is a pain<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any way we could get, then build a data file for all<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing what "areas"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are off limits in each park.  This seems to be the major issue,<br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; if<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want boxes placed we can avoid and monitor this ourselves,<br/>
&gt; &gt; helping<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park staff.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end I have no problem with rules, just would like to work<br/>
&gt; &gt; towards a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than permits.   We clearly state in the clues where the box is,<br/>
so<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork for all to waste time on.   I would encourage (and<br/>
would<br/>
&gt; &gt; be<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; willing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to go with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to any meetings) trying to partner with the park system to<br/>
self<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; police<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if a problem occurs they contact one of us to resolve it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this<br/>
evening.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had<br/>
much<br/>
&gt; &gt; time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up<br/>
with<br/>
&gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be<br/>
&gt; &gt; aware<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on<br/>
his<br/>
&gt; &gt; own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching<br/>
&gt; &gt; policy<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're<br/>
&gt; &gt; trying<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application<br/>
form.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place<br/>
for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over<br/>
time, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two<br/>
&gt; &gt; activities.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes<br/>
in<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made,<br/>
but<br/>
&gt; &gt; Mr.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my<br/>
endeavor, in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.<br/>
There<br/>
&gt; &gt; is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that<br/>
asking<br/>
&gt; &gt; for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe<br/>
that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However,<br/>
I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to<br/>
place<br/>
&gt; &gt; our<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long<br/>
run<br/>
&gt; &gt; and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to<br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do<br/>
feel<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my<br/>
&gt; &gt; appeal,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Until we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by<br/>
placing<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My suggestion is the same.  Ranger contacts us (you, me, Lucy, SE, etc) via email to let us know of problem and we contact placer to move box or we put out the word for closest person to area to remove it.  Personally, if permitting is the only way to go, then I will not participate with State Parks and either remove my existing boxes if that is a problem or let them fade away.  I know Permitting is what they do, but continuing down a bad path is not a good answer.   We need change.   Also, if we are able to go with what I laid out (self regulation with park input on where can't hide) I am willing to work with the parks on promotion of letterboxing (brochure design, etc).  Just can not get excited about doing this with having to fill out a permit every year for all the boxes I have in the parks (probably about 75).   Seems like more work for them with all these permits each year, and having to go check on the box, and filing and reminders that permit is expiring (because I will never remember to send in new one each year to each park).   Also, if go with my system we can clean up and boxes that are in locations they do not want, thus no need to determine grandfathering.  I am all for not allowing boxes in places they should not be, and feel it is up to us to make sure this does not happen and clean up any that already are in places they should not be.  I understand this may be a radical change for the parks to consider, but we will be doing most of the work, and will be promoting visitation.  <br/>
<br/>
I guess the key question is, How many of you will actually go through the permit system, or will you just avoid hiding in parks if that is the only system.  And if say you will NOT hide in parks if that is the only system, would you hide in state parks if the system was as I outlined in earlier post (and below).  I guess if no one responds to this (not counting Mike and Boots) then we are all problably waisting our time.<br/>

&gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they already have park maps showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this purpose.  I'm sure I could get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the time being, if we ask the park manager, when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that are sensitive or protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us.  I don't think there is any way we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely.  I have pointed out to Mr. Owen that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing any trouble and, in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That tells me that they have been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these little points add up and maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our boxes.  They have stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at least make the point that we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about how we could do that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't want to give up the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on a moments notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the right to delegate that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can understand their position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would have to leave the box as you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when they get around to checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either have to go back and move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because then they'd have to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying to resolve and so far, we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would satisfy both them and us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; That is what I was saying.  We develope the database and store it on this talk list.   I am willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also.  Self regulation on our part would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then each park would need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can not be used for letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along with instructions and rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make sure they are not in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be aware of, but then we can make them aware of it).    Boots - do you think this would be something worth presenting to your new contact, vs the permit system which is a pain for everyone involved.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't want to pee on the campfire - but developing a database like that sounds<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a full-time job.  I can assure you that TPWD isn't hiring right now.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; fact, some rangers are worried about keeping their jobs.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Remember - TPWD is out to do what is most economical, easiest and best for TPWD.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Less work, less cost, less people.  Unless a volunteer steps forward with a way<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to make that work without any input from TPWD, I don't see it happening.  I am<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not saying it isn't a good idea....  I just don't see TPWD doing it with the<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any way we could get, then build a data file for all the parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; showing what "areas"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are off limits in each park.  This seems to be the major issue, and if we know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; where they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want boxes placed we can avoid and monitor this ourselves, helping the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park staff.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end I have no problem with rules, just would like to work towards a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than permits.   We clearly state in the clues where the box is, so permit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork for all to waste time on.   I would encourage (and would be willing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; to go with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to any meetings) trying to partner with the park system to self police<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if a problem occurs they contact one of us to resolve it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening.  I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I noticed that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr. Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I noticed that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr. Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in spite of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

 think that the permit application needs to reflect that either it's a geocache or a letterbox and require hobby-appropriate information.<br/><br/>I would prefer that we could police ourselves after being told where not to place boxes, but honestly, I'm not really clear on how we would ensure that TX boxers not on this list were aware of that stuff.  Although that's certainly the preferred option, unless every park has a volunteer who is as dedicated as Mike that can go check on boxes, I don't see how we'll convince the parks department that it would work at every park.  Maybe parks near long-time, upstanding boxers that are well known would do this, but I don't think we can expect a sweeping approval of such a policy across the state.<br/><br/>Do the permits cost anything other than excessive amounts of time?  I'm not real clear on that, and honestly, if I'd be expected to shell out a chunk of change for every permit on an annual basis, I
 don't think I'd bother with any of it.  (Just saying, 'cause it's not like I've been active in planting lately anyway.)<br/><br/>Rogue Artist<br/><div><br/></div><div><br/><div><hr size="1"/><b><span>From:</span></b> Boots Tex &lt;redbarn@eastex.net&gt;<br/><b><span>To:</span></b> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/><b><span>Sent:</span></b> Fri, December 10, 2010 1:09:03 PM<br/><b><span>Subject:</span></b> [letterboxingtexas] Re: State Parks<br/><br/>

&gt; My suggestion is the same.  Ranger contacts us (you, me, Lucy, SE, etc) via email to let us know of problem and we contact placer to move box or we put out the word for closest person to area to remove it.  Personally, if permitting is the only way to go, then I will not participate with State Parks and either remove my existing boxes if that is a problem or let them fade away.  I know Permitting is what they do, but continuing down a bad path is not a good answer.   We need change.   Also, if we are able to go with what I laid out (self regulation with park input on where can't hide) I am willing to work with the parks on promotion of letterboxing (brochure design, etc).  Just can not get excited about doing this with having to fill out a permit every year for all the boxes I have in the parks (probably about 75).   Seems like more work for them with all these permits each year, and having to go check on the box, and filing and reminders that
 permit is expiring (because I will never remember to send in new one each year to each park).   Also, if go with my system we can clean up and boxes that are in locations they do not want, thus no need to determine grandfathering.  I am all for not allowing boxes in places they should not be, and feel it is up to us to make sure this does not happen and clean up any that already are in places they should not be.  I understand this may be a radical change for the parks to consider, but we will be doing most of the work, and will be promoting visitation.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I guess the key question is, How many of you will actually go through the permit system, or will you just avoid hiding in parks if that is the only system.  And if say you will NOT hide in parks if that is the only system, would you hide in state parks if the system was as I outlined in earlier post (and below).  I guess if no one responds to this (not counting Mike and Boots) then we are all problably waisting our time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they already have park maps showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this purpose.  I'm sure I could get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the time being, if we ask the park manager, when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that are sensitive or protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us.  I don't think there is any way we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely.  I have pointed out to Mr. Owen that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing any trouble and, in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That tells me that they have been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these little points add up and maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our boxes.  They have stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I
 will at least make the point that we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about how we could do that in a way that they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't want to give up the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on a moments notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the right to delegate that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can understand their position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You would have to leave the box as you place it and leave the application for their approval.  If, when they get around to checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either have to go back and move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because then they'd have to pick it up and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying to resolve and so far, we haven't negotiated a solution. 
 Does anyone have a plan that would satisfy both them and us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; That is what I was saying.  We develope the database and store it on this talk list.   I am willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also.  Self regulation on our part would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then each park would need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can not be used for letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along with instructions and rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make sure they are not in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be aware of, but then we can make them aware of it).    Boots - do you think this would be something worth presenting to your new contact, vs the permit system which is a pain for everyone involved.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is there any way we could get, then build a data file for all the parks<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing what "areas"<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are off limits in each park.  This seems to be the major issue, and if we know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want boxes placed we can avoid and monitor this ourselves, helping the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park staff.  In<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end I have no problem with rules, just would like to work towards a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than permits.   We clearly state in the clues where the box is, so permit<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be extra<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork for all to waste time on.   I would encourage (and would be willing<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to go with<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to any meetings) trying to partner with the park system to self police<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if a problem occurs they contact one of us to resolve it.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS - Thank you for all your efforts in this matter!!!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening.  I have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I noticed that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr. Owen is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request.  I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in spite of<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I have quite a few thoughts on this issue, but at the moment I am drawn away by a personal matter that is distracting me away. I apologize for not speaking up sooner. I'm going to answer the question first, and then throw out some random disconnected thoughts. Each of you is free to agree or disagree with me, as sometimes I disagree with myself!<br/>
<br/>Let me just say - I am willing to go through the permit process, and have done so at Tyler State Park. I completely understand where the parks are coming from - they want to know what goes on in THEIR park so they can monitor activities and understand why things happen.<br/>
<br/>I am also willing to be a park liaison - a single point of contact a park can use to contact to facilitate for further communications and actions with letterboxers. <br/><br/>Now, random comments:<br/><br/>I don't think this IS the first TPWD has heard about letterboxing. They've known about us for quite some time - take Fairfield SP, Huntsville SP (in the past - not currently), and it seems like another park or two - have apparently pulled boxes as they have found them without the benefit of notification. We have found out when someone has gone to look for boxes in a particular park and all of them were gone. Some parks, like Mission Tejas, have known about us and have turned a blind eye to our activity. This inconsistency of policy application is what alarms me the most - Mission Tejas may like us today, but give 'em a new head ranger and they may go militant on getting rid of unpermitted boxes. <br/>
<br/>I believe that while Boots is working from a statewide level, each of us who wants to box in a SP needs to be ambassadors to our area parks - volunteer a little perhaps (as Mike has promoted strongly), be good stewards when we are there, and let them know who we are, even if to say "Hey, I'm a letterboxer and I would really like to place a box here because I enjoy this park so much, but it's just too darned complicated to place one". This is a big enough issue that we can NOT rely on a single method of attach to get the problem resolved to our satisfaction.<br/>
<br/>On a similar note, whether YOU intend to place a box in a state park or not, it IS a matter of concern for YOU - you being the global letterboxer. When YOU go to visit a state park to letterbox, YOU are on deck to be the latest contact the park has with letterboxing. Rehide well, rehide well, rehide well. Watch not to contribute to social trails, don't leave trash (in fact, pick up trash). Be especially conscientious about NOT outing boxes that are there while we are transitioning into the age of permitting. <br/>
<br/>IN ANY SITUATION, Don't ask for help from rangers or strangers. If you can't find it on your own, don't ask for help from non-letterboxers. This is about one of the stupidest things letterboxers do and regardless of the permitting situation, it's a good way to get a box to go missing.<br/>
<br/>Having permitted and unpermitted boxes in a single state park worries me too. I don't want to permit my box and draw attention to letterboxing, knowing full well that Silver Eagle or Baby Bear has a box there. Although I disagree with them on the permitting issue, I consider them to be conscientious objectors of sorts and respect them for their position. I don't have an answer for it, I just wanted to say it concerns me.<br/>
<br/>As long as we have the mentality of "More Is Better", I don't believe we have the ability to police ourselves. Even if we get them to give us a map of off-limits areas, stacking boxes in on top of each isn't good even in hardy areas.<br/>
<br/>Mike mentioned the idea of legacy boxes. That came from me. I happen to believe that not every box should stay in place forever. There are some, a few, boxes that should be cared for as long as possible, but I believe a responsible placer will consider whether a box should not be retired and removed to allow other boxers to place boxes and share with us of their creativity without creating a situation where there are too many boxes in too small a space. <br/>
<br/>And a personal note to Baby Bear and Silver Eagle, I realize some of this discussion touches a raw nerve for y'all and I hate that. Many, many of us - and not just on this list - consider you to be personally responsible for our getting a start in letterboxing and then sticking with it. I will do anything I can to protect your boxes because of the impact they - and each of y'all - has had on my family's enjoyment of the hobby. <br/>
<br/>I'm sure I have other thoughts, but I'll move on for the moment.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

<div>Random ramblings...</div>
<div>I would be a willing to help the rangers here in Austin and near by... I'm not sure I can handle much more volunteer work, I already put in over 80+ hours a month with Girl Scouts, and working full time and part time (50 hour weeks) and being a single mom with 2 girls. Everyone has a life, some busyier than others but I'm still willing to help so we can keep this wonderful hobby in State Parks. I just bought myself a State Park pass for my Birthday because I'm hitting up so many SP with boxes lately. Its cheaper for me to get the pass for $60 for the year and get in free to the parks than it is for me to pay anywhere from $3-$10 to get into a SP each time. I would hate for my new pass to be for nothing if every box were pulled from SP because the rangers didn't want letterboxing there anylonger because we can't follow a few rules. Change has to start with each and every one of us. If we can each take care of the State Parks near our houses that
 is worth it in the long run. Each may not have a letterboxer living near by but I'm sure we can cover a multitude of the SP. There are about 75 State Parks and how many of us in Texas? We can pull together and make a diffrence in the way Rangers see us. </div>

I, too, would like to hear what others think about this issue. There are 401 members on this board and I think we've heard from 4, including me, Mike, Baby Bear and Silver Eagle. I would hope that we could get some input from some of the other 397 people out there. Just tell us what you think. I will not comment or question your opinion and hope that no one else will, either. We just want to know your thoughts.<br/><br/>Boots Tex<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "babybearlb2002" &lt;babybearlb2002@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; My suggestion is the same. Ranger contacts us (you, me, Lucy, SE, etc) via email to let us know of problem and we contact placer to move box or we put out the word for closest person to area to remove it. Personally, if permitting is the only way to go, then I will not participate with State Parks and either remove my existing boxes if that is a problem or let them fade away. I know Permitting is what they do, but continuing down a bad path is not a good answer. We need change. Also, if we are able to go with what I laid out (self regulation with park input on where can't hide) I am willing to work with the parks on promotion of letterboxing (brochure design, etc). Just can not get excited about doing this with having to fill out a permit every year for all the boxes I have in the parks (probably about 75). Seems like more work for them with all these permits each year, and having to go check on the box, and filing and reminders that permit is expiring (because I will never remember to send in new one each year to each park). Also, if go with my system we can clean up and boxes that are in locations they do not want, thus no need to determine grandfathering. I am all for not allowing boxes in places they should not be, and feel it is up to us to make sure this does not happen and clean up any that already are in places they should not be. I understand this may be a radical change for the parks to consider, but we will be doing most of the work, and will be promoting visitation. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I guess the key question is, How many of you will actually go through the permit system, or will you just avoid hiding in parks if that is the only system. And if say you will NOT hide in parks if that is the only system, would you hide in state parks if the system was as I outlined in earlier post (and below). I guess if no one responds to this (not counting Mike and Boots) then we are all problably waisting our time.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Boots Tex" &lt;redbarn@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion. Maybe I'll ask if they already have park maps showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this purpose. I'm sure I could get copies of those if they exist. I think, for the time being, if we ask the park manager, when we pick up the permit application form, if there are areas that are sensitive or protected that we should stay away from, they would tell us. I don't think there is any way we'll be able to avoid the permitting process completely. I have pointed out to Mr. Owen that some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing any trouble and, in fact, without any park official even knowing about them. That tells me that they have been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me. All these little points add up and maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more control of our boxes. They have stressed that they don't want to add more paperwork, so I will at least make the point that we would be willing to handle the paperwork ourselves. Let's think about how we could do that in a way that they would consider. Understand, now, that they don't want to give up the right of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on a moments notice when you drop it off at headquarters. They want to reserve the right to delegate that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis. I can understand their position. But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging. You would have to leave the box as you place it and leave the application for their approval. If, when they get around to checking it out, it doesn't meet with their approval, you would either have to go back and move it or abandon it to their descretion (which they don't want, because then they'd have to pick it up and dispose of it). This is the dilemma that we're trying to resolve and so far, we haven't negotiated a solution. Does anyone have a plan that would satisfy both them and us?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "babybearlb2002" &lt;babybearlb2002@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; That is what I was saying. We develope the database and store it on this talk list. I am willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be also. Self regulation on our part would only require the park system to meet with us and agree to this, then each park would need to spend 15 minutes with their park map and hilite all areas that can not be used for letterboxing, then we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along with instructions and rules). I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make sure they are not in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be aware of, but then we can make them aware of it). Boots - do you think this would be something worth presenting to your new contact, vs the permit system which is a pain for everyone involved.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Mike Olbrisch" &lt;mike-2007@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I don't want to pee on the campfire - but developing a database like that sounds<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like a full-time job.

This seems to be the major issue, and if we know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want boxes placed we can avoid and monitor this ourselves, helping the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park staff. In<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the end I have no problem with rules, just would like to work towards a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than permits. We clearly state in the clues where the box is, so permit<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems to be extra<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paperwork for all to waste time on. I would encourage (and would be willing<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to go with<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you to any meetings) trying to partner with the park system to self police<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if a problem occurs they contact one of us to resolve it.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS - Thank you for all your efforts in this matter!!!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Boots Tex" &lt;redbarn@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We've been gone for a week and just got back home this evening. I have been<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much time to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD. I noticed that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration. I discussed the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures. At this time, most park managers should at least be aware of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own as to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process. We are having to use the geocaching policy and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well. We're trying to do<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that. We should be at least getting our own application form. I don't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for geocaching,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I think the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two activities. We<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the policy.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that were<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place. No promises have been made, but Mr. Owen is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; considering the request. I would like to say that I appreciate the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; encouragement that I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have received from Barefoot Lucy and Silver Eagle in my endeavor, in spite of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Silver<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes. There is no one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's. I even agree with him that asking for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission. I, too, believe that<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so. However, I don't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our boxes<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and may,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the parks. I<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't set the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes. Okay, maybe I do feel some<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good. I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, that we<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks. Until we have<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing boxes in<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager. I think, in this way, we can<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yahoo!

                    <html><body><p>Dawns Glory,<br/><br/>You speak well - I agree with everything you said so nicely. <br/><br/>I don't know if Girl Scouts has the same running joke as Boy Scouts, but in Boy Scouts we leaders laugh about "it only takes one hour a week." - a phrase I'm sure BSA has come to regret putting into one of it's early trainings. I did my one hour about 40 times a week every week last month. Thankfully it is not always like that, but it IS the sort of thing that is always in the back of your mind once it becomes an integral part of your life! Anyway, I'm sure scouting has taught you the same thing it has taught me - the results are well worth the investment. Can we say the same thing about letterboxing? Well...<br/>
<br/>Sometimes it is easy to say letterboxing is only a hobby - it's not like it's life or death. And that is true - it's not. And as I alluded to in my post, I've had to move letterboxing down my priority list recently because of things that are more life or death in my family (not trying to be overly dramatic, just trying to continue the metaphor). However, letterboxing has greatly enriched my family's and my life. It got me through a deep grief over my father's death when I first started letterboxing. We were just beginning Cub Scouts back then and it was an activity that blended well with scout activities. It helped us expand ourselves into the world around us. I've made friends I've come to care a lot about. If I were to ask myself "Would it be worth it to me to invest some of my volunteer hours on something that benefits letterboxing?" I would have to say yes. The benefits I have gotten from boxing have been worth the investment so far and I would hope it will be worth any investment I make now for the future.<br/>
<br/>I hope any letterboxer reading this will stop and ask themselves what they've gotten out of letterboxing, and decide if it wouldn't be worth it to put a little back in.<br/><br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"Not about footwear, it's about philosophy!"<br/>

<p>I have had a SP pass for several years. I would still visit them even if there weren't any boxes available. That is icing on the cake for me. We like to camp, ride our bikes and take photographs , so for us this is a great inexpensive destination. . I do not want to permit my boxes. I would make a decision if I was contacted, which probably would be to pull the boxes. So far, it seems like it is a long process to get the permits.</p>
<p>I work full time and volunteer on a weekly basis, but not in a SP. The nearest park for me is about 35 miles away. We do visit the park and I do maintain my boxes, and I always check the other boxes while I am there. </p>
<p>I have had people send me updates on boxes saying they asked the Rangers for help. This not only puts my box, but other boxes in the park in jeopardy. If I can't find a box, I mark it off my list and move on.</p>
<p>In over five years of boxing, I very rarely have ever seen a social trail leading to a box. I know it depends on how often a box is found, and how people treat the area leading to the box, but this has been my experience.</p>
<p>I agree with Baby Bear's idea of mapping out off limits areas. I would be willing to help out with Martin Creek SP if needed. Boots has worked diligently trying to find a solution to this dilemma. </p>
<p>As for leaving boxes in places miles away from where I live, I always update my clues to reflect what is going on with the box when it needs maintenance. So far, this has worked for me, and I am always willing to help out when needed in my area. I am so glad for those who have visited here, and  left boxes behind for us to stamp in. I now have to drive at least an hour or so (for the most part) to even look for a box, which limits my boxing adventures. </p>
<p>I love to find a box that has been in the wild a long time. For me, it shows longevity and the box was well placed. I love the fact that I can go to Memorial Park and spend a couple of days there, and still walk away saying I haven't found all the boxes. It is a large park and a great place to spend a day boxing.r</p>
<p>I am aware of the fact that the people at the State Parks have the responsibility of maintaining their parks and keeping them from being destroyed by careless people.</p>
<p>I am afraid there isn't an easy solution to this problem, but to those of you who are able to work on it, I say thank-you. Hopefully, your efforts will pay off.</p>

                    <html><body><p>Silver Eagle, and I'm sure others, have issues besides the complicated permitting process with getting permits. However, it seems like the biggest hindrance for most of us has been the time involvement in getting permitted. Many times, we go to a destination and want to be able to leave a box behind, not come back again (and hopefully ONLY once more). <br/>
<br/>When I permitted three boxes at Tyler State Park about a year ago, they were well aware of geocaching, vaguely aware of letterboxing, and haphazard about it all. I was permitting two boxes that were already in place and wanted to place a third. They emailed me the permitting form, let me mark through it to make it more box-friendly (i.e. gave them the link to the clues rather than coords), and let me scan it in and email it back to them once I had checked on the two boxes and placed the third. I asked them if there was anywhere off-limits, they told me not to place the boxes anywhere dangerous (well heck - WHY NOT???). Clearly, they didn't consider themselves to be eco-sensitive or historically important, so pretty much anywhere was okay as long as someone wasn't going to get hurt. I emailed the permits back and never heard from them, so I got in touch with them to get a copy sent back to me and they were a little surprised I was concerned about whether they were approved - more like they just wanted the paperwork completed.<br/>
<br/>In retrospect, I think that one question was pretty telling - "Is there anywhere off-limits?" If they pull out the map and start pointing out areas that wouldn't be box-friendly, it's probably going to be more difficult to get permitted than in a park that is pretty hardy. <br/>
<br/>Can we see if we all have the same idea of a park liaison? This is what I would think would be "ideal" - but because of the time and distance factors it would probably be something less than this - so lets just say that if we could have everything we wanted in a park liaison, this is what it would be, in my mind: <br/>
<br/>The liaison would make an appointment to go out with the permit contact at the park and take a view of the park. Get a good view of where would be off-limits, where would be acceptable. Get an idea if they would like to see quantity limits placed. Find out if the park has other expectations from boxers. Give them an example of a box (perhaps this could be a courtesy box - a box placed at the counter at the park office that would be there for the asking?) This gives the permit contact an opportunity to get familiar with the liaison and to get some assurance that the liaison (can I call this the PL? I keep getting the "i"s out of order) Placers could call on the PL for help in placing a box, not necessarily in person, but in general to make sure the placer is going to propose a successful permit. The PL sort of walks the placer through the process. Later, if the park runs into a problem with a box (i.e. someone finds it and brings it into the office), they can contact the PL instead of going on to the website to track the box down and figure out which one it is, if it isn't obvious from the box itself for whatever reason. The PL can get in touch with the placer and let them know they've been contacted and coordinate a fix. Maybe the PL could even place a series in coordination with the park like Boots mentioned that they might be interested in having a letterbox challenge in some parks. And maybe even the PL could do an occasional letterboxing program for park visitors (we would secretly call this a gathering, but they could call it a program because they like to say they have programs for guests). If someone places a box without permitting (i.e. someone who isn't on this list and doesn't know about permitting), the PL could contact them and offer to help them get "legal" with their box. <br/>
<br/>This would truly be a volunteer position, and it COULD be rather time consuming, although I think once the PL was in place and there was a meeting of the minds with the park, it wouldn't be too bad. It has features of self-policing that could really be workable and would probably be welcomed by parks to take the burden off them for the whole permitting process. I think the biggest reason the permitting process is so cumbersome is that the central office folks wrote the policy and the park staff has to enforce it and they don't really understand it, so they make it more difficult than it has to be and they are hesitant to quickly approve and instead shuffle it to the bottom of the stack to handle when they get inspired to do it. If they had a trusted volunteer to help them through it, they would be more willing to hustle through the paperwork. This would be especially workable if they would be willing to handle things via email as Tyler was.<br/>
<br/>Anyway - just trying to brainstorm to help us get through this mess. Anyone who wants to run with this idea or change it or propose something different is welcome to do just that.<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">

<p>As for leaving boxes in places miles away from where I live, I always update my clues to reflect what is going on with the box when it needs maintenance. So far, this has worked for me, and I am always willing to help out when needed in my area. I am so gladfor those who have visited here, and left boxes behind for us to stamp in.

<p>I love to find a box that has been in the wild a long time. For me, it shows longevity and the box was well placed. I love the fact that I can go to Memorial Park and spend a couple of days there, and still walk away saying I haven't found all the boxes. It is a large park and a great place to spend a day boxing.r</p>
<p>I am aware of the fact that the people at the State Parks have the responsibility of maintaining their parks and keeping them from being destroyed by careless people.</p>
<p>I am afraid there isn't an easy solution to this problem, but to those of you who are able to work on it, I say thank-you. Hopefully, your efforts will pay off.</p>

Even now, they will hand you a geocache form, but you just mark out "geocaching" and write in "letterboxing", then put the information required to locate the box, which would not include gps coordinates for letterboxes.  I don't know how long it will take for the forms to be made and distributed.  I suggested to him that, in order to save paper, we could put a form on our website that we could fill in, print out and take with us, leaving only the directions to the box to be filled in at the park.  He's considering that.<br/>

&gt; Sorry - I digress.)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Personally, I don't mind the idea of having to get a permit for a box.  I do <br/>
&gt; take issue with the thing on the department site about how the permit has to <br/>
&gt; include GPS coordinates - I don't own a GPS, and I likely never will.  If that's <br/>
&gt; going to be required for letterboxes, I won't place boxes in the state parks.  I <br/>
&gt; understand that we're being interpreted as being similar enough to geocaching <br/>
&gt; that we're falling under the same rules, but if we have to permit our boxes <br/>
&gt; (again, I don't take issue with that), I think that the permit application needs <br/>
&gt; to reflect that either it's a geocache or a letterbox and require <br/>
&gt; hobby-appropriate information.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I would prefer that we could police ourselves after being told where not to <br/>
&gt; place boxes, but honestly, I'm not really clear on how we would ensure that TX <br/>
&gt; boxers not on this list were aware of that stuff.  Although that's certainly the <br/>
&gt; preferred option, unless every park has a volunteer who is as dedicated as Mike <br/>
&gt; that can go check on boxes, I don't see how we'll convince the parks department <br/>
&gt; that it would work at every park.  Maybe parks near long-time, upstanding boxers <br/>
&gt; that are well known would do this, but I don't think we can expect a sweeping <br/>
&gt; approval of such a policy across the state.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Do the permits cost anything other than excessive amounts of time?  I'm not real <br/>
&gt; clear on that, and honestly, if I'd be expected to shell out a chunk of change <br/>
&gt; for every permit on an annual basis, I don't think I'd bother with any of it.  <br/>
&gt; (Just saying, 'cause it's not like I've been active in planting lately anyway.)<br/>

&gt; &gt; My suggestion is the same.  Ranger contacts us (you, me, Lucy, SE, etc) via <br/>
&gt; &gt;email to let us know of problem and we contact placer to move box or we put out <br/>
&gt; &gt;the word for closest person to area to remove it.  Personally, if permitting is <br/>
&gt; &gt;the only way to go, then I will not participate with State Parks and either <br/>
&gt; &gt;remove my existing boxes if that is a problem or let them fade away.  I know <br/>
&gt; &gt;Permitting is what they do, but continuing down a bad path is not a good answer.   <br/>
&gt; &gt;We need change.   Also, if we are able to go with what I laid out (self <br/>
&gt; &gt;regulation with park input on where can't hide) I am willing to work with the <br/>
&gt; &gt;parks on promotion of letterboxing (brochure design, etc).  Just can not get <br/>
&gt; &gt;excited about doing this with having to fill out a permit every year for all the <br/>
&gt; &gt;boxes I have in the parks (probably about 75).   Seems like more work for them <br/>
&gt; &gt;with all these permits each year, and having to go check on the box, and filing <br/>
&gt; &gt;and reminders that permit is expiring (because I will never remember to send in <br/>
&gt; &gt;new one each year to each park).   Also, if go with my system we can clean up <br/>
&gt; &gt;and boxes that are in locations they do not want, thus no need to determine <br/>
&gt; &gt;grandfathering.  I am all for not allowing boxes in places they should not be, <br/>
&gt; &gt;and feel it is up to us to make sure this does not happen and clean up any that <br/>
&gt; &gt;already are in places they should not be.  I understand this may be a radical <br/>
&gt; &gt;change for the parks to consider, but we will be doing most of the work, and <br/>
&gt; &gt;will be promoting visitation. <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; I guess the key question is, How many of you will actually go through the <br/>
&gt; &gt;permit system, or will you just avoid hiding in parks if that is the only <br/>
&gt; &gt;system.  And if say you will NOT hide in parks if that is the only system, would <br/>
&gt; &gt;you hide in state parks if the system was as I outlined in earlier post (and <br/>
&gt; &gt;below).  I guess if no one responds to this (not counting Mike and Boots) then <br/>
&gt; &gt;we are all problably waisting our time.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; I can present it to him as a suggestion.  Maybe I'll ask if they already have <br/>
&gt; &gt;park maps showing the protected and historic areas that we can use for this <br/>
&gt; &gt;purpose.  I'm sure I could get copies of those if they exist.  I think, for the <br/>
&gt; &gt;time being, if we ask the park manager, when we pick up the permit application <br/>
&gt; &gt;form, if there are areas that are sensitive or protected that we should stay <br/>
&gt; &gt;away from, they would tell us.  I don't think there is any way we'll be able to <br/>
&gt; &gt;avoid the permitting process completely.  I have pointed out to Mr. Owen that <br/>
&gt; &gt;some letterboxes have been in State Parks for years without causing any trouble <br/>
&gt; &gt;and, in fact, without any park official even knowing about them.  That tells me <br/>
&gt; &gt;that they have been responsibly placed and he had to agree with me.  All these <br/>
&gt; &gt;little points add up and maybe as we go forward, we'll be able to take over more <br/>
&gt; &gt;control of our boxes.  They have stressed that they don't want to add more <br/>
&gt; &gt;paperwork, so I will at least make the point that we would be willing to handle <br/>
&gt; &gt;the paperwork ourselves.  Let's think about how we could do that in a way that <br/>
&gt; &gt;they would consider.  Understand, now, that they don't want to give up the right <br/>
&gt; &gt;of approval, and that they can't go out and check on your box on a moments <br/>
&gt; &gt;notice when you drop it off at headquarters.  They want to reserve the right to <br/>
&gt; &gt;delegate that task to someone on a "when we get around to it" basis.  I can <br/>
&gt; &gt;understand their position.  But, that leaves you, as the placer, hanging.  You <br/>
&gt; &gt;would have to leave the box as you place it and leave the application for their <br/>
&gt; &gt;approval.  If, when they get around to checking it out, it doesn't meet with <br/>
&gt; &gt;their approval, you would either have to go back and move it or abandon it to <br/>
&gt; &gt;their descretion (which they don't want, because then they'd have to pick it up <br/>
&gt; &gt;and dispose of it).  This is the dilemma that we're trying to resolve and so <br/>
&gt; &gt;far, we haven't negotiated a solution.  Does anyone have a plan that would <br/>
&gt; &gt;satisfy both them and us?<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is what I was saying.  We develope the database and store it on this <br/>
&gt; &gt;talk list.   I am willing to help in this effort, as I'm sure others would be <br/>
&gt; &gt;also.  Self regulation on our part would only require the park system to meet <br/>
&gt; &gt;with us and agree to this, then each park would need to spend 15 minutes with <br/>
&gt; &gt;their park map and hilite all areas that can not be used for letterboxing, then <br/>
&gt; &gt;we can do all the rest (Post maps to talk list along with instructions and <br/>
&gt; &gt;rules).  I and others can monitor new boxes added to the parks to make sure they <br/>
&gt; &gt;are not in the areas designated (as some LBers not on talk list will not be <br/>
&gt; &gt;aware of, but then we can make them aware of it).    Boots - do you think this <br/>
&gt; &gt;would be something worth presenting to your new contact, vs the permit system <br/>
&gt; &gt;which is a pain for everyone involved.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; showing what "areas"<br/>

&gt; &gt;we know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; where they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want boxes placed we can avoid and monitor this ourselves, <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; simpler system<br/>

&gt; &gt;have been<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the postings on this board while we were gone, but haven't had much <br/>
&gt; &gt;time to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reply, so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thought I would expand just a little on my meeting with TPWD.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt;noticed that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Adams Trail<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tried to permit a box in a SP but met with some frustration.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt;discussed the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lack of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consistency with Ranger Owen and we are attempting to come up with <br/>
&gt; some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; standard<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures.  At this time, most park managers should at least be aware <br/>
&gt; &gt;of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxing, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since there are no procedures in place, each is pretty much on his own <br/>
&gt; &gt;as to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how to carry<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out the permitting process.  We are having to use the geocaching policy <br/>
&gt; &gt;and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; procedures at<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moment, but apparently they lack consistency as well.  We're trying <br/>
&gt; &gt;to do<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about that.  We should be at least getting our own application form.  I <br/>
&gt; &gt;don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should expect our policy to differ much from the one in place for <br/>
&gt; &gt;geocaching,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but we should<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be recognized as a separate entity from geocaching, so over time, I <br/>
&gt; &gt;think the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personnel will come to appreciate the differences in the two <br/>
&gt; &gt;activities.  We<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have to prove to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them that we can police ourselves before we can discuss changes in the <br/>
&gt; &gt;policy.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also discussing the possibility of "grandfathering" letterboxes that <br/>
&gt; &gt;were<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; placed before the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; TPWD policies were put in place.  No promises have been made, but Mr. <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eagle's opinion that we shouldn't have to permit letterboxes.  There is <br/>
&gt; &gt;no one<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whose opinion<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I value more than Silver Eagle's.  I even agree with him that asking <br/>
&gt; &gt;for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forgiveness is<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes better than asking for permission.  I, too, believe that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxers are capable<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of policing ourselves and should be allowed to do so.  However, I <br/>
&gt; don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; believe that will<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happen and I think that, if we work with them and continue to place our <br/>
&gt; &gt;boxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; responsibly<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and according to their rules, we will be better off in the long run and <br/>
&gt; &gt;may,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with our good<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, be able to convince them that we are causing no harm to the <br/>
&gt; &gt;parks.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; don't want<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to talk negatively about our cousins, the geocachers, but they didn't <br/>
&gt; &gt;set the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; best example<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we are helping to pay for their mistakes.  Okay, maybe I do feel <br/>
&gt; &gt;some<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bitterness, but<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that does no good.  I believe, from Mr. Owen's response to my appeal, <br/>
&gt; &gt;that we<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not only<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be welcome, but that we will be embraced in Texas State Parks.  Until <br/>
&gt; &gt;we have<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our own<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; policy in place, I encourage you all to test the waters by placing <br/>
&gt; &gt;boxes in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; State Parks, by<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the rules as interpreted by each park manager.  I think, in this way, <br/>
&gt; &gt;we can<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prove our right<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to exist in their parks.<br/>
