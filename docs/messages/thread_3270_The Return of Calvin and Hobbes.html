<div>No, Calvin &amp; Hobbes  aren't returning to the comics pages, at 
least not that I know of, but I have recarved my Calvin and Hobbes stamps that 
went missing from that too-busy park in Mansfield, and will be planting the new 
boxes in a totally different location soon (next week I hope!).  So for 
those of you who have been asking about them, watch for The Return of Calvin and 
Hobbes.  As before, you'll have to find Calvin for clues to his imaginary 
playmate/stuffed tiger, Hobbes.  The location is a place I've long wanted 
to plant a box, but just didn't have the proper inspiration for the stamps for 
this place until I realized it's perfect for these two!  I'm excited 
myself!</div>
