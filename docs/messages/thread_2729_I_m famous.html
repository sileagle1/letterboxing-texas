<div>Our local paper did an article on our family a couple of years ago.  I still have people come up to me and ask me if I still do that thing I used to do.  One lady who asks me about it every time I see her was jogging with two of her friends in Nichols Green while I was hanging on the side of a hill trying to find one of JBK's holiday series.  She jogged by me as I tried to think how to explain what I was doing hanging out where I was.  As they jogged by, I heard her tell her friends I was mailboxing.  That's good.  They'll be really confused if they google mailboxing and try to relate it to what I was doing in the park.
