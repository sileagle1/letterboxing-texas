                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just posted my sitrep for the day, but I have to<br/>
address an issue and I didn't want to do it while I<br/>
talked about what a fun day we had.  It WAS a lot of<br/>
fun, but it wouldn't have been nearly as much fun if<br/>
some of the boxes we found had been missing.<br/>
<br/>
Let me just say it:<br/>
<br/>
REHIDE.<br/>
<br/>
REHIDE WELL.<br/>
<br/>
REHIDE WELL PLEASE.<br/>
<br/>
I hate to say this, but every single box I found was<br/>
exposed.  Every one.  Two of them could be seen from a<br/>
distance of about 15 feet, and one of those two was so<br/>
clearly visible from the trail that I'm surprised<br/>
someone didn't pick it up and take it away as trash. <br/>
Someone had tried to rehide by laying three sticks<br/>
across it.  Three sticks and nothing else across a<br/>
bright blue lid is like an elephant trying to hide<br/>
behind a lamppost.  It doesn't work.<br/>
<br/>
When you rehide, take a look from several different<br/>
angles to make sure you can't see any hint of the box.<br/>
 Also, consider that if you are using small matter to<br/>
rehide, some of that material will slip away.   And<br/>
don't go digging with a backhoe to get more material<br/>
to cover with - that only draws attention to the fact<br/>
that someone has been concealing something.  <br/>
<br/>
One of the boxes I hid today, Go Jacks!, was a very<br/>
difficult carving.  Aside from being an intricate<br/>
piece of work, it is also a tribute to my deceased dad<br/>
who earned a forestry degree from SFA, and who was a<br/>
man bigger than life and as fine a person as anyone I<br/>
could ever hope to meet.  And as if that isn't enough,<br/>
it is a nod to my own alma matre and the time I spent<br/>
at SFA.  I put a lot of work into the stamp and it<br/>
turned out great!  I'm very proud of it and I'm eager<br/>
to share it with my fellow letterboxers.  I know that<br/>
I placed it in a high risk area, but it is exactly<br/>
where it needs to be, given what it means.<br/>
<br/>
HOWEVER, I'm very discouraged after my run today - if<br/>
Go Jacks! isn't hidden back any better than the boxes<br/>
I found today, it won't last a month.  Consequently,<br/>
I'm going to post it on LBNA, but the clues will only<br/>
be available by email from me.  If it goes missing, it<br/>
goes missing, and I WILL be sad, but I don't want it<br/>
to go missing because someone didn't respect my effort<br/>
enough to take care of it for me.<br/>
<br/>
For you finders who have never placed a box, I<br/>
encourage you to carve a stamp and place a box, so you<br/>
can better understand the position of a placer.  In<br/>
most cases, placers are sharing a little bit of<br/>
themselves with future finders unknown.  It's a<br/>
difficult idea to understand if you haven't been<br/>
there.  It's a wonderful feeling to set a box free,<br/>
but it really is frustrating to know that it might<br/>
never be seen again.<br/>
<br/>
I hope that I haven't offended anyone or hurt any<br/>
feelings by what I've said, but I say it for the good<br/>
of all of us, not just myself.  And I am not trying to<br/>
point fingers at any person, but at a practice that<br/>
needs to be better.  If it was a newbie who did the<br/>
poor rehiding, I don't want you to get discouraged and<br/>
quit because of what I've said, but I DO want you to<br/>
understand that it is up to YOU - the finder - to take<br/>
extra care to protect the boxes you find.  The placer<br/>
should be diligent to put the box in a location that<br/>
is amenable to hiding and to provide a means to hide<br/>
it well, but that's as far as they can go.  The rest<br/>
is up to all of us!<br/>
<br/>
Thank you today because I know you'll try harder<br/>
tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
Lucy<br/>

free,</tt><br/>
<tt>but it really is frustrating to know that it might</tt><br/>
<tt>never be seen again.</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>I hope that I haven't offended anyone or hurt any</tt><br/>
<tt>feelings by what I've said, but I say it for the
good</tt><br/>
<tt>of all of us, not just myself.  And I am not
trying to</tt><br/>
<tt>point fingers at any person, but at a practice
that</tt><br/>
<tt>needs to be better.  If it was a newbie who
did the</tt><br/>
<tt>poor rehiding, I don't want you to get discouraged
and</tt><br/>
<tt>quit because of what I've said, but I DO want you
to</tt><br/>
<tt>understand that it is up to YOU - the finder - to
take</tt><br/>
<tt>extra care to protect the boxes you find. 
The placer</tt><br/>
<tt>should be diligent to put the box in a location
that</tt><br/>
<tt>is amenable to hiding and to provide a means to
hide</tt><br/>
<tt>it well, but that's as far as they can go. 
The rest</tt><br/>
<tt>is up to all of us!</tt><br/>
<br/>
<tt>Thank you today because I know you'll try harder</tt><br/>
<tt>tomorrow.</tt><br/>

<div>THANK YOU!!!     My friend in Colorado heard from a family who found one of her boxes and they told her they let their four year old re-hide the box and Oh that was soooooooooooo cute.................so she goes to check it later and finds it laying there in the open with a *stick* laying on top of it. Good grief. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Re-hiding *and* putting the contents of the box back the same way are pet peeves of mine. I've been hearing from different people that with so many new boxers, there has been kind of a problem with re-hiding in general. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Frankly I don't get why anyone would not re-hide well, but then I'm so "picky".  And I really don't have any patience with those who don't. There's just simply no reason not to unless you just don't care. </div>

<div>I agree!! I have found a number of boxes that were exposed. After putting it back, we always check from a number of angles to make sure it is not visible and not "marked" with a "HEY LOOK HERE, SOMEBODY HID SOMETHING" covering. I do think, tho, that sometimes the ground covering stuff and small sticks are washed away by a heavy rain. </div>
