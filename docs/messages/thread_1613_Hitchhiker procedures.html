<br/>
Just a reminder about the way to handle a hitchhiker.  I picked up<br/>
Quetzel's Bee on the Move at the Fairfield Letterbox yesterday, and<br/>
it's missing a few box stamps.  Hitchhiker logbooks are stamped with<br/>
the stamp of the host box and with the stamp of any letterboxer who<br/>
moves it along or who takes its stamp image as a visitor without<br/>
moving it anywhere.  The person who places the HH in the host box is<br/>
supposed to stamp the new host box in the log along with the date<br/>
left, but often people forget.  In that case, the person who picks up<br/>
the HH should do it.  <br/>
<br/>
So, when you pick up a hitchhiker, check to make sure it has the box<br/>
it has been hiding inside is stamped in the logbook.  I didn't do<br/>
that, just grabbed it, and I got home found that it doesn't have the<br/>
Fairfield stamp in it.  However, the HH log is also missing the stamp<br/>
of the previous box it visited as well, so I thought I'd offer this<br/>
reminder.  It can certainly get confusing.<br/>
<br/>
And, with the gathering coming up in a few months, I thought I'd ask<br/>
if anyone needs clarification on a personal traveler and what it is<br/>
and how it works?<br/>

the Tour Bus and wondered what that was all about.<br/>
