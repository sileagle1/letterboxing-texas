<p> I did notice that there appears to be a number of boxes in city parks there that weren't there when we visited Fredericksburg a couple of years ago, and several in one park particularly. Maybe they found some of them as they did seasonal maintenance.</p>

There are only 3 ways to go from here.<br>
<br>
1.  Continue to hide boxes without permission and give letterboxing a bad name<br>
there.<br>

2.  Quit letterboxing there.<br>

what you wish for) – the problem will become greater and greater.  It has already been mentioned right here on the list that a park used for the annual meeting has a large number of boxes left behind along with the question of just who will maintain them.  Remember – no matter how passionate you are about letterboxing, to the un-initiated it is still abandoned trash.  If someone tossed a box of trash in your yard – how would you feel?  Even if you were promised it was “good trash”?  You still need to “clean it up”.  In addition, this trash was drawing people into a sensitive area where

Speaking for myself, if I am with family while trying to place a box, I don't have time to deal with authorities, and even if I am by myself I might not have time to find the right person, get the permit, get approval and place the box all in one visit. So I would either have to only place boxes in parks near where I live, which would really limit my choices, or not place boxes in any parks. In my opinion it would be much simpler for parks concerned about letterboxing to just post the sensitive areas to avoid and let us police ourselves. The contact information is on the clues so I see no need for permits. This would shift the burden of work to us instead of the Rangers, and I would welcome that.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/><br/>--- In <a href="http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, "Mike Olbrisch" &lt;mike-2007@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I can only imagine the uproar now.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; There are only 3 ways to go from here.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 1.

As for calling letterboxing "litterboxing", I don't see it that way.  If a box is hidden well enough not to be seen, how is it litter?  If the box is visible, it will go missing, so I don't see the problem.<br>

I have faced the same kind of mindset with owning guns, with ham radio antennas, with geocaching, etc etc…..  If you do not follow the rules, you can be banned from using the parks, or even fined.  What is the fine for littering?  I do not box a lot anymore, so I really don’t care of this hobby becomes such a problem that it isn’t allowed anywhere anymore.<br>

I'm betting the park in question is Lady Bird Johnson park (which is on the edge of town by the airport), but I guess you would now question if the boxes placed at the visitor center parking lot in town would be in trouble and require permits.   Where would you go to permit a box in a parking lot?  I would just suggest maybe we create a "Do not place" list, and post places known in Texas that are not friendly to letterboxing (PS: IRA - My front yard will be the number 1 entry).    <br>

I never said you ignore the rules.  I only said that people who do will only bring more of the same and worse.  Call it what you like - it is what it is - and they have every right to demand that their rules be complied with.<br>

BTW - 20 new boxes in the Franklin Mountains would be less than one box per square mile - but some other parks like Palmetto, 20 boxes is beyond saturation.<br>

When a true letterboxer becomes the head of TPWD - they can reverse the rules.  But I am not holding my breath.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm getting in on this discussion a little late and I'm not sure what letterboxing has to do with guns except that I went to a Texas state park a couple of days agk and couldn't get in because they were allowing hunting that day. I wasn't involved in letterboxer back in the day when TPWD had a problem with geocaching, so I don't know that story.  I can't say what Fredericksburg has against letterboxing or what prompted the decision to require permits in their parks.  I do know that, until a few weeks ago, TPWD didn't have a clue about the existance of a thing called letterboxing.  I have corresponding with Chris Holmes there who is in charge of geocaching activities in Texas State Parks and the first time I spoke to him, he told me that he had never heard of letterboxing.  I have permitted letterboxes in 7 or 8 state parks and every time, I've had to use the geocache permit application because park personnel didn't know about letterboxing.  I am working with Mr. Holmes and he has appointed a ranger from southeast Texas to be in charge of establishing a policy for letterboxing that will be equal to and similar to the geocaching policy.  He has notified all park managers about the existence of letterboxing and has agreed to either give us our own separate permit application or include us equally on the existing geocache one.  I have been assisted in this matter with a couple of our prominent long time letterboxers, who have given me good ideas and suggestions to present to TPWD.  I met with Mr. Holmes's appointee, Robert Owen, last week at Huntsville State Park, along with Chrissy Halpen, the ranger in charge of HSP letterboxing and geocaching.  We had a productive meeting and discussed the suggestions and ideas that I brought with me, including the permitting process and holding events in the parks, including the fact that we would probably place a lot of boxes during an event.  These two rangers don't have a problem with that in theory as long as the boxes are permitted and placed by their rules.  They don't by the way, look upon letterboxes as litter.  They think that they are a viable activity for the parks and have asked if we would object to the promotion of the activiy in state parks.  This is a work in progress, but all Texas State Parks should now be aware of letterboxing.  There is a current policy in place lumped in with geocaching, but I think we will be recognized as an equal activity shortly.  As of right now, you are allowed to place boxes in state parks.  You should find out from park personnel what areas are off limits and follow their rules.  I am still working on a working partnership with Ranger Owen and will let everyone know the result of those meetings when they are finalized.  We may not get everything we ask for, but we can demonstrate to them by cooperating that we are willing to follow their rules when placing boxes in their parks.  Building their trust in us will help us in our future dealings with them.  The fact that nobody in Texas Parks and Wildlife are, or were, familiar with letterboxing, tells me that they haven't had any problems with us.  I think it demontrates that we've been doing a good job with our hiding and with our events.  They are looking for ways to improve attendence in parks and promote more appeal to younger people and letterboxing is one of the ways they can do that.  If you experience a problem with letterboxing in Texas State Parks, lets talk it over and figure out how we can work with them.  I don't think they'll ever let us completely police ourselves, because after all, they have bigger fish to fry, like hunting.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Good Morning B.T.<br>
<br>
GREAT JOB.  I always said it would take someone talking to them face to face for<br>
there to be any changes.  I also said it would be for someone living close to<br>
the HQ to do, not for someone 600+ miles away.<br>
<br>
Letterboxing vs guns?  Nothing in common, except I used guns and gun owners as<br>
an example of how a number of like-minded people can force awareness and change<br>
by forming a unified front, deciding what to do, then carrying it out to a<br>
positive conclusion.  Obviously the same thing you (alone) have done for<br>
letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Not being able to spend a lot of time with the TPDW-HQ, I concentrated on<br>
working it on a local level.  With some success I might add.  But you took it to<br>
a whole new level - right to the state.<br>
<br>
One correction.  Not all state parks are unaware of letterboxing.  At least 2<br>
are fully aware.  One is Franklin Mountain state Park, where I volunteer.  Those<br>
rangers are fully aware, although to them there are few differences between<br>
letterboxing and geocaching.  <br>
<br>
Hueco Tanks State Historic Site is unique, it has one letterbox, and NO<br>
geocaches.  I do not believe there will ever be a geocache in that park,<br>
geocachers are not as environmentally friendly and self-policing as they might<br>
be.  The letterbox was allowed for two reasons.  The first is because there was<br>
already one there before they learned of it, so historically it was allowed to<br>
stay.  The second reason was because letterboxers are more environmentally<br>
friendly people.  The box was not allowed to be returned to its original<br>
position, and it took several days of searching to find a suitable place that<br>
the head ranger would permit it to stay.  That is a very sensitive park<br>
environmentally.<br>
<br>
Again, all this was done on a local level where the local rangers were made<br>
aware.  When you boil it down, what is the difference between a geocache and a<br>
letterbox?  For the rangers, most of whom do have bigger fish to fry, what is<br>
the difference?  Someone hides something and someone else seeks something.  You<br>
hide it, they find it.  Trading stamps, or trading trinkets?  Using a compass,<br>
or a GPS?  Minor differences really in their minds.  While they are aware of the<br>
differences, there was no change to the state forms made locally.<br>
<br>
But again - GREAT JOB!<br>
<br>
As to cities like Fredericksburg?  I have no clue what caused them to require<br>
permitting.  This is the first time I have heard of such a thing.  It may have<br>
happened for geocachers already in other cities, but I have not been following<br>
that front at all.  I too have bigger fish to fry right now.  Again, someone<br>
locally would need to research that to see what caused them to do this.<br>
Probably a knee-jerk reaction to some incident, or some petty bureaucrat<br>
wielding his great power.  And someone locally would need to work with the city<br>
the same way you did with TPWD-HQ to make changes if any changes were needed.<br>
That the city has the right to specify how city property is used is not in<br>
question.  Some might argue that it is their property since they pay taxes for<br>
it, perhaps a valid claim.  How much will we collectively be willing to pay to<br>
fight that in court if it comes to that?<br>
<br>
As I said in the beginning of this thread, there are three things that can be<br>
done.  1 - you can play by the rules, as I try to do locally.  2 - you can just<br>
refuse to play the permitting game, as Silver Eagle as stated he will do for<br>
Fredericksburg.  I concur with him on that BTW, I too don't have days to go<br>
through the permitting procedure when I am passing through with a van full of<br>
dogs.  Or 3 - you can work with them and try to change it.  #3 is what you<br>
worked on.  I am sure it wasn't easy.  But you got it done, and you deserve the<br>
credit.<br>
<br>
As to letterboxes being trash.... of course I do not consider them to be trash.<br>
But others do, that is a simple reality.  Not everyone gets it.  It may not even<br>
be malicious, something as simple as a minimum wage city gardener not even<br>
looking at the dirty lock-n-lock box someone left after having lunch in the<br>
park.  Was it a lunch, or your letterbox spattered with some mud and dead<br>
leaves?<br>
<br>
I am not trying to be a jerk - just realistic.  Not everyone gets it.  Your<br>
efforts have done something to help raise the awareness level at the state level<br>
for state parks.  THANK YOU!<br>
<br>
Now - are you ready to take on Fredericksburg?  <grin>.<br>

We went on a 2 week trip to south Texas in November. We had planned on placing a few letterboxes in the State Parks that we stayed in. I said Planned on. We did not place any. The first park that we talked to was Buescher SP. We talked to the lady there and she said that the head ranger would have to approve it and gave us some papers to fill out which I expected and was willing to fill out. Then she said that it would probably be 2 to 4 weeks before he would approve it. That I could just mail it back. I asked when he would be in the park and she said that he would be in tomorrow. I asked if he could approve it then if I just brought it back tomorrow. She said that he might but most times it takes about 2 weeks. We had to leave so we could not see him tomorrow but thought we would stop on the way back. Our plans changed so we could not return. I was so disappointed. I know how Silver Eagle feels about planting in his own neighborhood. I live sorta in the back 40 so to speak. Once you plant in this area, you have planted. There is no use to keep it up. There is not much interest in this place and after all, hiking and interest is important in letterboxing. Adams Trails<br>

> I'm getting in on this discussion a little late and I'm not sure what letterboxing has to do with guns except that I went to a Texas state park a couple of days agk and couldn't get in because they were allowing hunting that day. I wasn't involved in letterboxer back in the day when TPWD had a problem with geocaching, so I don't know that story.  I can't say what Fredericksburg has against letterboxing or what prompted the decision to require permits in their parks.  I do know that, until a few weeks ago, TPWD didn't have a clue about the existance of a thing called letterboxing.  I have corresponding with Chris Holmes there who is in charge of geocaching activities in Texas State Parks and the first time I spoke to him, he told me that he had never heard of letterboxing.  I have permitted letterboxes in 7 or 8 state parks and every time, I've had to use the geocache permit application because park personnel didn't know about letterboxing.  I am working with Mr. Holmes and he has appointed a ranger from southeast Texas to be in charge of establishing a policy for letterboxing that will be equal to and similar to the geocaching policy.  He has notified all park managers about the existence of letterboxing and has agreed to either give us our own separate permit application or include us equally on the existing geocache one.  I have been assisted in this matter with a couple of our prominent long time letterboxers, who have given me good ideas and suggestions to present to TPWD.  I met with Mr. Holmes's appointee, Robert Owen, last week at Huntsville State Park, along with Chrissy Halpen, the ranger in charge of HSP letterboxing and geocaching.  We had a productive meeting and discussed the suggestions and ideas that I brought with me, including the permitting process and holding events in the parks, including the fact that we would probably place a lot of boxes during an event.  These two rangers don't have a problem with that in theory as long as the boxes are permitted and placed by their rules.  They don't by the way, look upon letterboxes as litter.  They think that they are a viable activity for the parks and have asked if we would object to the promotion of the activiy in state parks.  This is a work in progress, but all Texas State Parks should now be aware of letterboxing.  There is a current policy in place lumped in with geocaching, but I think we will be recognized as an equal activity shortly.  As of right now, you are allowed to place boxes in state parks.  You should find out from park personnel what areas are off limits and follow their rules.  I am still working on a working partnership with Ranger Owen and will let everyone know the result of those meetings when they are finalized.  We may not get everything we ask for, but we can demonstrate to them by cooperating that we are willing to follow their rules when placing boxes in their parks.  Building their trust in us will help us in our future dealings with them.  The fact that nobody in Texas Parks and Wildlife are, or were, familiar with letterboxing, tells me that they haven't had any problems with us.  I think it demontrates that we've been doing a good job with our hiding and with our events.  They are looking for ways to improve attendence in parks and promote more appeal to younger people and letterboxing is one of the ways they can do that.  If you experience a problem with letterboxing in Texas State Parks, lets talk it over and figure out how we can work with them.  I don't think they'll ever let us completely police ourselves, because after all, they have bigger fish to fry, like hunting.<br>
