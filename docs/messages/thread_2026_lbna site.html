                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is one reason I think it is good to have your clues listed a <br/>
couple of places.  If you post your clues on LBNA, but put an <br/>
Atlasquest link to them, AQ will save a "cached" copy of them, and <br/>
the clues will still be available when LBNA goes down.  This works <br/>
very well, IMHO.<br/>
<br/>
Or, you could do as Silver Eagle has done and host on your own <br/>
webpage.  <br/>
<br/>
You can search for a cached copy of specific clues using google, but <br/>
this is not working very well for newer clues.  The wayback machine <br/>
(www.archive.org) will also help with older clues, but you sometimes <br/>
have to have very specific information to find what you're looking <br/>
for.  It was a drag for me, because between the time I looked up the <br/>
clues in my hotel room upstairs and went downstairs to use the <br/>
printer (shooing away the gaggle of teeny myspace users), LBNA went <br/>
down and I was unable to find the boxes in Pensacola we were going <br/>
to find.   However, that meant more beach time for the kids, so they <br/>
didn't complain.<br/>
<br/>
This will all be very interesting.  I have no problem paying a small <br/>
fee to keep LBNA running, after all, I'm a premium member at <br/>
Atlasquest because I appreciate how much work it is to run a website <br/>
like that and I want to support those efforts.  As my husband says, <br/>
we should at least all contribute to the Choi beer fund as a thank <br/>
you for his HOURS of work.  <br/>
<br/>
But, there are people who will be ADAMENTLY opposed to even a <br/>
suggestion of paying.  I hope cooler heads prevail, and I suggest we <br/>
just stay out of it!<br/>

                    <html><body><div>This is exactly what I've been thinking as well - glad I have most of mine in both places.  Sometimes AQ goes down too.  The likelihood they'll both ever be down at the same time is pretty slim, but it is remotely possible.  A couple boxes of mine aren't on AQ though.  I've also got a few of mine hosted myself on geocities, and I'll sure move toward getting them all over there, if not for public use at least for my own purposes.  The one thing I wish right now is that I had a copy saved also to my hard drive in a single Word file.

<div>Certainly Choi and Ryan and other behind the scenes guys who put all their hard work into maintaining our sites shouldn't have to also flip the bill.  I'll be happy enough to contribute whatever they deem appropriate (within reason) when the dust settles.  I'm glad we have guys like them around to manage the databases.  That sort of thing sure isn't MY strength!

<div> </div>
<div>I'll be glad to go through and clean out the files section of the group if anyone would like to store their clues there.  Or what would y'all think if folks want to post clues to the group so they are archived in our history?  If y'all are agreeable to that, I would suggest that before anyone does that, we agree on a posting format.
<br/><br/>LBNA being down isn't the end of the world, and in fact it is an opportunity for us to think outside the box about how we would communicate clues if we didn't have LBNA or AQ.  Hmmm...what COULD we do???</div>

<div>Lucy, I think that would be great if it's something that's doable (I know 
nothing about this stuff, but sure do depend on the expertise of you and others 
who do!).  I'd love to have clues available in several places.  --
