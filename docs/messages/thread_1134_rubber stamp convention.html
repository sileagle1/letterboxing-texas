<p>I saw in the paper today that there is a Rubber Stamp Convention at the Arlington Convention Center this weekend.  Go to <a href="http://www.heirloompro.com">www.heirloompro.com</a> for more info.  It looks like most of the stuff is geared toward those who use stamps for greeting cards and scrapbooks, but there is a free bookbinding class on both days.  It also looks like the merchandise leans towards those of us who scrapbook.  Just in case you have some free time this weekend....</p>

caption TLRE.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;After the gathering I had thought we would offer to share the collection<br/>&gt;with other gatherings around the country - we had one group in California<br/>&gt;very interested in borrowing them for their Goldrush event, but sadly the<br/>&gt;organizer had a death in the family and plans fell through. I've offered the<br/>&gt;collection of 35 stamps to a couple other groups for their gatherings, but<br/>&gt;the "Wild West" theme seems to throw them! ( Go figure!!!)<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Sooo...on the heels of Barefoot Lucy's "barn raising" idea, I want to<br/>&gt;suggest that we send these delightful stamps back out into the state,<br/>&gt;specifically to "seed" barren areas. For example, Catpawz had mentioned that<br/>&gt;she travels to Lubbock once a month or so - perhaps she'd be willing to take<br/>&gt;3 or 4 boxes to plant?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;We would bring 4 or 5 boxes 
to Waxahachie to plant, of course!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;I still owe two out-of-state boxers, Wanda (of Wanda&amp;Pete) and Scarab (who<br/>&gt;inspired the whole CLUE game and suggested most of the titles) a booklet of<br/>&gt;the WildWestClues - somehow as soon as I remember that I need to do that, I<br/>&gt;forget again....obvious senility! I'm copying them both on this note to<br/>&gt;pressure myself into DOING it!<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Any comments, thoughts or suggestions?<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;Thanks!<br/>&gt;Ruby T.<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt;<br/></div></div><br clear="all"/><hr/> <a href="http://g.msn.com/8HMBENUS/2734??PS=47575" target="_top">Find e-mail and documents on your PC instantly with the new MSN Search ToolbarFREE!</a> </body></html>
