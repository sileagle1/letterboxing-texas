<div>I have one ready to plant when the currently planned mission flies as well.  It will go in another location in this area that was hard hit by debris.  I'll keep doing mission boxes as long as I feel like it.</div>

For awhile there we took shuttle flights for granted, like they were a<br>
bus line, forgetting what a bizarre miracle spaceflight is.  <br>
<br>
Let's hope that today's launch goes off without a hitch.<br>
