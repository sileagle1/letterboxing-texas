<div>Now that I've picked myself back up...</div>
<div> </div>
<div>SJZ's box is now more appropriately listed in Pilot Point, not Sanger (I thought I had changed it a long time ago, but apparently I hadn't).  As far as I can tell, SJZ is the closest box to Sanger, and it is around the lake from Sanger.  Looking at other boxes, it seems to me like the closest other boxes are actually in Denton and Gainesville, 15 and 20 miles away.

<div>Is that enough elbow room for your box???<br/> </div>

<div><font size="2">I LOVE that you are so conscientious as to where you plant your boxes! Sanger is a pretty big area and could use more boxes. As long as it's not right on top of BL's SJZ's box, I would imagine she would enjoy the company. My philosophy is that if there are more than one box listed in an area, they will likely attract more people. Many people just don't want to risk traveling for miles and miles in hopes of finding just one box (not everyone, but many people). Many of us have boxes hidden in the FW Botanical Gardens. There are so many visitors to that park from out of town, I think it is fun for them to be able to find all those boxes from different carvers/placers (Viewfinder, Baby Bear, Kantexan, Stargazer, Strawberry and me.... to name a few!)</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I am very, very excited for you to plant more boxes. If it's any consolation, two of my first three boxes were missing within the first year of my planting them too.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I'm sure many placers run into the same dilemma; you find a perfect spot to hide a box where it would be safe, but it's nearly impossible to describe it! Like: "start at the trailhead and count every oak tree within five feet of the right side of the trail... when you get to 843 (not counting saplings under two feet), take a compass reading of 254 degrees and go 1,273 paces into the woods at this degree until you come to a big hollowed out tree...... etc." There is one trail I am particularly fond of, but I swear there are NO distinguishing features along this trail to help lead finders to a box.... no posts, no bridges, no clearings.... just trees. I'll eventually figure something out.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Anyway.... congratulations on you decision to plant a new box!</font></div>

<div>Okay, now I'm really going to freak you out. I see a series coming. But, it's a whole metroplex thing. About 10 stamps, if I can get to all the places.</div>

<div><font size="2">I LOVE that you are so conscientious as to where you plant your boxes! Sanger is a pretty big area and could use more boxes. As long as it's not right on top of BL's SJZ's box, I would imagine she would enjoy the company. My philosophy is that if there are more than one box listed in an area, they will likely attract more people. Many people just don't want to risk traveling for miles and miles in hopes of finding just one box (not everyone, but many people). Many of us have boxes hidden in the FW Botanical Gardens. There are so many visitors to that park from out of town, I think it is fun for them to be able to find all those boxes from different carvers/placers (Viewfinder, Baby Bear, Kantexan, Stargazer, Strawberry and me.... to name a few!)</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I am very, very excited for you to plant more boxes. If it's any consolation, two of my first three boxes were missing within the first year of my planting them too.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I'm sure many placers run into the same dilemma; you find a perfect spot to hide a box where it would be safe, but it's nearly impossible to describe it! Like: "start at the trailhead and count every oak tree within five feet of the right side of the trail... when you get to 843 (not counting saplings under two feet), take a compass reading of 254 degrees and go 1,273 paces into the woods at this degree until you come to a big hollowed out tree...... etc." There is one trail I am particularly fond of, but I swear there are NO distinguishing features along this trail to help lead finders to a box.... no posts, no bridges, no clearings...<wbr>. just trees. I'll eventually figure something out.</wbr></font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">Anyway.... congratulations on you decision to plant a new box!</font></div>

<div>Make sure you're sitting before you read further, I don't want anyone falling down from shock.</div>

<div>I'm going to plant a box. Yep, it's true. (Are you still with me PS and VF?) Okay, so I'm really going to do it. (Take a deep breath janet, it's okay, you can do this)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm thinkin' Sanger. SJZ's birthday box, is listed on LBNA as Sanger, but it's not near where I'm thinkin'. There's a reason I'm thinkin' Sanger, of course. But, I don't want to infringe on anyone (even though my only two boxes were (yep, that's a were) in close proximity of others, with permission). I can plant somewhere else. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Obviously I'm scared. How long did it take me to plant the other two? Too long! But, I'm ready to try again :)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, anybody know if there is one there? I did a search, but I'm not the best navigator on the computer. </div>

<div>Y'all have wonderful a day!</div>
