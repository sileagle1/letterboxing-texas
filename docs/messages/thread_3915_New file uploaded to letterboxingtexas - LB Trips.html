                    <div class="plaintext-content">Our first Letterbox trip was in January, 2003, and we made a big loop <br/>
including Mission Tejas SP in the east, Confederate Reunion SP in <br/>
central, and Mother Neff SP in west central, plus a few places in <br/>
between.  We didn't place boxes in every county, just enough to give <br/>
everyone in those areas a box within a hundred miles or so.  Of <br/>
course nobody else was letterboxing at that time, but we were hoping <br/>
our seeds would start it growing, and it sure did!<br/>
<br/>
That summer we took our letterbox seeds out of state as we followed <br/>
the Lewis &amp; Clark trail.  We ended up putting boxes in OK, AR, MO, KS <br/>
IA, NE, SD &amp; ND.  We actually got to find a few on this trip and it <br/>
was a lot of fun, so we decided to do a letterbox trip every year.<br/>
<br/>
The next few years we mostly just found boxes and did not place that <br/>
many.  We went backpacking in Montana twice and put boxes in WA, OR, <br/>
ID, WY &amp; MT.  We also went to the Dallas area twice and East TX once.<br/>
We missed our trip last year so we were long overdue.  Since <br/>
populating virgin counties has become our new obsession, we decided <br/>
to get back to our roots and go on a letterbox seeding trip just like <br/>
the first one, only this time it would involve many more boxes and <br/>
much more travel.  It also required a lot of research to come up with <br/>
good subjects for all these counties and places to put the boxes.  <br/>
Since Boots &amp; LSQ had just finished the North Region with their LB <br/>
trip, we decided to go South and try to finish that region, along <br/>
with Central.<br/>
<br/>
Normally I like to place boxes in places that I want people to visit, <br/>
but in this case we sometimes had to place our boxes any place we <br/>
could find, usually cemeteries, and I'm sorry about that.  Most of <br/>
the boxes are about interesting things, though, and many of the forts <br/>
are fun to visit, so maybe somebody will go after them, or maybe a <br/>
new boxer from one of the areas will get hooked.<br/>
<br/>
There were several high notes and a few low notes on this trip.  A <br/>
few of the low ones:<br/>
<br/>
1.  The bleak countryside - nothing but scrub oak, thorn bushes and <br/>
cactus everywhere made me appreciate what the early travelers had to <br/>
deal with.  We are still picking thorns and cactus needles out of our <br/>
skin!<br/>
<br/>
2.  Trashy towns - not sure if it is because people are poor in that <br/>
part of the state or what, but many of the towns we visited were not <br/>
very nice.  Even some of the cemeteries had trash.<br/>
<br/>
Some high notes:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Good wildlife - we saw and heard many birds, including several <br/>
Mexican Eagles right after I placed my box of the same name.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Interesting history - we saw a rattlesnake taller than me, <br/>
Popeye, the cannon that started the TX Revolution, a town that was <br/>
under 7 flags instead of just 6, a town where O. Henry lived, and <br/>
several great forts.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Interesting stamps - we did manage to find a few boxes and some <br/>
were memorable, especially Lasso This, which contained a stamp with <br/>
great curves, er I mean carves, that helped keep our tent warm at <br/>
night.<br/>
<br/>
There is much more, but I will save it for the campfire at TALE6.<br/>

&gt; Kudos to you, Silver Eagle, and Baby Bear for spreading letterboxes <br/>
&gt; and letterboxing throughout the great state of Texas.  How many <br/>
years <br/>
&gt; have you been doing this, and how many boxes do you estimate were <br/>
&gt; placed on all these trips?<br/>

<div>&gt; a town that was <br/>under 7 flags instead of just 6,</div>

<div>Interesting! What was the seventh flag?</div>
