I was not able to get the box back up in the tree<br/>

I know most of them are harmless, but I am less than fond of our <br/>

&gt;      A friend went to Mercer yesterday and she said a big black <br/>
snake was<br/>
&gt;      guarding the Bamboo For You lb.  She also found a ribbon <br/>
snake by<br/>
&gt;      another box.  I guess there is a bonus in having 5 kids <br/>
with you - you<br/>
&gt;      make enough noise that everything clears out before we get <br/>
there - ha ha<br/>
&gt;<br/>
&gt;      &gt; ACK!!  A snake!!  Maybe he was guarding it for us!!<br/>

<div>That could be so - but he was having trouble opening the box (and it's so 
hard to stamp and log when you don't have hands, you know...)
