hiding spot.  Problem:  since we last checked on them 10 days ago, <br>
what was a nice little empty nook has been invaded by HUNDREDS of fire <br>
ants--probably washed down there from the rains.  Needless to say, our <br>
dogs were feeling a little uncomfortable and were happy to be moved to <br>
a new, currently ant-less residence not very far away.<br>
<br>
Lesson, one we all keep learning over and over:  amazing how quickly <br>
hiding conditions can change.<br>
<br>
We hid another mystery box this weekend, called The World's Smallest <br>
Letterbox.  Depending on how the placer lists mystery boxes, they may <br>
or may not come up on the LBNA Texas regions.  For this one, to see <br>
the listing, you'd have to click Texas Mystery.<br>
