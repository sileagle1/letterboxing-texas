                    <html><body><table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0"><tr><td valign="top"><div>First off, I want to say I am heartbroken (that's a medical thing) that I missed Barefoot Lucy this weekend. She was this close too. I guess it wasn't meant to be. I think I'm going to go East before the next big step in my life. Oh, yeah, that's why I'm writing. So, what happened was:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went to see the bone marrow transplant specialist team today. My big brother, Ray, RN went with me. They warned us we would be there 3-4 hours, they weren't lying. I think they had us waiting an hour at the begining because they knew we wouldn't need the whole 3 hours.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If Ray or my little brother, Del are a match, then we will be doing the transplant in around a month from now (if all things go as planned). I will be in Baylor downtown Dallas for at least three weeks, then home for about 7 or 8 weeks recuping.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If neither of them match, we could go to the National Bone Marrow Registry. As it looks right now, we won't go that route unless we find someone that is so like me it's scary (think clone). Now, I know how wonderful I am, as y'all do, but let's be honest, I don't think God would make more than one of me. One is enough, ya think?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, I really need y'all to pray for Del or Ray or both to match, cuz if they don't and we don't do a bmt, I have to have 3 more chemo treatments at least. I just don't think they make enough Charmin for that. (Nice run on sentence, huh?) Well, there is that mortality rate that goes down, we should think of that too. It goes up with the bmt. And, with chemo, there are other factors that aren't that great (and we're not talking hair here).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It was a great day though, weird, but great. I have got to get my brother a shirt or really big pin that says, "BROTHER, not husband, ick". We had to put several of them on our ick list for calling him my husband. And, a couple others were smart and hesitated so I could quickly say brother. Some medical professionals have made the mistake when Gary is with me. I guess they figure Ray and I "look" like we belong together (I think I just threw up in my mouth). It's pretty funny, in a really gross sort of way. We love seeing the reactions of the people when we get going. He says I better not fall asleep for too long or he'll pull the plug and I have to be nice to him or he won't give me the blood. The nurses and doctors just look at us to see if we're joking. Very funny stuff. We aint right, go ahead, you can say it.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Oh, and then one of the nurses I work with, she's a peach. I said, "They have to do a psychological evaluation to see if I'm mentally ready to do a bmt, I guess." She says, "No, they want to see if you are crazy. If you are, they probably don't want to prolong your life."  I don't care who you are, that there's funny.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Okay, so that's it. Still haven't gone boxing in a gazillion days, heavy sigh. Maybe this Sunday. Even one would be nice.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Love you all,</div>

Some medical professionals have made the mistake when Gary is with me. I guess they figure Ray and I "look" like we belong together (I think I just threw up in my mouth). It's pretty funny, in a really gross sort of way. We love seeing the reactions of the people when we get going. He says I better not fall asleep for too long or he'll pull the plug and I have to be nice to him or he won't give me the blood. The nurses and doctors just look at us to see if we're joking. Very funny stuff. We aint right, go ahead, you can say it.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Oh, and then one of the nurses I work with, she's a peach. I said, "They have to do a psychological evaluation to see if I'm mentally ready to do a bmt, I guess." She says, "No, they want to see if you are crazy. If you are, they probably don't want to prolong your life." I don't care who you are, that there's funny.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Okay, so that's it. Still haven't gone boxing in a gazillion days, heavy sigh. Maybe this Sunday. Even one would be nice.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Love you all,<br/>
