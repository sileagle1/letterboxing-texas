<br>
Over the weekend I was camping with our Cub Scout pack<br>
and I was working on putting together a box to plant<br>
in the park were we were camping (Ratcliff Lake - to<br>
be posted in the near future).  Our den knows what<br>
letterboxing is about, but for the rest of the boys it<br>
was a whole new show.  I wound up showing them my<br>
personal logbook to look at the stamps I had found.<br>
<br>
They think you make the coolest stamps of anyone they<br>
saw in my book.  I think the all around favorite was<br>
the Hog stamp at Jim Hogg Park in Rusk!  What really<br>
surprised me was that they started seeing similarities<br>
between the ones of yours that I had in my book, and<br>
they could just about pick out who had carved them. <br>
So I wanted to let you know that you are the hip fave<br>
of the Under 12 scouting crowd!<br>
