<br>
Anyhow, I just thought I'd warn you that we are heading down to the Spring/the Woodlands area this weekend and plan to do some letterboxing and geocaching.  I noticed the majority of the letterboxes in the area are at the Mercer Arboretum.  Looks like there are enough there to warrant a visit.  <br>
<br>
If there are any other really good ones we can't miss there (or on the way down I-45 from DFW area) please let us know!  I'm looking forward to getting some new stamps for my book.<br>

So guess I'll have to look over my query again and see which ones are on the way...<br>

I thought all the parking was inside the gates, and they wouldn't lock the gates if there were cars left in the parking lot.  I've been a little late before and they always came looking for me, even took me to my car in a golf cart.  By the way, this time of year the gates aren't locked until 7:00 PM.  Check out the Arboretum, which is across the street from the Botanical Gardens.<br>
