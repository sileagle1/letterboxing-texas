                    <html><body><p>Off to see Lightning in the one-act-play version of A Midsummer Night's Dream in a few minutes.<br/><br/>Fearless Fox sang and danced as a forest ranger in Little Mary Sunshine in October (more than he bargained for when he agreed to play a bit part in the musical), Lightning played Ralph (older Ralph-the narrator character) last weekend in an all-kid version of A Christmas Story, and today he is playing Quince, leader of a band of rustics, in A Midsummer Night's Dream for UIL (I keep reminding him that a certain letterboxer has adopted a certain character from this play as an alter-ego).<br clear="all"/>
<br/>Too late it has occurred to me that I need to be making boxes for these productions, so at least I can get a little boxing in while I follow them around with makeup and costumes.<br/><br/>And next time you see Lightning, ask him to say something in his cockney accent. Hehe...he loves it when people ask him that!<br/>
