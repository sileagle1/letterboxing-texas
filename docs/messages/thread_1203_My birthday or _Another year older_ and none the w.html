me a happy birthday. I had a really good day. My sister came <br/>
yesterday and spent the night, leaving this afternoon. We talked and <br/>
talked and laughed and laughed. <br/>
 And I got good mail today too - a postal letter box, and some <br/>
intriguing mail art. What fun! <br/>

&gt; Happy, happy birthday to you!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those of you who don't have the pleasure of<br/>
&gt; knowing her, she is a wonderful person!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; She was one of the first people to welcome me to<br/>
&gt; letterboxing on the Big List and was the first to join<br/>
&gt; this list besides me.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I think about those first days of boxing, she is<br/>
&gt; one of the people I think of first and fondly!<br/>
