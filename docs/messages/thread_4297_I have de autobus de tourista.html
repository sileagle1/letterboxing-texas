&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and take it to Mexico with me.  On the claim of Texas as a part of old<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mexico, it is justo that it residir en Guadalajara with me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I follow the path of Domingo Teran de los Rios, passing by many letterboxes<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as I go.  I am taking refugio in missions along the way, and will soon be in<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my tierra natal with my tesoro.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Via con Dios Texas and Texans, and to the loco Cajun.  I go laughing.<br/>
