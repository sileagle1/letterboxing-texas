                    <div class="plaintext-content">As the weather began cooling off a few weeks ago, it<br>
was all I could do to NOT go letterboxing - but life<br>
kept getting in the way!  Life threatened again to<br>
interfere this weekend, but we prevailed!<br>
<br>
We got up bright and early yesterday, packed our gear<br>
and grabbed a couple of the boxes we've had stacked up<br>
and waiting to go out for the past couple months.  We<br>
knew we had to be in Rusk at about 2:00, but that gave<br>
us the morning to roam where we wanted, right?<br>
<br>
Before we hit the trails, we stopped by a cub scout<br>
training here in town for what was supposed to be a<br>
quick check to see if they needed anything, and I was<br>
asked to present at the last minute - so there went<br>
the morning (had fun anyway - I LOVE scout trainings -<br>
they are soooo fun!).  We quickly readjusted and<br>
decided we would plant one box, and we would plant it<br>
in the park we had to be at in Rusk before we had to<br>
meet some of our cub scouts.<br>
<br>
The training ran into the afternoon, so we had to<br>
leave early because we had promised some little guys<br>
we would meet them at the Jamboree on the Air in Jim<br>
Hogg State Park and then take them on their first<br>
hike, and we didn't want to let them down.  By then,<br>
we were running very late, but we made it to Rusk in<br>
the nick of time.  Not knowing these boys very well, I<br>
hesitated to plant a box with them in tow, and where I<br>
wanted to plant the box was a little far to take them<br>
anyway, so again we adjusted our plans and decided we<br>
would take the box out to its spot AFTER we finished<br>
with the boys - by then, I was already pretty tired,<br>
but that seemed to be the only solution.<br>
<br>
Well, the boys loved their hike and didn't want to<br>
head back to the trail head - it seems like we looked<br>
at every spider, every bug, every mushroom, and every<br>
tree and tuft of grass - we even accidentally ran<br>
across a baby water moccasin whose back appeared to<br>
have been broken so he couldn't run away. He kept<br>
striking at us (to which we had to tell the boys "Yes,<br>
he's just a baby but he's still VERY poisonous, and<br>
NO, it isn't a good idea to get your face that close<br>
to him!).  We herded the boys along and I went back<br>
and euthanized the snake (I hate to kill any kind of<br>
critter, even poisonous ones!).  It had been quite a<br>
hike by the time we got back to the trail head.  I<br>
love it when these guys get excited about what they<br>
see in the woods, but we had busines to tend to!<br>
<br>
Finally, we sent the boys off with their mamas, who<br>
had stayed at the playground with their younger<br>
children.  We STILL had a box to plant, and I had had<br>
my heart set on boxing a little this weekend ALL week,<br>
and we were in the right place and had the right<br>
stuff, but my shoelace on one shoe had managed to<br>
strip itself so it would no longer stayed tight and<br>
tied.  We looked around the park and saw that the<br>
Jamboree was still going on although the crowd was<br>
very light at the moment, there was somebody set up<br>
with a P.A. system singing gospel music and trying to<br>
gather a crowd, and there were at least three birthday<br>
parties going on - awfully crowded!  Well there was no<br>
way we were going to leave without planting that box!<br>
<br>
We headed back into the woods, this time toward an old<br>
mining area we wanted to plant the box near.  As we<br>
were getting into the area we wanted to plant the box<br>
in, we ran smack dab into one of the birthday parties.<br>
 What man's idea of fun would be taking 18 (yes,<br>
eighteen) 6-year-old boys and girls walking in the<br>
woods BY HIMSELF???  They were about 3/4 mile out too!<br>
 We finally got ourselves clear of the party (and I<br>
could hear a plaintive little voice say "I have to go<br>
to the bathroom! just as their voices faded out of our<br>
hearing).  We started searching out "the spot" when my<br>
husband's cell phone rang - and he had to report to<br>
work to fix a computer problem!  We were determined by<br>
then to find our spot, so we finally got it and I sat<br>
down to write clues and rest my feet (did you know it<br>
is really important to the comfort of your feet for<br>
your shoelaces to work properly???) while my daughter<br>
hid the box.  I like the spot quite a lot myself, and<br>
I hope the directions are right!  I posted it late<br>
last night - it's called Starry, Starry Night and it's<br>
in Cherokee County - and I felt particularly satisfied<br>
to be posting a new box.<br>
<br>
Next weekend, I'm going boxing for real!!!<br>

I sure hope you keep a journal with your stamp logbook, Lucy - this whole<br>
saga is priceless! By the end of your story I was feeling anxious along with<br>
you about getting that box placed!<br>
And personally I'm very glad to have another reason to go to Rusk - by the<br>
time we reached the Hogg place on our last trip we were so rushed we really<br>
didn't get to enjoy wandering through the buildings and grounds.<br>
(I think you need to create a "Shoelace" box - perfect for your slogan!!!)<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">LOL...I guess it IS kind of funny today, but if we had<br>
had to go much longer, I wouldn't have been a happy<br>
camper AT ALL I'm afraid!  <br>
<br>
I did seriously consider taking my shoes off and<br>
hiking barefooted, but I couldn't get that tiny water<br>
moccasin out of my head, right in the middle of the<br>
trail and we would probably not have seen him if he<br>
hadn't been striking!  <br>
<br>
I'm gonna have to think about that "shoelace" box. I<br>
have another place in Jim Hogg that I want to plant<br>
and that might be the perfect box for it. I swear one<br>
of the things that kept running through my head was<br>
"bad enough I have to wear shoes, but for them to be a<br>
PROBLEM too???"<br>
