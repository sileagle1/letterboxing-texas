                    <div class="plaintext-content">i could try to explain why i've been unavailable for so long, but it<br>
is much faster to just apologize profusely for the delay in publishing<br>
the following:<br>
<br>
turn East onto Beltline from 35E (in Carrollton).  after passing under<br>
the back-to-back traffic lights (the intersections with Broadway and<br>
Denton), take the third left turn lane opportunity onto Erie.  turn<br>
right onto Walnut.  park in the smaller parking lot on your right that<br>
is right in front of a small lawn.  park between the two trees closest<br>
to the parking lot.  walk in the direction you parked (South, i<br>
believe) until you come to the other side of a bit of brush on your<br>
left.  there is a fallen log, and there might still be a red rug<br>
leading to the tour bus, which is under the log.<br>
<br>
i planted this three weeks ago before i left the land of unfettered<br>
access to the internet, so i again find myself giving uncertain clues<br>
based on faded memory.  and what with the rusk bash being near at<br>
hand, i will include my cell # for whoever might be having an<br>
unsuccessful hunt--i hope no one needs it!<br>
<br>
i am so sorry for this huge delay!!<br>
