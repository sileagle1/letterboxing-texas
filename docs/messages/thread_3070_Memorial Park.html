October. I think before then, we all need to get together and go to<br>
Mercer,get some of those hard working spiders, and transplant them at<br>
Memorial park. The mosquitoes are horrible!!!<br>
Pack the OFF!!!<br>
On the upside of the day we ran into some boxers and exchanged with<br>
Pastry Princess & Tejas Angel.We chatted a short while. They seem like<br>
really great gals. They are also brave. They were on a marathon<br>
boxin' trip without kids, so they were not going to let a little thing<br>
like mosquitoes slow them down.<br>

It was called "Running Bare".  I was on the purple trail down near where it goes down to Buffalo Bayou and a man ran by me, literally running bare.  As in, nothing on but running shoes  So, wouldn't that be considered illegal?  Should I have called the cops?  He ran on down the trail until he was out of sight (thank goodness) and I never saw him again.  The trails are marked as "closed", but I ignored that and had already seen a lady walking her dog on the red trail.  I don't know if this guy had a plan in case he saw someone, but he basically ignored me and kept on running.  I just thought you should be warned.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My son, Wills World, and I spent a few hours in Memorial Park yesterday.  The park is better than it was the last time I visited.  The part directly behind the softball fields, up to and including the east-west section of the blue trail, is still a shambles of fallen trees and branches and the red trail in that area is mostly nonexistent. Our purpose for being there was to find, if possible, the five boxes which make up the Nada Clue series.  The first box, Colonel Mustard was probably bulldozed into the ground and it would be impossible to replace the box anywhere in that area.  We actually found boxes 2 and 3 by recognizing a couple of landmarks, even though the area is nothing like it once was.  The last time I was there, I actually found box 4, so I knew exactly where it was, but, unfortunately, the multi-trunk tree had been chain-sawed down, even though it is still living, and the box is lost.  Multi trunks are now growing out of the stump.  Also, the area where box 5 was located is a wasteland of tree trunks and mulch. If the box is there, I couldn't find it.   I made the decision to move the entire series to a different part of the park, which will require carving 3 new, but identical stamps and rewriting the clues.  I hope to have that done before the Memorial Park Maintenance Event takes place.  I don't know if I can make that event because it's on Mother's Day weekend and I don't know what plans have been made by the family.  Other than that front area, the park looks good.  There are many trees marked for removal, so you probably shouldn't place a box behind one of those.  There were many bicyclists on the trails, so you have to be constantly attentive to them.  The rains came in the middle of the afternoon, but we made it out before the downpours.  <br>

World, and I spent a few hours in Memorial Park yesterday. The park is better 
than it was the last time I visited. The part directly behind the softball 
fields, up to and including the east-west section of the blue trail, is still a 
shambles of fallen trees and branches and the red trail in that area is mostly 
nonexistent. Our purpose for being there was to find, if possible, the five 
boxes which make up the Nada Clue series. The first box, Colonel Mustard was 
probably bulldozed into the ground and it would be impossible to replace the box 
anywhere in that area. We actually found boxes 2 and 3 by recognizing a couple 
of landmarks, even though the area is nothing like it once was. The last time I 
was there, I actually found box 4, so I knew exactly where it was, but, 
unfortunately, the multi-trunk tree had been chain-sawed down, even though it is 
still living, and the box is lost. Multi trunks are now growing out of the 
stump. Also, the area where box 5 was located is a wasteland of tree trunks and 
mulch. If the box is there, I couldn't find it. I made the decision to move the 
entire series to a different part of the park, which will require carving 3 new, 
but identical stamps and rewriting the clues. I hope to have that done before 
the Memorial Park Maintenance Event takes place. I don't know if I can make that 
event because it's on Mother's Day weekend and I don't know what plans have been 
made by the family. Other than that front area, the park looks good. There are 
many trees marked for removal, so you probably shouldn't place a box behind one 
of those. There were many bicyclists on the trails, so you have to be constantly 
attentive to them. The rains came in the middle of the afternoon, but we made it 
out before the downpours. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt;

                    <html><body><p>I am planning to go back Wednesday to place the box contents.  I actually placed empty boxes last Saturday and wrote the clues.  Now I've carved new stamps and made logbooks and I'm making another trip to place them in the boxes and test the clue directions.  I hope they work or I may have to make a third trip.  There's too many things that can go wrong with a series like this that requires maintenance.  If a box goes missing, the series doesn't work.  And I hate to retire it because of the AQ purple star, so made the decision to keep it going this time.  One more time may mean retirement, so be sure to close the bags securely and recover well! ;) Since the big rain last weekend, I'll be able to see how safe the locations are.</p><div><br/></div><div>Boots Tex</div><div><br/>--- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, Bonnie Lind  wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Hooray!

Really, no matter where you place a box, it still may not be safe from the bulldozers and chain saws in the future. As you said, this is probably going to be a long-term project. I got the 3 stamps carved today, so I'm ahead of schedule.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; --- In mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com, "sileagle1" sileagle@ wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Sorry to hear you lost most boxes from that series, but glad you will replace it. Hopefully it will be just a challenging as the original. Of course, the challenging thing for you will be where to hide them. When I re-hid my Bananagrams box it was very difficult to find a good spot with living trees or bushes not too close to the water or other low spots. I suspect it will be like Bastrop SP in that regard for quite a while.
