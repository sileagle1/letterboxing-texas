The point I'm making is that Letterboxing overall has a minimal effect on the parks, compaired to natural events or other park sponsored events.  I will agree that some boxes have been put in areas of historic value, and probably should be moved to a less sensitive area in that park, but most are in the woods, only yards off a trail, hidden behind a tree under a pile of sticks or rocks.  I don't think this is a major Enviromental issue, and we should stop placing boxes.   Common sense and ethics should be your guide.   If we find a box that crosses the line, then let's discuss that box, not Letterboxing as a whole.   <br/>
<br/>
Basically, I hope no one is offended by my comment, and I'm sure this topic has caused more harm than good.   Now back to actually doing letterboxing!!!<br/>

When I lived in Connecticut, our house was located on the side of a steep mountain; it was across the road from a state forest and at the bottom of our property was the Housatonic River where I kept my canoe. Every day when I'd hike down to my canoe, I cross over at least five deer trails (I guess they didn't they know they were on my private property?) Often, I'd have to climb over or find my way around some huge fallen tree that Mother Nature had inconsideratly decided to bring down over my path. She also decided my property would be a good place for her to plant her big old blackberry thicket, which often drew blood as I passed by (as well as providing a great treat in my breakfast bowl during the summer). Obviously Mother N didn't realize that was private property either. I was usually generous enough to share my property with the wildlife (deer, fox, Mother N, etc) until they bit the flowers off all the plants in my gardens. So here's what I did (under the advice of my local garden shop): I hung those singing fish plaques on trees around my gardens and when the deer would wander by, the fish would start wiggling and singing and Bambi would fly over the fence. So.... maybe instead of playing the role of "superior big brother", this group who thinks they're qualified to decide if a letterbox or geocache is worthy of being in their woods... maybe they should just hang singing fish around the woods whenever they discover a letterbox and try to scare the letterboxers off. Just sayin....<br/>
