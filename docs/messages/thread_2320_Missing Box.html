had two reports that my box, Flowers, Leaves, Birds, and Trees has <br>
gone missing at the Dallas Arboretum.I will try to replace it after <br>
the holidays. It was placed Sept. of 2005,so  it lasted a long time <br>
considering it was in a high traffic area. I hate that I don't have <br>
the log book :(<br>
