                    <html><body><div>I've got a geocities homepage I play around with some.  It's a bit of a pain in the neck, especially since I am inclined to chase down rabbit trails, but it serves some purposes.  If I want a particular layout or to use graphics, it works out fine.  If I want to post WOM clues online without them being visible to anyone, I can do that too, and make it so the page is hidden unless I shoot someone the link.
</div>

<div>I tried a blog awhile ago.  It's more of an online diary - more intended for text and random pictures.  I think it would be great for posting clues.  I'm going to try it again on blogspot.  We'll see.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'd love to know what others' experiences are with blogging vs having a homepage.<br clear="all"/></div>
<div>I'm thinking in terms mainly of posting clues.  But also, I guess, sitreps and other interesting information.</div>
