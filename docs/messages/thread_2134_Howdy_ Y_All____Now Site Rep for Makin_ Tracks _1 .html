now and then, especially when travelling (we are trying to get a <br/>
geocache in each state we travel through and micros are handy then), <br/>
and a local geocacher just put out 50 micros in my town in about 6 <br/>
weeks!  Ok, so what is so unique about the 5 postal boxes he put them <br/>
on? Or the Utility Boxes or road posts? Also, some of them appear to <br/>
be on private property (and I know some of them are...) and I really <br/>
doubt he got permission to hide those.. one of them I know for sure <br/>
that he didn't... but that is a different story.  Yes, we have found <br/>
3 of them... but I don't really intend to look for the others, even <br/>
though it would greatly increase our count.<br/>
<br/>
Enough of that rant...  sorry....  Micros do have their place, but I <br/>
just don't see a need for 50 basically identical micros on lampposts <br/>
or utility boxes in a 10 mile radius...<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, we have enjoyed bringing people to a park they might not have <br/>
known about, a pretty trail, and things like that...  we like to see <br/>
our numbers increase, but I want to have each of those numbers <br/>
represent something..  that is what geocaching seemed to be about <br/>
when we first started (January 2002), and that is what we try to do <br/>
when we geocache.<br/>
<br/>
If you get over to central Texas (Georgetown, especially) we can show <br/>
you some really fun geocaches, and hopefully our letterboxes will <br/>
stand up to the established standards... we sure will try, anyway.<br/>
