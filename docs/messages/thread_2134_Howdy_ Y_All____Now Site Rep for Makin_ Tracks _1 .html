<p>Well, we have 3 more in the works... I don't know how long until we <br/>can get them set, but hopefully by next weekend. Jim is the one with <br/>the creative streak.. he likes making them intriguing. We've had <br/>lots of practice with geocaching on making neat containers, etc. 
<br/>We had the same problem with #1, but I liked the location of <br/>the "den" ... I walk that trail frequently, and will keep an eye on <br/>it. Thanks for the comments... we are always open to some <br/>constructive criticism... that is how we learn!
<br/><br/>We've found most of the boxes in Georgetown, but there are still a <br/>few more to get (Berry Springs Park, mostly). Georgetown could use <br/>more boxes, though. That's ok... we can have fun planting more for <br/>
other folks to find.<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com</a>, Brandi J Rider &lt;brandi@...&gt;

<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My son and I went today and found both boxes. We are so <br/>impressed with your first carvings! And what a beautiful park...I <br/>live in Georgetown and never even knew that park was there! We <br/>especially liked the trail signs...like the one that points to GT

<br/>intensive than your method and your way works, too. As I said...I <br/>walked right past Makin' Tracks #2 SEVERAL times! LOL!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Welcome again to letterboxing and glad to see you found our <br/>little group!

I pretty much only go geocaching with a certain letterboxing pal,<br>
mainly so I am not out there looking foolish walking in circles by<br>
myself.  We have seen some really creative and amazing hides by<br>
geocachers.  I'm not a fan of the mushrooming micro-geocaches<br>
seemingly randomly dropped by the side of the road (or worse, way in<br>
the woods), but I really appreciate those gcers who go to some effort<br>
to provide scratch-your-head?-oh-doh!-right-there! entertainment.  In<br>
letterboxing and in geocaching, I like a thoughtful placement (and<br>
that can mean lots of things).<br>
<br>
So welcome to our little game.  I'm glad to see you're joining right in!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We aren't fans of the urban micros, either... I don't mind a couple <br>
now and then, especially when travelling (we are trying to get a <br>
geocache in each state we travel through and micros are handy then), <br>
and a local geocacher just put out 50 micros in my town in about 6 <br>
weeks!  Ok, so what is so unique about the 5 postal boxes he put them <br>
on? Or the Utility Boxes or road posts? Also, some of them appear to <br>
be on private property (and I know some of them are...) and I really <br>
doubt he got permission to hide those.. one of them I know for sure <br>
that he didn't... but that is a different story.  Yes, we have found <br>
3 of them... but I don't really intend to look for the others, even <br>
though it would greatly increase our count.<br>
<br>
Enough of that rant...  sorry....  Micros do have their place, but I <br>
just don't see a need for 50 basically identical micros on lampposts <br>
or utility boxes in a 10 mile radius...<br>
<br>
Anyway, we have enjoyed bringing people to a park they might not have <br>
known about, a pretty trail, and things like that...  we like to see <br>
our numbers increase, but I want to have each of those numbers <br>
represent something..  that is what geocaching seemed to be about <br>
when we first started (January 2002), and that is what we try to do <br>
when we geocache.<br>
<br>
If you get over to central Texas (Georgetown, especially) we can show <br>
you some really fun geocaches, and hopefully our letterboxes will <br>
stand up to the established standards... we sure will try, anyway.<br>
