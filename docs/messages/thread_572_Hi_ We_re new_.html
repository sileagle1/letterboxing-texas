Hi everybody. Our family is pretty new to letterboxing (just started <br/>
in October). We live in the Houston area. We're the Sol Horizons and <br/>
Lil Rowdy Ruff Boy. Last weekend we were out letterboxing at <br/>
Challenger 7 Park in Webster when we met the Kissing Fishies, <br/>
looking for the same box we were. What fun! They told us about this <br/>
group and also said there's an event coming up in March.....we'd <br/>
very much like more info on this, please. Also, to the Kissing <br/>
Fishies...had a great time with you searching for all the boxes. <br/>
Thanks so much!<br/>
<br/>
