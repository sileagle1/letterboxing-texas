I am also very pleased with the mix of new Houston & Texas boxers and<br>

So, for those of you coming from afar, would you like to see a Friday<br>
night dinner or ice cream social or a Sunday breakfast added onto the<br>
event?  <br>
Are you coming for the day or spending Friday and/or Saturday night?<br>
Would you like the opportunity to box elsewhere around Houston or do<br>
you prefer to stay in the general area of the gathering?  <br>

However, my husband is finally retiring from his job in Connecticut the end of October and I have to go up there and pack the stuff in our apartment and get it ready to move.... AND my daughter is having a baby which is due the middle of October in Dallas!!!! (They're all so inconsiderate - don't they know I want to go to Houston?) But seriously, I am in a wait and see mode right now, but I'm keeping a glimmer of hope that I'll be able to attend.</font></div>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to plan to make a weekend of it.  No sense in going that distance for one day and not stay two.  I think my preference would be to have a Friday evening get together.  I know I really enjoyed eating fish at Big Bertha's on Friday before the last gathering and I think it got us all in the right frame of mind the next day.  HOWEVER, my crew will be good to go no matter how the votes fall!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm hoping that my sis-in-law, TX Flutterby, will come along, and possibly bring her bunch (which would be 4).  Her husband, my LSS's brother, is an LSS too - conscientious about humoring her, but not necessarily enthusiastic, so we'll see!  Are there biking trails in or around Tomball?  That may be what will convince them that they want to tag along.  Except that my LSS, Fearless Fox, has a recent biking story that involves the Cliff of Death and a battle of wits with the Geico squirrel.  Letterboxing may look pretty good to him compared to biking...
