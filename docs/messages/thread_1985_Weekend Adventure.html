                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi everyone, Texas Gal here.  Thought I would share my letterboxing <br/>
experience with you.  Crazy bout Dragons and I went to Dallas last <br/>
weekend to celebrate her 14th birthday with her adult brother.  We <br/>
had plans to hit the Cheesecake Factory, the Dallas World Aquarium <br/>
and the Dallas Zoo.  I had hopes of getting some boxing in as well.  <br/>
<br/>
We arrived early afternoon on Friday and after discussing plans with <br/>
both kids, we went to LBNA to see what options were available.  I had <br/>
previously looked but it sure is nicer to have someone that is <br/>
familiar with the area be able to look at the directions and plot out <br/>
the best course of action.  I also had to explain the whole <br/>
letterboxing activity to my son.  Since his printer was on the fritz <br/>
it was off to the closest library to print out clues.  Since we <br/>
planned on trying for several boxes all weekend long, we printed all <br/>
of them out at that time.  It was time to start hunting!!!<br/>
<br/>
Our first box was the "flowers, leaves. birds, &amp; trees" at the Dallas <br/>
Botanical Gardens.  This was a great box and we really enjoyed the <br/>
part of the Gardens that we visited.  Since we were on a mission the <br/>
Gardens would have to be seen at a later date.<br/>
<br/>
Our next box was the "Lady in the Lake" at White Rock Lake.  Really <br/>
nice lake in the middle of a big city.  Great find. And had a lock &amp; <br/>
lock box so I figured we would be able to find this type of box in <br/>
the area.  At this point the adult son decided that letterboxing was <br/>
too cool and off to Hobby Lobby to get carving supplies and a log <br/>
book.<br/>
<br/>
After the birthday celebration at the Cheesecake Factory it was back <br/>
to the house to start carving.  My son decided his trail name would <br/>
be "Flaming Bamboo" and he carved his signature stamp and since we <br/>
were going to the Aquarium the next day, I decided to carve a <br/>
seahorse and place a box (clues to follow).<br/>
<br/>
Saturday morning I was eager to get started before it got too warm.  <br/>
I did have to prod a little but not near as much as normal to get the <br/>
kids going.  It was decided we would find two more boxes before going <br/>
to the aquarium.  We set off to find "Mustang Mania" and "Bach's <br/>
Box".  Loved the clues for both of these boxes and it gave us a <br/>
chance to discuss college options to a up and coming high school <br/>
freshman.  <br/>
<br/>
Next we were off to the Aquarium.  My son took us to the Dallas <br/>
Aquarium at Fair Park which is not the same thing as the Dallas World <br/>
Aquarium but since we were there anyway we went ahead and went <br/>
through the exhibits.  It was pointed out to me that this aquarium <br/>
has the "seahorse  rodeo" so we decided to plant my "seahorse" box at <br/>
this site.  Clues to follow shortly.<br/>
<br/>
Next we headed to the Dallas World Aquarium and I have to say that it <br/>
is an awesome place to visit but very busy and therefore not a good <br/>
place to plant a box, so planting it at the other location proved to <br/>
be wise.  Someone was guiding us.  <br/>
<br/>
Sunday Morning found us on the road after two more boxes.  "A league <br/>
of their own #4" and "Duncanville Dragonfly" .  "A league of their <br/>
own" is a series and a second trip must be planned to find the rest <br/>
of this series.  I made my son to promise to wait for us but I have a <br/>
feeling he may not, he has been bitten bad by the "box bug".  Next we <br/>
went to "Duncanville Dragonfly"  were we found not only the dragonfly <br/>
but a hitch hiker, "Sellin Mellon".  I felt quite proud that we had <br/>
done 6 boxes in 3 days with a hitch hiker.  Not a personal best or <br/>
anywhere near most of you other boxers but not bad considering I was <br/>
dragging along a teenager and an adult son.  We then went to the <br/>
Dallas Zoo and that night crashed.<br/>
<br/>
The "Sellin Mellon" hitch hiker will be placed by this Sunday, and <br/>
who  knows what other boxes we will find in the process.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>That sounds like a GREAT trip!  I've only made one trip into Dallas - last Thanksgiving with my daughter who was at that time recovering from a car accident - but it certainly made me want to go back!  Unfortunately, I haven't been able to get back to box, even with the same daughter now living in Denton.  Maybe I'll make that a Thanksgiving tradition...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I never seem to be able to get nearly as many boxes as I want to get, or as many as everyone else seems to be able to get.  I know I'm bad about getting sidetracked, and for the longest time I felt pressured to knock some boxes out on a boxing weekend, but I finally realized that what I get is all I'm gonna get, which is fine if I enjoy my time out.  Much better to go for quality of experience rather than quantity, although sometimes quantity is just fun.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm still trying to figure out how to make a livelihood of boxing so I can quit my infernal job that gets in the way by taking up so much of my time!</div>
