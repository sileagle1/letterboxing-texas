                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi, everyone.  I'm new(ish) to the list and wanted to introduce <br>
myself.  I started Letterboxing back in April after the NPR story, <br>
but had a long haitus where the weather wouldn't cooperate with my <br>
days off and, when it did, my free time was spoken for.<br>
<br>
I'm Gingercat and I live in Austin.  I've gotten my husband, my <br>
mother, my brother and his fiance interested in the hobby as well.  <br>
This past weekend, in honor of my brother's birthday, we went <br>
letterboxing in Bastrop.<br>
What a goldmine!<br>
I just wanted to let everyone know that we found:<br>
Trail Rider<br>
Skinny Pine (with Hitch Hiker, Roarin' Roadster, I'll plant next <br>
outing...Austin area?)<br>
Cool Cat<br>
Knots #1<br>
Poison Ivy<br>
Lost Loblolly<br>
Houston Toad<br>
Lone Star Letterboxers<br>
<br>
We had a wonderful time and the weather, although a bit muggy, was <br>
peachie.<br>
<br>
Thanks for making Bastrop State Park such a letterbox wonderland, <br>
everyone!<br>

I would like to take this moment to ask anyone on the<br>
list who hasn't yet posted an intro to go ahead and<br>
let us all know a little about yourself.  Even if you<br>
don't plan on ever posting again, it's nice to know<br>
who is lurking here!<br>
<br>
And if any of our older members care to update the<br>
list on what's going on with them, go right ahead!!!<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

<div>Howdy, long time no speak! After pretty much taking the last year and 9 months off from boxing the kids and I are ready to get back to it. The only thing weve done is the event in Jacksonville, but now that the baby is a year old we think she and I can better handle things. First thing we are going to work on is either replacing the boxes we have here that have gone missingÂ if possible and/or plant some others. We have all really missed getting out and doing this, especially the kids. One of them told me it takes poohdaddling (which they all love to do) to the extreme lol Anyway, hope you are all doing well, and have a safe, fun filled time at the TALE!</div>
