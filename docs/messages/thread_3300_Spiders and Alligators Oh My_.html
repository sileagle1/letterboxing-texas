rip stick (skateboard), 4 kids and a baby all bundled up.<br>
<br>
Well we went to Lake Tawakoni today.  Found a fairy working hard. A <br>
beautiful stamp made by Lucy Locket. Then we went for a hike along <br>
another nature trial.  Read the clues to the kids about Shelob's <br>
Lair.  A couple of hoodies were thrown over heads, a couple of kids <br>
said "no way, I'm not going down there".  Well we made them go "down <br>
there" and we made them go first.  If the baby can go in the <br>
stroller, so can the rest of them.  Not that the baby had a choice in <br>
the matter. :)<br>
<br>
After walking for a few minutes the kids took off ahead of us.  <br>
Apparently the thought of spiders had disappeared from their little <br>
brains.  Thank goodness for winter, I didn't want to see them <br>
either.  Found the spider in its hiding spot. Thanks Whistler' <br>
Mother.  <br>
<br>
Since we made it out without any problems, tomorrow we are going <br>
searching for a mouse. I hear he is hiding in a pocket.  I wonder if <br>
the Alligators are sleeping now. Gus.here we come.<br>
