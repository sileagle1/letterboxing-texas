I would love to hear more about your experiences in the<br>
birthplace of letterboxing.  Did you find Cranmere Pool,<br>
the first letterbox?  How did you get clues to letterboxes<br>
in Dartmore without help?  Were the letterboxes better,<br>
harder to find, etc?  I envy you getting to go there and<br>
hope to go there myself some day.<br>

We tried both. The gps way was with a group of locals who had the map on their gps and the grid coordinates for the boxes. Just plug them in and go. The scavenging way is just to go out there and dig around on the tors. Each had their merit. The gps was much more productive AND was necessary when the mist came in and you couldn't see any of the landscape to know where you where. The people we were with were pretty serious letterboxers - like F5000+ and such. We felt like complete rookies - and we were in that environment. If you've ever read a clue to a Dartmoor box, they work off of compass readings - like 30deg TV mast, 245deg such such tor, etc. I found that really hard. (I have the Spring book of clues by the way.) Mostly because we weren't sure what tor was what. It's not like there's a big sign or anything. It's all map and compass. Anyway, we tried both ways and had a great time. Rain, cold, mist, walking through the sheep and ponies, and more 'poo' than you'd ever want to see. We walked miles and on the day that was nice and no rain, the landscape was really lovely. We learned so much, but really, when it can down to it, we all do it the same way. Lots of the people we saw stamped on cards/sheets of paper instead of a book. I had my book and it got really wet, but it survived. They do carry a lot of gear though - since they're out there and any type of weather could come in - backpack, clothes, food, compasses, rain gear, etc. It was like a hiking expedition. :)<div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>We didn't have time to go to Cranmere. It is out and away from the more 'populous' areas and on the firing range, so we left it for another time. The stamps are all commercially made. Didn't see any hand-carved ones. They use pill containers - like we would get from the drug store - mostly a smaller one inside a bigger one. Little memo pads for the logbooks.</div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>I think that about sums it up.<div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div>TeamKing</div><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/><div><br class="khtml-block-placeholder"/></div><div><br/><div><div>On Aug 29, 2005, at 7:38 PM, Silver Eagle wrote:</div><br class="Apple-interchange-newline"/><blockquote type="cite"> <tt> Congratulations on such a productive first letterboxing year!<br/> I would love to hear more about your experiences in the<br/> birthplace of letterboxing.
