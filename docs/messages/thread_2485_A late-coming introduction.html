                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br/>
<br/>
Finally I am making some time to introduce myself to the group. Sorry<br/>
for taking so long. (I'm the friend Barefoot Lucy mentioned in a post<br/>
earlier last week.)<br/>
<br/>
I live in Fort Worth (moved here from East Texas about 8 months ago),<br/>
and I have been fascinated by letterboxing for a long time -- even<br/>
before I wrote the article about BL's family and their letterboxing.<br/>
Finally, I'm working a job that allows me some free time in an area<br/>
full of boxes -- and I've been looking for a new hobby that will get<br/>
me out and about, and is something I can occasionally take my dog,<br/>
Molly, with me. (She and I could both use the fresh air and some walks.)<br/>
<br/>
So, I've stocked up on some stamp-carving supplies (gotta love Hobby<br/>
Lobby) and I have a personal stamp design in mind -- I just need to<br/>
make it a reality now. <br/>
<br/>
I'm looking forward to my first LB adventure, and I will be sure to<br/>
let everyone know when it finally happens =) (I have yet to go hunting<br/>
for boxes, but I was very fortunate to share the experience of<br/>
planting a box with BL and her family.) I'm also looking forward to<br/>
planting some in my area as well as areas where family and friends<br/>
live. (I'm fortunate to have my mom in East Texas, my dad on the Gulf<br/>
Coast near Beaumont, and my best lifelong friend in Brazoria County --<br/>
I'm going to LB all over Texas!)<br/>
<br/>
So, hello from Cowtown, and I not only look forward to sharing<br/>
experiences with you all, but I also look forward to learning from<br/>
you, too.<br/>
<br/>
Have a great one,<br/>

plunge.  You live in a box-rich area (though East TX has a lot now, <br/>
too) with many nice places to visit, so you should have plenty of <br/>
opportunity to get out and about.  If you want to meet other <br/>
letterboxers, be sure to sign up on Atlas Quest for the TX Wildflower <br/>
LB Event to be held on March 3 at Lake Somerville.  Have fun!<br/>

<div>The Lost Player was on our list to find last Friday, but we ran out of daylight. Now it's on the top of our list for our next outing. I hope this nice weather lasts awhile in North Texas, but it looks like things may get ugly this weekend.

<span>&lt;blush&gt;Thank you so much Ms. B.  You are so sweet!  I’ll let you know about Stretch tomorrow evening.<br/>
<br/>
And welcome to North Texas, News Girl.  We are blessed to have such a talented and devoted group of boxers here in the area.  One of my biggest fears is that we’ll end up having to move and I’ll end up in some place without boxes or boxers.  The boxing community here is incredible!  Glad to have another!  Yay!<br/>

I'm also looking forward to<br/>planting some in my area as well as areas where family and friends<br/>live. (I'm fortunate to have my mom in East Texas, my dad on the Gulf<br/>Coast near Beaumont, and my best lifelong
 friend in Brazoria County --<br/>I'm going to LB all over Texas!)<br/><br/>So, hello from Cowtown, and I not only look forward to sharing<br/>experiences with you all, but I also look forward to learning from<br/>you, too.<br/><br/>Have a great one,<br/>News Girl =)<br/><br/></div></div><!--End group email --></blockquote><br/><p> __________________________________________________<br/>Do You Yahoo!?<br/>Tired of spam?
