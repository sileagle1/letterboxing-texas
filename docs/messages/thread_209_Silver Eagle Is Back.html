to do a little letterboxing in between wine tasting, dude<br>
ranching and setting off fireworks.  I ended up finding 18<br>
boxes and placing 4 new ones, and also replaced my Stevie<br>
Ray microbox.  The only 2 boxes I did not get that I tried <br>
for was Baby Bear's Park Ranger in Kerrville SP (road was<br>
closed for construction), and Corazon's Bear With Me in New<br>
Berlin (not smart enough to figure it out).  I found 2 HH<br>
in 2 different boxes, but I had already found both before<br>
so I left them for somebody else to find.  It was a fun<br>
trip and I envy those of you who live in that area of Texas.  <br>
Thanks to all who planted boxes to make my trip even better!<br>
