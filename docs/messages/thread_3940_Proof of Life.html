Certain people simply refuse to believe that JBK and I are two different<br>
people.  I helped JBK with part 2 of her Jacksonville cemetery project a<br>
while back, and I asked her to take a few pictures of me to prove to you<br>
that I do indeed exist in my own being.  Those pics have been uploaded on<br>
the Texas board.<br>
<br>
I've also uploaded our travelogues from the first two years; thought I'd<br>
done it before, but apparently not!<br>

Love you all,<br>
