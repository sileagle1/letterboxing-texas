<div>  Thanks for 
sharing your trip VF, that is a strikingly beautiful place, and I loved reading 
about it!  Daddy of Five and I went there for our 10th anniversary, and 
hiked the South Rim in Big Bend in one day...I was 6 months pregnant with #5, 
and it is a very long hike.  The next day we got up early and hiked out to 
the Window...but my legs started to ache when you said it was a "short" 
hike!  I had overdone it the day before...and my legs were just 
burning on the way back up from the window.   The best trip I've ever 
taken in my life, can't wait to go back.  And the Marfa Lights...so 
cool.  MO5 </div></body></html>
