With timeoneous off in Deer Park for a debate tournament I ventured to<br>
Georgetown Saturday.<br>
<br>
Explored Inner Space Cavern and Berry Springs Park. Found several nice<br>
stamps.. 2 nicely carved by Quatzel.  Berry Springs Park was a<br>
particularly nice setting on an historic farm compound with an old pecan<br>
grove. One lovely Lone Star Quilter stamp was particularly colorful and<br>
the Berry Buzy Beaver Letterbox path has been "connected,"  this was a<br>
nice short hike on a fairly warm day.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately I could not get near Blue Hole Park.  It was closed up<br>
tight due to flooding according to a posting on the Internet on July<br>
10th.  There are at least 5 boxes being held captive in there!!!  If<br>
anyone knows when it is scheduled to reopen I would appreciate it if you<br>
would let me know.<br>
<br>
I also went to Florence for the second time to find the passport series<br>
box.  I found the Florence Cemetery but not on Second and Preslar and I<br>
did not find the stump clues talked about.  Found a Maggie Gardner, but<br>
not a Margaret.  Found the very nice Holland box earlier this year and<br>
thought I would pursue the Athens at the Fishin 4 Boxes Event on Sept<br>
22.  I want the special stamp for finding them all, so I am not giving up.<br>
