You shoulda put the disclaimer at the TOP of the post,<br>
because now you're gonna get an answer whether you<br>
want one or not!<br>
<br>
Last year, several boxes got planted that weekend. <br>
The placers put the clues out for the rest of us to<br>
write down for ourselves, or they managed to have some<br>
slips of paper with the clues copied.  I guess it<br>
depends on the timing of placing the box-you may have<br>
time to make full copies, or you may want to just let<br>
everyone copy them for themselves.  I would say that<br>
if you want them to be found first at the gathering,<br>
you should write up the clues but not post them to the<br>
website until after the event.<br>
<br>
I'll bet you put a lot of thought intohiding Easter<br>
eggs too, don't you???  Hmmmm?<br>
<br>
