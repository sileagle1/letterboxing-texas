You shoulda put the disclaimer at the TOP of the post,<br/>
because now you're gonna get an answer whether you<br/>
want one or not!<br/>
<br/>
Last year, several boxes got planted that weekend. <br/>
The placers put the clues out for the rest of us to<br/>
write down for ourselves, or they managed to have some<br/>
slips of paper with the clues copied.  I guess it<br/>
depends on the timing of placing the box-you may have<br/>
time to make full copies, or you may want to just let<br/>
everyone copy them for themselves.  I would say that<br/>
if you want them to be found first at the gathering,<br/>
you should write up the clues but not post them to the<br/>
website until after the event.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet you put a lot of thought intohiding Easter<br/>
eggs too, don't you???  Hmmmm?<br/>

&gt; Either date is fine with me.  It's easy to take a<br/>
&gt; few days of from <br/>
&gt; work that time of the year.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Are we going to just hang out, box and drink beer,<br/>
&gt; or is there a <br/>
&gt; schedule of events?  Just curious.  I want to look<br/>
&gt; like I know what <br/>
&gt; I'm doing when I get there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Also, I don't know how this usually works, but I was<br/>
&gt; planning on <br/>
&gt; hiding a box or two in the park way before the event<br/>
&gt; takes place.  <br/>
&gt; Should I not post the clues until a few days before<br/>
&gt; that weekend?  <br/>
&gt; That way others won't be tempted to go find it if<br/>
&gt; they also do an <br/>
&gt; early plant, leaving them a few to find during the<br/>
&gt; event.  Or should <br/>
&gt; I go ahead and post and leave it up to them if they<br/>
&gt; want to get it <br/>
&gt; or not?  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After I wrote that down, I think I'll just leave it<br/>
&gt; up to them. <br/>

&gt; &gt; Not sure about everyone else, but we usually go on<br/>
&gt; vacation<br/>
&gt; &gt; during Spring Break, so that would be a bad time<br/>
&gt; for me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; This year our Break is March 5-12, so those 2<br/>
&gt; weekends are<br/>
&gt; &gt; out for me.  If we go too far in March we will<br/>
&gt; start getting<br/>
&gt; &gt; into kids sports.  That leaves March 19 or<br/>
&gt; February 26.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I checked camping availability at the park on<br/>
&gt; those dates<br/>
&gt; &gt; and Feb. 26 is the best (70 sites available). <br/>
&gt; There are<br/>
&gt; &gt; 2 covered picnic areas in the park that each hold<br/>
&gt; up to<br/>
&gt; &gt; 75 people, so that should work for us.  I could<br/>
&gt; not see<br/>
&gt; &gt; availability online so once we pick a date I will<br/>
&gt; call to<br/>
&gt; &gt; check it out and reserve if possible.  At this<br/>
&gt; point, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; recommend Feb. 26.  What do you think?<br/>
