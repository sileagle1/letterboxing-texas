Hello East Texas Lbers!  We had a great time finding boxes in January<br/>
something we usually can't do back here in Kingston, Ontario<br/>
Canada.  <br/>
Here is a summary of what we found from Jan 11 to 19th:<br/>
All 5 boxes at the Mercer Arboretum!  Yippee!!  Highstepping HH as<br/>
well.<br/>
Tomball  found Opossum, Funny Bunny, Bear Contry, Mr. LadyBug,<br/>
Frog's Life and The Hunter<br/>
Livingston State PK  box is missing, its hidey hole has been<br/>
boarded up.<br/>
Huntsville State Pk  Raven, Red Dragon -did not find either box<br/>
despite a thorough search.  Clues were clear and we did find the<br/>
locations described, could someone be taking the boxes?  Red Dragon<br/>
may be buried in the stump as it is really mushy and we didn't<br/>
want to knock it apart.  We left a box nearby and will post some<br/>
cryptic clues soon.<br/>
Huntsville  found Steambost Sam very cool place!<br/>
Bastrop State Park  boy those trails are confusing!  Lots of lost<br/>
souls wandering around so we didn't feel too bad.  We found Cool<br/>
Cat and Trail Rider. Skinny Pine has vanished.<br/>
Martin Dies State PK  found Can U Canoe, Day Hiker and Squirrelly<br/>
Camper.  The 6 foot stump described in Squirrelly camper is now a 6<br/>
foot log!  Took us awhile to figure this out.<br/>
Montgomery  found Ancient Sun Dancer and Dragonfly.  Did not<br/>
locate Lone Star Hiker, stump described is crumbling.  Could the hiker<br/>
be in there?<br/>
Washington on the Brazos  Found Texas Flag, Texas Birth.  Texas<br/>
Flag box was filled with green slimey water, we dried it out as best<br/>
we could.  Left box upside down so water could drain out.  It will<br/>
likely need a new logbook. Couldn't find DrooP's  Washington<br/>
on the<br/>
Brazos but we may not have found the right tree.<br/>
We also placed a box in Newton at Caney Creek Park and will post clues<br/>
soon.  <br/>
Many Thanks for the wonderful time, we found 22 boxes and even took my<br/>
82 year old Mother- in- law on some of the hikes!<br/>
Happy Trails to you.....<br/>
Norasta, Guitarzan and Guitarzan's Mom<br/>
