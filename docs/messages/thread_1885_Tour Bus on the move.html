<div>"You may all go to 
hell, and I will go to Texas."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>That is what Davy 
Crockett said before he left Tennessee to come to Texas, and he said it again 
just before he hopped on the Texas Tour Bus (I heard him!)  I know Davy is 
not a Native Texan, but neither am I, and I thought he should join the trip to 
represent those Texans who were not born here, but love it just the 
same.</div>

<div>The Bus is stopped at 
Burroughs park in Tomball.   To reach the 
park go east on 2920 from Tomball to Huffsmith-Kohrville road and turn left. Go 
1.7 miles to West Huffsmith road and turn right. Go 1.3 miles to the park 
entrance on the left. Turn in and stay on the main road to the back of the park 
(passing the lake). At the end, circle around the loop and park near the trail 
sign on the right (opposite the playground area.) <br/>TO THE 
BOX:</div>
<div>Start at the trail 
sign.  With the sign to your back start your journey on the crushed granite 
path into the woods, passing the volleyball court on your right.  After 
about 310 steps you will arrive at a sandy trail on your right (it is the first 
trail off the main trail.)  Take it for 45 steps.  Stop and look to 
your left, you should see 2 large pines side by side 22 steps off the 
trail.  Walk to the pine on the right, the bus is hidden behind it under 
sticks and pine needles.  Have Fun!  Oh, and bring a BIG backpack...it 
is a very large box!  MO5</div></body></html>
