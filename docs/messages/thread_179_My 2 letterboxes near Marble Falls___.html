reported to me as missing, today. :( But there was a HH in it's own <br/>
box where one of the LBs was supposed to be, so at least the person <br/>
reporting, did get something for their effort. If you do go by there <br/>
anyway, could you check again for me? <br/>

Thanks, <br/>

--- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, "Silver Eagle" &gt; My family <br/>
and I are heading to Austin area in a couple of weeks<br/>
&gt; and hope to find your Marble Falls boxes.  Now we have another<br/>
&gt; reason to go there since I love blackberries, though I'm used<br/>
&gt; to picking them free near my house.  Thanks for the tip about<br/>
&gt; Sweetberry Farm, Lou.<br/>
