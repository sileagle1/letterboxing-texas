James left at 2330 local time Thursday night.  He arrived at Ft. Hood /<br>
Killeen TX. Before noon today.<br>
<br>
Hope you all make him feel welcome, and enjoy his company.  He will be<br>
missed here - the only person that can hang with me on a hike.<br>
<br>
Speaking of which.....  I have an after-action report to post for Hueco<br>
Tanks #2.  James accompanied me on the quest.  I just need to publish the<br>
slide show and add the PHOTOS link to the report and I will send it.<br>
<br>
Sorry for the delay - but precious time with James was more important to me<br>
than the AAR.<br>
<br>
More to follow.<br>
