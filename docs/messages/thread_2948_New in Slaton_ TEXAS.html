<div> </div>
<div>The old carve/don't carve/store-bought question is one of the very first questions that pops up for virtually every letterboxer and has seen many discussions on just about any letterboxing list you may join.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are those of us who would say: "Try it!"  and those who would say "You wouldn't catch me carving if my life depended on it".  <br/> </div>
<div>The two notable "wouldn't carve in a million years" folks that I know of on this list are Mike and Gryzzled Gryphon.  However, rather than going and buying a store-bought, they design their own and have them custom-made.  I haven't had the privilege of seeing one of Mike's in person (although the scanned image of his personal stamp is impressive), I've seen Gryzzled Gryphon's custom stamps and they are very nice.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Probably the vast majority of folks on this list do their own carving, and let me assure you, there is a wide range of skill amongst us all.  If y'all are already working on it, I would go with it and see what you come up with.  One of the really cool things about carving your own is that you later can look back and see how much better you've become at carving!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - if the carving thing isn't going as you had hoped and you are eager to go looking, just grab a store-bought and use it for a little while until you can get one carved that you like.  Many of us have done that (including my family, and we had the opportunity to re-find our first boxes not too long ago and I had completely forgotten until I looked through the logbooks what store-boughts we had used wayyyyy back then!).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would say avoid using a store-bought when you plant a box though.  But that's just me and I'm sure other folks will say it doesn't matter (and for my part, it wouldn't keep me from looking for a box).

<div>Kristin,</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The old carve/don't carve/store-bought question is one of the very 
    first questions that pops up for virtually every letterboxer and has seen 
    many discussions on just about any letterboxing list you may join.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are those of us who would say: "Try it!"  and those who 
    would say "You wouldn't catch me carving if my life depended on it".  
    <br/> </div>
<div>The two notable "wouldn't carve in a million years" folks that I know 
    of on this list are Mike and Gryzzled Gryphon.  However, rather than 
    going and buying a store-bought, they design their own and have them 
    custom-made.  I haven't had the privilege of seeing one of Mike's in 
    person (although the scanned image of his personal stamp is impressive), 
    I've seen Gryzzled Gryphon's custom stamps and they are very nice. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Probably the vast majority of folks on this list do their own carving, 
    and let me assure you, there is a wide range of skill amongst us all.  
    If y'all are already working on it, I would go with it and see what you come 
    up with.  One of the really cool things about carving your 
    own is that you later can look back and see how much better you've become at 
    carving! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - if the carving thing isn't going as you had hoped and you are 
    eager to go looking, just grab a store-bought and use it for a little while 
    until you can get one carved that you like.  Many of us have done that 
    (including my family, and we had the opportunity to re-find our first boxes 
    not too long ago and I had completely forgotten until I looked through the 
    logbooks what store-boughts we had used wayyyyy back then!). </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would say avoid using a store-bought when you plant a box 
    though.  But that's just me and I'm sure other folks will say it 
    doesn't matter (and for my part, it wouldn't keep me from looking for a 
    box). </div>

<div>Another thing about the design.  You don't have to hand draw your design.  If you know what you want to be - say, a lizard - you can google images for lizards, pick one, print it, trace it with charcoal pencil, then turn it over onto the rubber and rub it on, then carve it out and you are an artist!

stable so what I reload in January will still work in June.  The powder 
must be powerful enough to do the job without overfilling the case.  But - 
it must need enough powder to almost fill the case.  The primer must seat 
snugly and fire hot enough to ignite the powder.  Then there are little
