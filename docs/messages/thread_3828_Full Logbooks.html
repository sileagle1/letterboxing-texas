                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently, a couple of my Austin boxes were found by a new <br/>
letterboxer, Austin Peacock.  He notified me that the logbooks in <br/>
both were full and offered to replace them for me.  So, I made up new <br/>
logbooks and mailed them to him.  He contacted me today to say that <br/>
they had been replaced and that the old logbooks were in the mail.  <br/>
Thanks, Austin Peacock, I really appreciate the help.  Both of those <br/>
logbooks had probably 25-30 pages in the logbooks originally, which <br/>
brings up a couple of points.  In the not-too-distant past, that many <br/>
pages in a logbook might last 2 or 3 years, at least.  Because of the <br/>
growth of Texas letterboxing, that's situation is changing, <br/>
especially in the larger cities.  I checked the finder list on LbNA <br/>
and there were 17 finders listed on those boxes.  But, I've noticed <br/>
that sometimes a group will stamp into the logbook, like a family <br/>
group, but only one will notify me by claiming a find.  Also, many <br/>
people stamp in and don't notify me, so the finder list doesn't <br/>
always accurately reflect the number of pages left in a logbook. <br/>
That's telling me that I need to make my logbooks bigger, with more <br/>
pages and more room to stamp.  I always try to carry extra generic <br/>
logbooks in case one needs replacing, and extra boxes in case a box <br/>
is cracked or something, but sometimes I forget to do that, and come <br/>
across a box that needs help and I'm not prepared. I need to do a <br/>
better job of that. I know Atlas Quest has a place to tag a box that <br/>
needs maintenance, and that's a good idea. Maybe we should all be <br/>
diligent about updating our clue pages when a box is reported in need <br/>
of some repair.  That way, when I print out a clue, the first thing <br/>
I'll see is a note that the logbook is full or that the box is wet.  <br/>
I might even have time to contact the placer and ask if they would <br/>
like for me to pick up the wet or full logbook when I find the box. I <br/>
have also noticed that Austin has a lot of new letterboxers, many of <br/>
them associated with the University of Texas.  However, I haven't <br/>
noticed the same trend in College Station among Aggies.  What do you <br/>
think that means?  Just rambling now, so thanks, Austin Peacock. <br/>

                    <html><body><div>I try to log my finds online, but since the time when logging became a possibility (it wasn't when I first started), I've done it because I know it makes many placers happy, not because I want to for myself.  I would much rather write a note in the log and notify the planter by email if there is a specific issue with the box, or if there was something really special about finding it.  I also usually write sitreps and post here, so logging is an added step that provides me with nothing (since I don't rely on online logging for counts), but gives the planter something.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now - I don't mind doing that, because I got a little happiness out of finding their box, so why shouldn't I give them a little happiness by logging if they want me to?  I have to admit, though, logging online has taken last place in my list of priorities when I go boxing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for why I prefer NOT to log online, there's just something special about keeping the game OFF the computer as much as possible.  I'm as computer-savvy as the next computer geek, but by the time I check and write email, look things up, do research, pay bills, play a game or two, I'm ready to take my FUN off the computer. I like being able to download clues and then being done with the computer part of it.  And when I go check on one of my boxes,  I like the surprise of opening my logbook and discovering who has been there.  It always reminds me of the first box I placed, and waiting months and months for anyone to find it.  My only possibility of knowing it had been found before I went to check it was if a finder emailed me.  So after several trips to check it (45 miles away), I will never forget my surprised and delight to discover that it HAD been found (by Gryzzled Gryphon no less, at the height of his celebrity bred by his anonymity) and then - the very day I was there - by Silver Eagle and Baby Bear.  It just wouldn't have been as fun if I had already known they had been there.  </div>

<title>Re: Full Logbooks</title>
</head>
<body>
<span>very interesting discussion! I’d like to second Boots Tex’s comment about appreciating the email saying that someone has found one of my boxes. i always enjoy the notes that folks have sent along saying how much they appreciated the hunt, or the stamp, etc. this always helps us know when to check up on a box too. that makes all the trouble worthwhile. <br/>
<br/>
so I’m a big fan of logging finds on the computer, but I can also appreciate though the interest in getting off the computer for those of us that already spend too much time on it! <br/>
<br/>
we’ve placed both traditional boxes and also some logless boxes (a couple in waco and a couple in galveston before Ike) and the nice thing about them is that there is less maintenance. if the logless boxes in galveston didn’t wash away, I at least don’t have to worry about them having a soggy, molding, logbook! another reason we’ve done some logless ones were because the boxes were tiny urban boxes that didn’t have room for anything other than a small stamp.<br/>
<br/>
I should also add, that our son, who was 3 when we started letterboxing always checks the logbooks of boxes we find to see if Gryzzled Gryphon has been there! :-)<br/>
<br/>
like most things in life, I don’t think there’s an easy answer to the question of whether boxes should have logbooks or not. and like much of letterboxing, there are lots of different folks with different interests and opinions, and lots of different kinds of boxes for everyone. that’s part of what makes the adventure so exciting and interesting. you never know when you’ll find a box unlike any you’ve encountered before. it may not be your favorite style, but variety is good for you! :- ) think of your favorite (or least favorite) letterbox you’ve enountered. what if they were ALL like that? it would be awfully boring, don’t you think? <br/>
<br/>
happy boxing,<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just received the two full logbooks that Austin Peacock recovered <br/>
for me (thanks again) and, in light of this discussion, I studied <br/>
them thoroughly.  There were a few veteran finders, some that have <br/>
been boxing for several years, and there were some newer, but <br/>
familiar boxers, notably from Austin, and there were a couple from <br/>
out of state (Georgis), but the majority of stamps were by boxers <br/>
that I have never heard of and who did not register the boxes as <br/>
finds on either LbNA or AQ.  I have to think that these people are <br/>
casual letterboxers who have heard about letterboxing from a source <br/>
like a magazine or newspaper article, or word of mouth from a friend, <br/>
and who find it to be entertaining.  I think a lot of home-schoolers <br/>
read about it in a magazine that is published for them.  There's <br/>
nothing wrong with that and I don't have a problem with it.  I'm <br/>
guessing that most of them are not interested in placing boxes and <br/>
have maybe never heard of this message board.  I do believe that <br/>
finders who become placers are the ones that are most likely to post <br/>
their finds and contact the placer.  So, when I think about it, <br/>
that's a good thing and I'm glad they enjoy my boxes.  Some of them <br/>
even write complimentary notes in the log book, so it's good to get <br/>
them back and read their comments.  I think I need to consider the <br/>
hiding place when I make my logbooks.  Boxes hidden in Houston or <br/>
Austin or the metroplex probably need a lot of pages, while boxes in <br/>
Rocksprings or the Big Bend (I started to say El Paso, but thought <br/>
better of it), not so much.<br/>

&gt; &gt; to you,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you assume all is well since you haven't heard that all is not<br/>
&gt; &gt; well, so that<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; you don't know there is a problem until there is a problem. I <br/>
know<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; guilty of doing this, but it would be alot better if we did<br/>
&gt; &gt; maintenance<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; instead of crisis management.<br/>
