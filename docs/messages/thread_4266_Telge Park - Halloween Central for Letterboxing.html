                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have added my 2009 addition to the park (Halloween 2009 - Boiled IRA) and posted the clues.   While there, I then tried to find all the boxes in the park, and have the follwoing report.  Some I found, some are definately gone, and some I just was not sure.  The park had 2 big floods last year, and the hurricane also took its toll.  But overall, I was happy with how many boxes are left.   Here is a listing, with some notes. <br>
<br>

Park Angel - Alive and Well (added new log book)<br>
La Llorona - Could not figure out<br>
A True Goblin - Found laying open on the ground near where should <br>

    hanging there somewhere.<br>

    whole area.  I found graveyard box in open, and returned it to <br>
     proper place with RIP rock back on top.  I did see one hanging <br>
     ghost, but will take some work to get to it.<br>
