Picnic Pavillion 3 is now booked for Saturday, 3/3/07.  We have <br>
already booked our campsites for Friday and Saturday nights.   They <br>
have water only sites (near the pavillion) or electric sites if you <br>
have a trailer.   If need hotel, Brenham is not that far away.  More <br>
details on the event will be sent out after the holidays.  Don't <br>
worry about the costs, as Silver Eagle and I have covered this (and <br>
turned out to be one of the lowest cost of all the parks!). Have a <br>
great Thanksgiving!!!!!<br>
