                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hello all!  I just received the invite today and was thrilled to find<br>
there is a new Texas group.  We live in Richmond/Rosenberg and started<br>
letterboxing in April of 2003.  We had a lot of fun throughout the<br>
summer, but just haven't found the time since school started.  I look<br>
forward to the summer so we can get out and about again.  I haven't<br>
gotten brave enough to attempt to place any, but I have seen a few<br>
places recently that it occurred to me that they would be perfect for<br>
a box so...  Now I just have to work up the courage to attempt a stamp<br>
that someone else might actually want to see in their log book.<br>
<br>
Happy to be here!<br>

<div>Hello!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wanted to take a minute to introduce myself as a new member to the 
letterboxing texas group!  My name is Kristin Collins ( my yahoo ID is 
runsforchocolate) and I was recently introduced to letterboxing by a friend that 
I scrapbook with.  I now have a Letterboxing scrapbook that I use to 
document my LB outings.  So far, in the past two weeks, I have found 28 
letterboxes, including a hitchhiker and was the first finder on a really cool 
stamp in Chappell Hill, TX!  In addition, I have seen three snakes and 
several deer! Do you get bonus points for that?!?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I look forward to seeing y'all on the hunt!</div>

<div>Welcome, Walter! We're a pretty active, chatty group, and have a get-together or two each year. Also,sometimes boxers in the same area get together to look for boxes.  We chat a lot on this list, and everyone is welcome.

We have a gathering coming up not terribly far from<br>
you in October in Waxahachie.  We are calling it a<br>
"barnraising" because the idea is to seed three<br>
counties with boxes.  The three counties are Johnson<br>
(closest to you), Ellis, and Navarro.  You are invited<br>
to join us and at the very least, maybe it will mean<br>
there will be new boxes closer to you!<br>
<br>
In the meantime, I know that Delivery Girl just put a<br>
box out in Johnson County and I'm sure she would<br>
welcome a visitor to it.  Not to speak for her, but I<br>
think she has a couple more planned.  <br>
<br>
When I first started boxing a couple of years ago,<br>
there were a scant few boxes near me (northeast Texas)<br>
and they weren't really that close!  Boxing in Texas<br>
is growing by leaps and bounds, so rest assured your<br>
day will come!<br>
<br>

<p>Hello!  </p>
<p>My screen name on the Letteboxing site is Royal Vista.  I first learned about letterboxing from my husband's friend.  I have another hobby called Bookcrossing (some of you may have heard of it and may be a fellow Bookcrosser also) that I had told him and his wife about.  He said, "Well, letterboxing is right up your alley."  And it is!  I have found almost a dozen letterboxes in the Metroplex and Wichita Falls area (and attempted one in Oklahoma also), and I've put out one letterbox so far that has had some traffic.  It's been a lot of fun.  To tell you a little about myself... I'm a 5th grade teacher about to finish my 2nd year of teaching.  I have a 4 year old son.  I love to read, spend time outdoors, traveling, and hanging out with family and friends.  I think that's about it for me.  Thanks for allowing me to take this time to introduce myself.</p>

<div><font face="MS Sans Serif" size="2">Welcome to the Texas Letterboxing group. It's great to have a new letterboxer in the area. After a "lifetime" of moving around the country (my husband is retired from the Air Force), we're "somewhat settled" in the DFW metroplex. Actually he's currently working in Connecticut so we travel back and forth a lot until he retires, yet again, in November! I haven't been out to the Benbrook area to find your Memorial Oak letterbox yet, but carry the clues with me in my car at all times and hope to get out there in the next couple of weeks! Keep planting those boxes, and welcome to the group!</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Greetings!  I'm a new member to the group (one who will tend to lurk), <br>
but I wanted to introduce myself.  I live in Justin, Texas, am married <br>
with two children, 18 and 21.  We have been married 26 years (all <br>
spent in Texas).  The rest of my family are native Texans (a whole <br>
discussion in itself), and I am not (born in Colorado - sure do miss <br>
it in August in Texas).<br>
<br>
My husband and I started geocaching on July 1 of this year.  Being a <br>
geek, he likes it because he gets to use his new GPS toy.  I like it <br>
all.  I started letterboxing on August 12.  I've done boxes in my area <br>
(Texas Motor Speedway, Denton, Grapevine, Southlake) and in Wichita <br>
Falls (dropping daughter off for college).  Today I did box #10!!<br>
<br>
We have an RV and love to travel, so I'll be keeping my eye out for <br>
letterboxes (and geocaches) as we travel.  Unfortunately, we still <br>
have to have jobs and earn a living.<br>
<br>
I'm hoping to put out a box or two soon, but first I have to master <br>
the stamp carving thing.  I may have to get help from my artist <br>
daughter.  <br>
<br>
Well, there's the intro.  Thanks for the group!<br>

<div>Welcome, Batty Girl!  (I see why you liked the Bats! letterbox.)  
</div>
<div>Glad to know you're so close to my area, and I can look forward to finding 
some of your letterboxes in the future.  If your daughter is going to 
college in Wichita Falls, then she must be at Midwestern - which is where I did 
my undergraduate degree waaaaaay back then.  Nice school, even if the 
weather isn't always!  I've got a letterbox to be planted in WF sometime 
whenever I make it up there, and so far the only one I've found there is the 
Falls letterbox (haven't searched for the others, but plan to sometime).  
Nice to have you in the group!</div>

I am a unique native West Texas female with a friendly smile and a <br/>
mischievous playful nature. I never claimed to be normal by anyone's <br/>
standards but my own. Find most people's standards to high for an <br/>
imperfect world. Mother of 2 teenagers. Divorced from 2nd marriage. I <br/>
work as a part time Histologist and attend College as a full time <br/>
student to earn my B.S. in Earth Science/Geology. I am involved in <br/>
community/social groups. It is because of Geology that I got a GPSr for <br/>
the field work. While trying to learn how to use it I came across <br/>
geocaching.com and found it an exciting activity for learning how to <br/>
use GPSr besides Geology field work. Have meet some really great people <br/>
there and not only learning from them but making new friendships. It <br/>
was on one of my geocaching adventures that I stumbled upon a Letterbox <br/>
and thought wow this is neat too. I admite that I used my thumbprint, <br/>
drawing a smile,eyes, arms and legs for my first stamping of a <br/>
letterbox, since then I found a cowboy boot stamp that has become my <br/>
mark, using a brown ink pad. Look forward to the new year to find more <br/>
letterboxs now that I know more about them.<br/>

<div>I am brand new to letterboxing, finding my first one this weekend in fact.  My sister in law told me about letterboxing last month and I then got on the web and did some research.  I found it pretty interesting and decided to try it out, what fun, now I can't wait to find the next one!</div>
<div>I live in West Texas, close to San Angelo in fact.  My husband and I have a couple of horses, 2 dogs and 3 daughters between us, all grown except one who still lives at home.  We love to go on cruises in the fall or winter and are planning one for January right now.  I am a community relations mgr at a not for profit and my husband is a welder.  This letterboxing thing is something we could do together even though the artsy stuff is my bag, but he enjoyed looking for that first one so I think he is hooked too.  I look forward to hearing and learning more from you.  <br/>Thanks</div>

DFW is rich with wonderful boxes so I know you'll have a great adventure finding some in the local area, as well as all over Texas! The Texas list was around and active long before the AQ Texas list, and you'll definitely find most Texas boxers participate on the letterboxingtexas list. When we plan events, they are always discussed on the letterboxingtexas list. Have fun discovering boxes in the DFW area.<br>

Between an LTC that is challenging me, my kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br>
I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving. They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to carve.<br>
And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont even know im here most of the time. :) <br>
Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <br>

color:green'>Well – as a retired soldier with lots of desert experience,
I can say that snakes are truly rare in the late fall through early
spring.  Not gone completely, but usually.  I speak for West Texas,
the habits in the east may differ somewhat.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";

And above all, do not mess with them.  Or kill them.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

chance they will warn you with a buzz of their tail.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

bite.  <o:p></o:p></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>If cornered, they will strike.  Most snake bites happen in
two ways.  The snake is found suddenly in an unexpected place and startled,
or people do not listen and try to mess with the snake.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>If a snake bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom.  This
is more true with older and larger snakes.  But you cannot count on
that.  Smaller snakes are more dangerous than the larger ones for several
reasons.  First, they are not as frightening, so people will be more
likely to mess with them.  Second, when they strike they nearly always
dump all the venom they have into the bite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Death from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy
people.  The very young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles
(like bee stings etc) need to be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite
victim calm, and seek medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out
the venom is for TV.  Study up on proper first aid for snake bite.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>Knowledge is power.  Most people fear what they do not
understand.  Kind of like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand
frightens them.  Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears. 
So it should be with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution is all you
need.  Use a stick to poke – not your hand.  Use a grabber to
reach the box, not your arm.  If you see a snake, remember it belongs
there, you are a visitor in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by
yielding the trail to it, and you will be fine.  Most snakes cannot quite
strike as far as they are long, but give it as much room as you can.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

color:green'><o:p> </o:p></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:"Verdana","sans-serif";
color:green'>In 20 years I only had to evac one soldier for snake bite. 
It was just a cute little baby snake.  He had heard that the baby snakes
didn’t bite.  Heh heh heh – just like all guns are loaded, so
too are all snakes.  Give them their due, and all will be well.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

Between an LTC that is challenging me, my kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br/> I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving. They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to carve.<br/> And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont even know im here most of the time. :)<br/> Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <o></o></p></div><div><p class="MsoNormal"><span style="color:white;"><o></o></span></p></div></div></div></div></div></div><div style="color: #fff; height: 0;"></div><style type="text/css">

    Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in Houston we
    don't get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in the back
    corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the
    inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake
    skin...i asked DH if i had anything to worry about since it could
    "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he
    just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way,
    of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are
    "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good
    education can go a long way.   I think I'll look into it..but just
    like phone numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant
    remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be able to
    remember if red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o)  But I'll
    do my best..<br/>
    Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee buzzing
    around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore
    it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just
    ignore them..<br/>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:
                  green;">If cornered, they will strike.  Most snake
                  bites happen in
                  two ways.  The snake is found suddenly in an
                  unexpected place and startled,
                  or people do not listen and try to mess with the
                  snake.<o></o></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:
                  green;">If a snake bites you, sometimes they do not
                  inject venom.  This
                  is more true with older and larger snakes.  But you
                  cannot count on
                  that.  Smaller snakes are more dangerous than the
                  larger ones for several
                  reasons.  First, they are not as frightening, so
                  people will be more
                  likely to mess with them.  Second, when they strike
                  they nearly always
                  dump all the venom they have into the bite.<o></o></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:
                  green;">Death from snake bite is a rare thing for
                  normal healthy
                  people.  The very young, very old, and those with
                  reactionary troubles
                  (like bee stings etc) need to be aware of their
                  situation.  Keep the bite
                  victim calm, and seek medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the
                  wound and sucking out
                  the venom is for TV.  Study up on proper first aid for
                  snake bite.<o></o></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-size: 10pt; color:
                  green;">Knowledge is power.  Most people fear what
                  they do not
                  understand.  Kind of like hoplophobic people, what
                  they do not understand
                  frightens them.  Knowledge and experience usually
                  conquers those fears. 
                  So it should be with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution
                  is all you
                  need.  Use a stick to poke – not your hand.  Use a
                  grabber to
                  reach the box, not your arm.  If you see a snake,
                  remember it belongs
                  there, you are a visitor in its land.  Give it the

                  snakes cannot quite
                  strike as far as they are long, but give it as much
                  room as you can.<o></o></span></p>

                  It was just a cute little baby snake.  He had heard
                  that the baby snakes
                  didn’t bite.  Heh heh heh – just like all guns are
                  loaded, so
                  too are all snakes.  Give them their due, and all will

<p>I have been a member of this group for a small
                        while but I just havent taken the time to
                        introduce myself yet. Between an LTC
                        that is challenging me, my kitchen being
                        remodeled (the mircowave is on my
                        craft table!)and starting a direct sales
                        business I havent been on top of all
                        the other areas of life lately. But im here now.
                        :)<br/>
                        I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan,
                        who lives in Austin, TX with
                        his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to
                        visit them at least once a year.
                        We have only went boxing once during a visit.
                        They loved it. April even started
                        carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the
                        box (after Grandma does all the
                        work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his
                        hand at carving. They both love
                        to draw so I hope its something they continue
                        and maybe even look for some
                        boxes when im not there. I havent been in
                        letterboxing for very long, a little
                        over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's
                        but I have let them overrun me
                        and am planning on taking a break so get some
                        scrapbooking done and try, try to
                        get better at quilting. I also want to plant
                        some more letterboxes in my area
                        since its still pretty quiet around here. I get
                        some finds, most are accidents,
                        very few log them but I still love doing it. I
                        have a box ready to be planted
                        in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments
                        my son lives at. I hope to do
                        that in November. I am married to a great
                        supportive guy. He probly wouldnt
                        letterbox on his own but has found every box
                        with me and helps me with the
                        directions and stuff planting mine. We also
                        geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was
                        lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in
                        March. It was my first gathering.
                        Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes me. I
                        was kinda shy, not sure what to
                        do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got some
                        great advice about carving a
                        portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe for
                        an LTC but havent tried Sophia
                        yet which is who I want to carve.<br/>
                        And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go
                        on so much, you probly wont even
                        know im here most of the time. :) <br/>
                        Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a
                        question ( we'll find out who
                        survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the
                        snakes ever hibernate in Texas?
                        Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them?
                        Just wondering. <o></o></p>

<div>I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)</div>
<div>Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. </div>
<div>While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. </div>
<div>Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!</div>

<div>Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in Houston we don't get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to worry about since it could "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can go a long way.   I think I'll look into it..but just like phone numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br/>Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee
 buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>Carol<br/><br/>On 9/11/2010 9:53 PM, Mike Olbrisch wrote:

I just wore a bear bell attached to my walking stick and backpack to warn them that I was coming so I wouldn't surprise them. But I was afraid of mountain lions when I hiked on the Pacific Crest Trail. Every time I'd pass under a large boulder, I could just imagine one waiting to pounce on me from above.  We're going hiking in the mountains of northwestern Colorado in a couple of weeks - what should I focus my fear on there?

<div>Thank you for all the information. Between this and what I have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas letterboxing tool. :) </div>
<div>I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)</div>
<div>Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. </div>
<div>While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. </div>
<div>Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!</div>

<div>Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in Houston we don't get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to worry about since it could "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can go a long way.   I think I'll look into it..but just like phone numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br/>Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>Carol<br/><br/>On 9/11/2010 9:53 PM, Mike Olbrisch wrote:

<div>I have been a member of this group for a small while but I just havent taken the time to introduce myself yet. Between an LTC that is challenging me, my kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br/>I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving. They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to carve.<br/>And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont even know im here most of the time. :) <br/>Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. </div></div>

<p class="MsoPlainText">We have bears in the NM mountains just north of me. 
There are bear warning signs, and even precautions to take right on the
trail-head signs.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">They warn that black and brown bears are frequently seen,
and sometimes even grizzly bears in the more northern mountains bordering
Colorado.  They warn of approaching bears, or even coming upon them and
startling them.  They recommend wearing brightly colored clothing, making noise
while hiking, and even sewing little bells on your clothing so that the bears
know you are coming.  They also recommend carrying bear repellant spray.<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Another thing they mention is identifying what bears are
in the area.  If you see them - of course you can tell the difference.  Brown
bears are brown.  Black bears are black, and about the same size as a brown
bear.  Grizzly bears are also black, but much larger and meaner too.  Although
they are cute - DO NOT approach any bear cubs under any circumstances!<o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o:p> </o:p></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">If you don't see bears, you can still somewhat identify
them by their scat (poop) found on the trail.  Black and brown bear scat is
very similar.  It will contain bits of twigs, leaves, and sometimes rabbit fur
or bird feathers.  Grizzly bear scat will usually contain bits of brightly
colored clothing, little bells, and will smell like bear repellant spray.<o:p></o:p></p>

little time checking him out.  It has been interesting to see him growing year

<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for all the information. Between this and what I
  have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas
  letterboxing tool. :) <o:p></o:p></p>

<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my
  fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even
  saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear
  has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota
  a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state
  parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities
  to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha.
  I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota
  for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>
  And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still
  couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although
  my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the
  research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I
  love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a
  bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled
  them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt
  mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any
  snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up
  but I wouldnt let him. Haha. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going
  to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding
  new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the
  water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he
  saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up
  an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in
  Houston we don't get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in
  the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the
  inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked
  DH if i had anything to worry about since it could "possibly" lead
  to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him
  up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows
  which ones are poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call
  him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can go a long
  way.   I think I'll look into it..but just like phone
  numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands
  office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill
  a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br/>
  Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee
  buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore
  it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>

  is power.  Most people fear what they do not understand.  Kind of
  like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them. 
  Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears.  So it should be
  with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution is all you need.  Use a
  stick to poke – not your hand.  Use a grabber to reach the box, not your
  arm.  If you see a snake, remember it belongs there, you are a visitor
  in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by yielding the trail to it,
  and you will be fine.  Most snakes cannot quite strike as far as they
  are long, but give it as much room as you can.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have been a member of this group for a small while but I
  just havent taken the time to introduce myself yet. Between an LTC that is
  challenging me, my kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft
  table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the
  other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br/>
  I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with
  his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a
  year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even
  started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma
  does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving.
  They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even
  look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very
  long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let
  them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking
  done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more
  letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some
  finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I
  have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments
  my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great
  supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every
  box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also
  geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in
  Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet
  me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway.
  :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a
  carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to
  carve.<br/>
  And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont
  even know im here most of the time. :) <br/>
  Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who
  survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in
  Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <o:p></o:p></p>

  have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas

<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my
  fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even
  saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear
  has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota
  a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state
  parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities
  to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha.
  I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota
  for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>
  And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still
  couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although
  my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the
  research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I
  love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a
  bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled
  them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt
  mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any
  snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up
  but I wouldnt let him. Haha. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going
  to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding
  new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the
  water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he
  saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up
  an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in
  Houston we don't get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in
  the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the
  inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked
  DH if i had anything to worry about since it could "possibly" lead
  to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him
  up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows
  which ones are poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call
  him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can go a long
  way.   I think I'll look into it..but just like phone
  numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands
  office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill
  a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br/>
  Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee
  buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore
  it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">If
  cornered, they will strike.  Most snake bites happen in two ways. 
  The snake is found suddenly in an unexpected place and startled, or people do
  not listen and try to mess with the snake.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">If
  a snake bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom.  This is more
  true with older and larger snakes.  But you cannot count on that. 
  Smaller snakes are more dangerous than the larger ones for several reasons. 
  First, they are not as frightening, so people will be more likely to mess
  with them.  Second, when they strike they nearly always dump all the
  venom they have into the bite.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">Death
  from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people.  The very
  young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc)
  need to be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite victim calm, and
  seek medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is
  for TV.  Study up on proper first aid for snake bite.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">Knowledge
  is power.  Most people fear what they do not understand.  Kind of
  like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them. 
  Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears.  So it should be
  with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution is all you need.  Use a
  stick to poke â€“ not your hand.  Use a grabber to reach the box, not
  your arm.  If you see a snake, remember it belongs there, you are a
  visitor in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by yielding the
  trail to it, and you will be fine.  Most snakes cannot quite strike as
  far as they are long, but give it as much room as you can.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">In
  20 years I only had to evac one soldier for snake bite.  It was just a
  cute little baby snake.  He had heard that the baby snakes didnâ€™t
  bite.  Heh heh heh â€“ just like all guns are loaded, so too are all
  snakes.  Give them their due, and all will be well.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

  table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the
  other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br/>
  I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with
  his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a
  year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even
  started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma
  does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving.
  They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even
  look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very
  long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let
  them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking
  done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more
  letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some
  finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I
  have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments
  my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great supportive
  guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every box with me
  and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also geocache,
  Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in
  March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes
  me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got
  some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe
  for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to carve.<br/>
  And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont
  even know im here most of the time. :) <br/>
  Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who
  survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in
  Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <o:p></o:p></p>

  you for all the information. Between this and what I have read on AQ boards a
  good, long walking stick will be a new Texas letterboxing tool. :) <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">I
  lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a
  snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have
  been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus
  another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years
  ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me
  fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they
  dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few
  people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years
  and have never seen a bear. <br/>
  And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still
  couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although
  my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the
  research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<o:p></o:p></p>
</div>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Well
  im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE
  the places ive seen letterboxing. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">While
  searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes
  that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe
  they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them
  because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway
  &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt
  let him. Haha. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-margin-top-alt:auto;mso-margin-bottom-alt:auto">Anyway...great
  information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they
  live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They
  have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the
  water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it
  freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!<o:p></o:p></p>

  answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in Houston we don't get
  many snakes.  And actually in the little space in the back corner of my
  house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the inside is actually the
  corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to
  worry about since it could "possibly" lead to my closet and he
  "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him
  someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows which ones are
  poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call him if i see one
  but Mike is right..a good education can go a long way.   I think
  I'll look into it..but just like phone numbers,  when I'm stressed and
  freaked out..i cant remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be
  able to remember if red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o)  But
  I'll do my best..<br/>
  Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee
  buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore
  it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">If
  a snake bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom.  This is more
  true with older and larger snakes.  But you cannot count on that. 
  Smaller snakes are more dangerous than the larger ones for several
  reasons.  First, they are not as frightening, so people will be more
  likely to mess with them.  Second, when they strike they nearly always
  dump all the venom they have into the bite.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">Death
  from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people.  The very
  young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc)
  need to be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite victim calm, and
  seek medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is
  for TV.  Study up on proper first aid for snake bite.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="font-size:10.0pt;color:green">Knowledge
  is power.  Most people fear what they do not understand.  Kind of
  like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them. 
  Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears.  So it should be
  with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution is all you need.  Use a
  stick to poke – not your hand.  Use a grabber to reach the box, not your
  arm.  If you see a snake, remember it belongs there, you are a visitor
  in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by yielding the trail to it,
  and you will be fine.  Most snakes cannot quite strike as far as they
  are long, but give it as much room as you can.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

  have been a member of this group for a small while but I just havent taken
  the time to introduce myself yet. Between an LTC that is challenging me, my
  kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft table!)and starting a
  direct sales business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life
  lately. But im here now. :)<br/>
  I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with
  his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a
  year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even
  started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma
  does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving.
  They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even
  look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very
  long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let
  them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking
  done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more
  letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some
  finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I
  have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments
  my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great
  supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every
  box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also
  geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in
  Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet
  me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway.
  :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a
  carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to
  carve.<br/>
  And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont
  even know im here most of the time. :) <br/>
  Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who
  survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in
  Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">It is ok to be afraid of things.  I am somewhat afraid of heights – but I regularly jumped out of aircraft (not since I retired).  I am afraid of electricity, but I work in a power plant.  Some jobs cause me to sweat and make my hands shake.  But I get the job done.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">As I posted earlier – my experience is in DESERT snakes – you may encounter slight differences in east Texas.  And you might encounter a snake at any time, although there is a lesser chance in cold weather.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">Check out this site as a primer.  <a href="http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/mar/stories/rattlesin.html">http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/mar/stories/rattlesin.html</a><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">Being afraid is OK.  It is when you allow that fear to paralyze you into unreasonable avoidance that it really affects your life.  Like a person that has been bitten by a dog, and now wants to have all dogs destroyed.  Knowledge, thought and caution are usually enough to keep you safe.  Don’t lock yourself inside your house just because there might be snakes outside.  &lt;grin&gt;.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">As to bears – I just sent something to a ham-radio hiker friend….  Let me see if I can find it for you.<o></o></span></p>
<div style="BORDER-BOTTOM: windowtext 1pt solid">
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p></div>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">We have bears in the NM mountains just north of me.  There are bear warning signs, and even precautions to take right on the trail-head signs.<o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">They warn that black and brown bears are frequently seen, and sometimes even grizzly bears in the more northern mountains bordering Colorado.  They warn of approaching bears, or even coming upon them and startling them.  They recommend wearing brightly colored clothing, making noise while hiking, and even sewing little bells on your clothing so that the bears know you are coming.  They also recommend carrying bear repellant spray.<o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Another thing they mention is identifying what bears are in the area.  If you see them - of course you can tell the difference.  Brown bears are brown.  Black bears are black, and about the same size as a brown bear.  Grizzly bears are also black, but much larger and meaner too.  Although they are cute - DO NOT approach any bear cubs under any circumstances!<o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">If you don't see bears, you can still somewhat identify them by their scat (poop) found on the trail.  Black and brown bear scat is very similar.  It will contain bits of twigs, leaves, and sometimes rabbit fur or bird feathers.  Grizzly bear scat will usually contain bits of brightly colored clothing, little bells, and will smell like bear repellant spray.<o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText"><o></o></p>
<p class="MsoPlainText">Really - if you want to know....  <a href="http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscat.html">http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscat.html</a><o></o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">As you can see – part of it was a joke, as it is generally accepted that Grizzly bears do not come this far south, being predominantly in Idaho and Washington St.  Doesn’t mean they can’t walk the continental divide and come south.  But generally, the last grizzly sighting this far south is generally accepted as being in the mid 1940s.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">So don’t let the idea of Texas snakes stop you from enjoying the out-doors and finding lots of letterboxes.  I guess what I am saying is – don’t let fear control your life.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">There is a rock-rattler that lives in a crack in the rocks of a trail that I frequently hike.  I see him often, every summer for three years now.  I named him Rocky.  It is a little-used trail, I could very well be his only human contact.  While I carefully step around him, I do sometimes spend a little time checking him out.  It has been interesting to see him growing year by year.  BTW – the number of buttons on the rattle has nothing to do with the age of the snake, only with how many times it has shed its skin.<o></o></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">Thank you for all the information. Between this and what I have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas letterboxing tool. :) <o></o></p></div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<o></o></p></div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. <o></o></p></div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. <o></o></p></div>
<div>
<p class="MsoNormal">Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!<o></o></p></div>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">If a snake bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom.  This is more true with older and larger snakes.  But you cannot count on that.  Smaller snakes are more dangerous than the larger ones for several reasons.  First, they are not as frightening, so people will be more likely to mess with them.  Second, when they strike they nearly always dump all the venom they have into the bite.</span> <o></o></p>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">Death from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people.  The very young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc) need to be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite victim calm, and seek medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is for TV.  Study up on proper first aid for snake bite.</span> <o></o></p>

<p class="yiv981013478msonormal"><span style="FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: green">Knowledge is power.  Most people fear what they do not understand.  Kind of like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them.  Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears.  So it should be with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution is all you need.  Use a stick to poke – not your hand.  Use a grabber to reach the box, not your arm.  If you see a snake, remember it belongs there, you are a visitor in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by yielding the trail to it, and you will be fine.  Most snakes cannot quite strike as far as they are long, but give it as much room as you can.</span> <o></o></p>

<p class="MsoNormal">I have been a member of this group for a small while but I just havent taken the time to introduce myself yet. Between an LTC that is challenging me, my kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br/>I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving. They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to carve.<br/>And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont even know im here most of the time. :) <br/>Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who survived reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <o></o></p></div></div></div></div></td></tr></tbody></table>

Im still afraid but I do it. Same with letterboxing in Texas...snakes wont stop me. Bears do stop me. I think because they are bigger. We went to our county fair yesterday and guess what....a bear show. Im not at all afraid to admit im afraid of them. Although fun to watch but very scary. I kept telling my husband 'see why im afraid. If they wanted out of that areana no one could stop them. Lets go.' Hahaha.<br/>We laughed and stayed and watched them frolic around in this pool of water. So some fear I can work through but some I wont, but the bear one I said I would try but I wont tent camp. At least give me that. Haha. Husband agreed. Northern
 Minnesota is more beautiful in the Fall/early Winter anyway. Hahaha!!<br/>

</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText">We have bears in the NM mountains just north of me.  There are bear warning signs, and even precautions to take right on the trail-head signs.
</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText"> 
</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText">They warn that black and brown bears are frequently seen, and sometimes even grizzly bears in the more northern mountains bordering Colorado.  They warn of approaching bears, or even coming upon them and startling them.  They recommend wearing brightly colored clothing, making noise while hiking, and even sewing little bells on your clothing so that the bears know you are coming.  They also recommend carrying bear repellant spray.
</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText"> 
</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText">Another thing they mention is identifying what bears are in the area.  If you see them - of course you can tell the difference.  Brown bears are brown.  Black bears are black, and about the same size as a brown bear.  Grizzly bears are also black, but much larger and meaner too.  Although they are cute - DO NOT approach any bear cubs under any circumstances!
</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText"> 
</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoPlainText">If you don't see bears, you can still somewhat identify them by their scat (poop) found on the trail.  Black and brown bear scat is very similar.  It will contain bits of twigs, leaves, and sometimes rabbit fur or bird feathers.  Grizzly bear scat will usually contain bits of brightly colored clothing, little bells, and will smell like bear repellant spray.

</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">As you can see – part of it was a joke, as it is generally accepted that Grizzly bears do not come this far south, being predominantly in Idaho and Washington St.  Doesn’t mean they can’t walk the continental divide and come south.  But generally, the last grizzly sighting this far south is generally accepted as being in the mid 1940s.</span>

</p><p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">There is a rock-rattler that lives in a crack in the rocks of a trail that I frequently hike.  I see him often, every summer for three years now.  I named him Rocky.  It is a little-used trail, I could very well be his only human contact.  While I carefully step around him, I do sometimes spend a little time checking him out.  It has been interesting to see him growing year by year.  BTW – the number of buttons on the rattle has nothing to do with the age of the snake, only with how many times it has shed its skin.</span>

<p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal">Thank you for all the information. Between this and what I have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas letterboxing tool. :) </p></div>
<div>
<p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal">I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you)
 :)</p></div>
<div>
<p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal">Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. </p></div>
<div>
<p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal">While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. </p></div>
<div>
<p class="yiv1255118479MsoNormal">Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!</p></div>

 well..If you see a bee buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>Carol<br/><br/>On 9/11/2010 9:53 PM, Mike Olbrisch wrote: </p></div>

<p>Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in Houston we don't 
  get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in the back corner of 
  my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the inside is actually the 
  corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to 
  worry about since it could "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he 
  sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the 
  kids way, of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are 
  "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can 
  go a long way.   I think I'll look into it..but just like phone 
  numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands 
  office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill 
  a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br/>Of course my "bee theory" 
  had held up well..If you see a bee buzzing around, don't swat at it or run 
  around..just sit still and ignore it...I've never been stung by a bee and i 
  think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>Carol<br/><br/>On 9/11/2010 9:53 PM, Mike

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Well  as a 
    retired soldier with lots of desert experience, I can say that snakes are 
    truly rare in the late fall through early spring.  Not gone completely, 
    but usually.  I speak for West Texas, the habits in the east may differ 
    somewhat.<o></o></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Rattle Snakes 
    do not want to encounter you.  If given the chance they will warn you 
    with a buzz of their tail.<o></o></span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If cornered, 
    they will strike.  Most snake bites happen in two ways.  The snake 
    is found suddenly in an unexpected place and startled, or people do not 
    listen and try to mess with the snake.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">If a snake 
    bites you, sometimes they do not inject venom.  This is more true with 
    older and larger snakes.  But you cannot count on that.  Smaller 
    snakes are more dangerous than the larger ones for several reasons.  
    First, they are not as frightening, so people will be more likely to mess 
    with them.  Second, when they strike they nearly always dump all the 
    venom they have into the bite.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Death from 
    snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people.  The very young, 
    very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc) need to 
    be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite victim calm, and seek 
    medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is for 
    TV.  Study up on proper first aid for snake bite.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">Knowledge is 
    power.  Most people fear what they do not understand.  Kind of 
    like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them.  
    Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears.  So it should be 
    with snakes.  Knowledge and precaution is all you need.  Use a 
    stick to poke  not your hand.  Use a grabber to reach the box, not 
    your arm.  If you see a snake, remember it belongs there, you are a 
    visitor in its land.  Give it the respect it is due by yielding the 
    trail to it, and you will be fine.  Most snakes cannot quite strike as 
    far as they are long, but give it as much room as you can.<o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt"><o></o></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="COLOR: green; FONT-SIZE: 10pt">In 20 years I 
    only had to evac one soldier for snake bite.  It was just a cute little 
    baby snake.  He had heard that the baby snakes didnt bite.  Heh 
    heh heh  just like all guns are loaded, so too are all snakes.  Give 
    them their due, and all will be well.<o></o></span></p>

disappointed we hadn’t seen any on our geocaching and letterboxing adventures
lately, but that changed last weekend.  We were in Memorial Park and found this
guy laying on one of the back trails<a name="_MailEndCompose"> when we went
after a cache.  We moved him with a long stick to get him off the path – didn’t
want him to get stepped on or run over by a bike.  We looked him up and apparently
it’s a banded water snake (not poisonous).  It’s the first I’ve seen of one of
these.  <o:p></o:p></a></span></p>

think we are supposed to be!  But I’ve seen enough snakes (including plenty in
my yard) that they don’t bother me much.  If  you take some precautions they
are going to leave you alone.  Plus my husband has many teenage stories of “playing”
with snakes (maybe antagonizing is a better word) without anyone getting hurt,
so I think bites must be rare.  If anyone should have been bitten it was him

  to admit im afraid of them. Although fun to watch but very scary. I kept telling

  stop them. Lets go.' Hahaha.<br/>
  We laughed and stayed and watched them frolic around in this pool of water.
  So some fear I can work through but some I wont, but the bear one I said I
  would try but I wont tent camp. At least give me that. Haha. Husband agreed.
  Northern Minnesota is more beautiful in the Fall/early Winter anyway.

<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">We have bears in the NM mountains just
  north of me.  There are bear warning signs, and even precautions to take
  right on the trail-head signs. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">  <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">They warn that black and brown bears are
  frequently seen, and sometimes even grizzly bears in the more northern
  mountains bordering Colorado.  They warn of approaching bears, or even
  coming upon them and startling them.  They recommend wearing brightly
  colored clothing, making noise while hiking, and even sewing little bells on
  your clothing so that the bears know you are coming.  They also
  recommend carrying bear repellant spray. <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">  <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">Another thing they mention is identifying
  what bears are in the area.  If you see them - of course you can tell
  the difference.  Brown bears are brown.  Black bears are black, and
  about the same size as a brown bear.  Grizzly bears are also black, but
  much larger and meaner too.  Although they are cute - DO NOT approach
  any bear cubs under any circumstances! <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">  <o:p></o:p></p>
<p class="yiv1255118479msoplaintext">If you don't see bears, you can still
  somewhat identify them by their scat (poop) found on the trail.  Black
  and brown bear scat is very similar.  It will contain bits of twigs,
  leaves, and sometimes rabbit fur or bird feathers.  Grizzly bear scat
  will usually contain bits of brightly colored clothing, little bells, and
  will smell like bear repellant spray. <o:p></o:p></p>

  you can see – part of it was a joke, as it is generally accepted that Grizzly
  bears do not come this far south, being predominantly in Idaho and Washington
  St.  Doesn’t mean they can’t walk the continental divide and come
  south.  But generally, the last grizzly sighting this far south is
  generally accepted as being in the mid 1940s.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

  well be his only human contact.  While I carefully step around him, I do
  sometimes spend a little time checking him out.  It has been interesting
  to see him growing year by year.  BTW – the number of buttons on the

  it has shed its skin.</span> <o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="yiv1255118479msonormal">I lived in Az during my teenage years and I
    had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and
    I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer
    and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time
    hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2
    bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have
    alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we
    are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they
    have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>
    And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I
    still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful.
    Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and
    the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="yiv1255118479msonormal">Well im def. not going to let the snake
    fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing.

<div>
<p class="yiv1255118479msonormal">While searching in the Round Rock cemetary
    we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went
    home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely
    moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont
    mess with any snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted
    to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. <o:p></o:p></p>
</div>
<div>
<p class="yiv1255118479msonormal">Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank
    you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love
    exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few
    snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the water which he
    did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out.
    He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!<o:p></o:p></p>

<p class="yiv1255118479msonormal">Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to
    say that here in Houston we don't get many snakes.  And actually in
    the little space in the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting
    away...which on the inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a
    snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to worry about since it could
    "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he
    sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the
    kids way, of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are
    "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good
    education can go a long way.   I think I'll look into it..but
    just like phone numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant
    remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if
    red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br/>
    Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee
    buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore
    it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore
    them..<br/>

That's hilarious (recognizing bear scat). I did carry bear repellent spray just as a backup, strapped to my backpack, but it was confiscated when I went into Canada. Did you know that it's a felony to transport pepper spray, etc into Canada? Now I know that.<br>
 <br>
If I'd realized it was the Easter Beagle or Great Pumpkin hanging over my head on the trail, I may have left a dog biscuit or two when passing by.<br>

It is ok to be afraid of things.Â  I am somewhat afraid of heights â€“ but I regularly jumped out of aircraft (not since I retired).Â  I am afraid of electricity, but I work in a power plant.Â  Some jobs cause me to sweat and make my hands shake.Â  But I get the job done.<br>
As I posted earlier â€“ my experience is in DESERT snakes â€“ you may encounter slight differences in east Texas.Â  And you might encounter a snake at any time, although there is a lesser chance in cold weather.<br>
Check out this site as a primer.Â  http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/mar/stories/rattlesin.html<br>
Being afraid is OK.Â  It is when you allow that fear to paralyze you into unreasonable avoidance that it really affects your life.Â  Like a person that has been bitten by a dog, and now wants to have all dogs destroyed.Â  Knowledge, thought and caution are usually enough to keep you safe.Â  Donâ€™t lock yourself inside your house just because there might be snakes outside.Â  <grin>.<br>
As to bears â€“ I just sent something to a ham-radio hiker friendâ€¦.Â  Let me see if I can find it for you.<br>
We have bears in the NM mountains just north of me.Â  There are bear warning signs, and even precautions to take right on the trail-head signs.<br>
They warn that black and brown bears are frequently seen, and sometimes even grizzly bears in the more northern mountains bordering Colorado.Â  They warn of approaching bears, or even coming upon them and startling them.Â  They recommend wearing brightly colored clothing, making noise while hiking, and even sewing little bells on your clothing so that the bears know you are coming.Â  They also recommend carrying bear repellant spray.<br>
Another thing they mention is identifying what bears are in the area.Â  If you see them - of course you can tell the difference.Â  Brown bears are brown.Â  Black bears are black, and about the same size as a brown bear.Â  Grizzly bears are also black, but much larger and meaner too.Â  Although they are cute - DO NOT approach any bear cubs under any circumstances!<br>
If you don't see bears, you can still somewhat identify them by their scat (poop) found on the trail.Â  Black and brown bear scat is very similar.Â  It will contain bits of twigs, leaves, and sometimes rabbit fur or bird feathers.Â  Grizzly bear scat will usually contain bits of brightly colored clothing, little bells, and will smell like bear repellant spray.<br>
Really - if you want to know....Â  http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscat.html<br>
Good luck on your next hike.....<br>
As you can see â€“ part of it was a joke, as it is generally accepted that Grizzly bears do not come this far south, being predominantly in Idaho and Washington St.Â  Doesnâ€™t mean they canâ€™t walk the continental divide and come south.Â  But generally, the last grizzly sighting this far south is generally accepted as being in the mid 1940s.<br>
So donâ€™t let the idea of Texas snakes stop you from enjoying the out-doors and finding lots of letterboxes.Â  I guess what I am saying is â€“ donâ€™t let fear control your life.<br>
There is a rock-rattler that lives in a crack in the rocks of a trail that I frequently hike.Â  I see him often, every summer for three years now.Â  I named him Rocky.Â  It is a little-used trail, I could very well be his only human contact.Â  While I carefully step around him, I do sometimes spend a little time checking him out.Â  It has been interesting to see him growing year by year.Â  BTW â€“ the number of buttons on the rattle has nothing to do with the age of the snake, only with how many times it has shed its skin.<br>
Hope you enjoy your boxing adventures.<br>

Thank you for all the information. Between this and what I have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas letterboxing tool. :) <br>
I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br>
And believe me I did alot of research on black bears before we went. I still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<br>
Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. <br>
While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway <shudder> haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. <br>
Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by the water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa. Boys!<br>

Good answer Mike.. .  I was going to say that here in Houston we don't get many snakes.  And actually in the little space in the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to worry about since it could "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can go a long way.   I think I'll look into it..but just like phone numbers,  when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o)  But I'll do my best..<br>
Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee buzzing around, don't swat at it or run around..just sit still and ignore it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br>

Well â€“ as a retired soldier with lots of desert experience, I can say that snakes are truly rare in the late fall through early spring.  Not gone completely, but usually.  I speak for West Texas, the habits in the east may differ somewhat.<br>
Study up on them â€“ respect them, but do not fear them.  And above all, do not mess with them.  Or kill them.<br>
Rattle Snakes do not want to encounter you.  If given the chance they will warn you with a buzz of their tail.<br>
  <br>
If forced into a human encounter, they would rather flee than bite.  <br>

Death from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people.  The very young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc) need to be aware of their situation.  Keep the bite victim calm, and seek medical aid ASAP.  Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is for TV.  Study up on proper first aid for snake bite. <br>

In 20 years I only had to evac one soldier for snake bite.  It was just a cute little baby snake.  He had heard that the baby snakes didnâ€™t bite.  Heh heh heh â€“ just like all guns are loaded, so too are all snakes.  Give them their due, and all will be well. <br>

 somewhat afraid of heights â€“ but I regularly jumped out of aircraft (not since I retired).Â I am afraid of electricity, but I work in a power plant.Â Some jobs cause me to sweat and make my hands shake.Â But I get the job done.<br/>As I posted earlier â€“ my experience is in DESERT snakes â€“ you may encounter slight differences in east Texas.Â And you might encounter a snake at any time, although there is a lesser chance in cold weather.<br/>Check out this site as a primer.Â <a href="http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/mar/stories/rattlesin.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.desertusa.com/mag98/mar/stories/rattlesin.html</a><br/>Being afraid is OK.Â It is when you allow that fear to paralyze you into unreasonable avoidance that it really affects your life.Â Like a person that has been bitten by a dog, and now wants to have all dogs destroyed.Â Knowledge, thought and caution are usually enough to keep you safe.Â Donâ€™t
 lock yourself inside your house just because there might be snakes outside.Â &lt;grin&gt;.<br/>As to bears â€“ I just sent something to a ham-radio hiker friendâ€¦.Â Let me see if I can find it for you.<br/>We have bears in the NM mountains just north of me.Â There are bear warning signs, and even precautions to take right on the trail-head signs.<br/>They warn that black and brown bears are frequently seen, and sometimes even grizzly bears in the more northern mountains bordering Colorado.Â They warn of approaching bears, or even coming upon them and startling them.Â They recommend wearing brightly colored clothing, making noise while hiking, and even sewing little bells on your clothing so that the bears know you are coming.Â They also recommend carrying bear repellant spray.<br/>Another thing they mention is identifying what bears are in the area.Â If you see them - of course you can tell the difference.Â Brown bears are brown.Â Black
 bears are black, and about the same size as a brown bear.Â Grizzly bears are also black, but much larger and meaner too.Â Although they are cute - DO NOT approach any bear cubs under any circumstances!<br/>If you don't see bears, you can still somewhat identify them by their scat (poop) found on the trail.Â Black and brown bear scat is very similar.Â It will contain bits of twigs, leaves, and sometimes rabbit fur or bird feathers.Â Grizzly bear scat will usually contain bits of brightly colored clothing, little bells, and will smell like bear repellant spray.<br/>Really - if you want to know....Â <a href="http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscat.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.bear-tracker.com/blackbearscat.html</a><br/>Good luck on your next hike.....<br/>As you can see â€“ part of it was a joke, as it is generally accepted that Grizzly bears do not come this far south, being predominantly in Idaho and Washington St.Â
 Doesnâ€™t mean they canâ€™t walk the continental divide and come south.Â But generally, the last grizzly sighting this far south is generally accepted as being in the mid 1940s.<br/>So donâ€™t let the idea of Texas snakes stop you from enjoying the out-doors and finding lots of letterboxes.Â I guess what I am saying is â€“ donâ€™t let fear control your life.<br/>There is a rock-rattler that lives in a crack in the rocks of a trail that I frequently hike.Â I see him often, every summer for three years now.Â I named him Rocky.Â It is a little-used trail, I could very well be his only human contact.Â While I carefully step around him, I do sometimes spend a little time checking him out.Â It has been interesting to see him growing year by year.Â BTW â€“ the number of buttons on the rattle has nothing to do with the age of the snake, only with how many times it has shed its skin.<br/>Hope you enjoy your boxing

Between this and what I have read on AQ boards a good, long walking stick will be a new Texas letterboxing tool. :) <br/>I lived in Az during my teenage years and I had lost my fear of running into a snake, 6 years of hiking and camping and I never even saw one. But I have been back in the midwest for a lot longer and the fear has returned. Plus another, bears. We spent alot of time hiking in Minnesota a couple years ago and I only managed to hike in 2 bear country state parks before I let me fears stop us. They seem to have alot of simalarities to snakes only they dont have a 'rattle' to warn us we are getting close. Ha. I have met a few people on the trails that say they have hiked Minnesota for years and have never seen a bear. <br/>And believe me I did alot of research on
 black bears before we went. I still couldnt shake that fear but I still enjoyed the parks, so beautiful. Although my husband said I talked alot more than usual. Haha. Nerves ( and the research said make lots of noise and the bears will avoid you) :)<br/>Well im def. not going to let the snake fear stop me. I love Texas so far and LOVE the places ive seen letterboxing. <br/>While searching in the Round Rock cemetary we did find a bunch of little snakes that looked like big worms. We went home and googled them. We believe they were Rough Earth Snakes. Barely moved. We didnt mess with them because we didnt know what they were (I wont mess with any snake anyway &lt;shudder&gt; haha) but my son really wanted to pick one up but I wouldnt let him. Haha. <br/>Anyway...great information from Mike. Thank you. Im going to forward it to my son since they live there and love exploring and finding new parks to wonder around in. They have seen a few snakes, mostly in/by
 the water, and one time an egg in the water which he did pick up and thought he saw a snake in the egg and it freaked him out. He said he will never pick up an egg again. Hahaa.

 AM<br/><br/>Good answer Mike.. . I was going to say that here in Houston we don't get many snakes. And actually in the little space in the back corner of my house, were the wood is rotting away...which on the inside is actually the corner of my closet...we found a snake skin...i asked DH if i had anything to worry about since it could "possibly" lead to my closet and he "uh no"...if he sees a snake he just picks him up and moves him someplace safer out of the kids way, of course he knows which ones are poisonous and which ones are "safe"...I just call him if i see one but Mike is right..a good education can go a long way. I think I'll look into it..but just like phone numbers, when I'm stressed and freaked out..i cant remember my husbands office number so i doubt I'll be able to remember if red and yeller will kill a feller or not..;o) But I'll do my best..<br/>Of course my "bee theory" had held up well..If you see a bee buzzing around, don't swat at it or
 run around..just sit still and ignore it...I've never been stung by a bee and i think it's cuz i just ignore them..<br/>Carol<br/><br/>On 9/11/2010 9:53 PM, Mike Olbrisch wrote: <br/><br/>Well â€“ as a retired soldier with lots of desert experience, I can say that snakes are truly rare in the late fall through early spring. Not gone completely, but usually. I speak for West Texas, the habits in the east may differ somewhat.<br/>Study up on them â€“ respect them, but do not fear them. And above all, do not mess with them. Or kill them.<br/>Rattle Snakes do not want to encounter you. If given the chance they will warn you with a buzz of their tail.<br/><br/>If forced into a human encounter, they would rather flee than bite. <br/><br/>If cornered, they will strike. Most snake bites happen in two ways. The snake is found suddenly in an unexpected place and startled, or people do not listen and try to mess with the snake. <br/><br/>If a snake bites you,
 sometimes they do not inject venom. This is more true with older and larger snakes. But you cannot count on that. Smaller snakes are more dangerous than the larger ones for several reasons. First, they are not as frightening, so people will be more likely to mess with them. Second, when they strike they nearly always dump all the venom they have into the bite. <br/><br/>Death from snake bite is a rare thing for normal healthy people. The very young, very old, and those with reactionary troubles (like bee stings etc) need to be aware of their situation. Keep the bite victim calm, and seek medical aid ASAP. Cutting the wound and sucking out the venom is for TV. Study up on proper first aid for snake bite. <br/><br/>Knowledge is power. Most people fear what they do not understand. Kind of like hoplophobic people, what they do not understand frightens them. Knowledge and experience usually conquers those fears. So it should be with snakes. Knowledge and
 precaution is all you need. Use a stick to poke â€“ not your hand. Use a grabber to reach the box, not your arm. If you see a snake, remember it belongs there, you are a visitor in its land. Give it the respect it is due by yielding the trail to it, and you will be fine. Most snakes cannot quite strike as far as they are long, but give it as much room as you can. <br/><br/>In 20 years I only had to evac one soldier for snake bite. It was just a cute little baby snake. He had heard that the baby snakes didnâ€™t bite. Heh heh heh â€“ just like all guns are loaded, so too are all snakes. Give them their due, and all will be well. <br/><br/>Hope this is helpful. <br/><br/>Vy73 - Mike - KD9KC<br/>El Paso, Texas - DM61rt<br/>W5-SOTA Association Manager <br/>W5-SOTA info: <a href="http://www.qsl.net/kd9kc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">http://www.qsl.net/kd9kc</a><br/><br/>Molon labe.

Between an LTC that is challenging me, my kitchen being remodeled (the mircowave is on my craft
 table!)and starting a direct sales business I havent been on top of all the other areas of life lately. But im here now. :)<br/>I live in Northwest Iowa. I have a son, Jordan, who lives in Austin, TX with his wife, April and daughter, Sophia. I try to visit them at least once a year. We have only went boxing once during a visit. They loved it. April even started carving. Sophia LOVES stamping and finding the box (after Grandma does all the work looking for it. :))Jordan even tried his hand at carving. They both love to draw so I hope its something they continue and maybe even look for some boxes when im not there. I havent been in letterboxing for very long, a little over a year. Lately I have been into the LTC's but I have let them overrun me and am planning on taking a break so get some scrapbooking done and try, try to get better at quilting. I also want to plant some more letterboxes in my area since its still pretty quiet around here. I get some
 finds, most are accidents, very few log them but I still love doing it. I have a box ready to be planted in Austin, in the 'backyard' of the apartments my son lives at. I hope to do that in November. I am married to a great supportive guy. He probly wouldnt letterbox on his own but has found every box with me and helps me with the directions and stuff planting mine. We also geocache, Yikes I know. Haha. I was lucky enough to meet some boxers in Austin in March. It was my first gathering. Dawns Glory organized it to meet me, yes me. I was kinda shy, not sure what to do. But I felt special anyway. :) I got some great advice about carving a portrait, I practiced with a carving of Poe for an LTC but havent tried Sophia yet which is who I want to carve.<br/>And ive rambled on forever. I normally dont go on so much, you probly wont even know im here most of the time. :) <br/>Thanks for the invite to the group. I have a question ( we'll find out who survived
 reading this to the end. haha) Do the snakes ever hibernate in Texas? Is there ever a 'safe' time of year from them? Just wondering. <br/><br/></div></div></div></blockquote></td></tr></table><br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, Dewberry. All very good advice! We're driving my convertible up to the mountains so there won't be room for much in the trunk except the car top, so I've been adviced to only bring essentials by my LSS. Obviously that's my hiking stick with the bear bell, and my backpack. Since the wildfires around Boulder have probably driven the mountain lions west, they'll be in a grumpy mood and probably hungry, so I'll throw a couple of cans of Friskies in my pack. But I don't think I'll be able to get my snowshoes in the trunk so I'll probably have to just wear them in the car. I certainly can travel light... but I just don't like to!<br>

<div>So happy to have another letterboxer in my neighborhood!  I am

<p>Hello! I am Campfire Critters and am from the San Antonio area. I just found 
out that letterboxing existed after looking on Pinterst a few weeks ago after a 
trip to Bastrop State Park. I was looking for camping activities to do with kids

that I looked up all the info I could on making a stamp, made one, and got

Letterboxing is a great way to express your inner creative self while enjoying the great outdoors, so I hope you and your family will enjoy it as much as this group does.  Interesting that you were just at Bastrop SP since we just had our 10th TX Annual Letterbox Event (TALE) nearby in Buescher SP.  It is a great way to put faces to names on this list and is held the first Saturday of March every year in different locations.  There might be other events throughout the year so I recommend looking on Atlas Quest to see if any are near you.  I also recommend searching through the archives of this list to get a feel for our history and possibly answer some questions you didn't even know you had.  Have fun!<br>

If you would like me to email you the presentation made at the TALE 10 event (which gave history, stories, pictures, etc of all the annual events and people who attended), send me an email to babybearlb2002@yahoo.com, and let me know if you want in PDF or Power Point format.   I will then email it to you.  <br>

Thank you all for the welcomes!  It's fun hearing from you guys.  Especially since I've already seen some of your names on logs and/or have found some of your boxes.  <br>
<br>
Silver Eagle: I wish I had discovered letter boxing just a little bit sooner!  TALE sounds like a great event!  I actually tried to ride my bike over to Buescher from Bastrop SP, but I had no idea how tough the hills are on that road and didn't quite make it!<br>
