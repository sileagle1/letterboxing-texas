<div> </div>
<div>A hitchhiker is a stamp and logbook that travels together from box to box.  If you open a box and find the stamp and log that belongs in the box, plus another stamp/logbook - probably in a baggie - you've found a hitchhiker!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What do you do with it?  If you will be boxing again soon, you can take it with you and move it to a new host box.  If you aren't likely to be finding another box soon, it's probably best to stamp it in your logbook but leave it for someone who can keep it moving.  Before you take it though, you should make sure it has been imprinted into the logbook of the box where you found it and that the box's stamp has been imprinted into the HH's book.  After you take it, you can stamp it into your logbook and stamp your stamp into it's logbook.  When you place it in a new box, take the time to go ahead and exchange imprints with the new host also, in case the person who gets it next isn't as savvy as you about HH's or just flat forgets to do the imprint. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The hitchhiker logbook should be a record of where it's been and who it's met, so basically, any stamp it comes into contact with should be recorded in the log.  By the same token, it wants to leave it's mark everywhere it goes, so any personal logbook and box logbook should get its imprint.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If a HH has specific directions (i.e. "please help this hitchhiker get back to Kansas by summer"), honor those directions if possible.  If not, you are free to place it anywhere - and you don't necessarily have to leave it in the NEXT box, you can leave it in a box near your home, or in your last box of the day, or somewhere where you know someone specific is likely to find it.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hitchhikers don't get tracked nearly as well as regular boxes, so please favor the creator with a quick email to tell them where their HH is.  I have one that started out right here in East Texas, but is currently touring the far northeast - last I heard it was heading to Maine!

<div>What else am I forgetting?  What about creating a HH?<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
