<div> </div>
<div>Too many Shiners make Luckenbach have many correct spellings, right?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It looks like there are two boxes in Luckenbach (no Shiners for me - yet).  Did you happen to try Monarchtrailer's Let's Go To Luckenbach as well?  It appears is might be missing as well, since the last attempt was October 2nd.  I told Fearless Fox I have to go to Luckenbach no matter what, just to say I've been.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The Benini Sculpture Ranch is very high on my list, and now you've said what you have about Cancan's box, it's a must-do.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Thanks for the info!</div>

<p>Hey Y'all, <br/><br/>I"ve just finished putting together my clue book for a trip to the Fredericksburg area this next weekend and I now need to get the details wrapped up. Is there anything I need to know about boxes there, or the area in general? <br/>
<br/>Any WOM clues I could beg for? <br/><br/>Any boxes with problems I can help with? <br/><br/>Any boxes with problems it would be helpful to know about? <br/><br/>Any place that is begging for a box? <br/><br/>Gotta go to restaurants? (Nothing too nice - we ARE camping after all) <br/>
<br/>We're going to be light-packing/camping in the area, and the one hard and fast thing we've got on the agenda timewise is a run in to Austin for REI's garage sale on Saturday. We'll be in the area for several days and are planning to go to Johnson City, Luckenbach, Stonewall, Enchanted Rock, and Pedernales Falls basically. <br/>
<br/>Thanks for any help you can give! <br/><br/>Lucy</p></div></div></div></blockquote>

few blocks away has more lights in trees than I've ever seen.  Also, <br>
if you have time, Pedernales Falls SP is not far from there and is a <br>
nice park with a few boxes.  <br>
<br>
That whole area is great, and if you follow the trail of letterboxes <br>
you will experience most of it, including good wine.  Have fun!<br>

<p>Try to go to Johnson City at night to see the Christmas lights if <br/>they are still up. The courthouse is awesome and the power company a <br/>few blocks away has more lights in trees than I've ever seen. Also, <br/>
if you have time, Pedernales Falls SP is not far from there and is a <br/>nice park with a few boxes. <br/><br/>That whole area is great, and if you follow the trail of letterboxes <br/>you will experience most of it, including good wine. Have fun!<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Thank you for all the nice comments regarding Cock's Crow, this was my first plant. And I love the cavorting SE picture!  <br/><br/>The Hill Country needs boxes...lots and lots and lots of boxes.  Luckenbach makes me very sad and definately needs a rebox! Unfortunately every box has been rather short lived in that town...and I think a new placement would require it to be complete out of muggle territory. Where that is, I do not know because the last several placements, I did consider out of the way.  Same goes for the Unbroken Promises location...I was greatly disappointed to have missed that one. <br/>
<br/>I would love to know if my Extreme Turkey Trot is doing well...and would jump on the opportunity to come out there and "help" you...if we didn't already have plans.<br/><br/>So you're interested in boxes to hunt...<br/>

<br/>Fredericksburg-Brautigam Garten, Cross Mtn, and House  Cat Blues<br/>N. of Fredericksburg near Willow City Loop (great wildflowers in the right season)-Follow the Rainbow to Gold<br/>S. of Fredericksburg-Morris Ranch and Yellow Roads of Texas<br/>
Old Tunnel Wildlife Mgmt Area (9 miles south of 290-SE of Fredericksburg) Going Batty at the Tunnel and my two Grapetown boxes on the way there - BTW one block east of the Old Tunnel is the fabulous <b>Alamo Springs Cafe</b>- this place is in the middle of nowhere on a dead end folks and has great burgers and fries and onion rings and the best homemade desserts, actually everything I've had here was good. Try the Chedder Jalepeo bun if you get a burger and don't be surprised when they keep erasing the desserts off the blackboard (so if you want one better tell them to save you one when you order your meal...even at lunch!).<br/>
<br/>Wineries, wineries...I'm not a wine hound...and I see Becker's Winery (Stonewall) is missing, but go there anyway (love
the Cabernet filled chocolates, a splurge at $6 for a box of 4, but buy
them anyway)... and you can take in the lavender farm too in season.  Torre de Pietra has Sat entertainment...don't miss 6x World Champion Fiddle player Bart Trotter if he is here (he also plays Hondo's in Fredericksburg quite often).<br/>
<br/>On the other hand...I DO love a good beer...and rarely miss a chance to stop at the Fredericksburg Brewing Company in downtown Fredericksburg...my reward for making it to the top of Enchanted Rock!  I like the sausage plate and the Pioneer Porter.<br/>
<br/>Check out the mystery boxes...I think there are a couple still out there.  I just found one on a list that I overlooked all this time. It was last found in 2006, but I found it under Mystery, Mystery and it looks like it might be in the close proximity of two in the above list and may be worth the looksie if you are in the vacinity.  Another on a WOM webpage I have hunted for 2x and not found, but would look anyway if I were on the trail.<br/>
<br/>Hope I didn't leave out any boxes...The Hill Country...it's one of my all time favorite places.<br/><br/>I know you will have a wonderful time! <br/><br/>Have a Safe and Happy New Year,<br/>Cancan<br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">

<p>Hey Y'all,
<br/>
<br/>I"ve just finished putting together my clue book for a trip to the Fredericksburg area this next weekend and I now need to get the details wrapped up.  Is there anything I need to know about boxes there, or the area in general?
<br/>
<br/>Any WOM clues I could beg for?
<br/>
<br/>Any boxes with problems I can help with?
<br/>
<br/>Any boxes with problems it would be helpful to know about?
<br/>
<br/>Any place that is begging for a box?
<br/>
<br/>Gotta go to restaurants?  (Nothing too nice - we ARE camping after all)
<br/>
<br/>We're going to be light-packing/camping in the area, and the one hard and fast thing we've got on the agenda timewise is a run in to Austin for REI's garage sale on Saturday.  We'll be in the area for several days and are planning to go to Johnson City, Luckenbach, Stonewall, Enchanted Rock, and Pedernales Falls basically.
<br/>
<br/>Thanks for any help you can give!
<br/>
<br/>Lucy</p>
