was to do that right away.  A week later I made it over there and, <br>
b/c of the great advice I got here, went to the visitor center and <br>
asked if there was someone I could talk to about planting <br>
letterboxes.  Of course, I got the quizzical expression and then a <br>
park ranger from the "back room" came walking out asking if that was <br>
anything like geocaching!!!  I had brought with me one box all ready <br>
to show, some clues and a lot of courage (I am usually pretty <br>
timid).  I ended up walking away super excited to talk to the new <br>
park manager tomorrow and hike the park.  The park ranger I talked <br>
to was getting everyone else there excited about the idea of such <br>
great, "clean fun" (as she put it) coming to her park.  The main <br>
warning (if you could call it that) was that they didn't want anyone <br>
being led off the trails as this is a natural area over the Edward's <br>
Aquifer recharge zone and there were endangered species in the <br>
area...I told her with 5 children, I would definitely NOT be going <br>
too far off the trail.  <br>
<br>
Sadly, I won't be able to plant the boxes before our San Antonio <br>
event, but at least I'll be able to let everyone know to be watching <br>
out for them!!!  <br>
