<div>Hi Yall-</div>
<div>My name is Kristie and I am new to letterboxing.  We had a friend to introduce it to us and am now HOOKED!!  My husband and I have a daughter, 5 years, and a son that is 2.  Our whole family is enjoying this new found hobby!  Even our son feels like he has a job to do when it comes to letterboxing.... we let him stamp our stamp in the found boxes... So, if you ever see lankin's purple monkeys, you will know it is us!!</div>
<div>We live in Brenham, which is Blue Bell country and I stay at home with my babies!  We haven't started hiding our own stamps, but I imagine it is in the near future.  We plan to take a road trip this summer to the Hot Springs, Arkansas area and have started maping out some letterboxing stops along the way.  We cannot wait to see what we find!</div>
<div>Have a great summer!!<br/> </div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay, that makes sense, thanks for the clarification.  The group seems to be extra quiet right now, but if you have questions about letterboxing, this is the place to post them.  You have letterboxes all around you, so have fun finding them, and be sure to let the placers know when you do.<br>
