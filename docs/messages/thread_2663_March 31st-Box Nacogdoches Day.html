<div> </div>
<div>How about we box that day in Nacogdoches and meet up at Java Jack's around, say, 4 p.m.?  TrailCat is going to check around a bit to see where else we might meet, but JJ has a nice little upstairs area we could commandeer.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm going to go ahead and set it up as a gathering on AQ, and if you would like to RSVP you can so we can know who's going to be out there and who we might run into.  Also, if you are new to boxing and would like to tag along with someone else, or if you are going to be alone and would like to team up with someone, the RSVP list will be helpful in that respect also.

<div>This is all thrown out there and subject to change based on comments, so tell me what you all think!<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
