                    <html><body><div>My Homestead Hitchhiker Hostel is about to be retired due to the fact that they have built some apartments in the same complex where the box is located.  The apartments are for elderly and low-income families, so I'm thinking those pesky old people are gonna be out in the field where the box is messing things up and playing around and it won't be long until they find my box and do who knows what with it.  Consequently, I'm going to retire it and disseminate the hh's in it.  They still have about a month's worth of work to do before they can rent the first unit, so I'm shooting to retire it on April 30th.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I bring this up because it's kind of a fun box to solve and find and there may be someone out there who has it on their list to get.  If you do, you'd better get it quick!  It's been a lot of fun having a hostel out there and I'll probably set up another one somewhere around, but it will be an all new box so it can count as a new find.<br/>
