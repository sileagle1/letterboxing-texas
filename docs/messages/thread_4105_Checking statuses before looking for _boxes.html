                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hey lucy, that is what I do.  I go on AQ and find all the boxes for an <br>
area and hit print clues. Then I paste it into an email and email it to <br>
myself on my phone.  If I find myself somewhere that I don't have clues <br>
for them I use my mobile Internet to to look and see if there are any <br>
nearby boxes.  No paper needed!<br>
<br>
Well ok when Princessa and I went after the 76 boxes in Jacksonville we <br>
did print them all. That was a mass attack day!<br>
