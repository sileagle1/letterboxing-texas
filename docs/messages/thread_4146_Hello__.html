<div>Hello everyone I'm Carol.  Was a member of the 
group a long time ago and Letterboxed with my daughter but then I had two more 
lovely babies and letterboxing in Texas heat while carrying little ones got a 
little too taxing for me..LOL  Now they are 5 and 3 and follow directions 
fairly well so I'm trying to get back into letterboxing with all three kids...I 
have a 9yo girl as well.  I live in NW Houston Spring/Klein area and would 
like to take them somewhere close by.  I thought there were some 
letterboxes in Meyer park off cypresswood dr but cant seem to find any 
listed.  Does anyone know if there are any boxes in Meyer park or close to 
this side of town?  I know we could go to Mercer arb but I was actually 
looking for places even closer...LOL</div>

<div>Thanks for any info</div>
