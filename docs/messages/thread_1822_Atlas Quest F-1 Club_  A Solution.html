Mike, give it a try.<br/>

&gt; Hmmmm....   I am not so much uncomfortable about it as I am <br/>
perplexed by it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I just in the last few days got around to registering on AQ.  And <br/>
I placed<br/>
&gt; my 5 letterboxes on it.  The problem is that there are NO OTHER <br/>
boxes listed<br/>
&gt; that I have found.  So I guess I will remain findless on AQ, <br/>
unless I find a<br/>
&gt; way to convince it I have some finds already.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I guess it is possible that there is another box on there I have <br/>
found.  But<br/>
&gt; if it is an F-1, I will never see it.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; So, you got to get your F-1 somewhere.  But you can't get it on <br/>
AQ.  And you<br/>
&gt; can't see much on AQ unless you get your F-1.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; Very perplexing!<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is actually a point I'd like to discuss and get feedback from <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; Texas letterboxers about.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; A few months ago, when you listed a clue on AQ, a box started <br/>
popping<br/>
&gt; up that would ask you if you wanted to hide this clue from search<br/>
&gt; engines (like Google).  I checked yes, because I don't want my<br/>
&gt; letterbox clues accidentally popping up when a non-letterboxer is<br/>
&gt; searching for info on the Arboretum, for example.  Last week, all <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; those clues with the box checked were converted to F1 clues, <br/>
because<br/>
&gt; that is a more secure way of ensuring that the clues are protected<br/>
&gt; from the search engines.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; So, what do you think?  These are meant to be clues accessible to<br/>
&gt; everyone who's interested (aka letterboxers), and I don't really <br/>
want<br/>
&gt; barriers to accessing the clues.  But, on the other hand, logging <br/>
one<br/>
&gt; find on Atlas Quest in order to see the clues doesn't seem that <br/>
onerous.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As you're the finders, I throw it out to you.  Are you <br/>
uncomfortable<br/>
&gt; with the F1 requirement?  Your thoughts are appreciated.<br/>
&gt; <br/>

&gt; &gt; Since I usually only look at LBNA for clues, I was stumped<br/>
&gt; &gt; when a recent clue that pointed to AQ said "Must belong to<br/>
&gt; &gt; F-1 Club to see clue".  I asked the placer what that meant<br/>
&gt; &gt; and it means you must log at least 1 find in AQ before you<br/>
&gt; &gt; can see the clue.  After doing that I also had to log off<br/>
&gt; &gt; and back on to AQ before it would let me see it.  Just wanted<br/>
&gt; &gt; to pass this on in case some of you have the same problem.<br/>
