State Park and saw quite a few bluebonnets blooming.  It's<br>
not as good as previous years, but still worth seeing.  I<br>
managed to do some letterboxing in the area and highly<br>
recommend visiting all the boxes in Washington County.<br>
Also, I noticed that the picnic pavilion at the Park was<br>
nice with a great view, and there was plenty of camping<br>
spots.  Next time the Event is held this way we will have<br>
to consider Lake Somerville, especially if the wildflowers<br>
are blooming.<br>

P.S.  Wasn't the weather great this weekend?  Woke up Saturday<br>
morning with ice on the tent!<br>
