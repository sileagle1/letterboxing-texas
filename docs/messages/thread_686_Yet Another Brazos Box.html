After a bad month that included a car accident (with accompanying <br>
month-long fight with the insurance company), four cases of the flu, <br>
one blown-out knee with impending surgery, and assorted other <br>
craziness, we decided that we needed to turn our luck around.  So, <br>
we created the Good Luck box, which we hid today at Brazos Bend.  It <br>
is fitting that it go there, as once long ago when we were dating, I <br>
found two four-leaf clovers there.  To make it fit the theme, we hid <br>
this box on the Horseshoe Lake Trail.  <br>
<br>
As luck would have it, I never really loved any of the stamps that I <br>
carved.  So, although we hid one, there are several other versions <br>
carved.  So, just for this event, they will be Asterix' and my <br>
personal travelers (I'm not sure what you call that).  Asterix will <br>
be easy to recognize, if he's feeling well enough to come, as he <br>
will be the one on crutches.  If not, I'll have the assorted good <br>
luck stamps with me.  To get our travelers, just tell us why you <br>
deserve some good luck.<br>
<br>
The boys will hopefully each have their own travelers.  You can <br>
probably just ask them for theirs--plans are for them to each have a <br>
stamp of something they really like.  <br>
<br>
We had a great day.  I am sorry we just missed Droop.  I can confirm <br>
that the park was absolutely crawling with people (and gators), but <br>
with gorgeous weather like this, people wanted to be OUTSIDE.  <br>
