                    <html><body><div>For those who were wondering about BoxDN here recently, I saw that he posted an update on the AQ Louisiana board.  He said that he has only occasional internet access "because it isn't high on his priority list, nor is letterboxing, right now."  He recently went to find one of his boxes, only to find it missing, and he is presuming all his other boxes are missing as well and has marked them so on LBNA and is apparently working on it on AQ.  He said he would one day replant them, and hopefully that is so.

<div>For those of you who don't know BoxDN, he is a one-of-a-kind guy from New Orleans who came to the second Annual gathering and made beignets and spearheaded a wild and woolly night boxing foray and acted as an emissary to the BEAs and brought cool t-shirts.  He is sorely missed on the LB scene, but as with so many New Orleanians, his priorities have been greatly simplified over the past year.
