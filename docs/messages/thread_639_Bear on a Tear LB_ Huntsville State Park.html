Hello southern friends, before leaving Texas I planted a LB in<br>
Huntsville SP where a couple of boxes had gone missing.  The clues<br>
are available by request only to bonafide LBNA folks, sent to them<br>
via their trail name & the LBNA site.  I had 4 requests quite quickly<br>
from LBer's who<br>
are listed, and I sent the clues to them.  Friday I had a request for<br>
clues from "Evosaurus" who I could not find listed on any LB site.  I<br>
asked<br>
them to clarify and did not hear back.  Today I got an email from<br>
someone who said their grandaughter had found Bear On a Tear and had<br>
brought it home.  This box was well hidden off the trail, so an<br>
accidental finding would be very unlikley.  The grandmother (not a<br>
LBer) asked me for the clues so she could put the box back....<br>
Hmmmm?????.  Has anyone been to look for this box?  Is someone making<br>
a collection of Huntsville boxes?  Theives or well meaning folks? <br>
What to do?<br>

I also asked for the clues right after you posted, but we haven't <br>
made it up to Huntsville.  We've all had this awful flu and it's <br>
rained lots of Saturdays recently (aargh, a source of great <br>
frustration for me).  <br>
<br>
I hope the box gets put back properly because we were looking <br>
forward to finding it.  <br>
