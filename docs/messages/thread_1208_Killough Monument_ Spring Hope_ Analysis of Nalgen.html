<br>

line...<br>
<br>
Awhile back, I started thinking toward trying to make<br>
my boxes more ecologically considerate.  I wanted to<br>
find a container that was smaller and less intrusive,<br>
but tough as nails, so I started looking for a good<br>
nalgene container.  If you aren't familiar with<br>
nalgene, the only thing I can tell you is to go to a<br>
backpacking store and ask them to look at a nalgene<br>
drink bottle.  I don't know about knock-off nalgene,<br>
but nalgene brand nalgene is indestructible.  You can<br>
literally run over it with a car (as I've done with<br>
one of my water bottles) and it bounces right back. <br>
You can even bounce it on concrete on its edge and it<br>
doesn't crack or splinter (I know because after<br>
bragging about my water bottle to a friend, I let him<br>
try to destroy it to prove to him how good it is - and<br>
uhhh, I still use the water bottle and he now owns one<br>
too).  I found some 8 ounce nalgene bottles in a white<br>
matte finish with a good waterproof lid, so I bought a<br>
couple to try out ($2 each).  To put the size into<br>
perspective, my average woman-sized hand almost<br>
reaches around the girth of the bottle and it extends<br>
slightly beyond my hand lengthwise.  Here are the good<br>
points:  The bottle size is great - you can get a<br>
small log and stamp in it, with a short marker.  It<br>
was also incredibly waterproof - no moisture in it at<br>
all (and this was a box that lay on the ground).  The<br>
matte finish meant that it didn't reflect light at<br>
all, and even being white it hid easily and was easy<br>
to cover.  The only downside, and it's a biggie: the<br>
neck is too narrow.  You really have to roll the log<br>
to get it back in the bottle, and I'll bet I've gone<br>
through a whole box of baggies replacing torn ones<br>
(thank goodness the bottle was as waterproof as it<br>
is).  I picked the larger of the two neck sizes<br>
available at our closest backpack store, but what I<br>
really want is a bottle with a neck as wide (or nearly<br>
as wide) as the bottle itself.  Soooo...the long and<br>
short of it is - nalgene would make a great container<br>
for waterproofness and toughness, if you - a) go to a<br>
bigger bottle so the neck is larger or b) find the<br>
same capacity bottle with a wider mouth.  If anyone<br>
runs across some, let me know!  <br>
<br>
And now - for my story!  I went to pick up Spring Hope<br>
about dusk this evening.  I was trotting myself back<br>
to my car with it in my hand, when a Harley pulled up<br>
to the park, the rider nodded and rode around to the<br>
back of the property the little park is on and parked.<br>
 He hopped off his bike and strode purposefully to the<br>
area where the box was.  As he got close, I was to my<br>
car, so I tried to find an excuse to slow down a<br>
little, but there was not much for me to do but to get<br>
in my car and leave.  I drove slowly away, and went in<br>
the direction where I could watch him.  He acted like<br>
he had a purpose, but he really wasn't in the exact<br>
right place for the box.  I drove down the road and<br>
turned and came back, and he was just hanging around<br>
(I woulda been thinking GG was a biker, if GG hadn't<br>
JUST been to this box a week ago).  I drove down the<br>
road the other way and turned and came back, and he<br>
was still just hanging around (and by this time, I'm<br>
thinking he's probably wishing that ignorant woman in<br>
the white car would quit turning around and passing by<br>
so she could stare at him).  I finally decided I was<br>
just going to have to stop back at the park and TALK<br>
to him - now my husband would KILL me if he knew I did<br>
this!  By this time, the guy had gone back to his bike<br>
and sat down on it, like he was just hanging out.  I<br>
got OUT of my car, walked all the way back to where he<br>
was.  I got close enough to him and I said "Now, I'm<br>
not trying to get in your business, but would you<br>
happen to be here looking for something?"  (And then I<br>
astutely pointed out to myself that I was sounding<br>
like a prostitute or a drug dealer).  He looked at me<br>
like I was crazy, and asked me to repeat myself - with<br>
a heavy Spanish accent.  Fortunately, I had the<br>
opportunity to reword my question, so I asked him if<br>
he was participating in a game.  And then he looked at<br>
me like I was REALLY crazy - I could see him wondering<br>
if he was understanding my English correctly or if I<br>
had really asked him if he was playing a game.  Well<br>
now, you can imagine I was feeling really STUPID by<br>
then!  I started trying to explain - hide and seek? <br>
And to make matters worse, I decided to try out my<br>
Spanish - now realize, I know enough Spanish to 1) let<br>
you know I'm really mad at you, or 2) tell you to do<br>
plant farm type stuff.  Other than that, my Spanish is<br>
spotty enough to be dangerous.  I finally managed to<br>
extricate myself from this very awkward conversation<br>
and retreat to my car and when I turned around I saw<br>
him laughing to himself and shaking his head.  I am SO<br>
glad I was able to entertain SOMEONE today...sheesh! <br>
But - I still wonder what the heck he was doing<br>
hanging around in MY park!<br>

<div>he had a purpose, but he really wasn't in the exact</div>
<div>right place for the box.  I drove down the road and</div>
<div>turned and came back, and he was just hanging around</div>
<div>(I woulda been thinking GG was a biker, if GG hadn't</div>
<div>JUST been to this box a week ago).  I drove down the</div>
<div>road the other way and turned and came back, and he</div>
<div>was still just hanging around (and by this time, I'm</div>
<div>thinking he's probably wishing that ignorant woman in</div>
<div>the white car would quit turning around and passing by</div>
<div>so she could stare at him).  I finally decided I was</div>
<div>just going to have to stop back at the park and TALK</div>
<div>to him - now my husband would KILL me if he knew I did</div>
<div>this!  By this time, the guy had gone back to his bike</div>
<div>and sat down on it, like he was just hanging out.  I</div>
<div>got OUT of my car, walked all the way back to where he</div>
<div>was.  I got close enough to him and I said "Now, I'm</div>
<div>not trying to get in your business, but would you</div>
<div>happen to be here looking for something?"  (And then I</div>
<div>astutely pointed out to myself that I was sounding</div>
<div>like a prostitute or a drug dealer).  He looked at me</div>
<div>like I was crazy, and asked me to repeat myself - with</div>
<div>a heavy Spanish accent.  Fortunately, I had the</div>
<div>opportunity to reword my question, so I asked him if</div>
<div>he was participating in a game.  And then he looked at</div>
<div>me like I was REALLY crazy - I could see him wondering</div>
<div>if he was understanding my English correctly or if I</div>
<div>had really asked him if he was playing a game.  Well</div>
<div>now, you can imagine I was feeling really STUPID by</div>
<div>then!  I started trying to explain - hide and seek?</div>
<div>And to make matters worse, I decided to try out my</div>
<div>Spanish - now realize, I know enough Spanish to 1) let</div>
<div>you know I'm really mad at you, or 2) tell you to do</div>
<div>plant farm type stuff.  Other than that, my Spanish is</div>
<div>spotty enough to be dangerous.  I finally managed to</div>
<div>extricate myself from this very awkward conversation</div>
<div>and retreat to my car and when I turned around I saw</div>
<div>him laughing to himself and shaking his head.  I am SO</div>
<div>glad I was able to entertain SOMEONE today...sheesh!</div>
<div>But - I still wonder what the heck he was doing</div>
<div>hanging around in MY park!</div>
