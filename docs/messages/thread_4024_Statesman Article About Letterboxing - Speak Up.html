If this topic just doesn't interest anyone so be it, but if you are not posting because you are afraid of upsetting someone, please reconsider.  As long as discussions are kept civil and respectful I think they are a valuable way for us to become better letterboxers.  It's ok, in fact it's healthy, to have some disagreement, as long as you state your reasons in a rational manner.  Here is a chance for some of you that mostly lurk to voice your opinion and be an active part of this group, and I invite you to do so.<br>

I wonder where the reporter is finding letterboxers who are willing to be interviewed for the upcoming article?  Could they be, as this group seems to be, home schoolers?  Does anyone see anything negative about this particular article?  What are the positive things?  I'm sure your point was that the park, McKinney Roughs Nature Park, was very specific and that, if the park management didn't like the idea of letterboxes in their park, this would throw up a red flag to them and put the letterboxes in danger, and you're certainly correct.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">This article mentioned letterboxing as part of a general article about McKinney Roughs.  But another reporter (a "features writer" whatever that is) is doing another story just about letterboxing and has been interviewing several Austin letterboxers - me, Cancan, Bellmotel and others.<br>
<br>
So I am very interested in what people think are the pro's / con's - what is critical information to leave out or put in.  I am not sure exactly when this next article is coming out, but it should be very soon.<br>
<br>
In speaking with the reporter, it seemed to me she understood the need for stealth.  She actually seemed very excited about the hobby and I would not be surprised if she continues to letterbox after the article is finished.  She has already been around town and found many local boxes and seemed very familiar with the local letterboxing scene.  <br>
<br>
She asked if she could take a picture of one of my letterboxes that she found.  The stamp was carved by Kirbert, so I asked him and he was just fine with it.  I personally don't care if she takes a pic of my letterbox... as long as she doesn't say "Hey look at the letterbox I found in the tree at the corner of Walk and Don't Walk"<br>
<br>
Overall, I think publicity is good.. It might bring in some new boxers... Here in Austin we have some newbies that have made incredible contributions to the local letterboxes.  <br>
<br>
As for the downside... When an article is published about letterboxing any malicious soul who really wants to use the information to create havoc is going to.  With access to Atlasquest or LBNA nothing can really be kept totally secret. (except possibly PFX restrictions, WOM, etc). Personally I think most people have better things to do than to deliberately cause trouble, though I am sure we can all think of the exception to that rule.  What is more likely is that new people to the hobby will come bungling in, breaking all the rules, and have a helluva lot of fun anyway.<br>
<br>
A few years ago, I was that newbie... having read that worn out article in the Smithsonian in some doctor's office, I got excited, ran out to Michael's and bought me, my husband, my six children and my best friend each a stamp and a spiral bound pack of 3 x 5 cards and we went, en masse, to Zilker and Shoal Creek and Bastrop and found letterboxes.  We screamed with pleasure when we found them.  We let the kids rehide for us.  We stamped in openly on the trail, so excited we would have LOVED IT if someone has asked what we were all doing just so we could tell.  In short, we were the letterboxing family from hell ... breaking every rule.  ok.  Guilty... But the more we did it, the more we learned and I like to think we've turned into very responsible letterboxers.<br>
<br>
So bottom line, I think some discretion is called for in any article, but we needn't be too sanctimonious about it.  The more the merrier.<br>
