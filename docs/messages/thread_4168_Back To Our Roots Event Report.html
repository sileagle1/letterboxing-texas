                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm back from a week vacation in New England where I was lucky enough to attend the "Back To Our Roots" Letterbox Event held in West Dover, Vermont on 06/20/009.  It celebrated the 10th anniversary of the first Letterbox Event held at the Inn At Long Trail  in Killington, Vermont in 1999 and was hosted by Mark &amp; Sue Pepe.  To say they did a great job does not do them justice and I really appreciate their efforts in making this one of the best Events ever.<br/>
<br/>
When I first heard about this Event, I really wanted to go but knew it would be a hard sell to my non-letterboxing wife.  However, I pitched it as a New England vacation and since she loves that area, she decided to go with me.  We flew out several days before the Event and visited parts of New Hampshire and northern Vermont, enjoying the cool but wet weather (temperature only got up to a HIGH of 65).  We had a great time hiking, watching wildlife and visiting wineries (Vermont makes some good wine and is known for their white cheddar).  I placed and found a few boxes, but the highlight was finding the Prayer Rock letterbox, the first one placed in America.  Another highlight was visiting the site of the first LB Event, and it was fun looking inside where these intrepid pioneers met 10 years ago.<br/>
<br/>
We finally worked our way to West Dover on Friday night, just in time for the pre-event gathering.  As we walked into the Inn where it was held, I saw a couple that just had to be Mark &amp; Sue, so I headed for them.  I said "You must be Mark &amp; Sue" and they asked who I was.  When I told them, it was like we were long lost relatives and I really felt welcomed.  I have wanted to meet them for years, so my main mission of this whole trip was already complete, but little did I know the surprises were just beginning!<br/>
<br/>
After meeting a few other people, Mark asked me if I had seen the surprise guest yet.  I said no, so he pointed out Der Mad Stamper for me.  I must have looked as amazed as I felt because he started laughing and told me to go introduce myself.  Now I have always wanted to meet DMS and have the greatest respect for what he has done for letterboxing (he was one of the founders of LBNA and much of its content was done by him), but I must admit I was a little nervous as I walked over to meet him.  Not knowing what to say, I asked "Are you THE Der Mad Stamper?", and he said "Yes, and who are you?" to which I replied "just a little ole letterboxer from Texas named Silver Eagle".  Well I figured he would nod politely and discreetly move on to talk with other more worthy boxers, but to my surprise he grabbed my hand and shook it saying that I was the main person he wanted to meet that night!  I was dumbfounded but pleased because he proceeded to talk with me for over 15 minutes, patiently answering all my questions as I babbled like a star-struck kid getting to meet his favorite idol, which I was.  It turns out one of the reasons he wanted to meet me is because I am one of the few people that has found some of his remote letterboxes in Kansas.  Way back in 2003, Baby Bear and I traveled all through the mid-west on our Lewis &amp; Clark trip, and that is when we found many of his boxes.  At the time DMS was no longer participating in letterboxing, but I emailed our finds anyway, along with praise for his hiding skills.  Well he read the emails and after getting back into letterboxing he revisited those boxes to check on them.  He told me Baby Bear and I are still about the only people who have visited those boxes, and he just had to meet somebody that would drive all the way to Kansas for a letterbox!<br/>
<br/>
As we were talking, other people started gathering around to find out who this guy was monopolizing all of DMS' time, and when they heard my name, many of them also knew who I was and started talking with me.  Some of them were other big names I have always wanted to meet, including Silent Doug and Choi.  Needless to say, I had a blast and before I knew it the party was over, but I was already looking forward to seeing them again the next day at the main Event.<br/>
<br/>
The next morning, most people just went to the Event location long enough to get their packets of clues, and then were off hunting letterboxes on nearby trails.  Since my wife likes to hike, we decided to do this also, then come back later so I could exchange while she went shopping.  Mark &amp; Sue told me I had to do the "Back To Our Roots" series of boxes if nothing else, so that is where we headed.  I had carved a stamp for the event, and Mark ended up including it in this series as the second box, so I was curious to see how it stood up to the other ones.  Well, after seeing the first stamp, I was very close to stealing the second box and hiding it so nobody would see my inferior stamp, but since I have never claimed to be a great carver, I consoled myself that at least I was part of a great series.  And what great stamps there were!  <br/>
<br/>
Soon, many boxers were on the trails looking for the same boxes, so we joined with a group to make it easier and it was fun talking with them.  At one point, part of the group went ahead to look for the next box while some of us replaced the current box and as we were walking to catch up a biker started riding toward us on the trail.  We asked if he had seen the rest of our group, and he looked disappointed as he said "yes, and they told me to be on the lookout for nude letterboxers on the trail".  Well, the rest of our group all laughed and I figured it was some inside joke, so they explained that in Vermont there is no law against nudity, so it is not uncommon for people to go around naked.  Now I'm normally all for the old saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans", but I declined this time.<br/>
<br/>
After several hours of hiking and boxing, in which my wife performed like a trooper, it was time to head back to the Event.  When she dropped me off there were only a few people there, so I talked with Mark &amp; Sue for a little while until they asked if I was ready for another surprise.  I said yes, so they walked me over to where an older gentleman was sitting and introduced me to Tom Cooch, another original founder of LBNA.  Well I was speechless, but only for a few seconds, since I proceeded to talk his ears off!  After a few minutes, Der Mad Stamper walked over and sat down across from Tom and they started reminiscing about the old days while I listened in rapture.  I couldn't believe I was sitting with two of the original founders of LBNA and had them all to myself!  I was having such a good time that I almost forgot to exchange with them, but finally we got around to it.  At this point, Tom opened his original logbook and as it fell open to the first page, DMS looked at me and said "you know you are looking at the first image of the first letterbox placed in America".  It turns out that Tom was the first finder of Prayer Rock and that was the first stamp in his book.  I asked if he would show me more and he graciously went through each page, explaining each stamp as he went.  There were stamps of many first state boxes, along with a Mapsurfer 4 star box.  Needless to say I was impressed.<br/>
<br/>
Soon other people began arriving and the exchange frenzy started.  I never got up for over 2 hours as people just kept coming over to me.  During this time, Brian of Team Green Dragon sat down across from me and we started talking.  Now I have seen his posts on the Big List for years, and he comes across as a crotchety old man that I figured would be hard to get along with, but he and I hit if off swimmingly.  I'm not sure what this says of me, but we had a lot of fun, especially during the raffle.  I also met many other people whose names I recognized, and it was great putting faces to names.  All too soon it was over and time to say goodbye.  Handshakes were not enough as I found myself hugging everyone, including the guys.  At that moment I felt as close to them as I do to some of my fellow TX letterboxers, and I can only hope you get to meet them some day (many expressed a desire to come to a TX LB Event).<br/>
<br/>
The next day it was time to head out for Maine and our last two days of the trip, but first I wanted to get one more box.  We parked and my wife stayed in the car while I looked for the box across the meadow.  When I got back, she said a guy next door had come outside completely nude to get the paper.  We both laughed and knew we would miss Vermont!<br/>

<div>Wow!  It sounds like a fabulous trip.  I'm so glad you were able 
to go.  Mark and Sue are some of my favorite people ever, and DMS and Raqs 
Enigma are really fun and down to earth too.  I can't wait to hear more at 
our next gathering.  Now what can we do to entice some of those folks to 
visit us in Texas?</div>

Well, after seeing the first stamp, I was very close to stealing the second box and hiding it so nobody would see my inferior stamp, but since I have never claimed to be a great carver, I consoled myself that at least I was part of a great series.  And what great stamps there were!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon, many boxers were on the trails looking for the same boxes, so we joined with a group to make it easier and it was fun talking with them.  At one point, part of the group went ahead to look for the next box while some of us replaced the current box and as we were walking to catch up a biker started riding toward us on the trail.  We asked if he had seen the rest of our group, and he looked disappointed as he said "yes, and they told me to be on the lookout for nude letterboxers on the trail".  Well, the rest of our group all laughed and I figured it was some inside joke, so they explained that in Vermont there is no law against nudity, so it is not uncommon for people to go around naked.  Now I'm normally all for the old saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans", but I declined this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After several hours of hiking and boxing, in which my wife performed like a trooper, it was time to head back to the Event.  When she dropped me off there were only a few people there, so I talked with Mark &amp; Sue for a little while until they asked if I was ready for another surprise.  I said yes, so they walked me over to where an older gentleman was sitting and introduced me to Tom Cooch, another original founder of LBNA.  Well I was speechless, but only for a few seconds, since I proceeded to talk his ears off!  After a few minutes, Der Mad Stamper walked over and sat down across from Tom and they started reminiscing about the old days while I listened in rapture.  I couldn't believe I was sitting with two of the original founders of LBNA and had them all to myself!  I was having such a good time that I almost forgot to exchange with them, but finally we got around to it.  At this point, Tom opened his original logbook and as it fell open to the first page, DMS looked at me and said "you know you are looking at the first image of the first letterbox placed in America".  It turns out that Tom was the first finder of Prayer Rock and that was the first stamp in his book.  I asked if he would show me more and he graciously went through each page, explaining each stamp as he went.  There were stamps of many first state boxes, along with a Mapsurfer 4 star box.  Needless to say I was impressed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon other people began arriving and the exchange frenzy started.  I never got up for over 2 hours as people just kept coming over to me.  During this time, Brian of Team Green Dragon sat down across from me and we started talking.  Now I have seen his posts on the Big List for years, and he comes across as a crotchety old man that I figured would be hard to get along with, but he and I hit if off swimmingly.  I'm not sure what this says of me, but we had a lot of fun, especially during the raffle.  I also met many other people whose names I recognized, and it was great putting faces to names.  All too soon it was over and time to say goodbye.  Handshakes were not enough as I found myself hugging everyone, including the guys.  At that moment I felt as close to them as I do to some of my fellow TX letterboxers, and I can only hope you get to meet them some day (many expressed a desire to come to a TX LB Event).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next day it was time to head out for Maine and our last two days of the trip, but first I wanted to get one more box.  We parked and my wife stayed in the car while I looked for the box across the meadow.  When I got back, she said a guy next door had come outside completely nude to get the paper.  We both laughed and knew we would miss Vermont!<br/>

Thank you so much for posting your story and pictures.  I love being able to live vicariously through others!  I read the account from my phone as I was going to bed last night but seeing the pictures this morning makes it so much better.  Thanks for sharing.  I would love to get some of these boxers to Texas for an event (I'd love to actually be able to attend an event!).  I loved your story.<br/>

&gt; I'm back from a week vacation in New England where I was lucky enough to attend the "Back To Our Roots" Letterbox Event held in West Dover, Vermont on 06/20/009.  It celebrated the 10th anniversary of the first Letterbox Event held at the Inn At Long Trail  in Killington, Vermont in 1999 and was hosted by Mark &amp; Sue Pepe.  To say they did a great job does not do them justice and I really appreciate their efforts in making this one of the best Events ever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first heard about this Event, I really wanted to go but knew it would be a hard sell to my non-letterboxing wife.  However, I pitched it as a New England vacation and since she loves that area, she decided to go with me.  We flew out several days before the Event and visited parts of New Hampshire and northern Vermont, enjoying the cool but wet weather (temperature only got up to a HIGH of 65).  We had a great time hiking, watching wildlife and visiting wineries (Vermont makes some good wine and is known for their white cheddar).  I placed and found a few boxes, but the highlight was finding the Prayer Rock letterbox, the first one placed in America.  Another highlight was visiting the site of the first LB Event, and it was fun looking inside where these intrepid pioneers met 10 years ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We finally worked our way to West Dover on Friday night, just in time for the pre-event gathering.  As we walked into the Inn where it was held, I saw a couple that just had to be Mark &amp; Sue, so I headed for them.  I said "You must be Mark &amp; Sue" and they asked who I was.  When I told them, it was like we were long lost relatives and I really felt welcomed.  I have wanted to meet them for years, so my main mission of this whole trip was already complete, but little did I know the surprises were just beginning!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After meeting a few other people, Mark asked me if I had seen the surprise guest yet.  I said no, so he pointed out Der Mad Stamper for me.  I must have looked as amazed as I felt because he started laughing and told me to go introduce myself.  Now I have always wanted to meet DMS and have the greatest respect for what he has done for letterboxing (he was one of the founders of LBNA and much of its content was done by him), but I must admit I was a little nervous as I walked over to meet him.  Not knowing what to say, I asked "Are you THE Der Mad Stamper?", and he said "Yes, and who are you?" to which I replied "just a little ole letterboxer from Texas named Silver Eagle".  Well I figured he would nod politely and discreetly move on to talk with other more worthy boxers, but to my surprise he grabbed my hand and shook it saying that I was the main person he wanted to meet that night!  I was dumbfounded but pleased because he proceeded to talk with me for over 15 minutes, patiently answering all my questions as I babbled like a star-struck kid getting to meet his favorite idol, which I was.  It turns out one of the reasons he wanted to meet me is because I am one of the few people that has found some of his remote letterboxes in Kansas.  Way back in 2003, Baby Bear and I traveled all through the mid-west on our Lewis &amp; Clark trip, and that is when we found many of his boxes.  At the time DMS was no longer participating in letterboxing, but I emailed our finds anyway, along with praise for his hiding skills.  Well he read the emails and after getting back into letterboxing he revisited those boxes to check on them.  He told me Baby Bear and I are still about the only people who have visited those boxes, and he just had to meet somebody that would drive all the way to Kansas for a letterbox!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we were talking, other people started gathering around to find out who this guy was monopolizing all of DMS' time, and when they heard my name, many of them also knew who I was and started talking with me.  Some of them were other big names I have always wanted to meet, including Silent Doug and Choi.  Needless to say, I had a blast and before I knew it the party was over, but I was already looking forward to seeing them again the next day at the main Event.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next morning, most people just went to the Event location long enough to get their packets of clues, and then were off hunting letterboxes on nearby trails.  Since my wife likes to hike, we decided to do this also, then come back later so I could exchange while she went shopping.  Mark &amp; Sue told me I had to do the "Back To Our Roots" series of boxes if nothing else, so that is where we headed.  I had carved a stamp for the event, and Mark ended up including it in this series as the second box, so I was curious to see how it stood up to the other ones.

Do tell her - we promise to put our best feet forward if she'll grace us at the next gathering...(well, I can't speak for PuddleSplasher, but I think the rest of us would be good).</div>

&gt; I'm back from a week vacation in New England where I was lucky enough to attend the "Back To Our Roots" Letterbox Event held in West Dover, Vermont on 06/20/009.  It celebrated the 10th anniversary of the first Letterbox Event held at the Inn At Long Trail  in Killington, Vermont in 1999 and was hosted by Mark &amp; Sue Pepe.  To say they did a great job does not do them justice and I really appreciate their efforts in making this one of the best Events ever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first heard about this Event, I really wanted to go but knew it would be a hard sell to my non-letterboxing wife.  However, I pitched it as a New England vacation and since she loves that area, she decided to go with me.  We flew out several days before the Event and visited parts of New Hampshire and northern Vermont, enjoying the cool but wet weather (temperature only got up to a HIGH of 65).  We had a great time hiking, watching wildlife and visiting wineries (Vermont makes some good wine and is known for their white cheddar).  I placed and found a few boxes, but the highlight was finding the Prayer Rock letterbox, the first one placed in America.  Another highlight was visiting the site of the first LB Event, and it was fun looking inside where these intrepid pioneers met 10 years ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We finally worked our way to West Dover on Friday night, just in time for the pre-event gathering.  As we walked into the Inn where it was held, I saw a couple that just had to be Mark &amp; Sue, so I headed for them.  I said "You must be Mark &amp; Sue" and they asked who I was.  When I told them, it was like we were long lost relatives and I really felt welcomed.  I have wanted to meet them for years, so my main mission of this whole trip was already complete, but little did I know the surprises were just beginning!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After meeting a few other people, Mark asked me if I had seen the surprise guest yet.  I said no, so he pointed out Der Mad Stamper for me.  I must have looked as amazed as I felt because he started laughing and told me to go introduce myself.  Now I have always wanted to meet DMS and have the greatest respect for what he has done for letterboxing (he was one of the founders of LBNA and much of its content was done by him), but I must admit I was a little nervous as I walked over to meet him.  Not knowing what to say, I asked "Are you THE Der Mad Stamper?", and he said "Yes, and who are you?" to which I replied "just a little ole letterboxer from Texas named Silver Eagle".  Well I figured he would nod politely and discreetly move on to talk with other more worthy boxers, but to my surprise he grabbed my hand and shook it saying that I was the main person he wanted to meet that night!  I was dumbfounded but pleased because he proceeded to talk with me for over 15 minutes, patiently answering all my questions as I babbled like a star-struck kid getting to meet his favorite idol, which I was.  It turns out one of the reasons he wanted to meet me is because I am one of the few people that has found some of his remote letterboxes in Kansas.  Way back in 2003, Baby Bear and I traveled all through the mid-west on our Lewis &amp; Clark trip, and that is when we found many of his boxes.  At the time DMS was no longer participating in letterboxing, but I emailed our finds anyway, along with praise for his hiding skills.  Well he read the emails and after getting back into letterboxing he revisited those boxes to check on them.  He told me Baby Bear and I are still about the only people who have visited those boxes, and he just had to meet somebody that would drive all the way to Kansas for a letterbox!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we were talking, other people started gathering around to find out who this guy was monopolizing all of DMS' time, and when they heard my name, many of them also knew who I was and started talking with me.  Some of them were other big names I have always wanted to meet, including Silent Doug and Choi.  Needless to say, I had a blast and before I knew it the party was over, but I was already looking forward to seeing them again the next day at the main Event.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next morning, most people just went to the Event location long enough to get their packets of clues, and then were off hunting letterboxes on nearby trails.  Since my wife likes to hike, we decided to do this also, then come back later so I could exchange while she went shopping.  Mark &amp; Sue told me I had to do the "Back To Our Roots" series of boxes if nothing else, so that is where we headed.  I had carved a stamp for the event, and Mark ended up including it in this series as the second box, so I was curious to see how it stood up to the other ones.  Well, after seeing the first stamp, I was very close to stealing the second box and hiding it so nobody would see my inferior stamp, but since I have never claimed to be a great carver, I consoled myself that at least I was part of a great series.  And what great stamps there were!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon, many boxers were on the trails looking for the same boxes, so we joined with a group to make it easier and it was fun talking with them.  At one point, part of the group went ahead to look for the next box while some of us replaced the current box and as we were walking to catch up a biker started riding toward us on the trail.  We asked if he had seen the rest of our group, and he looked disappointed as he said "yes, and they told me to be on the lookout for nude letterboxers on the trail".  Well, the rest of our group all laughed and I figured it was some inside joke, so they explained that in Vermont there is no law against nudity, so it is not uncommon for people to go around naked.  Now I'm normally all for the old saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans", but I declined this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After several hours of hiking and boxing, in which my wife performed like a trooper, it was time to head back to the Event.  When she dropped me off there were only a few people there, so I talked with Mark &amp; Sue for a little while until they asked if I was ready for another surprise.  I said yes, so they walked me over to where an older gentleman was sitting and introduced me to Tom Cooch, another original founder of LBNA.  Well I was speechless, but only for a few seconds, since I proceeded to talk his ears off!  After a few minutes, Der Mad Stamper walked over and sat down across from Tom and they started reminiscing about the old days while I listened in rapture.  I couldn't believe I was sitting with two of the original founders of LBNA and had them all to myself!  I was having such a good time that I almost forgot to exchange with them, but finally we got around to it.  At this point, Tom opened his original logbook and as it fell open to the first page, DMS looked at me and said "you know you are looking at the first image of the first letterbox placed in America".  It turns out that Tom was the first finder of Prayer Rock and that was the first stamp in his book.  I asked if he would show me more and he graciously went through each page, explaining each stamp as he went.  There were stamps of many first state boxes, along with a Mapsurfer 4 star box.  Needless to say I was impressed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon other people began arriving and the exchange frenzy started.  I never got up for over 2 hours as people just kept coming over to me.  During this time, Brian of Team Green Dragon sat down across from me and we started talking.  Now I have seen his posts on the Big List for years, and he comes across as a crotchety old man that I figured would be hard to get along with, but he and I hit if off swimmingly.  I'm not sure what this says of me, but we had a lot of fun, especially during the raffle.  I also met many other people whose names I recognized, and it was great putting faces to names.  All too soon it was over and time to say goodbye.  Handshakes were not enough as I found myself hugging everyone, including the guys.  At that moment I felt as close to them as I do to some of my fellow TX letterboxers, and I can only hope you get to meet them some day (many expressed a desire to come to a TX LB Event).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next day it was time to head out for Maine and our last two days of the trip, but first I wanted to get one more box.  We parked and my wife stayed in the car while I looked for the box across the meadow.  When I got back, she said a guy next door had come outside completely nude to get the paper.  We both laughed and knew we would miss Vermont!<br/>

HA! I don't have to put my best foot forward as I've already had the pleasure of meeting Ms. Eagle (perhaps it was at the Moose Meet?), thus I've already attempted to put my best foot forward. However, I would be pleased to visit with her again. At the campfire at TALE 5, we had the honor of visiting with Ms. Bear also, and she shared many embarrassing stories of her adventures with Baby. It was great. <br/>

Funny thing is, we were living in Sugar Land and walking at Lost Creek Park and visiting Brazos Bend SP to walk the trails at the same time you guys were getting started.  Too bad we couldn't have planted a box or two for you to find back then.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Boots, I really appreciate it.  We may have paved the way, but it's people like you that will keep it going.<br/>

&gt; &gt; I, too, offer my thanks for letting us share in your great adventure.  I think you are being a little modest, though, by being surprised at how much pleasure the "pioneers" of letterboxing took in meeting you, because you are truly their peer.  We in Texas are lucky and grateful that you and Baby Bear decided to take up the hobby of letterboxing and paved the way for the rest of us.  We owe you a debt of gratitude.<br/>

&gt; I'm back from a week vacation in New England where I was lucky enough to attend the "Back To Our Roots" Letterbox Event held in West Dover, Vermont on 06/20/009.  It celebrated the 10th anniversary of the first Letterbox Event held at the Inn At Long Trail  in Killington, Vermont in 1999 and was hosted by Mark &amp; Sue Pepe.  To say they did a great job does not do them justice and I really appreciate their efforts in making this one of the best Events ever.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; When I first heard about this Event, I really wanted to go but knew it would be a hard sell to my non-letterboxing wife.  However, I pitched it as a New England vacation and since she loves that area, she decided to go with me.  We flew out several days before the Event and visited parts of New Hampshire and northern Vermont, enjoying the cool but wet weather (temperature only got up to a HIGH of 65).  We had a great time hiking, watching wildlife and visiting wineries (Vermont makes some good wine and is known for their white cheddar).  I placed and found a few boxes, but the highlight was finding the Prayer Rock letterbox, the first one placed in America.  Another highlight was visiting the site of the first LB Event, and it was fun looking inside where these intrepid pioneers met 10 years ago.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We finally worked our way to West Dover on Friday night, just in time for the pre-event gathering.  As we walked into the Inn where it was held, I saw a couple that just had to be Mark &amp; Sue, so I headed for them.  I said "You must be Mark &amp; Sue" and they asked who I was.  When I told them, it was like we were long lost relatives and I really felt welcomed.  I have wanted to meet them for years, so my main mission of this whole trip was already complete, but little did I know the surprises were just beginning!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After meeting a few other people, Mark asked me if I had seen the surprise guest yet.  I said no, so he pointed out Der Mad Stamper for me.  I must have looked as amazed as I felt because he started laughing and told me to go introduce myself.  Now I have always wanted to meet DMS and have the greatest respect for what he has done for letterboxing (he was one of the founders of LBNA and much of its content was done by him), but I must admit I was a little nervous as I walked over to meet him.  Not knowing what to say, I asked "Are you THE Der Mad Stamper?", and he said "Yes, and who are you?" to which I replied "just a little ole letterboxer from Texas named Silver Eagle".  Well I figured he would nod politely and discreetly move on to talk with other more worthy boxers, but to my surprise he grabbed my hand and shook it saying that I was the main person he wanted to meet that night!  I was dumbfounded but pleased because he proceeded to talk with me for over 15 minutes, patiently answering all my questions as I babbled like a star-struck kid getting to meet his favorite idol, which I was.  It turns out one of the reasons he wanted to meet me is because I am one of the few people that has found some of his remote letterboxes in Kansas.  Way back in 2003, Baby Bear and I traveled all through the mid-west on our Lewis &amp; Clark trip, and that is when we found many of his boxes.  At the time DMS was no longer participating in letterboxing, but I emailed our finds anyway, along with praise for his hiding skills.  Well he read the emails and after getting back into letterboxing he revisited those boxes to check on them.  He told me Baby Bear and I are still about the only people who have visited those boxes, and he just had to meet somebody that would drive all the way to Kansas for a letterbox!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; As we were talking, other people started gathering around to find out who this guy was monopolizing all of DMS' time, and when they heard my name, many of them also knew who I was and started talking with me.  Some of them were other big names I have always wanted to meet, including Silent Doug and Choi.  Needless to say, I had a blast and before I knew it the party was over, but I was already looking forward to seeing them again the next day at the main Event.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next morning, most people just went to the Event location long enough to get their packets of clues, and then were off hunting letterboxes on nearby trails.  Since my wife likes to hike, we decided to do this also, then come back later so I could exchange while she went shopping.  Mark &amp; Sue told me I had to do the "Back To Our Roots" series of boxes if nothing else, so that is where we headed.  I had carved a stamp for the event, and Mark ended up including it in this series as the second box, so I was curious to see how it stood up to the other ones.  Well, after seeing the first stamp, I was very close to stealing the second box and hiding it so nobody would see my inferior stamp, but since I have never claimed to be a great carver, I consoled myself that at least I was part of a great series.  And what great stamps there were!  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon, many boxers were on the trails looking for the same boxes, so we joined with a group to make it easier and it was fun talking with them.  At one point, part of the group went ahead to look for the next box while some of us replaced the current box and as we were walking to catch up a biker started riding toward us on the trail.  We asked if he had seen the rest of our group, and he looked disappointed as he said "yes, and they told me to be on the lookout for nude letterboxers on the trail".  Well, the rest of our group all laughed and I figured it was some inside joke, so they explained that in Vermont there is no law against nudity, so it is not uncommon for people to go around naked.  Now I'm normally all for the old saying "When in Rome, do as the Romans", but I declined this time.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; After several hours of hiking and boxing, in which my wife performed like a trooper, it was time to head back to the Event.  When she dropped me off there were only a few people there, so I talked with Mark &amp; Sue for a little while until they asked if I was ready for another surprise.  I said yes, so they walked me over to where an older gentleman was sitting and introduced me to Tom Cooch, another original founder of LBNA.  Well I was speechless, but only for a few seconds, since I proceeded to talk his ears off!  After a few minutes, Der Mad Stamper walked over and sat down across from Tom and they started reminiscing about the old days while I listened in rapture.  I couldn't believe I was sitting with two of the original founders of LBNA and had them all to myself!  I was having such a good time that I almost forgot to exchange with them, but finally we got around to it.  At this point, Tom opened his original logbook and as it fell open to the first page, DMS looked at me and said "you know you are looking at the first image of the first letterbox placed in America".  It turns out that Tom was the first finder of Prayer Rock and that was the first stamp in his book.  I asked if he would show me more and he graciously went through each page, explaining each stamp as he went.  There were stamps of many first state boxes, along with a Mapsurfer 4 star box.  Needless to say I was impressed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Soon other people began arriving and the exchange frenzy started.  I never got up for over 2 hours as people just kept coming over to me.  During this time, Brian of Team Green Dragon sat down across from me and we started talking.  Now I have seen his posts on the Big List for years, and he comes across as a crotchety old man that I figured would be hard to get along with, but he and I hit if off swimmingly.  I'm not sure what this says of me, but we had a lot of fun, especially during the raffle.  I also met many other people whose names I recognized, and it was great putting faces to names.  All too soon it was over and time to say goodbye.  Handshakes were not enough as I found myself hugging everyone, including the guys.  At that moment I felt as close to them as I do to some of my fellow TX letterboxers, and I can only hope you get to meet them some day (many expressed a desire to come to a TX LB Event).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The next day it was time to head out for Maine and our last two days of the trip, but first I wanted to get one more box.  We parked and my wife stayed in the car while I looked for the box across the meadow.  When I got back, she said a guy next door had come outside completely nude to get the paper.  We both laughed and knew we would miss Vermont!<br/>
