                    <div class="plaintext-content">Stuck at home with a sick kid today, instead of finding TeamKing's The<br>
Birds as planned, so I am pondering what I carry around.  Some of this<br>
is in the car, some is in the pack:<br>
<br>
A full first aid kit, always.  You don't know how many times I've been<br>
the one at the park who is able to produce an automatic ice kit, bee<br>
sting medicine, bandaid, etc.  My husband laughs hysterically at me<br>
because I believe you can never have too many first aid kits--I have a<br>
big one at home, a little one in the pack and a medium one in the car.<br>
 To the usual, I have to add a poison ivy wash called tecnu. The more<br>
I letterbox, the less tolerant I get of PI.  All for emergency people<br>
repair.<br>
<br>
A car emergency kit with cables, etc. For minor emergency car repair<br>
(the big stuff I have to call for help)<br>
<br>
A box in the car with extra containers, baggies, logbooks, etc. for<br>
emergency box repair.<br>
<br>
Water, trail mix, raisins, crayons, pencils, paper, maze & puzzle<br>
books, and goldfish for emergency whiny kid repair.<br>
<br>
So, I've been contemplating changing my trail name.  Maybe I should be<br>
the Repair Lady (but then people might think I could fix stuff, which<br>
is far, far, far from the truth).<br>
<br>
Add to that maps, maps and more maps!  I love maps!  But I couldn't<br>
fit it into the repair motif.<br>

                <div class="message-content">
                    <div class="plaintext-content">We love Tecnu!  My daughter is terribly, terribly<br>
allergic to PI, and (as you mentioned) the more she is<br>
exposed to it the less tolerant she has become.  Tecnu<br>
makes it possible for her to get off the sidewalk and<br>
have fun.  We are considering buying stock in the<br>
company!<br>
<br>
I carry the same first aid kit - always and forever. <br>
My clan and my extended clan (cub scouts) have an<br>
ongoing need for first aid stuff.<br>
<br>
I just finally put all my LB stuff into a back pack<br>
with three big pockets and several smaller outer<br>
pockets.  In one pocket I carry ink of all kinds and<br>
my GPS.  In the smallest big pocket I carry our stamps<br>
and the ink that we use with them and I also have an<br>
emergency contact list in that pocket.  In the largest<br>
big pocket, I carry my logbook and 3 large baggies: 1)<br>
full of baggies of all shapes and sizes sorted and<br>
bagged within the big baggie, paper towels, and wet<br>
paper towels, 2) sheets of carving material and<br>
pencils, blades and gouges, and drawing pad, 3)<br>
journal stuff - precut pages, a hole punch, and rings.<br>
 In the bottom of the biggest pocket I carry an<br>
all-in-one tool, my nifty new headlamp, a pair of<br>
leather gloves, a roll of duct tape, an extra<br>
container, and miscellaneous other stuff like snacks<br>
(which hopefully, but not always, get rotated fairly<br>
frequently - ewwww!).  On the straps of my pack I have<br>
a compass on one shoulder and a whistle on the other. <br>
I also strap a nalgene bottle to the bottom of the<br>
pack.  My clue book and my walking stick goes<br>
separately.<br>
<br>
I wind up carrying about 12 pounds with me by having<br>
all this, but I can literally stop any time, any where<br>
and make up a box or fix a box.  I also like carrying<br>
the extra weight because it keeps me able to go at a<br>
faster pace when we go out with scouts.  It's been<br>
really nice having it all together because my mom has<br>
been in the hospital for the last week and I've been<br>
able to carry my pack around and drop in a corner on<br>
the floor of the hospital if I've needed to and draw<br>
and carve and generally pass the time.  <br>
<br>
So far, I haven't found I needed anything else.  If I<br>
do, I'm going to have to get a bigger backpack!<br>
