                    <div class="plaintext-content">We love Tecnu!  My daughter is terribly, terribly<br/>
allergic to PI, and (as you mentioned) the more she is<br/>
exposed to it the less tolerant she has become.  Tecnu<br/>
makes it possible for her to get off the sidewalk and<br/>
have fun.  We are considering buying stock in the<br/>
company!<br/>
<br/>
I carry the same first aid kit - always and forever. <br/>
My clan and my extended clan (cub scouts) have an<br/>
ongoing need for first aid stuff.<br/>
<br/>
I just finally put all my LB stuff into a back pack<br/>
with three big pockets and several smaller outer<br/>
pockets.  In one pocket I carry ink of all kinds and<br/>
my GPS.  In the smallest big pocket I carry our stamps<br/>
and the ink that we use with them and I also have an<br/>
emergency contact list in that pocket.  In the largest<br/>
big pocket, I carry my logbook and 3 large baggies: 1)<br/>
full of baggies of all shapes and sizes sorted and<br/>
bagged within the big baggie, paper towels, and wet<br/>
paper towels, 2) sheets of carving material and<br/>
pencils, blades and gouges, and drawing pad, 3)<br/>
journal stuff - precut pages, a hole punch, and rings.<br/>
 In the bottom of the biggest pocket I carry an<br/>
all-in-one tool, my nifty new headlamp, a pair of<br/>
leather gloves, a roll of duct tape, an extra<br/>
container, and miscellaneous other stuff like snacks<br/>
(which hopefully, but not always, get rotated fairly<br/>
frequently - ewwww!).  On the straps of my pack I have<br/>
a compass on one shoulder and a whistle on the other. <br/>
I also strap a nalgene bottle to the bottom of the<br/>
pack.  My clue book and my walking stick goes<br/>
separately.<br/>
<br/>
I wind up carrying about 12 pounds with me by having<br/>
all this, but I can literally stop any time, any where<br/>
and make up a box or fix a box.  I also like carrying<br/>
the extra weight because it keeps me able to go at a<br/>
faster pace when we go out with scouts.  It's been<br/>
really nice having it all together because my mom has<br/>
been in the hospital for the last week and I've been<br/>
able to carry my pack around and drop in a corner on<br/>
the floor of the hospital if I've needed to and draw<br/>
and carve and generally pass the time.  <br/>
<br/>
So far, I haven't found I needed anything else.  If I<br/>
do, I'm going to have to get a bigger backpack!<br/>
