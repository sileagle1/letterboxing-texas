this whole week they have had my two children who love<br/>
letterboxing. My mom had agreed that while they (the<br/>
kids) were visiting she and my dad would take them<br/>
letterboxing in Kilgore. Neither of my parents had<br/>
even heard of Letterboxing until July when I started<br/>
doing this hobby. So today they get to the park and<br/>
they are following the clues. My mom thinks she is<br/>
going right and my dad thinks she is wrong so he<br/>
starts off with the kids in a different direction. A<br/>
couple of minutes later my mom hears my dad yelling at<br/>
the top of his lungs "RUN...RUN...RUN.." all my mom<br/>
sees is my dad running behind my children and he is<br/>
stripping off his shirt. So she takes off running.<br/>
When they get back to the car she discovered that he<br/>
had disturbed a wasp nest and he had been stung<br/>
SEVERAL times and my daughter had been stung once.<br/>
Both my parents have sworn that they will NEVER go<br/>
letterboxing again.<br/>
<br/>
Don't worry everyone is fine and it probally shouldn't<br/>
be funny but I just thought I had to share the funny<br/>
adventure. <br/>
