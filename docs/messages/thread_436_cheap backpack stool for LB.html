Hey all,<br>
If anyone is interested I have been checking several sites for <br>
backpack stools for LB.  I ordered one that is a Coleman and when it <br>
came it said it was only for kids!  Also it was 14.95.  Today I <br>
checked a site I had seen before and found one for 6.97!  It shows a <br>
man wearing it so I assume it will hold more weight than the one I <br>
got.  If anyone is interested it is at <br>
http://www.collectionsetc.com/Item60051.aspx.<br>
I ordered three today for the little Samurai Stampers!<br>
I hope I am not breaking some talklist etiquette here by giving out <br>
a company's website address. I have nothing to do with the company.  <br>
I am just thrilled to find the backpacks so cheap!  They were 9.97 <br>
last week.<br>
Also, does anyone know if the Kansas boxers have a talklist?  I am <br>
planning some boxing up there in the future.<br>
Thanks!-Kantexan<br>

Great idea for letterboxing. I have found that my <br>
"letterboxing kit" has grown from being just a small<br>
fanny pack with my stamp, pen, ink pad, and log, to<br>
include a 3-ring notebook (for clues), a tupperware<br>
container (with emergency box-making supplies), candy<br>
box (with microboxes to plant), and an occasional<br>
full-size letterbox to plant. Add to that my camera,<br>
"snake stick" (actually a monopod for my camera), and<br>
a water bottle, and I really need more backpack room!<br>
<br>
As far as a Kansas letterboxing group, I'm not sure if<br>
they have an organized on-line group. I have had some<br>
emails with Okiebookworms@yahoo.com, as they did some<br>
boxing in Kansas and seemed to have some contacts. If<br>
you're headed that way, check out the boxes I planted<br>
a couple of weeks ago!<br>

How fun to be mentioned for help (we're also known <br>
as "OkieBookworms") since I've been listening in lately.  We're <br>
hopefully going to get to come down next weekend to DFW to box.<br>
<br>
I don't know of any talklists for Kansas.  My brother lives there <br>
and he usually uses the main talk list.  Wes who runs the lbna <br>
website lives in the Kansas City area.<br>
<br>
There are many in the Kansas City area.  Check ahead for some of the <br>
ones in Wichita.  Some of them have been missing but are still on <br>
the list.  I'm pretty sure they list their missing status on the <br>
clues.<br>
<br>
I can recommend the boxes that Hawk placed around Cottonwood Falls, <br>
KS.  It was a beautiful area with a surprisingly interesting <br>
National Park.<br>
<br>
<br>
Have fun!<br>
<br>
You could e-mail one of the placers in the area and they can give <br>
you some clues as to good finds.  (My brother and sister-in-law <br>
are "RyanandAllison.")<br>
