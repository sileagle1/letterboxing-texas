Hey all,<br/>
If anyone is interested I have been checking several sites for <br/>
backpack stools for LB.  I ordered one that is a Coleman and when it <br/>
came it said it was only for kids!  Also it was 14.95.  Today I <br/>
checked a site I had seen before and found one for 6.97!  It shows a <br/>
man wearing it so I assume it will hold more weight than the one I <br/>
got.  If anyone is interested it is at <br/>
http://www.collectionsetc.com/Item60051.aspx.<br/>
I ordered three today for the little Samurai Stampers!<br/>
I hope I am not breaking some talklist etiquette here by giving out <br/>
a company's website address. I have nothing to do with the company.  <br/>
I am just thrilled to find the backpacks so cheap!  They were 9.97 <br/>
last week.<br/>
Also, does anyone know if the Kansas boxers have a talklist?  I am <br/>
planning some boxing up there in the future.<br/>
Thanks!-Kantexan<br/>

Great idea for letterboxing. I have found that my <br/>
"letterboxing kit" has grown from being just a small<br/>
fanny pack with my stamp, pen, ink pad, and log, to<br/>
include a 3-ring notebook (for clues), a tupperware<br/>
container (with emergency box-making supplies), candy<br/>
box (with microboxes to plant), and an occasional<br/>
full-size letterbox to plant. Add to that my camera,<br/>
"snake stick" (actually a monopod for my camera), and<br/>
a water bottle, and I really need more backpack room!<br/>
<br/>
As far as a Kansas letterboxing group, I'm not sure if<br/>
they have an organized on-line group. I have had some<br/>
emails with Okiebookworms@yahoo.com, as they did some<br/>
boxing in Kansas and seemed to have some contacts. If<br/>
you're headed that way, check out the boxes I planted<br/>
a couple of weeks ago!<br/>

How fun to be mentioned for help (we're also known <br/>
as "OkieBookworms") since I've been listening in lately.  We're <br/>
hopefully going to get to come down next weekend to DFW to box.<br/>
<br/>
I don't know of any talklists for Kansas.  My brother lives there <br/>
and he usually uses the main talk list.  Wes who runs the lbna <br/>
website lives in the Kansas City area.<br/>
<br/>
There are many in the Kansas City area.  Check ahead for some of the <br/>
ones in Wichita.  Some of them have been missing but are still on <br/>
the list.  I'm pretty sure they list their missing status on the <br/>
clues.<br/>
<br/>
I can recommend the boxes that Hawk placed around Cottonwood Falls, <br/>
KS.  It was a beautiful area with a surprisingly interesting <br/>
National Park.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Have fun!<br/>
<br/>
You could e-mail one of the placers in the area and they can give <br/>
you some clues as to good finds.  (My brother and sister-in-law <br/>
are "RyanandAllison.")<br/>

&gt; they have an organized on-line group. I have had some<br/>
