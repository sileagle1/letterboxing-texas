yesterday, thinking it would be a perfect day to hunt for Kantexan's<br>
Mondrian series...it was a little chilly and we figured the area around the<br>
Kimbell Art Museum and Will Rogers Coliseum would not be very populated.<br>
<br>
Have you ever seen Fort Worth on the last weekend of the LiveStock Show???<br>
The good thing was that so many people were milling around, we were barely<br>
noticeable!!!(Although the mounted police are a little intimidating when<br>
you're skulking in the bushes)<br>
This series of 5 boxes by Kantexan & the SamuraiStampers has got to be at<br>
the top of our "most creative idea" list! We loved it. (We were unable to<br>
find the last box in the series, but only Kantexan would be able to confirm<br>
that it is missing)<br>
<br>
I'm so grateful for all the Texas letterboxers who plant fantastic boxes for<br>
us to find!<br>
