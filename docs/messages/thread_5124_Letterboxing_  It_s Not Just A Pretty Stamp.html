                    <div class="plaintext-content">The other day somebody in my family was reading an article in a TX magazine about Grapevine and asked me what county it was in.  I surprised them by correctly answering Tarrant.  They asked "How could you possible know that?" and I just said "through letterboxing".  It got me to thinking about all the things I have learned or experienced through this quirky hobby and it is pretty amazing.  Even if I can't remember details I can look at TX letterbox clues and find out about historical figures, places, legends and ghosts.  I can get in the car and visit old school houses, churches, forts and even wineries while possibly driving across a one-of-a-kind suspension bridge in the process. Through my work on the TX clue map I know there are 254 counties in TX and the largest one, Brewster, is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island combined.  So whenever you no longer feel like getting out and looking for a plastic box, just remember all the other things you will be missing.<br>

Looking forward to the other great thing about letterboxing; seeing all of you at TALE 10, less than 2 months away.<br>
