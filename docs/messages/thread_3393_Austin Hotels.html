<div>Hi Blue Butterfly,</div>
<div>I've been to an all day seminar at the Double Tree 
and I've stayed at the Embassy Suites.  The convention room and facilities 
at the Double Tree were very nice, no idea on the rooms.  The Embassy 
Suites was wonderful with a glass elevator and indoor landscaping.  Is she 
attending something in North Austin or in a surrounding area.  I live just 
north of Austin in a suburb called Cedar Park and if I knew where she was going 
to be doing something could make a better suggestion.</div>
<div>Hope this helps,</div>

<div> </div>
<div>When I traveled to Austin several times a month, I stayed all over town and finally settled on the Habitat Suites to be my home away from home.  It's an eco-conscious hotel, beautiful grounds, staff is very friendly (of course it helped that I stayed with them about 30 times a year, so they recognized me, but they were as welcoming the first time I arrived as they were the last), they have a full HOT breakfast buffet in the mornings that caters to a variety of dietary needs, a happy hour in the evenings that features wine and beer but also nice snacks (after a day of meeting food, this was often my supper).  The rooms are suites with a full kitchen, comfortable beds and some even have a fireplace.  Computer access, all the amenities.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I liked it most especially because of the relaxed environment - after a long day of lobbying and negotiating and jockeying, I just wanted to relax and it was a lot easier at this place than in the big name hotels.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have no idea how their rates are because I was staying under state contract rates, which were the same amount no matter where I stayed - be it the La Quinta or the Driskill.  However, because I was able to cook in my room and had a breakfast buffet, I was able to eat more nutritiously on the road and save money on eating out.  I won't ever stay anywhere else when I go to Austin, unless it's a tent.</div>

<div>Was great meeting you last Sat. And glad we had such great weather, unlike the snow and cold windy rain of today!!!</div>
<div>Here are a few recommends for hotel in Ausitn. There is a La Quinta on North MoPac. Several upscale hotels (Renaissance) in the Arboretum area 183 No and MoPac. Is she visiting Northwest Austin, or more up I-35 toward Round Rock? She probably wouldn't want to be anywhere east if I-35. There are also several in the I-35 and 290 area, but it is pretty congested and noisy with hwy traffic noise.</div>
<div>If you have a little more specifics, I can look up some hotel addresses.</div>
