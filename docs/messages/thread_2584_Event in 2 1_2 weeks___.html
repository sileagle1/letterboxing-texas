                    <div class="plaintext-content">The LB Trivia Contest will contain questions covering a wide range of <br/>
LB history and facts, including many Texas-specific ones.  Some will <br/>
be easy, others will be hard, but most will be medium.  Prizes will <br/>
be awarded to top three, but should be fun even if you don't win.  It <br/>
should be fun to hear the stories behind some of the answers.  I'm <br/>
looking forward to seeing everyone there!<br/>
