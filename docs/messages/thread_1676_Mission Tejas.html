That's my thoughts and why I asked exactly what was in<br>
the brochure.  I wouldn't want to see clues published<br>
for my boxes, but I'm glad to know they like us.  I<br>
always find the staff there to be very open and<br>
friendly and knowledgeable.  I would think they would<br>
be open-minded enough to consider us a benefit.  That<br>
park, by the way, needs another box or two.  <br>

Well that's very interesting, and it sounds like it is<br>
well-handled.  My only fear about being openly<br>
acknowledged in a park like that is that they would<br>
indiscriminately publish clues, which they obviously<br>
haven't done.  I like that they specifically state<br>
that they've gotten permissions both from the park and<br>
from the placer.  <br>
<br>
The staff at Mission Tejas is hands-down the best park<br>
staff I've ever met.  There is almost always someone<br>
there who has a demonstration or a talk to give on the<br>
drop of a hat.  Was the guy there when y'all went that<br>
does the 19th century tools and toys demonstration? <br>
We went once for the one hour talk and wound up<br>
spending half a day with him.  I don't think he can be<br>
stumped!<br>

<br>
That's an age-old debate in the letterboxing world. <br>
Do we tell or do we hope they don't notice?  Better to<br>
ask forgiveness rather than ask permission?  How much<br>
disclosure is a good thing?<br>
<br>
Because letterboxing is relatively small compared to<br>
geocaching, we've pretty much managed to stay under<br>
the radar (as long as you don't count the bomb squad<br>
incident, but that wasn't in Texas).  Official opinion<br>
varies quite a bit about us - from distrust to open<br>
arms.  Mike in West Texas is a good example of one who<br>
has actively fostered good relations with park<br>
officials and it sounds as if it has paid off.  Of<br>
course, he comes from the GC world, where they have a<br>
lot more public recognition and so have had to deal<br>
with officialdom quite a bit more, so he's been around<br>
this block before.  <br>
<br>
I don't think any of the more negative incidents have<br>
occurred in Texas, at least not to my knowledge.  Here<br>
in Texas, a box will occasionally be discovered by a<br>
park official who might write an email and ask that<br>
the box be removed or tell the placer the box is being<br>
removed, or something like that.  I'm only aware of<br>
one incident where the park official got a little<br>
skitchy about it, and I think that was because they<br>
actually caught someone replacing a box and asked<br>
questions and the replacer wasn't ready with a<br>
responsible answer.<br>
<br>
Now this is my opinion only (as most of this has<br>
been), but I don't particularly favor going to an<br>
agency as a whole to ask where we fit in - I like<br>
Mike's approach of making friends with the field guys<br>
and letting them see us in action.  If the local guys<br>
know that when we come to find a box we also pick up a<br>
bag of trash or do some trail maintenance, then when<br>
the main agency guys start sniffing around, the local<br>
guys are going to say "Hey, no problem, they help us<br>
out!"  Boots, your contact with the rangers at Mission<br>
Tejas is another good example of making positive local<br>
contact.  <br>
<br>
I like having no official sanctions, but I figure the<br>
day is coming when we will have official rules put on<br>
us.  I hope that before that happens we can as a group<br>
represent ourselves well as self-policing and as<br>
having responsible practices that we encourage and<br>
spread among ourselves.  I think we essentially do<br>
that already, but how do we demonstrate to someone<br>
official that we do more than litter the woods with<br>
tupperware?<br>
<br>
Anyway, this is always a very interesting topic of<br>
discussion, no matter what list it comes up on.<br>

At first I felt like we were imposing on his time<br>

shooting the breeze and I know I walked away a whole<br>
