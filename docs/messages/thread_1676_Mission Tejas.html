That's my thoughts and why I asked exactly what was in<br/>
the brochure.  I wouldn't want to see clues published<br/>
for my boxes, but I'm glad to know they like us.  I<br/>
always find the staff there to be very open and<br/>
friendly and knowledgeable.  I would think they would<br/>
be open-minded enough to consider us a benefit.  That<br/>
park, by the way, needs another box or two.  <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; found something I thought was interesting.  There<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was an insert in one <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the brochures that talked about the five<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; geocaches hidden in the <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; park and how to find them.  I asked the park ranger<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if they were <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterbox friendly as well and she said that they<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; loved to have <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; geocachers and letterboxers in the park.  I hope<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that's a trend.<br/>

Well that's very interesting, and it sounds like it is<br/>
well-handled.  My only fear about being openly<br/>
acknowledged in a park like that is that they would<br/>
indiscriminately publish clues, which they obviously<br/>
haven't done.  I like that they specifically state<br/>

&gt; Of course, I didn't tell her that there were<br/>
&gt; letterboxes in the park <br/>
&gt; or that I was there as a letterboxer, but I don't<br/>
&gt; think she would <br/>
&gt; have had a problem with that.  Maybe someone should<br/>
&gt; get an opinion <br/>
&gt; on letterboxes from Texas Parks and Wildlife.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
<br/>
<br/>
That's an age-old debate in the letterboxing world. <br/>
Do we tell or do we hope they don't notice?  Better to<br/>
ask forgiveness rather than ask permission?  How much<br/>
disclosure is a good thing?<br/>
<br/>
Because letterboxing is relatively small compared to<br/>
geocaching, we've pretty much managed to stay under<br/>
the radar (as long as you don't count the bomb squad<br/>
incident, but that wasn't in Texas).  Official opinion<br/>
varies quite a bit about us - from distrust to open<br/>
arms.  Mike in West Texas is a good example of one who<br/>
has actively fostered good relations with park<br/>
officials and it sounds as if it has paid off.  Of<br/>
course, he comes from the GC world, where they have a<br/>
lot more public recognition and so have had to deal<br/>
with officialdom quite a bit more, so he's been around<br/>
this block before.  <br/>
<br/>
I don't think any of the more negative incidents have<br/>
occurred in Texas, at least not to my knowledge.  Here<br/>
in Texas, a box will occasionally be discovered by a<br/>
park official who might write an email and ask that<br/>
the box be removed or tell the placer the box is being<br/>
removed, or something like that.  I'm only aware of<br/>
one incident where the park official got a little<br/>
skitchy about it, and I think that was because they<br/>
actually caught someone replacing a box and asked<br/>
questions and the replacer wasn't ready with a<br/>
responsible answer.<br/>
<br/>
Now this is my opinion only (as most of this has<br/>
been), but I don't particularly favor going to an<br/>
agency as a whole to ask where we fit in - I like<br/>
Mike's approach of making friends with the field guys<br/>
and letting them see us in action.  If the local guys<br/>
know that when we come to find a box we also pick up a<br/>
bag of trash or do some trail maintenance, then when<br/>
the main agency guys start sniffing around, the local<br/>
guys are going to say "Hey, no problem, they help us<br/>
out!"  Boots, your contact with the rangers at Mission<br/>
Tejas is another good example of making positive local<br/>
contact.  <br/>
<br/>
I like having no official sanctions, but I figure the<br/>
day is coming when we will have official rules put on<br/>
us.  I hope that before that happens we can as a group<br/>
represent ourselves well as self-policing and as<br/>
having responsible practices that we encourage and<br/>
spread among ourselves.  I think we essentially do<br/>
that already, but how do we demonstrate to someone<br/>
official that we do more than litter the woods with<br/>
tupperware?<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, this is always a very interesting topic of<br/>
discussion, no matter what list it comes up on.<br/>

At first I felt like we were imposing on his time<br/>

shooting the breeze and I know I walked away a whole<br/>
