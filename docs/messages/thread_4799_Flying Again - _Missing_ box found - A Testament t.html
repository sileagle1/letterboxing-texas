                    <html><body><p>Over the years, I've received several notes from potential finders saying that my box, Flying Again, was missing but every time I've been out to check it, I've found it in place. I don't know what it is about that box, but it has a way of sinking in to its surroundings.<br/>
<br/>The last few missing reports have come from very credible boxers, so I had resigned myself to believing it was gone. However, this morning SJZ and her (as yet un-trail-named) boyfriend and I were out checking boxes so we ran out to see about Flying Again. I fully expected to find nothing and told them so. <br/>
<br/>We got out of the truck and tramped around the tree (all but SJZ who is horribly allergic to poison ivy and was busy slathering herself with Technu because she had SEEN poison ivy). We scraped away the leaves and debris and - sure enough - nothing. Poked around a little further out - still nothing. Finally, I got a longer stick so I could poke a little further out of reach and sure enough, a little hollow sound! I dug around the edges of the hollow sound and within seconds we were pulling my box out of the red mud! Really, seriously, it LOOKED like solid ground when we just looked for it with our eyes. It has happened before with this box that it has gotten deeper than you would expect, and it had happened again!<br/>
<br/>When I opened the box, it had a small amount of standing water in it. Not much, but enough to devastate a logbook. Thankfully, I had bagged the contents in a freezer bag and the bag was well sealed by the last finder. As I opened the baggie, I explained to the Boyfriend why we bag. Inside the bag, I found another baggie - a regular weight baggie also well-sealed - with stamp and logbook inside. Although the book was slightly damp, it was still perfectly legibly. The last logged find was in May 2008 - three years ago! I brought the box home to freshen it up and get a new logbook for it and I will replace it before the Tomato Fest.<br/>
<br/>This little box demonstrates three things we talk about fairly often:<br/><br/>1) Don't trust "Attempted" logs - they don't conclusively mean a box is missing, only that the potential finder did their best and came up empty-handed. In this case, I knew where I had planted it and still couldn't see it until I happened to tap it with a stick.<br/>
2) Your container is everything - this was a camo'd lock and lock (name brand), although it had some water, I'm very surprised it didn't have a whole lot more since it has been in the wild since 7/26/05 and dormant for three years.  And in the same vein, double, even triple, bag. Bagging SAVED this logbook.<br/>
3) Just because a box hasn't been found in awhile doesn't mean you shouldn't go for it. Sometimes it is laying in place, waiting for YOU!<br/><br/>Needless to say, I was ecstatic to find this box. It won't be in place forever because it will be underwater when they flood for Lake Columbia, but I did want it to last until that happens. This is one of the few boxes of my own that I will definitely replace. <br/>

<p>Over the years, I've received several notes from potential finders saying
that my box, Flying Again, was missing but every time I've been out to check
it, I've found it in place.  I don't know what it is about that box, but
it has a way of sinking in to its surroundings.<br/>
<br/>
The last few missing reports have come from very credible boxers, so I had
resigned myself to believing it was gone.  However, this morning SJZ and
her (as yet un-trail-named) boyfriend and I were out checking boxes so we ran
out to see about Flying Again.  I fully expected to find nothing and told
them so.  <br/>
<br/>
We got out of the truck and tramped around the tree (all but SJZ who is
horribly allergic to poison ivy and was busy slathering herself with Technu
because she had SEEN poison ivy).  We scraped away the leaves and debris
and - sure enough - nothing.  Poked around a little further out - still
nothing.  Finally, I got a longer stick so I could poke a little further
out of reach and sure enough, a little hollow sound!  I dug around the
edges of the hollow sound and within seconds we were pulling my box out of the
red mud!  Really, seriously, it LOOKED like solid ground when we just
looked for it with our eyes.  It has happened before with this box that it
has gotten deeper than you would expect, and it had happened again!<br/>
<br/>
When I opened the box, it had a small amount of standing water in it.  Not
much, but enough to devastate a logbook.  Thankfully, I had bagged the
contents in a freezer bag and the bag was well sealed by the last finder. 
As I opened the baggie, I explained to the Boyfriend why we bag.  Inside
the bag, I found another baggie - a regular weight baggie also well-sealed -
with stamp and logbook inside.  Although the book was slightly damp, it
was still perfectly legibly.  The last logged find was in May 2008 - three
years ago!  I brought the box home to freshen it up and get a new logbook
for it and I will replace it before the Tomato Fest.<br/>
<br/>
This little box demonstrates three things we talk about fairly often:<br/>
<br/>
1) Don't trust "Attempted" logs - they don't conclusively mean a box
is missing, only that the potential finder did their best and came up
empty-handed.  In this case, I knew where I had planted it and still
couldn't see it until I happened to tap it with a stick.<br/>
2) Your container is everything - this was a camo'd lock and lock (name brand),
although it had some water, I'm very surprised it didn't have a whole lot more
since it has been in the wild since 7/26/05 and dormant for three years.  
And in the same vein, double, even triple, bag.  Bagging SAVED this
logbook.<br/>
3) Just because a box hasn't been found in awhile doesn't mean you shouldn't go
