<div>Hi, Diane -- </div>
<div>I immediately signed up for your event, but now I 
realize that Tom has booked a trip to Las Vegas for us on that weekend.  
Tom's AA sponsor wanted to celebrate his 20th AA birthday by driving race cars, 
and Tom has wanted to do a weekend of driving race cars for years.  So 
they've signed up for 30 laps, and the wives have signed up for 20 laps at the 
Richard Petty Driving Experience!  We have purchased tickets for Cirque du 
Soleil's "Love" for that night as well.  So, I guess I won't make it 
to the NM event after all!  Phooey!</div>
<div>After almost a month in Little Rock this time, I am 
back in Austin this week.  About 3 weeks ago, the feeling started returning 
to my Mom's legs.  About a week after that, the feeling started returning 
to her abdomen.  She is home, doing out-patient physical therapy.  She 
is really beginning to recover, now.  Still walks with a walker, and still 
can't drive, but at least she's not still paralyzed!!!!!  Yea!  I 
probably won't have to go back up there, although I'm really glad I could when I 
did.  She's feeling well enough to call girlfriends for rides to 
appointments and the grocery store.</div>
<div>I actually got to go to the third weekend of the 
Kerrville Folk Festival last weekend, which I didn't think would happen.  
Now I'm working on clearing my desk at work.  And laundry -- I don't 
think Tom washed a shirt for a month!  Only his socks and 
underwear.</div>
<div>I know I said I would come whenever you held an 
event, so I'm irked I can't come.  Oh 
-- we laughed our heads off!  Mark sent us "Letterboxing Nerd" pins.  
We would have loved to have worn them in NM!  I'm sure you'll have a great 
time.</div>
<div>Love, Vicki</div>
