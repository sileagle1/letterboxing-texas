I am so glad that you joined the group and are getting into <br>
letterboxing too. I just enjoy it on so many levels. Hopefully we <br>
can go letterboxing together sometime in the near future. Are you <br>
going to the gathering in Bastrop?<br>

<br>
Thanks for the welcome! I only know a little about Letterboxing from <br>
Susan's intro to a group I am in.  So, right now, I know nothing <br>
about the Bastrop gathering other than what has been posted here.<br>
<br>
I appreciate the post about materials for carving a stamp.  I am <br>
stumped at this point about what I would want my stamp to be.  I <br>
would love it if you all shared about your stamps and how you were <br>
inspired to come up with them. <br>
<br>
For instance, SilverEagle, is your stamp a silver eagle?   Just <br>
really curious.  <br>
<br>
My yahoogroups connection experienced technical difficulty since my <br>
last post.  Just now getting things straightened back out.  Thank <br>
goodness it seemed to be technical and was not a virus.<br>
<br>
Have a great weekend.<br>
<br>
I look forward to learning about Letterboxing.<br>
<br>
Congratulations, Susan on planting those boxes!!<br>

<br>
I've been really busy this week so I haven't had a<br>
chance to do more than the bare minimum on this list,<br>
so I was glad to see you had joined up with Susan's<br>
encouragement.  We're really glad to see new folks<br>
coming in to Texas letterboxing!<br>
<br>
Have you had an opportunity to learn more about the<br>
gathering?  It's March 6th at Bastrop State Park. <br>
Several of us are camping there for the weekend. <br>
Silver Eagle has graciously organized it and is<br>
bringing chili.  BabyBear is carving the event stamp. <br>
Everyone else is pitching in as they can.  Hope you<br>
can be there!<br>
<br>
Take it easy and relax about figuring out what you'll<br>
design for your own stamp.  It'll come to you,<br>
probably like one of those big "What took me so long<br>
to think of that?" kind of moments!  Although I've<br>
carved my personal stamp and a couple of box stamps, I<br>
go out to my workbench and just carve for practice and<br>
in hopes of inspiration two or three times a week. <br>
Right now I'm working on a non-letterboxing stamp as a<br>
gift for my daughter's drill team director. We have a<br>
few letterbox ideas, but getting the stamp idea is<br>
giving me grief!  I figure if I'm out there carving<br>
and piddling around with the knives, something will<br>
hit me.<br>
<br>
Anyway, glad to have you!<br>
Lucy<br>
