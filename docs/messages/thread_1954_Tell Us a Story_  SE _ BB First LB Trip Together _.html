                    <div class="plaintext-content">I don't want to bore everyone that has already heard my<br/>
"LB Beginning" story, so I will just give a brief account<br/>
of the events leading up to my first trip with Baby Bear<br/>
planned around letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
After reading about letterboxing in April, 2002, finding<br/>
my first box in August, then placing my first box in<br/>
September, Baby Bear and I started placing boxes around<br/>
Houston for each other to find (since nobody else was<br/>
participating at that time).  We still had not found any<br/>
of the less than 10 boxes existing at that time in TX, <br/>
since the closest one was in Austin, so finding each other's<br/>
boxes was the next best thing.  It's hard to imagine it now,<br/>
but posting clues for boxes back then was a long process, <br/>
fraught with pleading, begging and near-despair.  You had to<br/>
submit your clues to the webmasters and wait for them to <br/>
post them on LBNA.  Direct posting by letterboxers was over<br/>
a year away at that point.  Well, since TX had seen so little<br/>
activity, no webmaster had been assigned to our state, and <br/>
our clues were not being published.  This did not stop us,<br/>
since we just emailed each other our clues, but we worried<br/>
that other letterboxers would never come if no clues were out<br/>
there to draw them.  So I started bugging the webmasters<br/>
for help, and after a month or so I got an email from a<br/>
webmaster named Wes saying that he had been assigned our state<br/>
(along with his others).  He soon posted our clues and I<br/>
developed a good relationship with him, which helped me<br/>
get several other requests implemented to help the future<br/>
of TX letterboxing.<br/>
<br/>
At that time, the map of TX on the cluepage only had a couple<br/>
of regions colored in, since those were the only areas with<br/>
boxes.  I wanted the Southeast Region colored in, since we<br/>
had placed boxes there, so people would know at a glance<br/>
that boxes did exist around Houston.  I had also noticed<br/>
that some counties were in the wrong region, so when my<br/>
clues were finally posted they were showing up in the wrong<br/>
place and I worried future boxers would miss them.  Wes <br/>
colored in the SE region, then sent me the spreadsheet used<br/>
for TX regions and had me "fix" it.  Well, TX has a LOT of<br/>
counties, and I had to go through every one and make sure<br/>
it matched up to the correct region.  It was worth it though,<br/>
since once Wes implemented the updated spreadsheet, clues<br/>
were showing up in the correct place.  <br/>
<br/>
So, with the posting process finally under control, it was <br/>
time to start placing boxes.  Baby Bear and I realized that<br/>
just placing boxes around Houston was not good enough if we<br/>
wanted more boxers to get interested, so we started planning<br/>
a Letterbox Planting trip.  It was to be like Johnny Appleseed,<br/>
except our seeds would be letterboxes.  <br/>
<br/>
Stay tuned for the story about that trip .....<br/>

&gt; And in honor of our new members, I thought it would be a good time <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; ask our esteemed Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, "Please tell us a story <br/>
&gt; about the good ol' letterboxing days!"<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; For those who don't know, Silver Eagle and Baby Bear (brothers, FYI) <br/>
&gt; kept the faith when letterboxing wasn't even a thought in most of <br/>
our <br/>
&gt; heads, and because of their diligence, there were boxes in place <br/>
near <br/>
&gt; many of us when we ventured out to give it a try...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Recently on one of the lists the suggestion was made that this is <br/>
really a low-tech game we play and that it used to be played WITHOUT a <br/>
website, and implied that the websites have made us soft.  I had no <br/>
idea you and Baby Bear lived that life, or I should say - I never <br/>
stopped to realize you must have lived that life!<br/>
<br/>
What a challenge it would be to find another letterboxer in Texas (let <br/>
alone the whole country) in order to find another letterbox.  It makes <br/>
me think of that Dr. Suess book "Are You My Mother?"  I can just see <br/>
y'all peering at folks on trails saying "Are YOU a letterboxer???"  <br/>
<br/>
Just imagine if the two of you hadn't both become interested in <br/>
letterboxing.  About the only way this could have ever taken off was <br/>
to have two or more people who wanted to play AND who knew each other <br/>
AND who were good at both hiding and finding. <br/>
<br/>
It amazes me yet again how far we've come in a few short years...<br/>
