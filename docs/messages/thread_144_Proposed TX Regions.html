Texas and put it in the Files section (txregions.jpg).<br>
Please take a look at it and post to the list what you<br>
think.  I ended up with 7 Regions:  Panhandle, North,<br>
Northeast, Southeast, South, Central & West.  I made<br>
some hard decisions where to draw the lines:  Del Rio<br>
& San Angelo are in West, Waco is in North, Lufkin is <br>
in Northeast.  Once we agree on this I will email Wes<br>
for the spreadsheet to fill out (thanks for the info.<br>
from Oregon).  Not sure if any of this will come to<br>
pass but it doesn't hurt to ask.  If nothing else, the<br>
map will give you a good reference for counties in Texas.<br>
Also, in answer to the question "Why Regions?", I do<br>
like having groups of counties grouped into Regions<br>
since Texas is so big, but I also would like to be<br>
able to search for boxes by county, so I will ask for<br>
that feature, too.  Thanks for your help on this.<br>

Yes!  What you did was exactly what I was envisioning!<br>
 It makes much more sense in a stomping-ground kind of<br>
mentality.  I think what you propose is probably what<br>
we all consider to be more of a natural division.  As<br>
an example, the original map appears to have split<br>
Midland and Odessa into different regions, but they<br>
are sister cities and should definitely be together. <br>
I don't see anything I would change about your<br>
suggestion, although I would be mainly familiar with<br>
your Region 3, the Northeast Region.<br>
<br>
To the "Why Regions" question, I would love to see a<br>
different type of search (although if the regions were<br>
divided differently, I wouldn't necessarily feel that<br>
way).  However, whenever I try to think of what I<br>
would prefer, I always come back to regions.  Texas<br>
has so many counties, it's hard to know more than<br>
about four counties in any given direction from home<br>
where different counties are.  I would be more<br>
inclined toward a town search, but then it becomes<br>
difficult to find anything in nearby towns unless you<br>
know specifically what towns are close by.  For me,<br>
being in a low box population area, I have to search<br>
farther afield to go finding, so I don't necessarily<br>
know clusters of towns.  Soooo...back I come to<br>
regions!  <br>
<br>
I admire Wes for his willingness to take on the<br>
monumfental task of cataloging and mapping all the<br>
boxes in the country, but I sure am glad he has opened<br>
up the floor to address needed changes.  And thanks to<br>
you, Silver Eagle, for being willing to think on a big<br>
scale on our behalf!<br>

Almost everything you see associated with Waco says "central Texas" <br>

for McLennon county in north Tx.<br>
<br>
But that's just nitpicking, feedback that you can do with what you <br>
will!  As long as I can search by county, I'm sure I can still find <br>
what I'm looking for!  It's a dilemma in this state, because even <br>
broken into 7 regions many regions are bigger than just a day trip <br>
