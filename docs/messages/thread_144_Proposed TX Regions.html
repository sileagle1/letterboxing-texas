Yes!  What you did was exactly what I was envisioning!<br/>
 It makes much more sense in a stomping-ground kind of<br/>
mentality.  I think what you propose is probably what<br/>
we all consider to be more of a natural division.  As<br/>
an example, the original map appears to have split<br/>
Midland and Odessa into different regions, but they<br/>
are sister cities and should definitely be together. <br/>
I don't see anything I would change about your<br/>
suggestion, although I would be mainly familiar with<br/>
your Region 3, the Northeast Region.<br/>
<br/>
To the "Why Regions" question, I would love to see a<br/>
different type of search (although if the regions were<br/>
divided differently, I wouldn't necessarily feel that<br/>
way).  However, whenever I try to think of what I<br/>
would prefer, I always come back to regions.  Texas<br/>
has so many counties, it's hard to know more than<br/>
about four counties in any given direction from home<br/>
where different counties are.  I would be more<br/>
inclined toward a town search, but then it becomes<br/>
difficult to find anything in nearby towns unless you<br/>
know specifically what towns are close by.  For me,<br/>
being in a low box population area, I have to search<br/>
farther afield to go finding, so I don't necessarily<br/>
know clusters of towns.  Soooo...back I come to<br/>
regions!  <br/>
<br/>
I admire Wes for his willingness to take on the<br/>
monumfental task of cataloging and mapping all the<br/>
boxes in the country, but I sure am glad he has opened<br/>
up the floor to address needed changes.  And thanks to<br/>
you, Silver Eagle, for being willing to think on a big<br/>
scale on our behalf!<br/>

Almost everything you see associated with Waco says "central Texas" <br/>

&gt; &gt; Rather than being geographically correct as far as landforms and <br/>
&gt; soil <br/>
&gt; &gt; types are concerned, each region is compact and "drivable". It <br/>
is <br/>
&gt; &gt; much more friendly for the searcher.  <br/>
