<body><!-- Converted from text/plain format --><br/>
<p>Good morning Texas 
letterboxers,<br/><br/>        I promised an 
After Action Report on the Hueco Tanks Letterboxes.  This is it.  Let 
me begin by saying none of this would have been possible without the cooperation 
of the Texas Parks and Wildlife staff at Hueco Tanks State Park.  For a few 
months I have been dealing with Rangers Danny Lee, (an old friend from another 
park), and Wanda Olszewski, park superintendent.  They arranged for a park 
volunteer named Ken Steiner to guide us in the areas where guides were 
necessary.  Sooo.... Today, 13 May 2006 was the 
day.<br/><br/>        Moni and I arrived a 
little bit early for our 0800 appointment.  Wanda and Ken were both ready 
and waiting.  After a few preliminaries, we were off to the area.  Ken 
got us permission to drive back into the area.  That saved Moni a lot of 
walking on her bad knee.  We did a lot of that anyway as you will 
read.<br/><br/>        We started out with the 
clues to Hueco Tanks #1.<br/><br/>Hueco Tanks #1<br/>This box is 
Unclaimed.<br/>Placement date: Jul 11 2000<br/>State: Texas<br/>County: El 
Paso<br/>Nearest city: El Paso<br/>Number of boxes: 1<br/><br/>Clues<br/>HUECO TANKS 
LETTERBOX #1<br/><br/>End of paved road on North Mountain. From last covered 
pick-nick<br/>area 20 NE to large white rock, approx 30 paces. 40 NE to 
first<br/>large oak, approx 50 paces. From large flat rock due south 8 
paces.<br/>Under rock on slab with small tree growing 
out.<br/><br/><br/>        The directions were 
RIGHT ON.  Unfortunately, the directions required us to cross some ground 
that is now closed to the public.  Under Ken's guidance, we carefully 
pace-counted to the rock at 20 magnetic.  Perfect.  Turn to 40 
magnetic and pace-counted to the next point - the tree.  Right on 
again.  The large flat slab of rock was there.  The excitement 
builds.  Turn due south - 8 paces.  The "slab" with the small tree 
growing out of it was flat, but not horizontal.  The crevasse with the tree 
was about 7 feet above the desert floor.  It was not a problem to step up 
high enough to see in the crevasse.  So step up I did.  Rocks piled in 
the crevasse.  I moved the rocks.  Well.......  Did I find 
it? <br/><br/>YES!!!!!<br/><br/>        It 
was in there, just as the clues said it should be.  Very excited now.  
Then disappointment.  Friends, this is a PERFECT EXAMPLE of why I have a 
love for ammo cans.  And it isn't just because I am retired Army.  
This container -MAY- have been waterproof under the -BEST- of 
circumstances.  The sun had eaten away at the plastic on the upper 
area.  This left a sizeable crack exposed to the top.  This allowed 
rain to get in.  The stamp was falling apart.  The wood handle was 
covered in moist green mold.  The logbook was thoroughly soaked.  It 
may dry out.  Time will tell.  Later back at the park HQ, I was able 
to wipe the stamp and stamp it in my logbook.  There was no way for me to 
stamp my stamp in the letterbox logbook.  If this stamp has any meaning to 
anyone, please fill us in.  I am not even sure it is oriented right.  
It could be up-side-down for all I know.  This is the stamp.<br/><br/><img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" height="211" hspace="0" src="cid:406190703@14052006-25F3" width="215"/></p>
<p>    We made our way back to the 
great white dog show van and put the letterbox in it.  Then after a short 
discussion, we started out  for Hueco Tanks #2.  </p>

<div>Hueco Tanks #2</div>
<div>This box is Unclaimed.</div>
<div>Placement date: Jul 11 2000</div>

<div>Nearest city: El Paso</div>
<div>Number of boxes: 1</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clues</div>
<div>HUECO TANKS LETTERBOX #2</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If one climbs the south side of North Mountain; 
follows one of the</div>
<div>easy routes at the end of the paved road (all 5.4 
to 5.6 stuff) they</div>
<div>lead to a large amphitheatre that has a huge oak 
in it. The</div>
<div>amphitheatre is accessible from all directions. 
In a hueco (natural</div>
<div>hole-as is the area) 14 paces from the old oak is 
a box covered by a</div>
<div>rock.  Note: access to this area requires some rock climbing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    These clues are a bit 
imprecise.  However, Ken led us along the back side of North 
Mountain.  We scouted from the ground and saw a few places that looked 
promising.  Seeing them is one thing.  GETTING to them is yet 
another.  The south side is layered in several levels or "steps".  We 
worked our way up layer by layer, exploring anything that looked like a 
possibility along the way.  There were several places where you might call 
it a large amphitheater.  There were several places where there were large 
oak trees.  There were a number of places where 14 paces was 
possible.  It was getting hot.  Ken and I were going into places where 
Moni couldn't follow.  And I was carrying the CamelBak.  Plus we had a 
LOT of mountain to cover.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    While separated from Moni, Ken 
and I found a place that looked VERY promising.  Ken said the climb in was 
the 5.4 to 5.6 as stated in the clues.  While the area wasn't what I would 
call a "LARGE" amphitheater, there was room for 14+ paces.  Best of all, it 
was accessible from all directions, AND it contained a HUGE oak tree.  I 
climbed down and did a quick search.  But because Moni was down below in 
the hot sun, and I had the water, a hurried search was all I did.  I 
climbed back out, and Ken and I went back out to get Moni and continue up the 
mountain.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    We found a few other places 
that had possibilities, but nothing that met the clues like that one spot.  
After a while, we decided that we had worked our way too far north.  Moni 
was hot, her knee was starting to give out, and we had a long way to go to get 
back.  So we decided to stop the search at this 
point.  Unsuccessful on finding Hueco Tanks #2, Ken led us out on the 
opposite end from where we parked.  Along the way, Ken led us to some of 
the nicer pictographs in the park.  I got some really nice photos.  
You can see some of the hike photos here:</div>
<div> </div>
<div><span><a href="http://www.vonbonehenge.com/news/huegotanks/2006_05_13/index.htm" title="http://www.vonbonehenge.com/news/huegotanks/2006_05_13/index.htm">http://www.vonbonehenge.com/news/huegotanks/2006_05_13/index.htm</a><?xml:namespace prefix = o ns = "urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office" 
/><o:p></o:p></span></div>
<div> </div>
<div>    We got Moni to a covered 
picnic bench, and Ken and I hiked around to get the vehicles.  Got the van, 
picked up Moni, and we went to report our movements and findings to Wanda.  
At this point, it was well past 1400.  That is 2pm for you civilians.  
Over 6 hours on that rough terrain.  No wonder Moni was wore 
out.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    We met with Wanda.  I 
turned over Hueco Tanks #1 to her.  We discussed options.  They will 
review the situation, and if it is at all possible, I will be allowed to make a 
replacement stamp and a replacement letterbox.  The clues may need to be 
changed.  The location may need to be changed.  It may even be 
necessary to place it outside the park.  But I feel certain we will get as 
fair a deal on this as they can accommodate for us.  I hope Wanda dries out 
the logbook.  I think adding wax paper between each page and letting it dry 
naturally would be the best bet.  But I am no expert.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    I also feel that the place 
with the huge oak tree still holds the best chance for finding Hueco Tanks 
#2.  I will be seeking permission for a return soon.  Just as soon as 
my legs heal from this outing.  &lt;grin&gt;  There were enough places 
in that spot that two people could spend an hour or more searching.  Since 
it is on the North Mountain, it is possible that I could be allowed to search 
that place again without making Ken guide us.  I would like to entice the 
other "NEW" Letterboxer from El Paso to come along.  We have hiked together 
before - I trust him.  Hmmmm....  wonder if Brad trusts me???  
&lt;grin&gt;  There WAS that trip to the repeater site......  
&lt;grin&gt;  I don't want Moni to hurt her knee going in there with 
me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    So this completes the After 
Action Report for our Hueco Tanks outing.  We were 50% successful finding 
#1, and gained a lot of good data on where #2 isn't.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>END OF REPORT.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>    I am going to work on a 
thank-you note to Wanda, and a thank-you to her supervisors.  Maybe a few 
of you will volunteer to do the same?  If any volunteer, I will get names 
and addresses to you.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>NOTE:  If anyone had ANY other information 
about these two boxes.... ANYTHING AT ALL, please share with me.  It might 
help.  I will keep the group posted on further events.</div>
<div> </div>

<div>Mike, thanks for sharing your story and the 
pictures. I have never been to that area but I would love to see it in 
person.</div>
<div>After looking at the stamp and your pictures, 
doesn't the stamp look like one of those rock drawings?</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Mike, great job!  You have confirmed the existance<br/>
of the oldest current letterbox in TX (Hueco Tanks #1).  <br/>
I don't know anything else about the boxes, just what is<br/>
written in the clues, since they were placed before<br/>
my letterboxing days.  I was not even sure you could<br/>
get to the area described by Hueco #2 since it requires<br/>
some rock climbing, so that is amazing you came so close.<br/>
That will be great if you can rehide the #1 box, even<br/>
if it is outside the park.  Do you think the rangers <br/>
would be receptive to other boxes being placed in that<br/>
park with their approval?  <br/>
Thanks again for going above and beyond the call of duty!<br/>
