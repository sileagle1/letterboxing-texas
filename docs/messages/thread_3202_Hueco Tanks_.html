<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Well - that is not a bad place to hike.  You will have 
a few things to overcome.  First, most of the area is small 
mountains.  There isn't a lot of level ground.  You do not need to go 
on the steep stuff, but it is uphill.  Next. you will be at about 4200 feet 
ASL.  This will make breathing more difficult.  But - with those two 
things in mind, just go slow and you will be fine.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">The crawling part doesn't need to be done like we did 
it.  Tying our gear to our feet and dragging it through was a bit 
extreme.  But we were not sure we would return the same way.  And 
there was no other way through.  We couldn't fit with the packs on our 
backs.  We were searching for a lost letterbox.  Being the kind of 
people we are, we didn't want to miss any possibility no matter how 
remote.  So we did some crawling.  Knowing we were going to some 
pretty remote areas, we also over packed.  You will likely not need nor 
want to carry that much gear.  But we didn't expect to see anyone else 
where we were headed, we needed to be self-sufficient.</font></span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2"></font></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">That was really two hikes combined into one.  Hiking 
to the paintings would have been a short hike.  It was the letterbox search 
that took the time.  But that was also the most enjoyable part to me.  
I guess I like a good hike.  You will need to crawl a bit to get to the 
paintings.  But it isn't anything difficult.</font></span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Last - I am a state park volunteer.  I patrol trails, 
watch out for the park, and clean up trash.  We were in a very remote area, 
one not often visited.  There is no telling how the trash got in 
there.  Blown in, washed in, or someone left it... does it really 
matter.  Yes, leaving it behind would have been easy.  But my military 
career was not built on doing what was easy.  And my son was with me.  
He was already 25 and a Cavalry Scout by then, but what example would I have set 
if I did the easy thing and left the trash?  That is just not me.  
Doing what is right, even when no one else is looking, that's me.  Likely 
your daughter won't get it.  That's ok, but my friends do.  Maybe that 
is why they are my friends..... they know we can count on each other and little 
things like that are the example.  </font></span></div>

<div><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">For 
Dinner - at the airport?  Well - if you insist.  But I would recommend 
that for dinner you go get the Cattle on the Mesa Letterbox.  You would be 
hard-pressed to find a better steak anywhere.  Don't take my word for it, 
come and try it.  And yes- they have Margaritas!  Get there about an 
hour before sunset.  Find the letterbox.  Then sit on the veranda and 
enjoy the sunset.  When you are ready for your meal, beg them to seat you 
where you can see the coyotes come in.  They scatter raw trimmings on the 
side of the restaurant and after dark the coyotes come in to 
eat.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Hopefully by spring that will get you three letterboxes.  Hueco 
Tanks, Hudspeth County, and Cattle on the Mesa.</font></span></div>

<div><span class="295193016-25112007"><font color="#008000" face="Verdana" size="2">Well 
- enough.  Got ammo to reload today.  For competition rifle ammo I 
need to weigh each powder charge, 24.8 gr of powder in each shell.  There 
are 7000 grains per pound.  I will use about two pounds of powder 
today.  I will be busy.</font></span></div>

<p>Mike, you'll get a kick out of this. I forwarded the post about the Hueco 
  Tank hike to my 23 yo, exercise addicted daughter. She thinks it will be to 
  hard for her, rofl. She read the part about dropping the gear and crawling 
  through crevices. Then she read how you forgot the trash bag and had to hike 
  back for it. To hear her tell it so funny. She says, "I would have just left 
  that bag there." I, of course, told her how that would defeat the purpose of 
  picking the trash up in the first place. She says, "You mean it wasn't even 
  their own trash? They picked up the trash from other people, then forgot it. I 
  bet they were so mad. . ." It was funny. She calls it the Army Man 
  hike.<br/><br/>I did explain that your hike and the hike to the cave paintings 
  was two completely different hikes. I told her that you explained that I could 
  hike it without training. Plus, I promised to take her to the restaurant in 
  the ELP airport and we'd eat and drink $10 margaritas (after the 
  hike).<br/><br/>I just may have her convinced to go in the Spring.<br/><br/>Janet,
