What a loving tribute, SE. Now I'm all teary eyed. We came to LBoxing post kids at home, but have loved introducing our grands to the sport. Just replaced a few boxes that I planted with them several years ago, and loved seeing their first image stamps in the now old log book. Thank you for sharing. And know that the parenting never ends, only morphs into wonderful friendship.<br/>

through all y'all have done in just the last ten years makes me realize
I'm just not ready forthis part of life to be over. <br/>

I've always admired the way you savor your family and I hope the very
