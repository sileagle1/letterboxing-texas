I think we will plan on doing exchanges the same way as <br>
last year;  logbooks laid out on tables and people stamp<br>
as they get a chance.  To help this process, you should<br>
bring a sheet of paper with your trail name to place under<br>
your logbook so others will know whose logbook they are<br>
stamping into.  Also, if you already have exchanges from<br>
some other letterboxers, either from last year's Event or<br>
other encounters, you might want to list Exchanges already<br>
obtained on your paper if you don't want duplicates.<br>
It might be a good idea for people to sign their trail<br>
name on each sheet after they exchange to keep track of<br>
which logbooks you have already done, since people will<br>
be arriving at different times.  Not sure the best way<br>
to do this, but this might work.<br>
Also, I recently found out we may have a surprise mystery<br>
guest coming from a long distance, so this Event is really<br>
shaping up to be a special one!<br>
