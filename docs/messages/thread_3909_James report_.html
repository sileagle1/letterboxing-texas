James just called.  From Bangor, Maine.  He will be at Ft. Hood within the next<br/>
6 hours.  Baring an aircraft accident, he is as safe as can be.  I told him - no<br/>
detours to the Hudson River.<br/>
<br/>
Moni and I thank you-all for your thoughts and prayers over the last 18 months<br/>
or so.  It helped.<br/>
<br/>
After nearly 8 years of service, nearly 4 of that in combat, James will be<br/>
coming back to live in El Paso for good.  He has been offered a job as an<br/>
electrical Apprentice.  He will be the foreman of a crew on days, and go to<br/>
school 3 nights a week.  They told him they need his leadership - they will<br/>
teach him the electrical part.  It is a great opportunity.  Proof yet again that<br/>
the military can lead to other things.<br/>
<br/>
Many of you have E-mailed me directly.  Thank you for your thoughts.  James<br/>
again reaffirmed he will be attending the annual cactus meeting in Tucson.  We<br/>
will see many of you there.<br/>
<br/>
And best of all - I gain a hiking partner who can hike me into the ground.  I am<br/>
looking forward to the challenge!  I may get below 190 pounds yet!!!<br/>

If any of you are as proud of our soldiers as I am, and wish you could do more<br/>
to show it.... Consider adopting a soldier.  A letter now and then.  A few books<br/>
and magazines.  Candy.  The USPS has a flat-rate box.  Under $9 with no weight<br/>
limit.  Do you know what you can send to Iraq or Afghanistan for $9?<br/>
<br/>
It means so much to them to know someone back home appreciates what they are<br/>
doing.  And it is so little for us compared to what they do.<br/>
<br/>

Y-all enjoy your weekend......<br/>
