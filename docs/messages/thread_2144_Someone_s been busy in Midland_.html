printed clues to the ONE box in Midland and TWO boxes in Odessa along <br>
with several boxes from nearby areas in case I got bored..  Well, <br>
today was my first opportunity to get out and search because it has <br>
been raining since I got here.  So, we went out hunting...  Found 1 of <br>
3, but the meteor was closed, so we plan to try for that one again <br>
tomorrow.  So I get on the computer to log my find and I pull up this <br>
area in Texas *in our new easy to understand divisions* and what do I <br>
find?????  Lone Star Quilter and Boots Tex have canvassed this <br>
area!!!  I am like, what is going on?  I printed all the clues before <br>
I left...  Yep, that was the 30th...  They went ABSOLUTELY CRAZY on <br>
the 31st!!  <br>
<br>
So, I bet you can guess what I am getting up early to do tomorrow... :)<br>

Hey, who would have thought we would be planting boxes in the rain <br>
in Midland, Texas?  I think it rained all week.<br>
