it has been reported missing (I thought I had reported that...but <br>
sometimes what I think and what I do are 2 different <br>
things!)...however it also says it was placed in 1969, which isn't <br>
exactly true.  I have the stamp carved to re-hide this box, I'm just <br>
waiting (and waiting and waiting) for it to cool off a little bit.  <br>
I'll let everyone know when it is back out there.  -Mother of four<br>
