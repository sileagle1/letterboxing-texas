                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am on several yahoo lists, own three active ones,<br/>
and am on a couple of moderator lists.  Although I<br/>
haven't seen any big problems here, except that Yahoo<br/>
is generally much slower than usual, I've been hearing<br/>
from moderators of other lists that weird stuff is<br/>
happening, like lists are disappearing or moderators<br/>
and owners are suddenly locked out.  If it were just a<br/>
few mods or a few lists, I would think it was some<br/>
sort of operator error, but it is apparently a<br/>
documented problem that Yahoo is working to fix.<br/>
<br/>
As of this evening, I'm backing up as much of our list<br/>
as I possibly can, although that probably only means I<br/>
can get a membership list and whatever files and links<br/>
we have on here.  Probably no messages.  If you have<br/>
messages you want and you don't already have them<br/>
downloaded, you might look at copying them to your<br/>
hard drive.<br/>
<br/>
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT something happens to this list,<br/>
I will set up a new list and invite everyone who is<br/>
currently a member here to join back up.  With Yahoo's<br/>
daily limits on inviting and adding, it will take a<br/>
couple of days to get everyone back on.  For your<br/>
reference, I am signed up on this list under two yahoo<br/>
ID's and Silver Eagle is signed up also, so the<br/>
likelihood that all three moderator ID's will get<br/>
locked out is virtually nil.  I'm not sure if Silver<br/>
Eagle is on hand at the moment (he was on vacation<br/>
last week), but I still have the two ID's, so we still<br/>
shouldn't have a problem.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway, I only tell you this so that IF something odd<br/>
happens and you get a bounced message or something, it<br/>
is probably a yahoo problem, not a list problem, and<br/>
I'm trying to minimize the effect of the problem. <br/>
Thankfully, this isn't a life or death problem, but it<br/>
might be a little inconvenient!  <br/>

<br/>
Thanks for the info, Lucy!  I moderate three lists, all of which are<br/>
large (about 500, 1000, and over 1500 members, respectively) and it's<br/>
good to know that Yahoo is having problems again.<br/>
<br/>
Oh, it's not the first time I've seen this happen, but when it does,<br/>
it's often a pip.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks again for the alert!<br/>
<br/>
Cheerfully,<br/>
