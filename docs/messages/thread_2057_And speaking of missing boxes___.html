<div> </div>
<div>And from previous discussions about how to handle missing or ill-kept boxes, y'all have probably figured out one of my own pet peeves is owners who quit letterboxing and abandon their boxes.  Those of us left behind have no way of editing a box to show it's true status and folks who go to find boxes that are gone discover later that it was a known fact that box was missing...and that's pretty aggravating to them, and rightfully so, although they should be (and usually are) aggravated with the owner.  In the case I'm thinking of, I had hoped Ryan's adoption policy would solve our local problem, but as it happens, the owner must've gotten a message that her boxes were about to be put up for adoption and she logged on to AQ - and so reset her year.  She still hasn't fixed any of her descriptions or done any maintenance.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I've been thinking - and I would like to see what y'all think - that a possible solution is to place a box where the old box was, then create an additional listing for the new box.  If they get both listings, they have one missing and one there, so it isn't a wasted trip.  If they happen to download only the one that is missing and go looking, at least there would be something there when they went to look.  I realize this is a little extreme and violates some of our own principles, but does it really violate the SPIRIT of the principles?  And if they go for the old box and find the new box, how does that count as a find?  Hmmm...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>The only problem with one particular box in my area is that the original clues were so bad, I couldn't begin to guess the proper location - I only found it originally by searching every tree of the species mentioned in the clues and I've heard others say they had similar difficulties making the find.  Come to think of it, the original hiding places of the missing boxes weren't of the type I would normally choose, so maybe I could hide one close by, then the clues are distinct.  If someone only downloads the missing box clues and don't get the new box clues, they still come up empty-handed, but you can't fix everything for everybody I guess...

<div><font size="2">That is a dilemma, Lucy! I tried to think of an intelligent solution, but intelligence seems to be alluding me at the present time. I do like your idea of hiding a new box near the site of an old box if the site is a good one (like Water From the Rocks!!!!!!!).</font></div>
