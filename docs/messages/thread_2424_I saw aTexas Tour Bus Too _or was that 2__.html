                    <div class="plaintext-content">We saw a sight today, too, a big old double-decker bus pulling out of <br/>
the station in Spring, with nary a soul on board.  It had "Lone Star <br/>
Tours" painted on the side.  We followed it a ways, but lost it when <br/>
it headed north up 59.  I'd hazard a guess that it was on its way to <br/>
pick up some special passengers.  We'll let y'all know if we see it <br/>
again.<br/>
