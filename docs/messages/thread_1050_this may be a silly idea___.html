Ooh, I like that idea!  My husband designs logos professionally.  Let<br>
me run the idea past him and see if he comes up with any clever ideas.<br>
 I could put the graphics online for people to download and print (or<br>
iron-on) online, free, and also throw them onto items (at cost) at<br>
Cafe Press.<br>

It reminds me that I was working on a patch several<br>

issues that sucked away my time.  If anyone wants to<br>
pick that up and run with it, I have a list already of<br>
folks who want patches, but it will probably be a<br>
month or two before I can turn my attention back to<br>
it.<br>

Thanks for all this info!  I'll talk with my husband about it this<br>
weekend.  If the logo already exists, it seems pretty straightforward<br>
to create the graphics for bumperstickers, tee-shirts, patches, and so<br>
on.<br>
