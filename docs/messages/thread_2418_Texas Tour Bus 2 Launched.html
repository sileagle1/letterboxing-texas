response has been favorable to continue the tour. So, welcome the  <br/>
Texas Tour Bus 2!<br/>
<br/>
This box will work the same as the original bus. All finds should be  <br/>
announced here. Once you have picked up the box, you should add a  <br/>
stamp of a person or an animal (this is a new feature for this bus)  <br/>
that pertains to Texas in some way. Then,  you will hide the box in a  <br/>
new location and list it here for the next person to find.<br/>
<br/>
The bus should NOT be taken out of the state of Texas. Although  <br/>
anyone else on this list who is visiting the state and would like to  <br/>
participate can do so as long as you leave the box here before you go  <br/>
back home.<br/>
<br/>
You can also list your find on Atlas Quest if you like. This box will  <br/>
only count as one find instead of the multiple finds like the last  <br/>
one (an operations error).<br/>
<br/>
The bus has left the depot and has arrived at its first location and  <br/>
is waiting for its first passenger. Will it be you?!<br/>
<br/>
Go to Mercer Arboretum in Humble. Find the playground area, then the  <br/>
pavilion to the right of it. From the trailhead here, go left down  <br/>
the trail. At the first intersection, go right. Walk along until you  <br/>
see a 3ft stump about 5ft from left side of the trail. There is a  <br/>
downed tree behind it. The bus is hiding out in the far end of the  <br/>
tree away from the stump. (if you get to a T intersection and trail  <br/>
sign with the bridge to the right, you passed it.) Also, there is a  <br/>
snake on this trail further along from the bus, so stay alert.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for your continued support. We hope 2007 is another great  <br/>
year for our tours.<br/>

<div>Oh boy, another Tour Bus to watch for!  Thanks, Team King.  The 
last one was so much fun, I'm really eager for the bus to make its way to north 
Texas, but on the other hand, I'm sort of hoping that it will have picked up a 
number of passengers first.  Seeing the distinguised (and diverse!) Texas 
figures on that bus is as much fun as finding it in the first place.  I 
know I'll be paying attention for locations and keeping gas in the Miata. --

be willing to go to pick up the Texas Tour Bus?  I'm talking about <br/>
Texas Tour Bus 2 now, which will only have a couple of passengers; I <br/>
have no control over the original Bus, but TTB2 is relatively close to <br/>
Houston now and will hit the road again soon, so it's destination is <br/>
still negotiable.<br/>

<div>BootsTex,</div>
<div>Victoria is about 100 miles from me.  San Antonio and Corpus Christi are both about 80 miles.  Somewhere around that approximate line would be good.  I will try to make the event in March, but won't know til closer to that time.   Sorry about all the whining.  I've all but quit Lb'ing because of the lack of new boxes down here.  I had really really hoped and prayed that the event would make it's way south, but I understand that central Texas is better for most.</div>
