<br/>
I have marked my calendar for March 3, 2007.  I would be willing to <br/>
contribute towards the cost within reason.  I havea friend from our <br/>
homeschool co-op who would probably love to go as well.   Might be a <br/>
good time to plant some new letterboxes with stamps my hubby is going <br/>
to carve.  He is a perfectionist and everything he does has to be just <br/>
right so maybe if he gets started now he will be done in time! :-)<br/>
