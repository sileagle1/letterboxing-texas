<div>I had two letterboxes in Irving in Las Colinas along the Campion Trail  that are now gone.  One was a mystery box, but now the mystery is, in just which part of the Trinity River did it wind up or did it make it all the way to the Gulf of Mexico after the floods of 2007?.  Both boxes were planted fairly high in trees, high above the bank of the river, and both were washed away in the floods, which is when we all realized that whole area is actually a flood plain, an overflow area for the Trinity during severe flooding.  Just so you'll avoid making the same mistake -- that's a beautiful trail and great area which seems to be perfect for planting boxes, but if and when we ever get rain again around this area, any low-lying flat area in the vicinity of any creek, river, or lake is going to become a flood plain and boxes will wash away!  I also lost one of several boxes I had on trails around Lake Grapevine in
 those same floods, but 3 of the 4 remain now  because of their locations on the trails high above the flood levels -- more cautionary tales!  Somewhere in the Gulf of Mexico, there is a Lost Moose, along with a Baa-Baa Black Sheep and Vivaldi's 4 Seasons, all now sleeping with the fishes.   <br/>-- Viewfinder (also in the DFW metro area)
