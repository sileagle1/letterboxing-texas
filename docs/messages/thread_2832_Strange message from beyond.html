                    <div class="plaintext-content">We received a strange (as in creepy) message through LbNA about one <br/>
of LSQ's Quilt Block letterboxes.  This box was placed in Oakwood <br/>
Cemetery in Austin the first week in April.  It was reported missing <br/>
only a few weeks after that by experienced letterboxers, so was <br/>
marked as missing.  Here is the text of the message, sent by "the <br/>
ghost of oakwood (Kasper)":<br/>
<br/>
Message:<br/>
I look after the graves of oakwood cemetery.  Your letterbox was <br/>
found disturbing the spirits of the Blanton family.  We are <br/>
currently looking for a good haunting.  If you want the contents of <br/>
your letterbox contact Kasper the not so friendly ghost guardian of <br/>
Oakwood cemetery so we can make arrangements to trade my new <br/>
letterbox for a piece of your soul or something of equal value.<br/>
<br/>
This person (spirit?) was able to contact us through LbNA, which <br/>
means they know how to find clues to other letterboxes.  They <br/>
mention "my new letterbox".  Do you think this is a new boxer with a <br/>
weird sense of humor?  Has anyone received any messages like this?  <br/>
What do you make of it?<br/>
<br/>

only a few weeks after that by experienced letterboxers, so was <br/>
marked as missing. Here is the text of the message, sent by "the <br/>
ghost of oakwood (Kasper)":<br/>
<br/>
Message:<br/>
I look after the graves of oakwood cemetery. Your letterbox was <br/>
found disturbing the spirits of the Blanton family. We are <br/>
currently looking for a good haunting. If you want the contents of <br/>
your letterbox contact Kasper the not so friendly ghost guardian of <br/>
Oakwood cemetery so we can make arrangements to trade my new <br/>
letterbox for a piece of your soul or something of equal value.<br/>
<br/>
This person (spirit?) was able to contact us through LbNA, which <br/>
means they know how to find clues to other letterboxes. They <br/>
mention "my new letterbox". Do you think this is a new boxer with a <br/>
weird sense of humor? Has anyone received any messages like this? <br/>
What do you make of it?<br/>

<p>My first blush is  scary.<span>  </span>Yikes!</p>

<span>2)<span>      </span></span></span>a muggle found your box and didn't much appreciate it being there, and is now wanting to return it to you for "some" reason.
</p>
<p><span>
<span>3)<span>      </span></span></span>a muggle found your box and did a little research and would like to return it and get more information, and thought it would be funny to write such a message.
</p>
<p><span>
<span>4)<span>      </span></span></span>a letterboxer found your box and is letting you know they have it, and are willing to return it to you and thought it would be funny to write it as a ghost.
</p>
<p><span>
<span>5)<span>      </span></span></span>a caretaker found it and is offering it back to you.</p>
<p><span>
<span>6)<span>      </span></span></span>someone (anyone) found it and are just going to have a little fun with you by email but don't intend on returning it, only scolding you for placing it in a sacred place.
</p>
<p><span>
<span>7)<span>      </span></span></span>someone (anyone) found your clues and are going to have a little fun with you since the box you lost is in a cemetery.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I think we can safely rule out #1 (last I checked, Oakwood wasn't a wi-fi hotspot).</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Although I think it's funny that they wrote it from the perspective of a ghost and the humor potential there is great, I think if it were a letterboxer or a "friendly" person, they wouldn't have written "Kasper, the not so friendly ghost" and what they asked for would be something innocuous like a letterboxing patch, or a personal exchange.
<span>  </span>Asking for a piece of your soul is a little gruesome and not Bible-beltish at all.<span>  </span>HOWEVER, you could just be dealing with someone who doesn't get the nuances of humor and thought it would be funny to make it ominous.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>I also doubt it is a grieving family member, who would not as likely frame it as humor, more as "how dare you disrespect my dead great-uncle Blanton".
<span>  </span></p>
<p> </p>
<p>And I also doubt it was a caretaker, because they would probably either write a formal "not on my turf" letter, or they would re-place it surreptitiously and keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't cause a problem.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>So that pretty much leaves someone who either has a bone to pick with you over what they may perceive as disrespectful placement (lots of folks don't like cemetery placements!) or someone just wants to jack with you as a joke.

<div class="MsoMessageHeader"> </div>
<div class="MsoMessageHeader">It also seems more likely than not that the person in question has your box.  </div>
<div class="MsoMessageHeader"> </div>
<p>I don't think it would hurt to email them back and ask them how they would like to go about exchanging the box.<span>
  </span>You might get a little better insight.  However, I wouldn't ask them to mail it to me - at least not to my home address.  If you have a PO box, that might work.  If you happen to know anyone on staff at a cemetery it would be really funny to give them the cemetery's business address as the place to send it back to.
</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Just out of curiosity, did you have information in your box about how to find out more about letterboxing?<span>

&gt; &gt;   I always put the message about going to letterboxing.org in our<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes, but I may have to rethink that. Also, I haven't responded<br/>
&gt; &gt; because I'm not sure I want them to have my email address. The<br/>
&gt; &gt; hiding place was in a low, crumbling wall around the grave plot. <br/>
A<br/>
&gt; &gt; few loose bricks were moved, the box placed behind them, and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bricks replaced. When the box was reported missing, it was said<br/>
&gt; &gt; that the corner of the wall had been completely dismantled and <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; bricks left scattered. Also, the title of the message<br/>
&gt; &gt; was "desacrated". We are always careful, in a cemetery, to place<br/>
&gt; &gt; the box away from any actual grave, like in or around a tree, <br/>
near a<br/>
&gt; &gt; fence, or, in this case, a falling-down brick wall. Like you, I<br/>
&gt; &gt; don't think it was a family member or a cemetery employee, for <br/>
the<br/>
&gt; &gt; reasons you stated. I know we need to keep Austin Weird, but this<br/>
&gt; &gt; is too weird.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; Eesh!<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; My first blush is  scary. Yikes!<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; My second blush is  let's think it through. What are the<br/>
&gt; &gt; possibilities?<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) literate, net-savvy ghosts who want some of your soul<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) a muggle found your box and didn't much appreciate it<br/>
&gt; &gt; being there,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and is now wanting to return it to you for "some" reason.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) a muggle found your box and did a little research and<br/>
&gt; &gt; would like to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; return it and get more information, and thought it would be <br/>
funny<br/>
&gt; &gt; to write<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; such a message.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) a letterboxer found your box and is letting you know they<br/>
&gt; &gt; have it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; and are willing to return it to you and thought it would be <br/>
funny<br/>
&gt; &gt; to write<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it as a ghost.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 5) a caretaker found it and is offering it back to you.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 6) someone (anyone) found it and are just going to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with you by email but don't intend on returning it, only <br/>
scolding<br/>
&gt; &gt; you for<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; placing it in a sacred place.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; 7) someone (anyone) found your clues and are going to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; little fun<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; with you since the box you lost is in a cemetery.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I think we can safely rule out #1 (last I checked, Oakwood <br/>
wasn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; a wi-fi<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; hotspot).<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Although I think it's funny that they wrote it from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; perspective of a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; ghost and the humor potential there is great, I think if it <br/>
were a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxer or a "friendly" person, they wouldn't have<br/>
&gt; &gt; written "Kasper, the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; not so friendly ghost" and what they asked for would be <br/>
something<br/>
&gt; &gt; innocuous<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like a letterboxing patch, or a personal exchange. Asking for a<br/>
&gt; &gt; piece of<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; your soul is a little gruesome and not Bible-beltish at all.<br/>
&gt; &gt; HOWEVER, you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; could just be dealing with someone who doesn't get the nuances <br/>
of<br/>
&gt; &gt; humor and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; thought it would be funny to make it ominous.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I also doubt it is a grieving family member, who would not as<br/>
&gt; &gt; likely frame<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it as humor, more as "how dare you disrespect my dead great-<br/>
uncle<br/>
&gt; &gt; Blanton".<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; And I also doubt it was a caretaker, because they would <br/>
probably<br/>
&gt; &gt; either<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; write a formal "not on my turf" letter, or they would re-place <br/>
it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; surreptitiously and keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; cause a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; problem.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So that pretty much leaves someone who either has a bone to <br/>
pick<br/>
&gt; &gt; with you<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; over what they may perceive as disrespectful placement (lots of<br/>
&gt; &gt; folks don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like cemetery placements!) or someone just wants to jack with <br/>
you<br/>
&gt; &gt; as a joke.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; It also seems more likely than not that the person in question <br/>
has<br/>
&gt; &gt; your<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; I don't think it would hurt to email them back and ask them how<br/>
&gt; &gt; they would<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; like to go about exchanging the box. You might get a little <br/>
better<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; insight. However, I wouldn't ask them to mail it to me - at <br/>
least<br/>
&gt; &gt; not to my<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; home address. If you have a PO box, that might work. If you<br/>
&gt; &gt; happen to know<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone on staff at a cemetery it would be really funny to give<br/>
&gt; &gt; them the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery's business address as the place to send it back to.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity, did you have information in your box <br/>
about<br/>
&gt; &gt; how to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; find out more about letterboxing? Do you think that's how they<br/>
&gt; &gt; found the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; website or did they do research? I've always been pretty gun-<br/>
shy<br/>
&gt; &gt; about<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; putting "Learn more at www.letterboxing.org" information in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; boxes because<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; it could potentially lead a ne'er-do-well to a goldmine of fun <br/>
and<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; entertainment at our expense.<br/>

<div>This email really caught me off guard when I first read it because, yep.... it's creepy. I just get the feeling it was written totally tongue in cheek by someone who found your letterbox and is attempting to return it. I would certainly be curious enough to respond, and find out what's up. He/she won't have access to any of your personal information - just your email address and you can certainly block him if that seems to be necessary. Keep us posted!</div>

I know we need to keep Austin Weird, but this<br/>&gt; &gt; is too weird.<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; --- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>&lt;letterboxingtexas%<br/>40yahoogroups.<wbr/>com&gt;,<br/>&gt; &gt; "Barefoot Lucy"<br/>&gt; &gt; &lt;barefootlucy@<wbr/>&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Eesh!<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;

What are the<br/>&gt; &gt; possibilities?<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) literate, net-savvy ghosts who want some of your soul<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) a muggle found your box and didn't much appreciate it<br/>&gt; &gt; being there,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and is now wanting to return it to you for "some" reason.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) a muggle found your box and did a little research and<br/>&gt; &gt; would like to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; return it and get more information, and thought it would be <br/>funny<br/>&gt; &gt; to write<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; such a message.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) a letterboxer found your box and is letting you know they<br/>&gt; &gt; have it,<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and are willing to
 return it to you and thought it would be <br/>funny<br/>&gt; &gt; to write<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it as a ghost.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 5) a caretaker found it and is offering it back to you.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 6) someone (anyone) found it and are just going to have a<br/>&gt; &gt; little fun<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with you by email but don't intend on returning it, only <br/>scolding<br/>&gt; &gt; you for<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; placing it in a sacred place.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 7) someone (anyone) found your clues and are going to have a<br/>&gt; &gt; little fun<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; with you since the box you lost is in a cemetery.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I think we can safely rule out #1 (last I checked, Oakwood <br/>wasn't<br/>&gt; &gt; a wi-fi<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; hotspot).<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Although I think it's funny that they wrote it from
 the<br/>&gt; &gt; perspective of a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ghost and the humor potential there is great, I think if it <br/>were a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxer or a "friendly" person, they wouldn't have<br/>&gt; &gt; written "Kasper, the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; not so friendly ghost" and what they asked for would be <br/>something<br/>&gt; &gt; innocuous<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like a letterboxing patch, or a personal exchange. Asking for a<br/>&gt; &gt; piece of<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; your soul is a little gruesome and not Bible-beltish at all.<br/>&gt; &gt; HOWEVER, you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; could just be dealing with someone who doesn't get the nuances <br/>of<br/>&gt; &gt; humor and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; thought it would be funny to make it ominous.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; I also doubt it is a grieving family member, who would not as<br/>&gt; &gt; likely frame<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it as humor, more as "how dare you disrespect my dead great-<br/>uncle<br/>&gt; &gt;
 Blanton".<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; And I also doubt it was a caretaker, because they would <br/>probably<br/>&gt; &gt; either<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; write a formal "not on my turf" letter, or they would re-place <br/>it<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; surreptitiously and keep an eye on it to make sure it doesn't<br/>&gt; &gt; cause a<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; problem.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; So that pretty much leaves someone who either has a bone to <br/>pick<br/>&gt; &gt; with you<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; over what they may perceive as disrespectful placement (lots of<br/>&gt; &gt; folks don't<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like cemetery placements!) or someone just wants to jack with <br/>you<br/>&gt; &gt; as a joke.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It also seems more likely than not that the person in question <br/>has<br/>&gt; &gt; your<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; box.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt;
 &gt; I don't think it would hurt to email them back and ask them how<br/>&gt; &gt; they would<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; like to go about exchanging the box. You might get a little <br/>better<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; insight. However, I wouldn't ask them to mail it to me - at <br/>least<br/>&gt; &gt; not to my<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; home address. If you have a PO box, that might work. If you<br/>&gt; &gt; happen to know<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; anyone on staff at a cemetery it would be really funny to give<br/>&gt; &gt; them the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; cemetery's business address as the place to send it back to.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Just out of curiosity, did you have information in your box <br/>about<br/>&gt; &gt; how to<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; find out more about letterboxing? Do you think that's how they<br/>&gt; &gt; found the<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; website or did they do research? I've always been pretty gun-<br/>shy<br/>&gt; &gt; about<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; putting "Learn
 more at www.letterboxing.<wbr/>org" information in my<br/>&gt; &gt; boxes because<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; it could potentially lead a ne'er-do-well to a goldmine of fun <br/>and<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; entertainment at our expense.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; On 6/15/07, Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter &lt;janet@&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We received a strange (as in creepy) message through LbNA<br/>&gt; &gt; about one<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of LSQ's Quilt Block letterboxes.

There's another feature about this site that I found interesting.  I <br/>
registered as a photo volunteer.  Requests are made all the time, <br/>
from genealogists or whomever, for photographs of certain <br/>
headstones.  They send me requests for San Jacinto County and I go <br/>
out and find the grave, photograph it, and upload the photo to <br/>
findagrave.com.  Sometimes there is vital information for <br/>
genealogists who may not be close enough to visit the cemetery.  <br/>
Also, when I go letterboxing and know I'll be in a certain cemetery, <br/>
I look for photo requests for that cemetery, claim the request, and <br/>
take pictures while I'm there finding a letterbox.  If the cemetery <br/>
is interesting, even if there are no letterboxes, I might go and <br/>
take pictures and check it out for a futute letterbox location.<br/>

<div>Seriously - I think that's pretty cool about how that site is a clearinghouse for genealogists especially.  I trod down that rabbit trail for awhile last year, thinking genealogy was awfully fascinating.  When I got off into it and realized how tediously time-consuming it can be, I was 1) very impressed that my cousin had the wherewithal to trace our family to the original colonies back when there WASN'T internet, and 2) resigned to the fact that I would have to add that interest to my long list of must-do's before I die, but that it wouldn't be right now.  Pretty cool you can put a request on that site and maybe somebody would pick it up, go take a picture, and post it - for free.
