                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over three years ago, one of Silver Eagle's boxes had mysteriously disappeared (the mystery was soon resolved by a zealous park ranger at Lake Bardwell). However, Viewfinder and I had just found the box a day before it went missing, so the suspicion obviously fell upon us. I of course, blamed it on the coyotes I had heard howling around his box as we were hiking out. A couple of months later, I paid tribute to those letterboxing coyotes in a box I planted at our annual event at Rusk State Park.<br>
<br>
My clues state: This letterbox pays tribute to letterboxing coyotes. A special breed of coyote who howls excitedly, calling all his pals to come running when he gets a whiff of a newly planted letterbox in his territory. Circling the box, yipping loudly and howling at the moon are part of their ritual. Suddenly one brave coyote quickly snags the box and runs, being chased all the while by the other coyotes nipping at his heels trying to snatch the letterbox from the clutches of his jaws. Fur flying, teeth gnashing, snarls penetrating the night - yes, these creatures love letterboxing. Has one of your boxes ever gone missing?<br>
<br>
You can imagine how excited I was this morning when I saw a letterboxing announcement that Silver Eagle had hidden a new letterbox within a mile of my regular drive to work. Obviously I made plans to leave a little early for work so I could search for his box on the way. Great clues, great box (thanks, Silver Eagle)... but as I was walking back to my car, what should I see... standing in the treeline from which I had just emerged? A huge COYOTE! He was watching me as I walked along. I couldn't help but wonder how Silver Eagle had managed this. I have no idea how he works his magic, but I will say this: I fully expect to see a magnificient coyote each time I find a Silver Eagle box. Whoo Hoo! Letterboxing is such a ride!<br>
