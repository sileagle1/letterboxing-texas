<div>I sent one with my Clue stamps, so you could put yours together with that one and any others that are there. Keep it one bunch. I looked on Silent Doug's site when I sent mine and it only explains what they are, not any set thing to do. I'd do that, put them all together with a little sign so that people know what they are and can count them as "Es" (Event Stamps) in their count. People are doing that to separate them from the real exchanges done with people at the event. You could do a cute sign. Maybe one with a *stamp* on it! </div>
