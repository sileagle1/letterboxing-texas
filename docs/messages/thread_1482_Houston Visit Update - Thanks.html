                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just wanted to thank the local who sent me emails regarding my <br/>
business trip to Houston this week.  This would include Silver Eagle, <br/>
Team King and Dewberry, who provided some recommendations.<br/>
<br/>
I did manage to find a little time to box, but was mostly kept busy <br/>
with work things.  Here are some comments on the boxes attempted and <br/>
found:<br/>
<br/>
Nov. 13 - "Houston Heros" - What a touching place and cool box.  The <br/>
innards were a bit wet (cracking container), but the baggie did keep <br/>
the business stuff dry.<br/>
<br/>
Nov 14-15 - too busy to box and Texas size thunderstorms!<br/>
<br/>
Nov 16 - Lunchtime - San Jacinto Monument area - Did not seek "San <br/>
Jacinto" because the park admins are letting the landscape revert to <br/>
a high grass prarie, so whatever path existed is no longer there.  <br/>
Did not feel like bushwhacking at the time.  Was able to amble out to <br/>
find "Tickling the Ivories".  Tried for "Battleship Texas" but <br/>
failed.  The spot is pretty wide open and I think it got muggled.  <br/>
Did manage to hide the "TX Corundum Conundrum" micro box there.  The <br/>
stanp is a crystal form of a ruby/sapphire gemstone.  Have fun <br/>
searching.<br/>
<br/>
After Work - Headed up to near Intercontinental airport to find some <br/>
dangerous critters.  Found "Scary Scorpion" and "Sstep Safely" <br/>
without a problem, but could not find "The Hills are Alive" (many, <br/>
many newly fallen pine needles) or "Gator Watcher", though I am sure <br/>
I had the proper fallen tree.  I did not seek "Big Bug", as I was <br/>
running out of daylight.<br/>
<br/>
You guys have showed me the light in the proper creation of Micro <br/>
Boxes.  I think I almost got it right with the one I placed for <br/>
y'all, but realize I can change one thing.  I used a length of cash <br/>
register paper tape, while most of the boxes I found has little books <br/>
created.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the fun and pressure release during my business trip.  I <br/>
hope that I can meet up with one of youze guyz (revealing my origins <br/>
here) next time I come to Houston.<br/>
<br/>
Take care,<br/>
<br/>
