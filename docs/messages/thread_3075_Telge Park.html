                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got a report from a new letterboxer about LSQ's box in Telge <br/>
Park.  They stated that they couldn't get to the box location because <br/>
there was water on the path and they couldn't get across.  <br/>
Nevertheless, they posted the box as "attempted" on LbNA.  We went <br/>
into the box site and noticed that a letterboxer named Wildflower had <br/>
also reported the box as "attempted" and put the date as "0 2020", <br/>
which means that report will always show as the latest information (in <br/>
this case an attempt) about that box. We don't actually think that box <br/>
is missing as it has been found recently by an experienced and <br/>
reliable letterboxer.  We'll check it out soon. We looked at other <br/>
boxes in that park and noticed that this placer had put that same date <br/>
on some of them (some found and some attempted).  As everone knows, a <br/>
report of "attempted" can mean death to a box.  We should make new <br/>
boxers aware that if they don't actually get to the correct location <br/>
of the box, it should not be reported as "attempted".  Is there any <br/>
way that the date "0 2020" can be removed from a listing?<br/>

<div>I just forwarded your message to the webmasters for LBNA.  There isn't a way for you to change that, but I think there is a way for them to change it.  In the meantime, you might make a note at the top of your clues that the particular attempt listing is an old listing that got dated incorrectly, and that to the best of your knowledge the box is still in place, if inaccessible after all the rains.

<div>Maybe you could just report it as found on 0 2021 - thus trumping her date.</div>
