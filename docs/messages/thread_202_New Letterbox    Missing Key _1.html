Lamar, Aransas County, TX<br/>
Placed by: ruby<br/>

Clues:<br/>
THIS LETTERBOX IS #1 OF 3 "MISSING KEYS" PLACED BY CELTICLIONS AND<br/>
FLICKER of THE WILDBIRDS<br/>
<br/>
Difficulty: Easy<br/>
Distance to Letterbox: 20 yards<br/>
<br/>
Can you believe it? We are missing one of our keys!!! I guess vacation<br/>
is such a carefree time - we tend to be a little less organized with our<br/>
belongings! We set out to look for the wonderful Bonefish Letterbox, and<br/>
picked up a map of the park on our way in. Being new to the whole<br/>
letterboxing game, we apparently ended up at the exact opposite trail<br/>
head /entrance to Turk's Head trail!!! Not realizing our mistake, we<br/>
paced 17 steps from the start of the trail, and spotted a huge tree on<br/>
our left (approximately to the Southwest at 240 degrees). Thrilled to<br/>
think we might be locating the Bonefish, we took 9 paces closer to the<br/>
North side of the tree. Fighting the thorns and mosquitoes, we removed<br/>
the loose bark in front and felt around in the hollowed trunk at about<br/>
eye-level.  <br/>
It must have been at that moment that we lost our first key!<br/>
<br/>
Please email us at: celticlions@comcast.net if you find our MISSING KEY<br/>
#1!<br/>
<br/>
NOTE: Always take adequate precautions such as prodding with a stick or<br/>
wearing gloves before reaching into dark crevasses and holes in trees! <br/>
