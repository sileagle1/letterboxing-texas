I don't really want to drive all the way to Jacksonville by my self in a car with No A/C!!!(from last years experience, after being out in the heat all day, driving home like that was not really a good idea!)  I live halfway between Lindale and Van on FM 16! But i will drive to Tyler if anyone is going from there that i can ride with!  I can drive to jacksonville if i have to but would really like to know i have some one/ group of people to tag along with when i get there, where to meet etc.  i don't want to be wandering around feeling lost by my self!<br>
hope to hear from some one i can at least ride part way with!<br>
thanks <br>

I live south of J'ville so I can't help u with the ride but I would be happy to box with u since I will be by myself. My normal boxing partner isn't able to come this year.</p>
