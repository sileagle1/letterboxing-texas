                    <div class="plaintext-content">whew.  i've had a crazy schedule lately.  it took me ~a week just to <br/>
place the bus, and after having planted it on monday morning, here i <br/>
am finally letting y'all know where it is:<br/>
<br/>
basically, it's at the NE corner of 635 &amp; the Bush, where <br/>
carrollton, farmer's branch, and irving meet.  the easiest way might <br/>
be to take Luna Rd. north from 635, past Valley View Ln, then turn <br/>
right (east) onto Keenan Bridge.  go past the small building(s) <br/>
until you get to a gravel driveway on the left.  turn onto the <br/>
driveway.<br/>
on the driveway, facing north, you will see three "trees" on your <br/>
immediate left.  going just on the north side of these, go west <br/>
until you run into a perimeter fence.  look for the conspicuously <br/>
large mound of dead leaves.<br/>
<br/>
if memory serves correctly, the bus should be no more than ~50 feet <br/>
from the road. <br/>
landmarks to look for: FB water tower relatively close by (on davis <br/>
road).  a three-story building that looks like a fireman's training <br/>
house inside the perimeter fence that you'll be parking outside of.<br/>
<br/>
let me know if there are any problems<br/>
