                    <div class="plaintext-content">We remember the places that we went to because of Letterboxing, like <br>
the serene setting of Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge at sunset, <br>
and finding intact letterboxes next to giant trees that had been <br>
uprooted by Hurricane Rita in Martin Dies, Jr. State Park.  Killough <br>
Monument, despite the desecration, was still a special place.  <br>
Hiking five miles up and down a mountain at Lost Maples. The <br>
thousands of Dogwoods in bloom at Jim Hogg Park in Rusk. <br>
Accidentally finding GG's WOM box at Rusk while looking for another <br>
one.  Chalk Ridge Falls Park near Belton, which is gorgeous, but <br>
only has one box, which was planted in 2002. Planting boxes in the <br>
letterboxing wasteland of West Texas so El Lobo would have some to <br>
find without having to drive 300 miles.  Finding letterboxes in <br>
Italy that our daughter placed just for us, and planting two others <br>
there.  We didn't go there because of letterboxing, but we made it a <br>
letterboxing event.  Attending our first gathering, the Great Book <br>
Adventure, and meeting all those incredible letterboxers.  And, of <br>
course, trying to rescue damsels in distress along the Lone Star <br>
Trail.  There are many more, but these in particular, stand out.<br>
