Hey all,<br/>
We had a great day of boxing today(and a Halloween ending,more about <br/>
that later)!<br/>
If you haven't gone to Dinosaur Valley State Park in Glen Rose -it <br/>
is well worth the drive.  One of the ONLY places in the WORLD to see <br/>
dinosaur footprints!  I had been there many times before but what <br/>
made it special today were the FOUR! boxes placed there by Baby <br/>
Bear, Mother of Four, Silver Eagle, and DrooP.  A class was there <br/>
studying the prints so a lot of subterfuge was called for-especially <br/>
on Dinosaur Valley and Fred.<br/>
We also went to the Perry Homestead Box by Celtic Lions.  Neat place <br/>
and beautiful handmade logbook.  If you haven't found one of their <br/>
books yet, you are in for a real treat!  <br/>
Now for the Halloween ending-We went to the Crockett Family box in <br/>
Acton.  I don't know what I was expecting but it is in a real, <br/>
rather large cemetary!  And we got there just at dusk with <br/>
thunderclouds moving in!  Of course we didn't have a flashlight-so <br/>
needless to say that was the FASTEST STAMPING EVER!!!!!!  Half of <br/>
our group stayed in the car while two of us searched.  I don't know <br/>
which would be scarier-searching or waiting in the car but either <br/>
way I still don't think my heart has stopped pounding!  Historical <br/>
importance aside-That will be my most memorable boxing experience <br/>
for the rest of my life!  I guess it's kind of funny we did that in <br/>
October.  You tell yourself you don't believe in ghosts, but try <br/>
that one at night when no one else is in the cemetary!<br/>
Thanks to Baby Bear for a chiiiiiilllllllllinnnnng box! All humor <br/>
aside-it is a great place and a neat stamp! :)<br/>

<div>I love cemeteries. I have a box in one in Central Texas. Though I admit, I've never been in one at night! It sounds a great day. </div>

<p><span>Here’s the truth (and since
Samuraistampers have collected both Shawnee Trail (carved by CactusLicker) and
Perry Homestead (carved by me!) stamps, you can attest to this with a
side-by-side comparison!!!)- I am hopelessly untalented at carving stamps. I
truly thought I’d be able to carve pretty well, since I do other arts

<p><span>So whenever possible, I nudge CactusLicker

-Ruby, You are not hopelessly untalented you are just very <br/>
modest!:)  Your stamp was great and the color of the inkpad very <br/>
appropriate!I'd say the apple doesn't fall far from the tree <br/>
concerning Cactus Licker's talent.:)-Kantexan<br/>
