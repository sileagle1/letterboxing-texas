I'm ashamed to admit that before I posted about the Boxdn Cafe' I <br>
had to look up the spelling of beignet and I've lived in NO all my <br>
life.  <br>
I believe I know the Grizzled Gyphon's profile.  Retired, small gas <br>
efficient car, outdoorsman, we have a retired couple here in LA, Mr <br>
Coffee and Madam Tweety that get most for our FF and were elusive as <br>
your flying lion.  They just happened to show up at one of our group <br>
hikes and it was like having a big name boxer there.  So maybe he'll <br>
show for the meet or maybe he'll be part of the great mystery of the <br>
hobby.  <br>
