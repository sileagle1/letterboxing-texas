Hey All,<br>
I've been busy going to AAA to get maps, maps, and more maps of <br>
Kansas City, Wichita, etc. and pouring over them for my big boxing <br>
trip up there.  (Also might have to pull over in OK for some road <br>
side boxing)  Hmmmmm, how can I shove turkey and dressing down in <br>
less than two minutes and find a good excuse to flee the table for <br>
Maximum Boxing Time!?  <br>
Now if I can just convince my spouse to get into boxing. :)  I got <br>
it! I'll tell him it's like golf.  We have to find 18 boxes, one may <br>
be a mulligan (if it's missing), the greens will be beautiful, you <br>
can ride in a car(t) from hole to hole, and you can keep score! <br>
