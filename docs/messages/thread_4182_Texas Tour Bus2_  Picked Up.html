<div>You are very lucky.  Had fate not 
intervened, I would have had it 30 minutes after the email hit my phone.  I 
was at the Target in Lake Worth when I got the email.  I was giddy 
with excitement.  Plan was to check out and head straight over there 
to get that sucker.  Then I got to the register and my wallet 
was gone.  All other thoughts fled my head.  By the time we found 
the wallet, my husband was too irritated to let me grab the 
bus.</div>

<div>You are very lucky.  Had fate not intervened, I would have had it 30 minutes after the email hit my phone.  I was at the Target in Lake Worth when I got the email.  I was giddy with excitement.  Plan was to check out and head straight over there to get that sucker.  Then I got to the register and my wallet was gone.  All other thoughts fled my head.  By the time we found the wallet, my husband was too irritated to let me grab the bus.</div>

<div>It's a huge Rubbermaid box full of stamps that are circus related and the person that finds it takes it home (totally unheard of, huh) and carves a new stamp and adds to it and hides it in a new spot closer to Watauga (just kidding on that part). It can't leave Texas, you post the new clue here on this list with The Circus or something like that in the subject line. Then, there's a mad dash to be the one to find it. If you are lucky, you will be first then post that it was found in the subject line.</div>
