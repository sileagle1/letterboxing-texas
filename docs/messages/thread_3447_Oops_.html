They may have been important, maybe not, but they would have been heartfelt. This poster is sorry for having wasted two very important posts that may have been used for something useful. This poster is also sorry to the environment for all the electricity wasted in these two posts and promises to use 10 less water bottles this week to make up for it and will walk to the store once.</div> <div> </div> <div>You may now go back to your regular posts, they may be real.</div> <div> </div> <div>As for me, I will still be sitting here in 3 hours reading and laughing and thinking very hard before hitting the reply button, then when I do, I promise to watch before hitting send.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thank you for your understanding,</div> <div>Janet, Blooming
