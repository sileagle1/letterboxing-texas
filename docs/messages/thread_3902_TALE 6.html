                    <div class="plaintext-content">Kudos to all that has been said.  It was fun to see all the familiar faces, and surprising to see so many new ones.   I believe I had over 15 new exchanges!   <br/>
<br/>
I liked all the aspects of this event.  The group camping area worked well as a gathering area for Friday and Saturday nights.  These little gatherings at night have turned into a big part of the fun of the events.   I also liked the pace of the actual event on Saturday, with more time to interact with everyone and relax.   The location of the pavillion worked well as a center stopping area for the day, as everyone fanned out to get the more than 50 letterboxes in the park.  Some additions that also made it better included the WONDERFUL copy machine (okay, everyone keep stroking LSQ and BT so they will bring it next year).  The great breakfast of BT rolls......never mind, y'all don't need to know about that.   <br/>
<br/>
Thanks to all that attended, and brought food and drinks!  We missed those that could not make it, but there is always next year (lobbying for location has begun, but we feel the north deserves some love).  <br/>
<br/>
One last note, I'm sorry if seemed a little out of it, but was struggling with off and on back pain, which I thought may keep me from even coming to the event.   I truely enjoyed hearing all your stories, just wish I could have participated more.   I'll bet IRA and Bozo did something to my bed to cause this problem......just wait.........<br/>

I was madly copying clues, packing supplies, and checking maps until midnight. On the road by 6! And we were soooo glad we came. Bird Dog had wonderful time holding down that camp chair with Phil. It was wonderful to meet and greet in a relaxed, refreshing place, yes, complete with copier! And the best chili/jambalaya ever!<br/>
Thanks to SE, BB, BT, LSQ, and all the rest of you great boxers. Alread got it on the calendar for 2010!<br/>
Bloomin Gramma Jo with best Bird Dog on the planet!<br/>
