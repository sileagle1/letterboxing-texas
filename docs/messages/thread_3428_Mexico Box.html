<div><font size="2">There are two sides to that issue (like there are to most things). Whereas it's true that you probably won't be able to return and maintain your box, often people who live nearer to the box will volunteer to check on it from time to time. Just last week, Barefoot Lucy was kind enough to check on my box at Rusk (former) State Park. I personally think it's nice to hide a box or so when you're traveling, because people in that region get to experience boxes hidden by someone other than those whom they may already be familiar. I love it when our friends from Houston or east Texas or <em>wherever </em> hide a box in our area (DFW). I consider it to be a real treat. I had a box in Reno that was steadily visited for a couple of years before it finally went missing. I received such nice notes from people who enjoyed finding the wonderful location (a hill with a great view of Reno) where it was planted. When it went missing, I simply retired it.</font></div>

planted a box.  My box had 2 attempts, but no finds and we never <br>
heard about LSQ's box.  Our son (Fish Tree) and his wife are in Italy <br>
now, to visit our daughter and their family, and went to check on our <br>
boxes.  LSQ's is still in place and never been found.  My box, <br>
Spaghetti Western, is missing.  It was in a very public place <br>
(Pompeii), but in a very secluded spot that I thought was fine.  So, <br>
you never know.  All you can do is place it and hope someone, <br>
someday, finds it.<br>

                    <html><body><div>Ditto what PuddleSplasher said - it's a two-sided issue.  It could be said that placing a box where you can't care for it is the equivalent of leaving behind what will eventuall become trash, but there is a lot of residual pleasure in leaving a box somewhere that you enjoyed - i.e. a vacation spot.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I first started out (I'm feeling like an old lady because I've written this now twice in the last hour in responding on this list), there were so very few boxes in my area, and those were thanks to the kindness of Silver Eagle and Baby Bear, who diligently plant everywhere they go.  I was so desperate for boxes to find that I told letterboxers that if they would only plant in my area, I would be glad to maintain their boxes for them - and to my immense pleasure, they came through like gangbusters.  Most of the boxes in my area now are planted by local planters, and it works out that all of us locals take care of those boxes by distant planters.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I am still ever so grateful to all of y'all who fed my need way back then...</div>

Bloomin' Gramma Jo,<br>
       I was very nervous about planting a box on foriegn soil. Be sure <br>
to observe all the rules when you are there. The hiding place for my <br>
box is in a high traffic area, but, very well hidden. Monterrey is a <br>
industrial city, not a "high on the list" vacation spot,but a very <br>
pretty city. I am so glad someone finally found the box. They are from <br>
the States. <br>
      I knew when I planted the box that I may never see or hear from <br>
it again, but I wanted to place a box where maybe one day someone would <br>
come along and enjoy the adventure. These boxers are close enough to <br>
check on it if needed. We rely on each other alot and that is one thing <br>
that is great about this community of boxers. We help each other with <br>
our plants.<br>

<div>About those long-distance letterboxes:I've planted a few boxes in far-away 
places that I'm unlikely to revisit, at least not anytime soon, and I probably 
get more excited when someone contacts me about finding one of those boxes than 
my local boxes because it's like getting a postcard from a traveling 
friend.  At least briefly, I mentally revisit the place and remember 
carving that special stamp for that location and finding what I hope to be a 
good safe location, since I won't be there to check on it.  I have boxes in 
Connecticut, Arizona, Colorado, far West Texas (Marfa), East Texas (Rusk 
SP), and South Texas (Somervell SP) -- all far from here in the DFW 
metroplex.   I'm also trusting in the letterboxing community to 
let me know if a logbook needs replacing and hoping someone in the area will be 
kind enough to help me out there if I send a new one, as Lucy did with my Rusk 
box recently.  It's sort of like a souvenir in reverse - leaving just a 
small personal part of yourself in a place you really enjoyed, and knowing it's 
still there, waiting to be discovered.  </div>
<div>    But I also admit that my first intended 
vacation-spot letterbox, a moose stamp I carved and took with me to Canada and 
Montana with full intentions of planting somewhere there, came back home with me 
because I just couldn't bear to leave it so far away, and it finally found a 
home at Lake Grapevine (The Lost Moose, the first of the now-famous Grapevine 
moose population), and sadly, it washed away in the summer floods last 
year.  Had I left it in Canada, who knows, maybe I'd still be hearing from 
finders!  All letterboxing is faith and chance - you  plant it out 
there and see what happens, depending on acts of Nature and other Letterboxers 
for its fate.  </div>
