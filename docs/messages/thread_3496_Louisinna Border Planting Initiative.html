                    <div class="plaintext-content">Sounds great Lucy. I wanted to add that Kilgore is also partially in <br>
Gregg County. My boxes at Synergy Park are very active boxes. Just be <br>
careful because there are a lot of geocaches in Kilgore. Lucy probably <br>
knows more about these than I do. I know Kilgore has a park, (Driller <br>
Park)but I think it is in Rusk Cty. I will check it out this week when <br>
I head back to Longview to get those boxes that were planted this week!<br>
Yippee!!!<br>

Well why don't we say this: Let's call it the Louisiana Border Planting <br>
Initiative, and we'll say that anyone that plants in Gregg, Harrison, <br>
Marion, Panola, Rusk, and Upshur Counties between April 1st and May <br>
31st will be a part of the initiative and will receive a commemorative <br>
LTC.  <br>
