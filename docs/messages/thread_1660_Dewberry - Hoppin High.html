                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks!  It's one I'd carved about 10 mos. ago, and then carried<br>
around in the pack for ages, looking for the right spot, and then it<br>
got lost and spent the fall in the garage, and I finally found it a<br>
few weeks ago.  I absolutely adored that park--it used to be a<br>
nursery, so it has this intriguing mix of naturalized non-natives and<br>
natives which makes for really unusual flora.  It's like whatever was<br>
there got to stay, as long as it could make it on its own.<br>
<br>
Hope you found Merlin too!  He's not very far away. . .<br>
