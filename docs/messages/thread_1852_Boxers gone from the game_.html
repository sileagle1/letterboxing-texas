<div> </div>
<div>Let's set up a hypothetical situation: There is a boxer who planted several boxes.  They were at one time very active and vocal.  Folks are still finding their boxes and sending found messages, but getting nothing back.  No one has heard from them in quite some time and they don't respond to public or private messages.  In fact, messages are hard bouncing.  It doesn't appear they are maintaining their boxes.  By all appearances, they have left the game, even though they didn't pull their boxes and didn't say "see ya later" or anything else.  I think this would be a pretty typical "left the game" scenario, don't y'all?
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, how would you suggest the following situations be handled by local boxers, given the above circumstances?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) Box needs maintenance.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Box is missing.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) Someone comes along that wants to adopt the box.</div>
<div> </div>

<div>How would y'all, as interested members of the LB community, want to see these situations handled?</div>

I would provide any maintenance required except recarving the<br>
stamp.  To me, that makes it a new box with a new owner.<br>

Don't replace it unless adopting it, but log an Attempted.<br>

I think this would be great and in the best interest of<br>
the LB community and for the box itself.  If the original<br>
owner ever rejoins the hobby, they can reclaim it if desired.<br>

                    <html><body><div>It IS happening, and I DO have a specific situation in mind.  However, the situation I am thinking of is probably a pretty common scenario, which is why I brought it to the group.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are so many issues wrapped up in this - on the one hand, the placer has the right to do what they want with their own boxes.  But are they still really the owner if they aren't taking responsibility for their boxes by either maintaining them or arranging maintenance through another boxer, and more importantly, if they've left the game?  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And where is the balance between the rights of the placer to label and manage their own boxes and the responsibilities of fellow letterboxers to other potential finders if they know a particular box is missing or gone, yet not identified that way in the database?  Since I know y'all are scratching your heads at that one, let me give an example:  I KNOW a particular box is missing because I went with someone to find it and it wasn't where it was when I originally found it.  I went so far as to ask the last finders about their recollection of where it was and their recollection agreed with mine, yet the box WAS NOT THERE.  I emailed the owner, who never responded AND never marked the box accordingly on the internet.  It was not there a couple months later when I stopped by again and decided to see if the owner had perhaps fixed the problem.  And still, the whole time I knew there was a problem, other folks were trying to find the box with no luck (and this particular box is really out of the way from everything!).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And what a shame for someone's valuable contribution to the game to deteriorate to cute litter, as dewberry called it.  I mean, in my neck of the woods, everyone who has ever placed or found a box has made an impact on the game and deserves to be remembered kindly for it!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And then there is the issue of new boxers:  as they come in,  do we want them to go look for a box known to be missing or unmaintained and believe that to be the accepted norm?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Don't get me wrong - I realize that most of this is rhetorical and that there are no magic answers to these issues.  I guess every now and then some much-discussed issue suddenly hits home with me and I realize why it's important to think about them.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's made me realize that if I ever move on from LB'ing, I want to be diligent to remove my boxes or give them away.  They really are much more like pets than possessions and they still have a life of  their own even if they aren't being fed and watered and taken on walks.

<div>Hi Lucy. I just got back from Connecticut. I found a series of boxes up there that had been adopted by another letterboxer who is quite active in the area (Sojourner). Her note on the clues stated that the former owner of the boxes could no longer be contacted, but it was a neat series that had been planted over five years ago, so she adopted the boxes and was maintaining them so folks could continue to hunt for them. Although they had the original stamps, she had added a new logbook to each box in the series since the original book was full. She had left the original in the box along with the new one, which was fun to look back through - I found that Wanda and Pete and many other "notable" boxers had stamped into the series. I think when it becomes obvious that someone is no longer participating in letterboxing but has left boxes on the list and hidden, they are fair game for adoption (or replacement as in the case of Water From the Rocks LB which is missing, but a wonderful location). Since we are dedicated to "leave no trace", it seems like unless you continue to maintain your boxes or find someone to adopt them, they are just litter - hey... Don't Mess With Texas!</div>
