</p><div>Intro's around are probably a good idea, especially since there are now 
  so many interconnections.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm BarefootLucy and I also live in East Texas not too far from Blue 
  Butterfly (in Texas "not too far" terms).  My son, Lightning, is 12 and 
  has been my #1 boxing partner-in-crime for the 4.5 years we've been at 
  it.  My husband, Fearless Fox, is an LSS (long-suffering spouse) 
  and a great sport about letterboxing, even if not an avid participant 
  (which, by the way, is pretty much the definition of LSS).</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My daughter, SJZ, is 20 and lives in Denton.  She's not terribly 
  active, but you'll see her stamp around if you are in the right areas, and you 
  may well run across some of her HH's - we did a bug series that has been 
  floating around very actively for about 3 years.  Her b/f, RXKaffee, 
  doesn't understand us but goes with us on occasion, so if your box has a 
  RXKaffee image, consider yourself lucky!  Their son, Jonah, is 7 
  months old, and Gryzzled Gryphon suggested the trail name, Trail Whale, which 
  I thought was highly appropriate but I haven't yet gotten a thumbs up from his 
  parents (and if they don't decide soon, we're gonna roll with it - I do, after 
  all, have his sig stamp!).  He, and maybe his mom, will likely attend the 
  Denton gathering with me.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nac Trail Cat, from Nacogdoches, is my mom.  She has been 
  letterboxing for a year-ish.  Her husband was known as Mr. Nac Trail Cat 
  until the Bastrop gathering we had recently, when I had devised a plan to 
  have him trail-named by the group.  He quickly came up with Cat 
  Nac.  <br clear="all"/></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My name has been mentioned a couple of times in the "intros", but I <br>
guess I'll go ahead and speak up, too.  I am Lucy Locket and I live <br>
in Navarro County.  Blue Butterfly, Roarin' Lion, Stinky Monkey, and <br>
I have been letterboxing since June 2005.  Sometimes we go on LB <br>
outings together, but because of distance and schedules, a lot of <br>
times I box solo.  <br>
<br>
It is true that I teach in public school and that BFL's niece is in <br>
my class.  <br>
<br>
The first box Blue Butterfly and I found was planted by Corazon.  We <br>
found it while on family business in Mississippi.  We are grateful to <br>
Corazon for having planted that box there and it got us hooked.  <br>
<br>
AFter I got back to my home in Nacogdoches after finding that first <br>
box, I saw that Silver Eagle had one entitled SAM I AM at a forest <br>
not too far from my house.  I was excited to see there were some so <br>
close to me, and I jumped into my car and found it.  <br>
<br>
That's probably enough about me.  <br>
Happy Trails, <br>
<br>

Just wanted you to know that my two daughters (Heartstar and Lovie) <br>
think you are "awesome!". We found your boxes in Nacogdoches and they <br>
loved them. When they saw your stamp in the "Sam I Am" box log they <br>
were so excited. They talked about you for the next quarter mile, <br>
saying how creative and caring you must be to have made all the boxes <br>
you have.<br>

everything the easiest way. I have no tools to cut wood and don't <br>

<div><font size="2">I'd suggest you back your stamp with whatever is economical for you. Many stamps are not backed at all and they do just fine. I believe I found over a hundred boxes before I ever dared to place my first box, and I doubt if many of them were backed at all. Don't be in a hurry to start planting boxes. There are so many boxes in your area of Texas now. Just enjoy finding them for awhile; that's probably the best way for you to see what you think works or doesn't work in your region. Keep reading the posts, keep finding boxes and just have fun!</font></div>

<div> </div>
<div>I've been letterboxing for four and a half years and one thing I have noticed is if folks take it slow getting started, they usually last a lot longer too.  There are plenty of people on this list that prove that statement wrong, but my thinking is that for every one of them that got off to a fast start and are still here, there are at least ten who started fast too and dropped out.  Perhaps you could say the quick starters who are still with us are exceptional...;^)  Big thing is - don't worry about how fast or how slow you start out.  The great thing about letterboxing is there are no first, second and third place trophies - everyone wins if they just get out and go boxing.  If you letterbox and you enjoy it, you have accomplished the whole sum purpose of the game.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>One thing I WOULD suggest though, before you plant very many boxes, is that you find bunches first.  As you go find them, take note of how they were placed, what sort of container they were in, how the pieces of the box were packaged, what kind of logbook did they use.  Also take notice of the clues and how they were written - were they clear or did they seem vague to you?  Did you have fun following them or were they boring?  And as you think about all these things, think also about what you liked and disliked about a particular box (now this information is for your own use and it is probably best not shared) and what elements you would like to include in a box.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>A case in point would be one of my own early boxes.  I can't remember which one, but I went and checked on it recently after a very long time.  It was in a disposable container, which I've since decided isn't the best sort of container for long-term use - they get brittle, The baggies inside were thin and easily ripped - I now prefer freezer bags because I've seen how much better they last in other peoples' boxes.  I used an index card notebook for the logbook - which I learned I don't like because the spiral rusts and folks feel like they should stamp on the lined side as well as the unlined to conserve space in my logbook for me, and it takes away from their stamps.  I still use index cards but I get unlined ones, or I use cardstock, and I put it on a binder loop.  So you see, if your first box to find had been my box, and it was the example you were using to make your box, you would be following a very poor example.  (I really cringed when I saw that box!)  Anyway, find quite a few boxes and boxes by several different placers.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wouldn't worry too much with all the debates - there are a hundred of them!  Mount/Don't Mount, Hand-Carved/Storebought/Custom Made, Exacto/Gouges, Journey/Stamp, AQ/LBNA.  That's just a few!  What most of those debates come down to is personal preference. It really is that simple.  What works for you?  For the record, I'm a Don't Mount/Hand-Carved/Exacto/Journey/LBNA.</div>

I am reading what you are writing and taking mental notes. I need to <br>
go out and find more boxes like you said. I did attempt to find some <br>
last weekend but it was so windy that I had to give up because I was <br>
shivering and shaking. <br>

<p>Thanks for your comments. I know I should find more and will try again this weekend. I just get excited and want to get involved with the planting before I really see the different box packing styles that everyone has found to work best. I really do need to go on a letterbox hunt this weekend.<br/><br/><b><i>Maribeth Jagger &lt;cjagger405@earthlin<wbr>k.net&gt;</wbr></i></b> wrote:

<div><font size="2">I'd suggest you back your stamp with whatever is economical for you. Many stamps are not backed at all and they do just fine. I believe I found over a hundred boxes before I ever dared to place my first box, and I doubt if many of them were backed at all. Don't be in a hurry to start planting boxes. There are so many boxes in your area of Texas now. Just enjoy finding them for awhile; that's probably the best way for you to see what you think works or doesn't work in your region. Keep reading the posts, keep finding boxes and just have fun!</font></div>

<div>Forgive me if I post in the wrong place and help me understand how to <br/>post in this group. At times I am computer don't know how. I call <br/>myself Green Eagle and am in the east Texas area. I have just planted <br/>one box so far and have only found one box so far. I guess I am <br/>having a slow start, but maybe a strong finish. Just yesterday I <br/>actually carved my very first stamp. I am going to plant it at the <br/>Tatum Public Library. Just getting everything together for my box for <br/>now and will post the clues probably next week. I have been reading <br/>about the mount the stamp debate so now I am truly confused about <br/>what to do, to mount or not mount the stamp. Iam counting my pennies <br/>as I slowly get into this hobby and not only that I want to do <br/>everything the easiest way. I have no tools to cut wood and don't <br/>want to buy any tools. I don't know anyone that has tools so if I can <br/>mount on foam, I am all for it. It is great reading suggestions <br/>because it is such a wonderful source of information. I am thrilled <br/>to be a member of the group and will visit often. <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>, "Barefoot Lucy" <br/>&lt;barefootlucy@<wbr>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Intro's around are probably a good idea, especially since there are <br/>now so<br/>&gt; many interconnections.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I'm BarefootLucy and I also live in East Texas not too far from Blue<br/>&gt; Butterfly (in Texas "not too far" terms). My son, Lightning, is 12 <br/>and has<br/>&gt; been my #1 boxing partner-in-crime for the 4.5 years we've been at <br/>it. My<br/>&gt; husband, Fearless Fox, is an LSS (long-suffering spouse) and a <br/>great sport<br/>&gt; about letterboxing, even if not an avid participant (which, by the <br/>way, is<br/>&gt; pretty much the definition of LSS).<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; My daughter, SJZ, is 20 and lives in Denton. She's not terribly <br/>active, but<br/>&gt; you'll see her stamp around if you are in the right areas, and you <br/>may well<br/>&gt; run across some of her HH's - we did a bug series that has been <br/>floating<br/>&gt; around very actively for about 3 years. Her b/f, RXKaffee, doesn't<br/>&gt; understand us but goes with us on occasion, so if your box has a <br/>RXKaffee<br/>&gt; image, consider yourself lucky! Their son, Jonah, is 7 months old, <br/>and<br/>&gt; Gryzzled Gryphon suggested the trail name, Trail Whale, which I <br/>thought was<br/>&gt; highly appropriate but I haven't yet gotten a thumbs up from his <br/>parents<br/>&gt; (and if they don't decide soon, we're gonna roll with it - I do, <br/>after all,<br/>&gt; have his sig stamp!). He, and maybe his mom, will likely attend <br/>the Denton<br/>&gt; gathering with me.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Nac Trail Cat, from Nacogdoches, is my mom. She has been <br/>letterboxing for a<br/>&gt; year-ish. Her husband was known as Mr. Nac Trail Cat until the <br/>Bastrop<br/>&gt; gathering we had recently, when I had devised a plan to have him <br/>trail-named<br/>&gt; by the group. He quickly came up with Cat Nac.<br/>&gt; And lastly, my sister-in-law lives in the Corsicana area (and her <br/>daughter<br/>&gt; takes/used to take band from Lucy Locket - I'm sure which at this <br/>exact<br/>&gt; moment). She occasionally goes boxing and she uses the trailname TX<br/>&gt; Flutterby. You might run into her stamp along the I-45 corridor.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Of these folks, only Nac Trail Cat is likely to post her own intro.<br/>&gt; -- <br/>&gt; Barefoot Lucy<br/>&gt; "It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></div></div></font><!--End group email --></blockquote>

<div>I agree with PuddleSplasher and Barefoot Lucy's advice to find as many 
boxes as you can before you begin to plant your own, because that's the only way 
you'll really discover all the wide range of possibilities!  It's so 
exciting to plant that first box and hear from finders, but after investing time 
in carving your stamp and creating your logbook and all the rest of it, it's 
really disappointing if the box goes missing quickly because of something about 
the planting you'd not anticipated, such as poor coverage when the wind blows 
the leaves away or being washed away by rising water when the location looked 
perfectly dry at the time, or having the box become trash as a result of 
over-exuberant landscape workers -- all things that can't always be helped, but 
with experience, you can begin to anticipate some of these things in your choice 
of planting locations.  Also, finding boxes by lots of different planters 
will expose you to a wide variety of styles of stamps and logbooks and 
containers for the letterbox, as well as locations and clues.  You'll 
definitely be a better planter after finding more boxes!  </div>
<div>Happy letterboxing,</div>

                    <html><body><p>Viewfinder, I am just excited about this. I have only found one box. Last week I attempted to find two more, but the park I went to was chilly and very windy. I thought that I hated to take the chance of getting sick so I called it a day without finding the two boxes. I plan to go back next week when the kids are back in school after spring break. I did plant one and have another one ready to plant. I probably will wait and plant others after I have some finds under my belt so to say. I have invited some friends to go on my adventures and they are just tied up with grandkids or work so I will just play it solo for now. I just try to make sure the place I go is safe, if there really is a safe place. I just hate to be paronoid about everyone and everything, but it's the world we live in. Anyway, I went back to Hobby Lobby today and got some more carving tools, another block of speedball pink stamp material, and a foam doorknob that I am going to use to back my first handmade
 stamp. I enjoy reading everyone's posts and will try to get all the names down, but it will probably take me forever to get it all together.
