To get Batrick's personal traveler, just tell him what <br/>
0-0 means in chess notation.  (He came up with this himself).<br/>
<br/>
Gramapillar requests a knock-knock joke, which of course has nothing <br/>
to do with the stamp in question, but is something that fits with <br/>
his style of humor (ie., that which appeals to almost four yo <br/>
boys).  <br/>
<br/>
We'll probably not be able to make the whole event, but at least <br/>
some of us will be there for part of the time, depending on how our <br/>
patient is faring.<br/>
