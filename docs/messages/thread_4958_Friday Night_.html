There is nothing mentioned on Silver Eagle's TALE9 Event website - http://sileagle.webs.com/tale9.htm<br/>
<br/>
I will be staying at Stephen F. Austin SP about an hour away so I will not be running back and forth too much. I plan to box at SFA on Friday and then head over to Brazos Bend on Saturday morning and spend the entire day there, returning to SFA late that night. Sunday is open at the moment for me.<br/>
<br/>
PI Joe<br/>
<br/>
BTW - If anyone else is staying at SFA I'd be willing to car-pool over to BB on Saturday. I'll have room for 4-6 people in my Expedition and I have a bike rack with room for 2-3 more bikes besides my own.<br/>

Nothing official planned this year for Friday, as nothing was very close to the park.  Also Silver Eagle has daughter event that night and now will not be to the park until Saturday Morning.  SO, if y'all come up with something please share on list, otherwise those of us in the park may just link up and have a campfire cocktail....Hot Chocolate.  I should be at BBSP at about 4pm on Friday.   <br/>
<br/>
As for event, rememeber we have the pavillion into the night, so will do as we did last year, re-gather later in day at pavillion to chat and re-eat!   Doing raffle and silent auction this year also, and money used to pay for event facilities and prizes.  Can't wait to see everyone next week, and should be a fun day!!!<br/>
