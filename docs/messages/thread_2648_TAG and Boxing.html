                    <div class="plaintext-content">We had  a great time at the event also. I was shocked to see boxers <br/>
from Missouri,LA,&amp; Kansas.Of course it is always a treat to get to box <br/>
with Texas LB'ers! It was fun chatting with the Atoy Adventurers and <br/>
meeting Lucy on the trail. It was a Looonngg walk, but the company on <br/>
the trail  made it go by faster. <br/>
     If you venture north to Little Rock, Lucy Locket and I found a <br/>
neat little series that is worth the stop also, A Lesson in Piccosso <br/>
by Nancy Drew. It is on the campus of UA Little Rock.Clever way to do <br/>
a stamp. <br/>
     Hopefully next year, we will get to meet more boxers for <br/>
Arkansas. <br/>

lone letterboxer in an apathetic State, but hopefully this will get <br/>
things going for him.<br/>
