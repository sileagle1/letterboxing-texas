                    <div class="plaintext-content">Over the recent holiday weekend, LSQ and I took a few days for a <br>
family gathering and letterboxing trip to the Fredericksburg area.  <br>
We met El Lobo and Star Seeker (LSQ's brother and his wife), then <br>
Will's World (our son) and Cattitude (LSQ's sister) met us there. <br>
They're all family and all letterboxers, so how cool is that? We <br>
rented a large ranch house on 250 acres of land for 3 days and it <br>
actually cost less than staying in a motel, plus we had the house to <br>
ourselves.  In total, counting the trip there and back, we found 30 <br>
letterboxes and planted 8.  The bad news is that we had to leave so <br>
many boxes unfound, due to a lack of time.  According to the ladies, <br>
you can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time shopping.  <br>
According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing.  And the <br>
heat.  And the chiggers!  We had a great time, ate too much good food <br>
and even tasted a little wine, thanks to Baby Bear. If you've never <br>
been to the Old Tunnel to watch 3 million bats emerge, you need to do <br>
that sometime.  I've posted the 8 boxes on both LbNA and AtlasQuest.  <br>
They are: "Nimitz", "The Yellow Roads of Texas" and "Unbroken <br>
Promises" in Fredericksburg, "Waylon & Willie" in Luckenbach, "The <br>
Road to the White House - Quilt Block Series" in Stonewall, "Mr. <br>
Texas - Texas Governors Series" in Junction, "The Lost Jim Bowie <br>
Mine" in Menard (first box in Menard County) and "Mohair Sam" in <br>
Rocksprings (first box in Edwards County).  I expect Mohair Sam, <br>
which is Lone Star Quilter's letterbox, to be pretty lonely for a <br>
while.  When you decide to go find him, please take another box to <br>
plant so he'll have some company.  I actually had another box ready <br>
to plant at Enchanted Rock, but when we were on top of the rock <br>
looking for another box, I discovered I had left mine in the car.  <br>
It'll have to wait.<br>

According to the <br/>ladies, <br/>&gt; you can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time shopping. <br/>&gt; According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing. And the <br/>&gt; heat. And the chiggers! We had a great time, ate too much good <br/>food <br/>&gt; and even tasted a little wine, thanks to Baby Bear. If you've <br/>never <br/>&gt; been to the Old Tunnel to watch 3 million bats emerge, you need <br/>to do <br/>&gt; that sometime. I've posted the 8 boxes on both LbNA and <br/>AtlasQuest. <br/>&gt; They are: "Nimitz", "The Yellow Roads of Texas" and "Unbroken <br/>&gt; Promises" in Fredericksburg, "Waylon &amp; Willie" in <br/>Luckenbach, "The <br/>&gt; Road to the White House - Quilt Block Series" in Stonewall, "Mr. <br/>&gt; Texas - Texas Governors Series" in
 Junction, "The Lost Jim Bowie <br/>&gt; Mine" in Menard (first box in Menard County) and "Mohair Sam" in <br/>&gt; Rocksprings (first box in Edwards County). I expect Mohair Sam, <br/>&gt; which is Lone Star Quilter's letterbox, to be pretty lonely for a <br/>&gt; while. When you decide to go find him, please take another box to <br/>&gt; plant so he'll have some company.

    took a few days for a <br/>&gt; family gathering and letterboxing trip to the 
    Fredericksburg <br/>area. <br/>&gt; We met El Lobo and Star Seeker (LSQ's 
    brother and his wife), then <br/>&gt; Will's World (our son) and Cattitude 
    (LSQ's sister) met us there. <br/>&gt; They're all family and all 
    letterboxers, so how cool is that? We <br/>&gt; rented a large ranch house on 
    250 acres of land for 3 days and it <br/>&gt; actually cost less than staying 
    in a motel, plus we had the house <br/>to <br/>&gt; ourselves. In total, 
    counting the trip there and back, we found <br/>30 <br/>&gt; letterboxes and

    can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time shopping. <br/>&gt; 
    According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing. And the <br/>&gt;

 (LSQ's sister) met us there. <br/>&gt; They're all family and all letterboxers, so how cool is that? We <br/>&gt; rented a large ranch house on 250 acres of land for 3 days and it <br/>&gt; actually cost less than staying in a motel, plus we had the house <br/>to <br/>&gt; ourselves. In total, counting the trip there and back, we found <br/>30 <br/>&gt; letterboxes and planted 8. The bad news is that we had to leave <br/>so <br/>&gt; many boxes unfound, due to a lack of time. According to the <br/>ladies, <br/>&gt; you can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time shopping. <br/>&gt; According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing. And the <br/>&gt; heat. And the chiggers! We had a great time, ate too much good <br/>food <br/>&gt; and even tasted a little wine, thanks to Baby Bear. If you've <br/>never <br/>&gt; been to the Old Tunnel to watch 3 million bats emerge, you need <br/>to do <br/>&gt; that sometime. I've posted the 8 boxes on both LbNA and <br/>AtlasQuest. <br/>&gt;
 They are: "Nimitz", "The Yellow Roads of Texas" and "Unbroken <br/>&gt; Promises" in Fredericksburg, "Waylon &amp; Willie" in <br/>Luckenbach, "The <br/>&gt; Road to the White House - Quilt Block Series" in Stonewall, "Mr. <br/>&gt; Texas - Texas Governors Series" in Junction, "The Lost Jim Bowie <br/>&gt; Mine" in Menard (first box in Menard County) and "Mohair Sam" in <br/>&gt; Rocksprings (first box in Edwards County). I expect Mohair Sam, <br/>&gt; which is Lone Star Quilter's letterbox, to be pretty lonely for a <br/>&gt; while. When you decide to go find him, please take another box to <br/>&gt; plant so he'll have some company. I actually had another box <br/>ready <br/>&gt; to plant at Enchanted Rock, but when we were on top of the rock <br/>&gt; looking for another box, I discovered I had left mine in the car. <br/>&gt; It'll have to wait.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></div></div></font><!--End group email --></blockquote>

We <br/>&gt; &gt; rented a large ranch house on 250 acres of land for 3 days and it <br/>&gt; &gt; actually cost less than staying in a motel, plus we had the house <br/>&gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; ourselves. In total, counting the trip there and back, we found <br/>&gt; 30 <br/>&gt; &gt; letterboxes and planted 8. The bad news is that we had to leave <br/>&gt; so <br/>&gt; &gt; many boxes unfound, due to a lack of time. According to the <br/>&gt; ladies, <br/>&gt; &gt; you can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time shopping. <br/>&gt; &gt; According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing. And the <br/>&gt; &gt; heat. And the chiggers! We had a great time, ate too much good <br/>&gt; food <br/>&gt; &gt; and even tasted a little wine, thanks to Baby Bear. If you've <br/>&gt; never <br/>&gt; &gt; been to the Old Tunnel to watch 3 million bats emerge, you need <br/>&gt; to do <br/>&gt; &gt; that sometime. I've posted the 8 boxes on both LbNA and <br/>&gt; AtlasQuest. <br/>&gt; &gt; They are: "Nimitz", "The Yellow Roads of Texas" and "Unbroken <br/>&gt; &gt; Promises" in Fredericksburg, "Waylon &amp; Willie" in <br/>&gt; Luckenbach, "The <br/>&gt; &gt; Road to the White House - Quilt Block Series" in Stonewall, "Mr. <br/>&gt; &gt; Texas - Texas Governors Series" in Junction, "The Lost Jim Bowie <br/>&gt; &gt; Mine" in Menard (first box in Menard County) and "Mohair Sam" in <br/>&gt; &gt; Rocksprings (first box in Edwards County). I expect Mohair Sam, <br/>&gt; &gt; which is Lone Star Quilter's letterbox, to be pretty lonely for a <br/>&gt; &gt; while. When you decide to go find him, please take another box to <br/>&gt; &gt; plant so he'll have some company. I actually had another box <br/>&gt; ready <br/>&gt; &gt; to plant at Enchanted Rock, but when we were on top of the rock <br/>&gt; &gt; looking for another box, I discovered I had left mine in the car. <br/>&gt; &gt; It'll have to wait.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br/>&gt; &gt;<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></wbr></p></div></font><!--End group email --></blockquote></body></html>

a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; family gathering and letterboxing trip to the Fredericksburg <br/>&gt; &gt; area. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; We met El Lobo and Star Seeker (LSQ's brother and his wife), <br/>then <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Will's World (our son) and Cattitude (LSQ's sister) met us <br/>
there. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They're all family and all letterboxers, so how cool is that? <br/>We <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; rented a large ranch house on 250 acres of land for 3 days and <br/>it <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; actually cost less than staying in a motel, plus we had the <br/>
house <br/>&gt; &gt; to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves. In total, counting the trip there and back, we found <br/>&gt; &gt; 30 <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxes and planted 8. The bad news is that we had to leave <br/>&gt; &gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; many boxes unfound, due to a lack of time. According to the <br/>&gt; &gt; ladies, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; you can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time <br/>shopping. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing. And <br/>
the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; heat. And the chiggers! We had a great time, ate too much good <br/>&gt; &gt; food <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; and even tasted a little wine, thanks to Baby Bear. If you've <br/>&gt; &gt; never <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; been to the Old Tunnel to watch 3 million bats emerge, you need <br/>
&gt; &gt; to do <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; that sometime. I've posted the 8 boxes on both LbNA and <br/>&gt; &gt; AtlasQuest. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; They are: "Nimitz", "The Yellow Roads of Texas" and "Unbroken <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Promises" in Fredericksburg, "Waylon &amp; Willie" in <br/>&gt; &gt; Luckenbach, "The <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Road to the White House - Quilt Block Series" in <br/>Stonewall, "Mr. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Texas - Texas Governors Series" in Junction, "The Lost Jim <br/>Bowie <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Mine" in Menard (first box in Menard County) and "Mohair Sam" <br/>in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Rocksprings (first box in Edwards County). I expect Mohair Sam, <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; which is Lone Star Quilter's letterbox, to be pretty lonely for <br/>a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; while. When you decide to go find him, please take another box <br/>to <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; plant so he'll have some company. I actually had another box <br/>
&gt; &gt; ready <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to plant at Enchanted Rock, but when we were on top of the rock <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; looking for another box, I discovered I had left mine in the <br/>car. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; It'll have to wait.<br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the recent holiday weekend, LSQ and I took a few days <br/>for <br/>&gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; family gathering and letterboxing trip to the Fredericksburg <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; area. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We met El Lobo and Star Seeker (LSQ's brother and his wife), <br/>
&gt; then <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Will's World (our son) and Cattitude (LSQ's sister) met us <br/>&gt; there. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They're all family and all letterboxers, so how cool is that? <br/>&gt; We <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rented a large ranch house on 250 acres of land for 3 days <br/>and <br/>&gt; it <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actually cost less than staying in a motel, plus we had the <br/>&gt; house <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves. In total, counting the trip there and back, we <br/>found <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; 30 <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; letterboxes and planted 8. The bad news is that we had to <br/>leave <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; so <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many boxes unfound, due to a lack of time. According to the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; ladies, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can't go to Fredericksburg and not spend some time <br/>&gt; shopping. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me, that just takes away from letterboxing. And <br/>
&gt; the <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; heat. And the chiggers! We had a great time, ate too much <br/>good <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; food <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and even tasted a little wine, thanks to Baby Bear. If you've <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; never <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been to the Old Tunnel to watch 3 million bats emerge, you <br/>need <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; to do <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sometime. I've posted the 8 boxes on both LbNA and <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; AtlasQuest. <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; They are: "Nimitz", "The Yellow Roads of Texas" and "Unbroken <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Promises" in Fredericksburg, "Waylon &amp; Willie" in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; Luckenbach, "The <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Road to the White House - Quilt Block Series" in <br/>&gt; Stonewall, "Mr. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Texas - Texas Governors Series" in Junction, "The Lost Jim <br/>&gt; Bowie <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mine" in Menard (first box in Menard County) and "Mohair Sam" <br/>
&gt; in <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rocksprings (first box in Edwards County). I expect Mohair <br/>Sam, <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which is Lone Star Quilter's letterbox, to be pretty lonely <br/>for <br/>&gt; a <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while. When you decide to go find him, please take another <br/>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looking for another box, I discovered I had left mine in the <br/>&gt; car. <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It'll have to wait.<br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br/>

I actually had another box <br/>ready <br/>&gt; to plant at Enchanted Rock, but when we were on top of the rock <br/>&gt; looking for another box, I discovered I had left mine in the
 car. <br/>&gt; It'll have to wait.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Boots Tex and Lone Star Quilter<br/>&gt;<br/><br/></wbr></wbr></div></div></font><!--End group email --></blockquote> <div></div></div><!--End group email --><br/><p>

<div>My favorite:  You Were Always On My Mind... but I also love Georgia on 
my Mind, and Blue Eyes Crying in the Rain, and all of the others anyone has 
mentioned or even those no one has mentioned.  His voice sounds like 
someone whispering in your ear, doesn't it!  I'm with you on this one...

<div>Hey!  There's an idea for our next annual TX LB gathering:  meet 
somewhere in the Hill Country, not too far from Luchenbach... I think we already 
know the theme of that one!  And the refreshments will be very 
cooling.  OK, we can even throw in some kolaches and German 
food.   I'm in... </div>
