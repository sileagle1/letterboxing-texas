                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think we can realistically expect that SPs may become more hard-core<br>
about permitting.  <br>
<br>
On the other hand, depending on the upcoming election, there may be<br>
less money for rangers and therefore no manpower to actually enforce<br>
anything.  <br>
<br>
Did you know that they've had to close Nails Creek Unit of Lake<br>
Somerville to camping because of budget constraints?  Apparently, the<br>
trails have become overgrown as well. . .the so-called trail to my<br>
Dragonfly Dos box is more like an exercise in bushwhacking.  I think I<br>
should retire it, so if anyone does go out there, please grab it for<br>
me.  I'll send you postage.<br>

short, including my CLICK AND CLACK box.  It was a disappointing <br>
trip to Fairfield as far as letterboxing was concerned.  If Baby <br>
Bear's TX TOUR was still in its place, it was heavily guarded by a <br>
wasp nest, so we had to leave well-enough alone on that one.  <br>
<br>
We were successful, however, in stamping into BLIND LEMON JEFFERSON <br>
and VAL VERDE CANNON.  Both of these were in good shape. <br>
