&gt; Well I'm terribly upset today!  I received a message from Blue <br/>
Butterfly<br/>
&gt; about her and Lucy Locket's jaunt yesterday.  I'm sure y'all saw <br/>
LL's post<br/>
&gt; to say they were going boxing yesterday, and apparently one of the <br/>
places<br/>
&gt; they stopped was Fairfield State Park because BB hadn't yet found <br/>
the boxes<br/>
&gt; there.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; One of the things she said is that she couldn't find my Oh Deer! <br/>
box.<br/>
&gt; Because Lucy Locket has found that box before, and because both BB <br/>
and LL<br/>
&gt; are diligent seekers who are very good at searching and don't give <br/>
up<br/>
&gt; easily, I consider this a reliable missing report for my box.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I've always considered that box to be my first successful box.  It <br/>
was my<br/>
&gt; third to plant, and although I eventually replanted Killough <br/>
Monument, I<br/>
&gt; only did that after Oh Deer had been up and running well for <br/>
awhile.  I<br/>
&gt; believe it was a good hide (it had lasted two years after all!) <br/>
and really<br/>
&gt; expected it to last a long time more.  I only wish I had gotten <br/>
the logbook,<br/>
&gt; which was likely very full.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Fearless Fox and Lightning are going to be passing through <br/>
Fairfield in a<br/>
&gt; few hours on their return from a scout campout.  I so want to call <br/>
and ask<br/>
&gt; him to stop and check and then, I don't know, have a little <br/>
memorial service<br/>
&gt; for my box at the site?  Does that sound a little over the edge to <br/>
ask my<br/>
&gt; LSS to do?  Still and all, he and Lightning will be upset too, <br/>
since they<br/>
&gt; also held their breaths countless times with me while we checked <br/>
to see if<br/>
&gt; anyone had logged in to that box!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I think we can realistically expect that SPs may become more hard-core<br/>
about permitting.  <br/>
<br/>
On the other hand, depending on the upcoming election, there may be<br/>
less money for rangers and therefore no manpower to actually enforce<br/>
anything.  <br/>
<br/>
Did you know that they've had to close Nails Creek Unit of Lake<br/>
Somerville to camping because of budget constraints?  Apparently, the<br/>
trails have become overgrown as well. . .the so-called trail to my<br/>
Dragonfly Dos box is more like an exercise in bushwhacking.  I think I<br/>
should retire it, so if anyone does go out there, please grab it for<br/>
me.  I'll send you postage.<br/>

short, including my CLICK AND CLACK box.  It was a disappointing <br/>
trip to Fairfield as far as letterboxing was concerned.  If Baby <br/>
Bear's TX TOUR was still in its place, it was heavily guarded by a <br/>
wasp nest, so we had to leave well-enough alone on that one.  <br/>
<br/>
We were successful, however, in stamping into BLIND LEMON JEFFERSON <br/>
and VAL VERDE CANNON.  Both of these were in good shape. <br/>
