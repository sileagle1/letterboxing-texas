                    <div class="plaintext-content">Susan, I suggest that when you go to get your stuff to<br/>
carve, get plenty of material so you can practice,<br/>
practice, practice!<br/>
<br/>
For my birthday in November, I asked my family for a<br/>
carving kit.  My husband, in classic fashion, went all<br/>
out and bought me every kind of tool he could find,<br/>
and followed up at Christmas with even more.  I have<br/>
more knives now than I will ever know how to use, but<br/>
it has been nice because I've gotten to try out lots<br/>
of different ones and figure out what I like.  If I<br/>
were going to choose just one set though, I would go<br/>
with the speedball carving tips and a simple wooden<br/>
handle.  Exacto does make a set of blades that seem to<br/>
be pretty good for detail work too.<br/>
<br/>
As to material, I've so far tried Speedball's "pink<br/>
stuff" and "white stuff" and I've also tried<br/>
Mastercarve.  I haven't really decided which I like<br/>
best, mainly because I can't tell if I don't like some<br/>
of the material because my carving technique is still<br/>
clumsy or because the material isn't that good.<br/>
<br/>
The one thing I've learned very well is to not get<br/>
attached to a stamp until it is finished - that way I<br/>
don't feel bad about throwing it away and starting<br/>
over if I'm not happy with it.<br/>

&gt; Thanks Everyone for the warm welcome.<br/>
&gt;  <br/>
&gt; I haven't carved my stamp yet.  I have to go to<br/>
&gt; Corpus or San Antonio to get what I need to do it. <br/>
&gt; There is nothing in Beeville!  In the mean time,<br/>
&gt; you'll just have to bear with me while I use a store<br/>
&gt; bought one (please be gentle...LOL).  I've got in<br/>
&gt; mind quite a few places for boxes.  Can't wait to<br/>
&gt; get started on that.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">My grandson, 'Cloud'...the boxer formerly known as Zach, then <br/>
Caballo Diablo, then Caballo... had a good idea for a letterbox <br/>
today and already carved the stamp this afternoon. It looks like a <br/>
10 year old carved the stamp, but I am really proud of it and the <br/>
idea he had. We plan to place it in Beeville, hopefully this week.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I've got a letterbox I've been carrying around for some time. <br/>
I can't find a suitable place to put it. We took another drive to <br/>
Veteran's Memorial Park (200 acres!) in Beeville where I thought <br/>
surely I could place it, but came away disappointed. That park has <br/>
got to be the most patroled and mowed park I have seen anywhere. For <br/>
awhile I was going with a friend playing disc golf in the early <br/>
morning, and there were city and county employees swarming <br/>
everywhere, each time. Last week my daughter-in-law and grandsons <br/>
went with me around noon, and there were mowers and supervisors all <br/>
over the place. There is a creek that runs through the park, and <br/>
some gullies, so we have to avoid flood prone areas. It doesn't help <br/>
that the letterbox is slightly larger than normal, but I do hope to <br/>
get it planted eventually. <br/>
<br/>
I finally attempted to re-carve my personal stamp, and even though <br/>
it is a bigger and simpler design that the one I did back when I <br/>
first started letterboxing, it is a mess. I am still going to try to <br/>
salvage it, but I don't know if I can or not. I seem to have 'lost <br/>
my groove' as far as carving goes. Probably because I haven't carved <br/>
much of anything in so long. This one wouldn't even make a good <br/>
abstract! <br/>
<br/>
Speaking of that, I love that idea! Thanks Aisling and Joy! That <br/>
information may come in handy some day. I'd love a nice multiple <br/>
print of an artsy abstract stamp in my log. <br/>
<br/>
Another little discovery came about a while back when I couldn't <br/>
find the Staedtler MasterCarve in the medium thickness I prefer. I <br/>
had to get the really thick (1"?) kind. It turns out that it is <br/>
thick enough to carve on both sides and sometimes, depending on the <br/>
design, you can carve on an edge too. So I've done 4 (I think it is) <br/>
carvings lately that either put together 'scenes' of sorts, or have <br/>
the image on one side and the name of the letterbox on the other <br/>
side. <br/>
<br/>
So wish Cloud and I luck this week as we do a little box maintenance <br/>
and scout out locations for letterboxes. ;)<br/>
