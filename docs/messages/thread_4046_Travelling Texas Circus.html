<div><font face="Arial" size="2">The wake in Austin for Alberto Zoppe is 
over.  The Zoppe family members were so touched by the tributes from 
the Texas Travelling Circus that Alberto's sons, Tino and Nino, have 
joined the cast of the show.  And now, it is time to head down the 
road.  Perhaps, it is time to add some new animal acts to 
the show.  Pulling up stakes, the tent heads south and west, catching 
the faint trace of big cat smell in the air.  Following the scent as it 
gets stronger, the circus turns onto Circle Dr.  Of course!  There is 
a sign for a zoo!  As with old habit, they follow the arrows down and along 
Rawhide Trail.  Maybe some of these animals can be convinced to leave their 
life behind bars for a life of adventure on the road, with a family who loves 
them.  For the smell of the peanuts, the roar of the crowd!</font></div>
