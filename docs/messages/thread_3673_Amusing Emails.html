letterboxes, and I thought it would be fun to share a few:<br/>
<br/>
A woman who inherited chairs supposedly belonging to Jane Long found <br/>
my clue page for the Mother Of TX Letterbox and wanted to know if I <br/>
was related.<br/>
<br/>
An author writing a book about a friend of Will Rogers found my clue <br/>
page for the Cherokee Cowboy LB and asked if he could buy the picture <br/>
I used on the web page.<br/>
<br/>
A fan of the Big Bopper found my clue page for the Big Bopper LB and <br/>
asked if I had any T-shirts for sale.<br/>
<br/>
And the latest,<br/>
A man in Missouri found my clue page for the Pecos Cantaloupe <br/>
Letterbox and asked if I could ship him some.<br/>
<br/>
I'll bet y'all have a few, too!<br/>
