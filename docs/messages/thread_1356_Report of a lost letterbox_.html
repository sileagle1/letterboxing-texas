Good evening everyone.<br>
<br>
	It was suggested I post this notice here so anyone on the list would<br>
not come looking for this letterbox.<br>
<br>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox-basement/message/211<br>
<br>
	My daughter and I searched for it Saturday morning.  Following the<br>
clues, I found a place where I would place a box.  But it was empty.  We<br>
spent an hour checking every spot possible within 25 yards of the area.  No<br>
luck.  It was disappointing.  There are only TWO letterboxes in the area for<br>
me to find.  I found one.  I know EXACTLY where the other is.  I am saving<br>
it!<br>
<br>
	I am going to search for these two after I return from the dog show.<br>
We have 3 dogs in the national finals, so we MUST attend.  My hiking buddy<br>
is headed for a blue ribbon this year!  Bless his big heart!<br>

<br>
	I have already contacted the ranger, an old friend from the other<br>
park.  He will help with the search and clear the letterbox for use if it is<br>
not in a restricted area.  He will help put it in a safe area if it needs to<br>
be moved.  I will keep the group posted on the results.  I will do my best<br>
to get them reactivated.<br>
<br>
Y-all have a fine Sunday evening.<br>
<br>
