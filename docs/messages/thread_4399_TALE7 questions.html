<br/>
I've never posted anything, anywhere before so I'm quite nervous, like the whole world is listening. (I know that's a bit dramatic but still scared) I have lots of questions about the upcoming event and other letterboxing stuff. The other stuff can wait but I can't put off the TALE7 questions any longer. Here goes<br/>
<br/>
When do you post the clues for the boxes at the event? I saw that everyone put the box info out for the new boxes but not the clues. So I did the same. I already have the clues to the box ready. Should I print and bring copies of the clues with me or add the clues to the site a day before. Also when I click the `print checklist' box I get the Exchange Checklist and the Personal Travelers. I know what to do with the personal travelers checklist but what do I do with the exchange checklist. And once at the event, what's the process to get the personal travelers. Do you just walk up to people whenever and give the answer to their traveler question? If I did a traveler would I make a log book for it?      <br/>

<p>Hi a-maze-ing!<br/>
<br/>
Great questions about events!<br/>
<br/>
Generally, clues for boxes that are placed specifically for an event will be
available on-site.  If you have a box in the area that you'd like to
launch so people can find it when they are in the area, you can certainly post
clues the day before - just make sure to have at least one copy of the clues
with you so folks can copy them.  I think there are a lot of people who
will have already printed out their clues prior to that, and I believe someone
said they were bringing a copy machine so that copies could be made on-site.<br/>
<br/>
The exchange checklist is just a list of folks you haven't exchanged sig stamps
with.  Bring it with you and when you exchange sig stamps, check them off
the list.  Chances are you won't get everyone - there's usually at least a
few folks who sign up to come to events but can't make it for one reason or
another.  It's just an easy way to keep track of who you still need to
exchange with.  It'll be more useful after a few events so that you aren't
going up to the same person at every event asking for exchanges...<br/>
<br/>
In general, I have found it to be perfectly acceptable to walk up to someone,
tell them how excited I am to meet them and that I solved some of their PTs,
fumble with my list of PT answers and then give them my answers.  If
nothing else, it's a great conversation starter.  If you were to make your
own PT, you would make a stamp and logbook for it - if there's a question
people need to solve, you'll want to get it posted sooner than later, so that
folks have a couple days to figure it out before printing out their final
lists.<br/>
<br/>
Hope that helps!<br/>

<p>Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I've never posted anything, anywhere before so I'm quite nervous, like the
whole world is listening. (I know that's a bit dramatic but still scared) I
have lots of questions about the upcoming event and other letterboxing stuff.
The other stuff can wait but I can't put off the TALE7 questions any longer.
Here goes…<br/>
<br/>
When do you post the clues for the boxes at the event? I saw that everyone put
the box info out for the new boxes but not the clues. So I did the same. I
already have the clues to the box ready. Should I print and bring copies of the
clues with me or add the clues to the site a day before. Also when I click the
`print checklist' box I get the Exchange Checklist and the Personal Travelers.
I know what to do with the personal travelers checklist but what do I do with
the exchange checklist. And once at the event, what's the process to get the
personal travelers. Do you just walk up to people whenever and give the answer
to their traveler question? If I did a traveler would I make a log book for it?
<br/>
<br/>

Some folks have logbooks for their PT's, but it gets pretty cumbersome doing
sig stamp exchanges and then PT exchanges.  You can have a logbook for
your PT if you want to - nothing says you can't - but from a matter of
practicality, I wouldn't bother with it.  You'll probably be getting
someone's sig stamp in your regular logbook at the same time they are getting
your PT, so it just means you'll have their sig in two places.  Two stamps
CAN be hard enough to manage - two books, not worth it.  <br/>

In my opinion, of course.<br/>

<br/>
Generally, clues for boxes that are placed specifically for an event will be
available on-site.  If you have a box in the area that you'd like to launch
so people can find it when they are in the area, you can certainly post clues
the day before - just make sure to have at least one copy of the clues with you
so folks can copy them.  I think there are a lot of people who will have
already printed out their clues prior to that, and I believe someone said they
were bringing a copy machine so that copies could be made on-site.<br/>
<br/>
The exchange checklist is just a list of folks you haven't exchanged sig stamps
with.  Bring it with you and when you exchange sig stamps, check them off
the list.  Chances are you won't get everyone - there's usually at least a
few folks who sign up to come to events but can't make it for one reason or
another.  It's just an easy way to keep track of who you still need to
exchange with.  It'll be more useful after a few events so that you aren't
going up to the same person at every event asking for exchanges...<br/>
<br/>
In general, I have found it to be perfectly acceptable to walk up to someone,
tell them how excited I am to meet them and that I solved some of their PTs,
fumble with my list of PT answers and then give them my answers.  If
nothing else, it's a great conversation starter.  If you were to make your
own PT, you would make a stamp and logbook for it - if there's a question people
need to solve, you'll want to get it posted sooner than later, so that folks
have a couple days to figure it out before printing out their final lists.<br/>

Hope that helps!<br/>

<p>Hi everyone,<br/>
<br/>
I've never posted anything, anywhere before so I'm quite nervous, like the
whole world is listening. (I know that's a bit dramatic but still scared) I
have lots of questions about the upcoming event and other letterboxing stuff.
The other stuff can wait but I can't put off the TALE7 questions any longer.
Here goes…<br/>
<br/>
When do you post the clues for the boxes at the event? I saw that everyone put
the box info out for the new boxes but not the clues. So I did the same. I
already have the clues to the box ready. Should I print and bring copies of the
clues with me or add the clues to the site a day before. Also when I click the
`print checklist' box I get the Exchange Checklist and the Personal Travelers.
I know what to do with the personal travelers checklist but what do I do with
the exchange checklist. And once at the event, what's the process to get the
personal travelers. Do you just walk up to people whenever and give the answer
to their traveler question? If I did a traveler would I make a log book for it?
<br/>
<br/>
Thanks,<br/>
