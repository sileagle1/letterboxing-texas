                    <div class="plaintext-content">Another thing to consider is stamps that require several different colors.  A stamp might be normal size, but have so many details that require different colors that the first ones dry before you are done.  I'm not saying stamps like this should be avoided, especially since I have carved several myself, but it does require a speedy, though accurate, inking process with fine-tip markers.  Another alternative is to create a stamp with the colored areas carved away, so you stamp with black and color in with markers later.  Baby Bear does this quite a bit and it makes every stamp a little different, since nobody colors them in quite the same way.<br>

> I imagine we all agree with Granny Butterfly that we're grateful to find a letterbox, no matter what size the stamp, but I posed this discussion question because it's my nature to always want to tweak things to improve them when possible. And I wasn't clear - I was asking about stamps FOUND in letterboxes, not signature stamps - that's definitely none of my business! Perhaps it's  not actually the size that confounds me as much as the large areas of uncarved medium. Try as I may, and careful as I may be, I just can't seem to get a good image of large stamps with lots of uncarved areas and it ends up being a "blob" in my logbook. Maybe I need to add a brayer to my backpack supplies so I can roll the back of the stamp and get a better image transfer into my logbook, but then we'd have to be super careful not to crack or damage large stamps. I try to ink the largest areas last on a stamp so they don't have time to dry out. I replaced my markers and stamp pads often, I make sure to use plenty of ink, I huff, I carefully place the stamp on my page with the logbook on a flat surface, I press evenly all over the area, paying special attention to large uncarved areas, and I still come up with missing areas.<br>
