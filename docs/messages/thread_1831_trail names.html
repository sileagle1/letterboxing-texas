What if it was a real<br/>box with a "Dewberry" twist?<br/>Anyway, I kept my response to him civil and explained<br/>the reason behind the box. And even though we still<br/>disagree on a few things, he is working on a way for<br/>those coming in from LBNA to be able to see F-1 clues<br/>without a logged find. Not sure if it can be done, though.<br/>Right now the only way you can use the F-1 feature in AQ<br/>but still have the clue visible to LBNA users without logged<br/>finds in AQ is to post the clue separately in LBNA (don't<br/>use the box in AQ). This is extra work, but will ensure<br/>everyone can see your clue. Of course, this kind of <br/>defeats the purpose of using F-1 in the first place since<br/>search engines can now find your clue on LBNA. But at<br/>least the one on AQ would be safe. I like to
 think of<br/>LBNA as the main clue repository and AQ as the backup,<br/>but right now, many are doing it the other way. Nothing<br/>wrong with that, but you may not be aware of problems<br/>like the F-1 affair in the future. <br/>I've already spent way more time on this whole thing than<br/>I ever wanted to, but at least most of you know the<br/>situation now and will hopefully be more aware in the future.<br/>As for future boxers ...?<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<br/>(Who me spike the punch :&gt;)<br/><br/><br/>--- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, "Maribeth Jagger" <br/><cjagger405>wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; I found it amusing that Ryan stated that the only two people who <br/>logged a find on this box did so to push up their numbers of finds.

<div>Back in the 70's or 80's, everyone had a CB radio in the car and you had a "handle" (or nickname). My Dad was Roadrunner. Of course no one in his everyday life called him that, but it was part of the "game" in the world of driving back then. My husband is retired Air Force and most everyone in the air force had a "call name". His was "Tire Chaser" which was awarded to him in his younger days by his friends who said he was like and old dog chasing a car... if he ever caught one, he wouldn't know what to do with it. Noth quite as glamourous as "Maverick" or "Iceman", but ....  That's kind of the fun of a trail name, an alter ego. Would I feel silly sitting in the doctors office waiting room if the nurse came out and called, "Puddle Splaher"? Just a tad, but it's fun for the letterboxing experience.</div>
