<div>Don't overlook clues for nearby boxes that are actually in 
Dallas, not Duncanville, but are in that vicinity since Dallas sort of 
wraps around parts of Duncanville.  I'm thinking of my 2 boxes in Cedar 
Hill Nature Preserve, which is just a very short distance west of  those 
parks west of Duncanville, and of Silver Eagle and Baby Bear's two boxes in 
Cedar Hill State Park, which is just immediately west of the Nature 
Preserve.  And you might also check to see if PuddleSplasher's Wren Box is 
still in the Nature Preserve, although it has been reported missing (could be 
there, who knows, or maybe she'll have replaced it before your trip this 
way).  Actually, we're hoping you'll add a couple of your boxes to this 
area while you're up this way, too, of course!  </div>
