<div>You DO know about all three other places to post your boxes, right?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) LBNA - <a href="http://www.letterboxing.org">www.letterboxing.org</a> - and don't forget to check the "Announce" check box when you put your box in.  Checking that box will post it to an automated list serv that posts the clues to all new boxes entered whose owner checked the box.  But don't forget to subscribe yourself to the announcements list - 
<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/lbox-announce">http://groups.yahoo.com/groups/lbox-announce</a></div>
<div> </div>
<div>2) Atlasquest - <a href="http://www.atlasquest.com">www.atlasquest.com</a> - this site has more logging features and is just "different" than LBNA.  There is a way to post your box on this site and have it automatically post it to LBNA.  There are several on this list that know how to do it (I myself always seem to post it first to LBNA and then remember to post to Atlasquest, so I haven't ever used the auto-post feature).
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>3) Texas Letterboxing Atlas - <a href="http://www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com">www.birdsofafeather.netfirms.com</a> - this site is special for us in Texas and is managed by Sea Dove of Birds of a Feather.  It's a map site that pinpoints boxes on a map - great for someone like me who is very visual.  If you want him to post your boxes, you can email him once and give him permission to post your boxes and he will pick them up and post them whenever he sees you have a new one, but he won't post them WITHOUT your permission!  He's a busy guy with lots of real life on his plate, so don't expect to see your boxes posted the very next day, but he's diligent to post them once he knows it's okay with you.
<br/> </div>
<div>And of course, we would love to see you announce your boxes here too...<br/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy" </div>
