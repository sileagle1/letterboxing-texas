                    <div class="plaintext-content">As we mentioned, this year we will be having a raffle on Saturday for "Valuable" prizes.   Tickets will be on sale starting at 10am until time of raffle.  To win, you must be present.  We will go over the ground rules again at event, but here they are, along with ticket prices:<br>
<br>
Rules:  All prizes will be put on a table for all to view.  We will draw a ticket from the bag, and winner will get to pick what prize they want until the prizes are all gone.  At the end we will have 2 "SPECIAL" prizes hidden in boxes.   We will draw a ticket and:<br>
1) if it is a person that has won something already you will have a choice of turning in one of your prizes to take a hidden prize, or decline and we pick another ticket.<br>
2) if it is a person that has not won before, they get to pick box A or B. <br>
The second round will be determined by what happend in first round.  So if #1 happened, then there is now a hidden prize and a returned prize available.  If #2 happened, only the hidden prize will be left.   We will draw another ticket and the same method applies (if pre-winner, can turn in one of your prizes and take either the hidden prize or the turned in prize, and if non-winner you take either).  This will continue until no prizes are left (thus non-winners still have chances). <br>
<br>
Ticket prices (discounts for buying in bulk):<br>
$1  = 1 ticket<br>
$5  = 7 tickets<br>
$10 = 16 tickets<br>
$15 = 27 tickets<br>
$20 = 40 tickets<br>
<br>
Hopefully everyone will have fun with this.  I heard a rumor that IRA's boxers are one of the hidden prizes.<br>
