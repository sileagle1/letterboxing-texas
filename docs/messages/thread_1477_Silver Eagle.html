There's a post on the Oklahoma group that your "Cherokee Cowboy" box<br/>
is in need of repair.  <br/>
<br/>
Mom (Happy Days) and I are going to be there next weekend to box.  If<br/>
you would like to send a new logbook we'll replace the box, bags etc.<br/>
for you.<br/>

Just let me know if I should expect it or not, we'll leave Thursday.<br/>
