There's a post on the Oklahoma group that your "Cherokee Cowboy" box<br>
is in need of repair.  <br>
<br>
Mom (Happy Days) and I are going to be there next weekend to box.  If<br>
you would like to send a new logbook we'll replace the box, bags etc.<br>
for you.<br>

Just let me know if I should expect it or not, we'll leave Thursday.<br>
