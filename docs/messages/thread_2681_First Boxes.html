Anahuac National Wildlife Refuge.  That was in June 04 - that same
weekend we also found Silver Eagles Brown Bomber, Haak Wine and Space
City Shuttle.  The next month we were in Lufkin and found Silver
Eagles and Baby Bears boxes at Texas Forestry Museum.<br/>

We have loved this so much!  It was also more fun when Runs For Chocolate joined in our adventures!!<br/>

                    <html><body><p>I heard about letterboxing while listening to NPR one morning at work. That afternoon I went to letterboxing.org and found out there was a letterbox in Zilker park in downtown Austin--right across Town Lake from where I work.  <br/>The next day, I spent my lunch break following the clues.  Sure enough--there it was:  The USA Flag Letterbox planted by Silver Eagle.  It had a HH, too (Boomerang).  I didn't have a stamp, so I just looked at it and put it away.  That weekend I went out and bought the stuff to make a stamp.  After carving a wretched personal stamp, I went back to the box and stamped in.  That was on 4/16/04.  I stamped in the HH, as well, but just left it there because I didn't know what it was.<br/>GingerCat<br/></p><p>

<br>
Howdy, Texas!  It's me, FungusWoman, back at home after a whirlwind <br>
letterboxing extravaganza in Austin with my cousin Zepe.  I just <br>
celebrated my third Lb'ing anniversary there, and had a marvelous <br>
time, I might add.  Thanks to all of you who placed the many boxes we <br>
found (I haven't finished updating my finds in AQ and LbNA yet).   <br>
<br>
My first box?  In March '04 I took my daughter (Papillon, though <br>
she's now almost 17 and too cool to letterbox with me, yet alone be <br>
known by a trailname) over her spring break to Mall of America in <br>
Bloomington, MN, where I found DebRocks' two Minnesota Valley <br>
Wildlife Refuge boxes.  I'd read about letterboxing a couple years <br>
earlier in the ScoutingLinks newsletter, but never got around to <br>
trying it.  I returned there a year later to place "Fish out of water <br>
8: Spring break in MN".  For various reasons I was unable to place an <br>
anniversary box last year, but this year I left y'all (that's Texas <br>
talk wearin' off on me!) "Fish out of water 10: Spring Break in TX" <br>
over at Beverly Shiffield.  Hope you enjoy it and keep me posted of <br>
how it's doing.<br>
<br>
Take care!  Hope you be back soon - we love TX!<br>

appeared to be missing, Zepe went to check it out, and indeed it is <br>

Thanks to those who gave me the heads-up.<br>

                    <html><body><div>I can't remember if I answered this question - my first box was Stone Celt by Baby Bear and we found it on September 7th of 2003.  We went on to find Spanish Flag by Silver Eagle and Tejas by Baby Bear that same day.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>What makes this especially memorable for me is the fact that September 7th is the anniversary of my father's death.  Despite the fact that this year will mark 20 years he has been gone, each year is very difficult for me because I loved him so dearly.  For the first ten or so years after he was gone, I spent that day pretty much wasted.  I eventually realized how unhealthy that was and how disrespectful to him in the first place, and for the next several years I struggled through the day by being frenetically active on that day so I just couldn't think of losing him.  It was in that vein that we tried letterboxing almost 4 years ago, and it was fate that we found a hobby we thoroughly enjoy, and which my dad would have gone nuts over.  We still spend Labor Day weekend (and the weekend after if Labor Day falls the Monday before the 7th) letterboxing each year, but not so much to keep me sane, but because it is a peaceful, positive way for me to mark the time without losing my mind.
