Some good things happened in El Paso Today.....<br/>
<br/>
First - I went out and hunted the letterbox my wife Dane Lady placed.  She<br/>
did a very nice job of it.  It was a nice hike - although getting warm by<br/>
the time we got down from the mountain at 1000.  It is a letterbox hybrid<br/>
geocache.  As a nice touch - she stuffed it full of kid toys and is letting<br/>
any kids hiking to it pick one toy free for hiking - no trading necessary.<br/>
Justin, one of the famous Texas Chihuahuas came along.  He is just<br/>
recovering from what Dane Lady calls "Brain Surgery", so he enjoyed the run<br/>
in the mountains too.  The staples didn't seem to bother him too much.<br/>
<br/>
Next - I (and Cherokee Brave) placed (replaced) the missing letterbox for<br/>
Sandibox<br/>
http://www.letterboxing.org/BoxView.php?boxnum=17560<br/>
<br/>
We did not stamp in - saving it for a rainy day.  Heh heh heh - last time I<br/>
did that - it went missing!  I hid it in a better spot this time.  Changed<br/>
clues sent.  I suppose she will update the clues soon.<br/>
<br/>
Last - and the BEST NEWS.  The LBNA patches arrived last night.  So for our<br/>
weekly ham-radio gun shooting Letterboxer geocacher hiking and dog training<br/>
meeting and pot-luck dinner last night I passed out LBNA, TX-LBNA, and<br/>
Geocaching patches to all the participating members.  Two guys don't play.<br/>
They didn't get patches either!  <grin><br/>
<br/>
Only bad part so far is I was told to clean my room, and get my junk off the<br/>
table.  Can you imagine that!  She wants to serve DINNER on the dining room<br/>
table!!!!  So where am I supposed to clean my rifle and store my hiking<br/>
gear????<br/>
<br/>
Hope she don't read this!  <grin><br/>
<br/>
Y-all have a GREAT day.<br/>

<div>Know the feeling.  I gave up on the kitchen table long ago.  We have too many people with too many projects in our house!  I've even given up on the living room.  Between Lightning practicing karate, SJZ practicing dance, and us all always seeming to be in transit, I got rid of the living room furniture and I tell visitors we are remodeling the living room and redo-ing the hardwood floors, but really, between ourselves we just refer to the living room as "the staging area."

<div>At the moment Fearless Fox and Lightning are packing to go to Mexico for a week and I'm packing to take an extended letterboxing weekend next weekend.  And Day Camp starts day after tomorrow, so we have numerous craft projects in various degrees of finishedness scattered among backpacks and tents...

OMG!!!  I'm not the only one!!!  I finally gave up on apologizing <br/>
for the constant mess/upheaval in our house and just came right out <br/>
and admitted the truth.  We live our lives and don't clean our <br/>
house.  (Not that it's dirty...just in a constant, never-ending <br/>
state of coming and going!)  I finally had to give up the imaginary <br/>
picture in my head of what my house might look like if everything <br/>
were picked up and put away........now it's just my house......the <br/>
place where we sleep and get ready to go somewhere else to do <br/>
something else!<br/>
<br/>
You cannot imagine how relieved I am to know that I'm not the only <br/>
one out there!<br/>
