<br>
I noticed that you have a box near Grand Lake Lodge - Colorado.  <br>
Since there is much snow in the high country right now, do you think <br>
that it will be accessible at this time?  Wanted to check before we <br>
head out to find it.  We live in the foothills of Denver - Highlands <br>
Ranch to be exact - we got a surprise snow storm this past Sunday - <br>
much needed snow for our area though! <br>
<br>
You'd be surprised at what you can find in the snow - ha!  We found <br>
four letterboxes in Deer Creek Canyon Park on Saturday.  We hiked 5 <br>
1/2 miles in ice, snow and mud.  That's progress for this Texas girl!<br>
<br>
We are expected to road trip to Canyon, TX this weekend.  To visit <br>
Eoghan's mom - Eoghan is from Canyon.  YES, I see that you have the <br>
Palo Duro Mouse letterbox in Palo Duro Canyon.  Trust me, we WILL <br>
find it!  I love that place!  It's so great to add letterboxing to <br>
road trips!  <br>
<br>
Look forward to your post!<br>
<br>
Ciao,<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I know that Grand Lake Lodge is closed for the season now<br>
but you can park outside and walk in.  Not sure how much<br>
snow builds up around there since they probably don't<br>
remove any while it's closed.  If you can get to the tree<br>
that the box is hidden under you may be able to dig it out.<br>
I know somebody found it in November but not much snow then.<br>
Glad that you will be going after my box in Palo Duro Canyon.<br>
That is a great park and you will enjoy it more than I did<br>
last summer when the temperature was 110!  I did manage to<br>
find Eoghan's box further down the trail from mine and it<br>
was still doing well, but with few visits.  Looking forward<br>
to hearing how mine is doing since you may be its first<br>
visitors.<br>
