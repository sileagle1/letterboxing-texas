There have been some people throughout the years who were not nice (or any semblance of cordial) in various emails. In truth, I think they are they type of person who thrive on negativity and being right or doing things only one way - their way. That's ok, I just don't need them in my life. Because of some interactions, both on the board and on AQ, we've stopped interacting as much and made boxing what we need it to be for us. We still box occasionally, but we don't log anything anymore except in our personal logbooks. That being said, we've met and had great interactions in person.

<p>Well said, Ms. Motel! And I agree with you, Blue Butterfly, that I too miss the campfire where we used to sit around and rehash old pranks and start new ones! And I also like Wry Me's comment about the internet not allowing for raised eyebrows. So often what is said in jest, just doesn't reach the reader with the same meaning. (Guilty!) I too am looking forward to TALE: seeing old friends and meeting new ones. </p>
<p>But I do feel a need to mention this about the Circus Box or any other special traveling boxes. Anyone who has ever been fortunate enough to find one of those traveling boxes realizes what a special treat it is. So many boxers put their best effort into carving a stamp and creating a neat page in the logbook. Many of us have made a special effort to find one of those boxes when they land in our area (or even sometimes... not in our area). In the past, one of those great boxes went missing when a non-boxer received it, and we were all very upset as we all treasure those boxes and look forward to the opportunity to find it and participate. We used to have an "unwritten rule" (since we don't have rules in letterboxing), that you should use the same urgency in replanting the box that you did in seeking it, because many people want to be able to look for it. Obviously, situations happen in people's lives that delay them from being able to re-hide it quickly, and I'd suggest if that happens in the future, we contact the "owner" of the box listed in the front of the logbook, or post on this list that we have the box but circumstances have occurred that prevent us from being able to re-hide it. (That's happened before.) I can almost guarantee that some local boxer will be able to help you out. I'm not scolding anyone, but just suggesting that in the future, hurt feelings may be avoided if we have a system in place to allow this type of box to stay active and in circulation because they really are wonderful boxes and are treasured by any Texas letterboxer who finds them.</p>

                    <html><body><p>Hi Everyone,<br/>I don't usually post but as a true outsider (I am not a Texas letterboxer - I am from New Mexico) I have to wholeheartedly echo Bell Motel's sentiments. When I first started letterboxing there were less than 50 boxes planted in New Mexico so when I heard about an event near Houston I decided to make the trek to have access to more boxes and get to meet more letterboxers. I arrived at the Great Book Adventure and was immediately welcomed. Over the last eight years I have attended around 11 events in Texas. I truly feel that this wonderful group of Texas letterboxers is by far the most welcoming I have ever experienced. I have met some incredible people and found some amazing boxes. As with any group it takes some effort to make your way in. But from my experience it wasn't hard - everyone I have met at the events has been friendly and helpful and I always look forward to when I have an opportunity to visit Texas and do some letterboxing. <br/>lionsmane</p></body></html>

What a treat it is seeing his art!  Maybe we could add a carve after a certain timeframe, but after that the priority should change to replanting it or something.  Other possible issues to address would be updates on the status, as in, "I'm currently passing the box around to all my boxing buddies and they're adding carves, so I get 3 times as long."   Ahem.  Not that I did that.

I too am looking forward to TALE: seeing old friends and meeting new ones. <o:p></o:p></p><p>But I do feel a need to mention this about the Circus Box or any other special traveling boxes. Anyone who has ever been fortunate enough to find one of those traveling boxes realizes what a special treat it is. So many boxers put their best effort into carving a stamp and creating a neat page in the logbook. Many of us have made a special effort to find one of those boxes when they land in our area (or even sometimes... not in our area). In the past, one of those great boxes went missing when a non-boxer received it, and we were all very upset as we all treasure those boxes and look forward to the opportunity to find it and participate. We used to have an "unwritten rule" (since we don't have rules in letterboxing), that you should use the same urgency in replanting the box that you did in seeking it, because many people want to be able to look for it. Obviously, situations happen in people's lives that delay them from being able to re-hide it quickly, and I'd suggest if that happens in the future, we contact the "owner" of the box listed in the front of the logbook, or post on this list that we have the box but circumstances have occurred that prevent us from being able to re-hide it. (That's happened before.) I can almost guarantee that some local boxer will be able to help you out. I'm not scolding anyone, but just suggesting that in the future, hurt feelings may be avoided if we have a system in place to allow this type of box to stay active and in circulation because they really are wonderful boxes and are treasured by any Texas letterboxer who finds them.<o:p></o:p></p><p>Puddle Splasher<o:p></o:p></p><blockquote><p><span>-----Original Message----- <br/>From: "Vicki Bell <a href="mailto:vicki@bellmotel.com">vicki@bellmotel.com</a> [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS]" <br/>Sent: Jan 15, 2015 12:14 PM <br/>To: "<a href="mailto:LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com">LETTERBOXINGTEXAS@yahoogroups.com</a>" <br/>Subject: Re: [LETTERBOXINGTEXAS] Re: Group Dynamics <br/><br/>I have to admit that the pranks have piled up over the years, and if you<br/>see us giggling over what appears to be a shared memory, ask us!
