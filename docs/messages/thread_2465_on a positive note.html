<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">One of my favorite 
things about letterboxing is finding a new place.  Some of the boxes that 
really stand out in my mind were very simple stamps, but places I never would 
have known about (or never would have gotten around to going to visit) without 
letterboxing.  Some of my all time favorites are: Don't Mess With Texas 
(what a cool bridge!) Gordon Grouper (I've already said that!) Mother of Texas 
(why else would I have an excuse to haul 4 kids around a cemetery) LLet's LLunch 
(Austin isn't the only weird place) and the Mother of all strange 
places....Stonehenge 2.</font></div>

have a love/hate (many times more hate than love) relationship with mystery 
boxes/puzzle clues.  The Tour Bus is great, because it is a surprise every 
time.  I like a box that makes me say, "What a cool ______!".  But 
more than anything I love a new place.  (Which is not to say I'll quit 
finding boxes in places I've already been!)  MO5</font></div></body></html>

I have discovered just local parks that are actually close to my neighborhood that I didn't even know existed without there having been a lb planted there. We have taken family members (in-laws) to some of these places after doing the boxes and they were amazed too.
