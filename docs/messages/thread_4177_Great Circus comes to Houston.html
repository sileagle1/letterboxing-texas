<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hello, Everyone!  A really fabulous one-ring 
circus from Mexico will be playing Houston, July 10 - August 02.  It is El 
Circo Hermanos Vazquez -- the Vazquez Brothers Circus, at <a href="http://www.circovazquez.com">www.circovazquez.com</a>.  They'll be at 
I-45 and Airline.  We went to see them twice in Austin, and were blown 
away.  Pay to sit in the front row.  The experience is fabulous.  
On the second night, I brought photos to owner Jesus Vazquez (he's the 
ringmaster for the second half) that I had taken of the show in Houston in 
1996.  He was so happy!  The show has grown so much -- it has top 
performers from all over the globe.  The show is all in Spanish, but is 
fast-paced, wonderful, surprising, and thoroughly enjoyable.  I obviously 
can't recommend it enough!  -- Bell Motel</font></div></body></html>
