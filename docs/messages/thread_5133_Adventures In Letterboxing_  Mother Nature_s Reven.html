                    <div class="plaintext-content">This time of year is when Baby bear and I usually take a letterboxing trip somewhere in Texas or beyond, but he couldn't make it this year so I decided to do a solo mini-trip in the Waco/Belton/Temple area.  I had not been to the area in a long time and several new boxes were just waiting to be found, including several by Boots Tex, so that was incentive enough.<br/>
<br/>
After finding a few boxes on the way there I finally arrived at Holy Cross Cemetery in Waco.  It has several nice boxes and is right next to Oakwood Cemetery which has several more, so I planned to spend quite some time here.  I found all but 1 box, including 3 by Boots and 1 by Lone Star Quilter, and saw many graves of famous people that I would not have known about were it not for the clues.  While I was finding boxes I kept my eye out for the grave of Doc Alderton, the inventor of Dr. Pepper.  I had read that he was buried there and I planned to place a box in his honor, but the place is huge and I could not find it.  Before giving up I tried going to the nearby visitor building to ask for help and the lady there was great.  She showed me where the grave was on a map and told me right how to get there, so I was able to hide my box nearby.  I highly recommend stopping by this place!<br/>
<br/>
Next up was Cameron Park.  Over the years I have found and placed several boxes in this nice park, but they all seem to go missing fairly quick, and this time was no exception.  All 3 boxes I tried to find were not there, but I tempted fate and placed a new one anyway.  I finished up the day at Carleen Bright Arboretum where I found 1 and placed one.  It is a nice place and could stand more boxes.<br/>
<br/>
The next day I headed toward Belton, stopping in McGregor to place a box and Moody to find one.  My main destination this day was going to be Miller Springs Park.  There was only 1 box to find and one to place, but because of the way the clues were written I knew it was going to take a little time and moderate hiking.  Boy did I underestimate!  <br/>
<br/>
I had last been to this great park way back in 2004 to find the Peace and Friendship boxes and my senile old brain could not remember much about it.  It also didn't help that Mother Nature had been busy changing things just to make it more interesting and challenging.  I was going to look for Bad Bat Box first, then place mine somewhere along the way, but to find this box you have to follow the clues to Peace &amp; Friendship, so that is what I tried to do.  The clues say to follow the North Trail and bear left at some point to go down some rocky steps.  Well right off the bat there are several intersections of trails, so I dutifully kept staying left until I got all the way down a ravine heading the wrong direction and finding no landmarks described in the clues.  After about 30 minutes of this I backtracked to the beginning and decided to just place my box and cut my losses.  Mother Nature: 1, Silver Eagle: 0.  <br/>
<br/>
I went on a different trail and found a neat place to put mine right at the edge of a rock shelf and as I was writing up my clues I noticed there were rock steps leading down the shelf.  A light bulb went off and I realized this must be the place mentioned in the Peace clues.  The hunt was back on!  MN: 1, SE: 1.<br/>
<br/>
Things went good for awhile as I found various landmarks in the clues, until I got to the part where it says "you will come to a small ravine that used to be spanned by a wooden bridge, but it has been out of commission for some time now and ... you have to go down into the ravine ... then scramble up the other bank".  I vaguely remembered crossing that old bridge back in 2004, but now there was no trace of it.  MN: 2, SE: 1.<br/>
<br/>
Luckily the creek was low and I was able to cross by jumping across rocks, but the far bank had been eroded to the point where it was now at least 5 feet high with no footholds and I wasn't sure I could get up it.  MN: 3, SE: 2.<br/>
<br/>
Well I pride myself on being in pretty good shape so there was no way I was going to give up due to a physical challenge (mentally is another matter).  Besides, if Baby Bear ever came and was able to climb up I knew I would never hear the end of it.  So I jumped as high as I could and managed to grab a rock at the top and pull myself up, muddy but happy, and continue on the trail.  MN: 3, SE: 3.<br/>
<br/>
Now I'm getting close to the Peace box and I just need to find a fallen tree next to a group of boulders.  I find the boulders but no tree.  Now I didn't really need to find the box since I already found it back in 2004, but I thought it would be cool to see it again so I kept looking.  By sheer luck I found it, an old Rubbermaid box covered in muck, and proceeded to gloat as I opened it up to find..nothing except a note saying it was a letterbox.  Since Mother Nature had nothing to do with taking the contents and I did find the box, I gave myself another mental point.  MN: 4, SE: 4.<br/>
<br/>
Now it was on to the next box, Friendship.  I did not need to find it either since the clues to the Bad Bat box went in another direction, but I decided to look for it anyway.  I did find it and since it had a new logbook I stamped in.  MN: 4, SE: 5.<br/>
<br/>
I'm starting to feel a little cocky as I head toward the Bad Bat box so I guess it was inevitable what happened next.  I found the area where the box was supposed to be and starting looking for the box "on top of the large rocks, covered by small rocks", but it wasn't clear which part of the rocks it meant, and they were pretty high up.  I had to scramble up a fairly steep slope to get to the rocks and then use my left hand to hang on to a rock above me while I searched with my right hand.  All of a sudden my left hand starts hurting so I hang on with my right to look at it and discover what looks like a thorn sticking out.  That seems weird since there are no sticker bushes anywhere, so I pull it out with my teeth and prepare to start searching for the box again when I hear loud buzzing and see a huge cloud form above my head.  It finally dawns on me that the sticker was a bee stinger and the cloud is a bunch of angry bees, so with great dignity and grace I give a yelp and tumble down the slope, tearing my hiking pants, and start running down the trail waving my arms at the swarm following me.  I must have run for  mile before they left me alone and was ready to admit defeat, so I headed back to the parking lot, tail between my torn legs.  As I was driving away it finally dawned on me that if I had reversed the direction of the clues I could have been at the location of Bad Bat in less than 15 minutes with none of the mishaps!  MN: 8, SE: 5.<br/>
<br/>
Bottom line:  Mother Nature can be cruel but she is beautiful and worth every minute you can spend with her; just be prepared for an adventure!  Happy trails everyone.<br/>

I had not been to the area in a long time and several new boxes were just waiting to be found, including several by Boots Tex, so that was incentive enough.<br/><br/>After finding a few boxes on the way there I finally arrived at Holy Cross Cemetery in Waco. It has several nice boxes and is right next to Oakwood Cemetery which has several more, so I planned to spend quite some time here. I found all but 1 box, including 3 by Boots and 1 by Lone Star Quilter, and saw many graves of famous people that I would not have known about were it not for the clues. While I was finding boxes I kept my eye out for the grave of Doc Alderton, the inventor of Dr. Pepper. I had read that he was buried there and I planned to place a box in his honor, but the place is huge and I could not find it. Before giving up I tried going to the nearby visitor building to ask for help and the lady there was great. She showed me where the grave was on a map and told me right how to get there, so I was able to hide my box nearby. I highly recommend stopping by this place!<br/><br/>Next up was Cameron Park. Over the years I have found and placed several boxes in this nice park, but they all seem to go missing fairly quick, and this time was no exception. All 3 boxes I tried to find were not there, but I tempted fate and placed a new one anyway. I finished up the day at Carleen Bright Arboretum where I found 1 and placed one. It is a nice place and could stand more boxes.<br/><br/>The next day I headed toward Belton, stopping in McGregor to place a box and Moody to find one. My main destination this day was going to be Miller Springs Park. There was only 1 box to find and one to place, but because of the way the clues were written I knew it was going to take a little time and moderate hiking. Boy did I underestimate! <br/><br/>I had last been to this great park way back in 2004 to find the Peace and Friendship boxes and my senile old brain could not remember much about it. It also didn't help that Mother Nature had been busy changing things just to make it more interesting and challenging. I was going to look for Bad Bat Box first, then place mine somewhere along the way, but to find this box you have to follow the clues to Peace &amp; Friendship, so that is what I tried to do. The clues say to follow the North Trail and bear left at some point to go down some rocky steps. Well right off the bat there are several intersections of trails, so I dutifully kept staying left until I got all the way down a ravine heading the wrong direction and finding no landmarks described in the clues. After about 30 minutes of this I backtracked to the beginning and decided to just place my box and cut my losses. Mother Nature: 1, Silver Eagle: 0. <br/><br/>I went on a different trail and found a neat place to put mine right at the edge of a rock shelf and as I was writing up my clues I noticed there were rock steps leading down the shelf. A light bulb went off and I realized this must be the place mentioned in the Peace clues. The hunt was back on! MN: 1, SE: 1.<br/><br/>Things went good for awhile as I found various landmarks in the clues, until I got to the part where it says "you will come to a small ravine that used to be spanned by a wooden bridge, but it has been out of commission for some time now and ... you have to go down into the ravine ... then scramble up the other bank". I vaguely remembered crossing that old bridge back in 2004, but now there was no trace of it. MN: 2, SE: 1.<br/><br/>Luckily the creek was low and I was able to cross by jumping across rocks, but the far bank had been eroded to the point where it was now at least 5 feet high with no footholds and I wasn't sure I could get up it. MN: 3, SE: 2.<br/><br/>Well I pride myself on being in pretty good shape so there was no way I was going to give up due to a physical challenge (mentally is another matter). Besides, if Baby Bear ever came and was able to climb up I knew I would never hear the end of it. So I jumped as high as I could and managed to grab a rock at the top and pull myself up, muddy but happy, and continue on the trail. MN: 3, SE: 3.<br/><br/>Now I'm getting close to the Peace box and I just need to find a fallen tree next to a group of boulders. I find the boulders but no tree. Now I didn't really need to find the box since I already found it back in 2004, but I thought it would be cool to see it again so I kept looking. By sheer luck I found it, an old Rubbermaid box covered in muck, and proceeded to gloat as I opened it up to find…..nothing except a note saying it was a letterbox. Since Mother Nature had nothing to do with taking the contents and I did find the box, I gave myself another mental point. MN: 4, SE: 4.<br/><br/>Now it was on to the next box, Friendship. I did not need to find it either since the clues to the Bad Bat box went in another direction, but I decided to look for it anyway. I did find it and since it had a new logbook I stamped in. MN: 4, SE: 5.<br/><br/>I'm starting to feel a little cocky as I head toward the Bad Bat box so I guess it was inevitable what happened next. I found the area where the box was supposed to be and starting looking for the box "on top of the large rocks, covered by small rocks", but it wasn't clear which part of the rocks it meant, and they were pretty high up. I had to scramble up a fairly steep slope to get to the rocks and then use my left hand to hang on to a rock above me while I searched with my right hand. All of a sudden my left hand starts hurting so I hang on with my right to look at it and discover what looks like a thorn sticking out. That seems weird since there are no sticker bushes anywhere, so I pull it out with my teeth and prepare to start searching for the box again when I hear loud buzzing and see a huge cloud form above my head. It finally dawns on me that the sticker was a bee stinger and the cloud is a bunch of angry bees, so with great dignity and grace I give a yelp and tumble down the slope, tearing my hiking pants, and start running down the trail waving my arms at the swarm following me. I must have run for  mile before they left me alone and was ready to admit defeat, so I headed back to the parking lot, tail between my torn legs. As I was driving away it finally dawned on me that if I had reversed the direction of the clues I could have been at the location of Bad Bat in less than 15 minutes with none of the mishaps! MN: 8, SE: 5.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Mother Nature can be cruel but she is beautiful and worth every minute you can spend with her; just be prepared for an adventure! Happy trails everyone.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p><span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>

I had not been to the area in a long time and several new boxes were just waiting to be found, including several by Boots Tex, so that was incentive enough.<br/><br/>After finding a few boxes on the way there I finally arrived at Holy Cross Cemetery in Waco. It has several nice boxes and is right next to Oakwood Cemetery which has several more, so I planned to spend quite some time here. I found all but 1 box, including 3 by Boots and 1 by Lone Star Quilter, and saw many graves of famous people that I would not have known about were it not for the clues. While I was finding boxes I kept my eye out for the grave of Doc Alderton, the inventor of Dr. Pepper. I had read that he was buried there and I planned to place a box in his honor, but the place is huge and I could not find it. Before giving up I tried going to the nearby visitor building to ask for help and the lady there was great. She showed me where the grave was on a map and told me right how to get there, so I was able to hide my box nearby. I highly recommend stopping by this place!<br/><br/>Next up was Cameron Park. Over the years I have found and placed several boxes in this nice park, but they all seem to go missing fairly quick, and this time was no exception. All 3 boxes I tried to find were not there, but I tempted fate and placed a new one anyway. I finished up the day at Carleen Bright Arboretum where I found 1 and placed one. It is a nice place and could stand more boxes.<br/><br/>The next day I headed toward Belton, stopping in McGregor to place a box and Moody to find one. My main destination this day was going to be Miller Springs Park. There was only 1 box to find and one to place, but because of the way the clues were written I knew it was going to take a little time and moderate hiking. Boy did I underestimate! <br/><br/>I had last been to this great park way back in 2004 to find the Peace and Friendship boxes and my senile old brain could not remember much about it. It also didn't help that Mother Nature had been busy changing things just to make it more interesting and challenging. I was going to look for Bad Bat Box first, then place mine somewhere along the way, but to find this box you have to follow the clues to Peace &amp; Friendship, so that is what I tried to do. The clues say to follow the North Trail and bear left at some point to go down some rocky steps. Well right off the bat there are several intersections of trails, so I dutifully kept staying left until I got all the way down a ravine heading the wrong direction and finding no landmarks described in the clues. After about 30 minutes of this I backtracked to the beginning and decided to just place my box and cut my losses. Mother Nature: 1, Silver Eagle: 0. <br/><br/>I went on a different trail and found a neat place to put mine right at the edge of a rock shelf and as I was writing up my clues I noticed there were rock steps leading down the shelf. A light bulb went off and I realized this must be the place mentioned in the Peace clues. The hunt was back on! MN: 1, SE: 1.<br/><br/>Things went good for awhile as I found various landmarks in the clues, until I got to the part where it says "you will come to a small ravine that used to be spanned by a wooden bridge, but it has been out of commission for some time now and ... you have to go down into the ravine ... then scramble up the other bank". I vaguely remembered crossing that old bridge back in 2004, but now there was no trace of it. MN: 2, SE: 1.<br/><br/>Luckily the creek was low and I was able to cross by jumping across rocks, but the far bank had been eroded to the point where it was now at least 5 feet high with no footholds and I wasn't sure I could get up it. MN: 3, SE: 2.<br/><br/>Well I pride myself on being in pretty good shape so there was no way I was going to give up due to a physical challenge (mentally is another matter). Besides, if Baby Bear ever came and was able to climb up I knew I would never hear the end of it. So I jumped as high as I could and managed to grab a rock at the top and pull myself up, muddy but happy, and continue on the trail. MN: 3, SE: 3.<br/><br/>Now I'm getting close to the Peace box and I just need to find a fallen tree next to a group of boulders. I find the boulders but no tree. Now I didn't really need to find the box since I already found it back in 2004, but I thought it would be cool to see it again so I kept looking. By sheer luck I found it, an old Rubbermaid box covered in muck, and proceeded to gloat as I opened it up to find…..nothing except a note saying it was a letterbox. Since Mother Nature had nothing to do with taking the contents and I did find the box, I gave myself another mental point. MN: 4, SE: 4.<br/><br/>Now it was on to the next box, Friendship. I did not need to find it either since the clues to the Bad Bat box went in another direction, but I decided to look for it anyway. I did find it and since it had a new logbook I stamped in. MN: 4, SE: 5.<br/><br/>I'm starting to feel a little cocky as I head toward the Bad Bat box so I guess it was inevitable what happened next. I found the area where the box was supposed to be and starting looking for the box "on top of the large rocks, covered by small rocks", but it wasn't clear which part of the rocks it meant, and they were pretty high up. I had to scramble up a fairly steep slope to get to the rocks and then use my left hand to hang on to a rock above me while I searched with my right hand. All of a sudden my left hand starts hurting so I hang on with my right to look at it and discover what looks like a thorn sticking out. That seems weird since there are no sticker bushes anywhere, so I pull it out with my teeth and prepare to start searching for the box again when I hear loud buzzing and see a huge cloud form above my head. It finally dawns on me that the sticker was a bee stinger and the cloud is a bunch of angry bees, so with great dignity and grace I give a yelp and tumble down the slope, tearing my hiking pants, and start running down the trail waving my arms at the swarm following me. I must have run for  mile before they left me alone and was ready to admit defeat, so I headed back to the parking lot, tail between my torn legs. As I was driving away it finally dawned on me that if I had reversed the direction of the clues I could have been at the location of Bad Bat in less than 15 minutes with none of the mishaps! MN: 8, SE: 5.<br/><br/>Bottom line: Mother Nature can be cruel but she is beautiful and worth every minute you can spend with her; just be prepared for an adventure! Happy trails everyone.<br/><br/>Silver Eagle<o:p></o:p></p></div><div><p><span><o:p></o:p></span></p></div></div></div></div></body></html>
