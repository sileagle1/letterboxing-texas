                    <div class="plaintext-content">ok i have a question about the proper thing to do.  a local <br>
letterboxer who quit letterboxing about a year ago had posted that she <br>
had pulled all of her boxes in the area.  she also deleted the boxes <br>
from both atlas quest and from lbna.  today i went to place a box in a <br>
spot where she had originally placed one and lo and behold, her box <br>
was still there.  now, again it is no secret that she has quit finding <br>
and placing boxes.  so my dilemna is what do i do?  <br>
thanks, jb<br>
