                    <div class="plaintext-content">I agree that March 19 would be better as far as weather goes<br/>
and that seems to be the majority choice.  Right now there<br/>
are 46 campsites still available for that date so it should<br/>
work if I can get one of the covered picnic areas.  I guess<br/>
we can wait a few more days to see if that date is still the<br/>
favorite and I will try to call and see when picnic areas<br/>
are available.<br/>
Several people who were not able to attend last year's Event<br/>
have asked what to expect, and my response is that we can<br/>
do it any way we want and I am open to suggestions.  Last<br/>
year we all brought some food and/or the means to eat it<br/>
and spent quite a bit of time eating and meeting each other.<br/>
Then groups of people went searching for existing or new<br/>
letterboxes, and some came back to eat and visit again.  <br/>
There was no formal schedule of events or itinerary and I<br/>
kind of liked the way it went.  People just came and went<br/>
as their schedule allowed.  Some came the night before and<br/>
camped both nights (I plan to do this), others just came for<br/>
the day.  You can go to my Event page to read more about it:  <br/>

<br/>
We can decide how to run the event later, after we pick<br/>
a date and get reservations.<br/>

Besides fishing, hiking and alligator viewing, it also has<br/>
the George Observatory, which allows the public to look through<br/>
several telescopes on Saturday nights.  I highly recommend <br/>
doing this and just hope it is a clear night when we are there.<br/>

Thanks for the input so far and sorry for you letterboxers<br/>
that live so far away having to either drive forever or miss<br/>
the event.  Maybe next year we will have enough letterboxers to<br/>
have 2 Events in different parts of the State.<br/>
