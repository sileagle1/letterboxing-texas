                    <div class="plaintext-content">We just got back home from a couple of days trailer camping with our <br>
son (trail name Fish Tree) and his family (wife and 3 kids 6, 4, 8 <br>
mos.).  We stayed wet all the time, either from the rain or the <br>
humidity, but had a great time.  We didn't take any letterboxes with <br>
us to place because, after all, this is a State Park.  This is one <br>
of those parks that hand out a list of geocaches and their gps <br>
coordinates, so I asked the ranger about the park policy on <br>
letterboxing and she said that she had never heard of it.  She <br>
called two other rangers in, including the head guy and neither of <br>
them knew what letterboxing was.  I explained it to them and they <br>
didn't have a problem with it. The head man did ask where we would <br>
typically hide a box and I told him generally behind trees, under <br>
logs, etc. He said there was nothing wrong with that. They said they <br>
had never had any trouble with geocachers and, in fact, thought they <br>
brought visitors to the park.  The first lady was really intrigued <br>
and thought it sounded like a great family hobby.  She was impressed <br>
that the kids would actually go with us instead of wanting to stay <br>
in the trailer and watch DVD's.  We went back to the trailer and <br>
made 3 letterboxes to place.  Mine is called "Nabedache", LSQ's <br>
is "Indian Trails - Quilt Block Series" and Fish Tree carved a stamp <br>
for Princess Aurora and hers is called "Tejas Bell".  We took them <br>
to the ranger this morning and showed the boxes to her before <br>
planting them.  Looking at the stamp impression on the logbook, she <br>
asked, "How do you get this stamped on, with a potato?".  Then I <br>
showed her the stamp and told her that we had just finished carving <br>
them and she was really impressed.  I didn't tell her that two <br>
letterboxes had been in that park for over four years (they're both <br>
in fine shape, by the way).  Actually, when we were looking for a <br>
place to hide LSQ's box, we found one of Atoy Adventurer's boxes <br>
(Pretty Kitty).  She has four there, although we didn't realize it <br>
at the time since they're not listed on LbNA.  The ranger gave me <br>
her card and asked if I would email her the website address whenever <br>
I posted the clues. This is a lovely little park, but has some good <br>
trails and a restored 1828 log house,as well as the Mission Tejas, <br>
and is also kept very clean.  This is now a letterbox-friendly park <br>
and if we all treat it with respect, we can keep it that way.<br>

<div> </div>
<div>I'm so glad you had a good experience there!  I remembered later that MT was, in fact, the park I had found that was treasure-hunt friendly.  I was talking to a weekend ranger when I was there with our pack on a campout in March.  The person I talked to was somewhat familiar with the stashes in the park, although I had forgotten about Atoy Adventurer's also since they weren't on LBNA (or maybe they weren't there then).  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm not sure if any of them told you, but there is a hike you can take in that park that must be guided by a ranger, because it goes into off-limits areas.  They have an archaeological site where there are even some wagon tracks preserved along the El Camino Real.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think Mission Tejas is, hands-down, the best State Park I've ever visited.  Long ago we visited there alot and were very familiar with the trails.  It was there on our first day letterboxing that I was astounded to discover Baby Bear's box not 6 feet from where we had gone many, many times.  It has the friendliest staff I've ever run across, and they are also quite knowledgeable about a wide variety of topics.  If you hit them on the weekends, there is a ranger that does a 19th century tools and toys program that will rock your socks - his program lasted an hour and we sat and talked to him for another THREE hours after that, and he could have gone on even longer.  That particular ranger is also very good about catching and properly handling Wampus Cats - he almost always has one he has just captured in his truck and is taking out to release.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It just figures that a park with that kind of track record also sees the wisdom of welcoming visitors who will promote visitation by others and will cooperate with those of us who are willing to responsibly use their facility.  Kudos to them, and kudos to you and LSQ for being ambassadors yet again!

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We pretty much had the park to ourselves this time.  You're right <br>
about the friendly staff and they do have some excellent events.  <br>
One ranger is a natural story-teller and commedian.  He came up to <br>
the Mission while we were there and gave the kids bug-catchers, bug <br>
boxes and magnifying glasses.  He has a story-telling hour around <br>
the fireplace, but you have to be there at the right time.  I knew <br>
that the park had a large area that was off-limits, but didn't know <br>
about the archaeological site.  That's cool.  I didn't see any <br>
Wampus Cats.  Is that the kind with six legs that the Cherokees <br>
brought from Tennessee?  I think that's where the term "Catty <br>
Wampus" comes from.<br>

 are also quite knowledgeable about a wide variety of topics.  If you hit them on the weekends, there is a ranger that does a 19th century tools and toys program that will rock your socks - his program lasted an hour and we sat and talked to him for another THREE hours after that, and he could have gone on even longer.  That particular ranger is also very good about catching and properly handling Wampus Cats - he almost always has one he has just captured in his truck and is taking out to release.  </div> <div> </div> <div>It just figures that a park with that kind of track record also sees the wisdom of welcoming visitors who will promote visitation by others and will cooperate with those of us who are willing to responsibly use their facility.  Kudos to them, and kudos to you and LSQ for being ambassadors yet again! </div> <div> </div> <div><br/><br/> </div> <div><span class="gmail_quote">On 6/27/07, <b class="gmail_sendername">Boots Tex

The first lady was really intrigued <br/>and thought it sounded like a great family hobby. She was impressed <br/>that the kids would actually go with us instead of wanting to stay <br/>in the trailer and watch DVD's. We went back to the trailer and <br/>made 3 letterboxes to place. Mine is called "Nabedache", LSQ's <br/>is "Indian Trails - Quilt Block Series" and Fish Tree carved a stamp <br/>for Princess Aurora and hers is called "Tejas Bell". We took them <br/>to the ranger this morning and showed the boxes to her before <br/>planting them. Looking at the stamp impression on the logbook, she <br/>asked, "How do you get this stamped on, with a potato?". Then I <br/>showed her the stamp and told her that
 we had just finished carving <br/>them and she was really impressed. I didn't tell her that two <br/>letterboxes had been in that park for over four years (they're both <br/>in fine shape, by the way). Actually, when we were looking for a <br/>place to hide LSQ's box, we found one of Atoy Adventurer's boxes <br/>(Pretty Kitty). She has four there, although we didn't realize it <br/>at the time since they're not listed on LbNA. The ranger gave me <br/>her card and asked if I would email her the website address whenever <br/>I posted the clues. This is a lovely little park, but has some good <br/>trails and a restored 1828 log house,as well as the Mission Tejas, <br/>and is also kept very clean.
