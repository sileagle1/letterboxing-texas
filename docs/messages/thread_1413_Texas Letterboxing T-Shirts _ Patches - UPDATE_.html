                    <div class="plaintext-content">Some of you received shirts/patches ages ago - you guys go ahead and delete<br>
this email!!!<br>
<br>
For the rest of you - I'm very tempted to just write a one-line<br>
all-encompassing excuse for the shirts & patches taking so long to<br>
send...something like "the dog ate my homework"! <br>
<br>
And actually one of the reasons is very close - Vandal, in a fit of temper<br>
when we left him home instead of taking him to San Francisco (he always<br>
assumes he is missing a letterboxing adventure)actually did chew up the<br>
exposed ends of all the extra-large Priority envelopes I'd purchased...which<br>
I didn't discover until today.<br>
<br>
BUT - that is just the latest in a long line of Murphy's Law reasons! The<br>
T-shirts are still giving me headaches - as I was sorting sizes I realized<br>
we were given wrong colors in wrong sizes. A couple of weeks later, we<br>
finally had correct assortment.  <br>
THEN I noticed that a few shirts had tiny holes - one had an undone seam.<br>
Each discovery has ended up in another phone call & a trip to Plano!<br>
One shirt was apparently a different dye lot - I noticed it ages ago, but<br>
forgot to follow up on it - the lovely recipients of that shirt have glossed<br>
over that as if it were a bonus!<br>
I have had two shirts on order for about 2 1/2 months - each time I call,<br>
"they are going to be here by the end of the week".<br>
<br>
I'll spare you guys the rest of the details - but admittedly part of the<br>
problem has been our recent trips, because I haven't stayed on top of the<br>
vendor each week.<br>
<br>
FRYES, JOY, BALFOURS, REBEL - I'm mailing yours out today and I apologize<br>
for the wait!<br>
<br>
GRAMMYPAT & SEMALEE - I'm still waiting on one shirt each for you- I spoke<br>
to the vendor again yesterday and was as forceful as I am capable of<br>
being;-) - we'll see if it works! (If you would like me to send you a<br>
partial order, please let me know)<br>
<br>
Needless to say, I can't recommend that we use this company again- I'm sorry<br>
because I like to give small businesses a chance, the owner is delightful,<br>
and the shirts are very comfy and reasonably-priced. But this is becoming<br>
waaaaay too time-consuming - I'd rather be boxing!<br>
<br>
Ruby Tuesday<br>
PS - The patches order from a totally different company was delivered in<br>
good condition and practically overnight (I think it was 2 days) <br>
