<div>BL, thanks for you kind words about Armadillo Girl!  I 
agree that the kids there were all super, but it seems in your list you forgot 
one...Lightning!  AG was very mad at me for not letting her try to carve 
when she saw that he had made his own stamp, but I told her that he had done it 
as part of a scout project.  Also, I don't know if all of you are aware of 
the "Lucy Lockett" nursery rhyme, but seeing as I listened to it over and over 
all the way back to Houston I would be happy to share the words if anyone is 
interested!  MO5</div></body></html>

<p><span>It’s so very interesting to see how
parents respond to the request of a first child as compared to the request of a
last child… SunSnake, age 11, is the youngest of my 3 girls.  When
she (then age 10) wanted to carve a stamp I showed her how to keep the blade
pointed away from her by moving the medium, not the blade and told her to have
at it.  I’m not even sure I stayed in the same room!  </span></p>
<p><span> </span></p>
<p><span>I agree, all of the kids were wonderful,
and I enjoyed getting to know them!</span></p>
