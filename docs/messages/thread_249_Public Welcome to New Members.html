least a few of whom came to us with an interest in letterboxing as a <br>
result of the Time magazine article!<br>
<br>
I would like to take a moment to publicly welcome those of you who <br>
are new to us and encourage you to jump in and to ask any questions <br>
you may have.  Please know that your questions will be handled by <br>
this group in a helpful, friendly manner - we live by the adage "No <br>
question is a dumb question!".  In fact, if anything, I think you'll <br>
be overwhelmed by the willingness to help that you will find in our <br>
group.  <br>
<br>
You are welcome to lurk if you prefer, but we'd love to read an intro <br>
from each of you before you settle in to lurkerdom!  Texas still has <br>
very few letterboxers and relatively few boxes, so we like to meet <br>
new boxers in our great state!<br>
<br>
As you begin boxing, don't be discouraged if there aren't many boxes <br>
in your area.  For one thing, we have several members who are <br>
committed to getting more boxes out there.  And for another, planting <br>
them can be as fun as finding them.  I am amazed at how many of our <br>
members have begun boxing since this list began in December and how <br>
many of them are actively committed to this pasttime and have already <br>
boosted their P (Placed) and F (Found) counts in that short time.  In <br>
short I'm saying don't despair because "Coming soon to a park near <br>
you...!"<br>
<br>
Welcome and have fun!<br>

yesterday (a co-worker brought it to work for me to<br>
read, as I have been raving about letterboxing for the<br>
past couple of months).<br>
<br>
I found my first boxes while on a trip to MA, but have<br>
been hunting boxes in the Houston area since I<br>
returned home. Through letterboxing, I have found gems<br>
in Houston that I would have had great difficulty<br>
discovering otherwise.<br>

So glad to have you!  <br>

I've found the same thing - I've discovered so much I<br>
wouldn't have seen or noticed through letterboxing!<br>
