<br/>
I would like to take a moment to publicly welcome those of you who <br/>
are new to us and encourage you to jump in and to ask any questions <br/>
you may have.  Please know that your questions will be handled by <br/>
this group in a helpful, friendly manner - we live by the adage "No <br/>
question is a dumb question!".  In fact, if anything, I think you'll <br/>
be overwhelmed by the willingness to help that you will find in our <br/>
group.  <br/>
<br/>
You are welcome to lurk if you prefer, but we'd love to read an intro <br/>
from each of you before you settle in to lurkerdom!  Texas still has <br/>
very few letterboxers and relatively few boxes, so we like to meet <br/>
new boxers in our great state!<br/>
<br/>
As you begin boxing, don't be discouraged if there aren't many boxes <br/>
in your area.  For one thing, we have several members who are <br/>
committed to getting more boxes out there.  And for another, planting <br/>
them can be as fun as finding them.  I am amazed at how many of our <br/>
members have begun boxing since this list began in December and how <br/>
many of them are actively committed to this pasttime and have already <br/>
boosted their P (Placed) and F (Found) counts in that short time.  In <br/>
short I'm saying don't despair because "Coming soon to a park near <br/>
you...!"<br/>
<br/>
Welcome and have fun!<br/>

yesterday (a co-worker brought it to work for me to<br/>
read, as I have been raving about letterboxing for the<br/>
past couple of months).<br/>
<br/>
I found my first boxes while on a trip to MA, but have<br/>
been hunting boxes in the Houston area since I<br/>
returned home. Through letterboxing, I have found gems<br/>
in Houston that I would have had great difficulty<br/>
discovering otherwise.<br/>

So glad to have you!  <br/>

I've found the same thing - I've discovered so much I<br/>
wouldn't have seen or noticed through letterboxing!<br/>
