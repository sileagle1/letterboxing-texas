                    <div class="plaintext-content">This last weekend I celebrated my anniversary by taking Mrs. Eagle to <br>
a B&B in Fredericksburg for a romantic get-away without kids.  We <br>
have been to this area many times and it is a great place to visit <br>
with many things to do, including shopping, hiking, eating & <br>
drinking, and thanks to all of you, letterboxing.  Since many boxes <br>
are placed in areas we both like to visit, especially the wine series <br>
by Baby Bear, I was able to please the LSS and letterbox!  In fact, <br>
at one point she commented that it was a great trip because we both <br>
got to do what we each liked at the same time.  For instance, when we <br>
went shopping in town, which I hate, I still had fun by going to a <br>
store that had over 100 free samples of food.  Then when we went to <br>
Wildseed Farms (a place like the Antique Rose Emporium only bigger), <br>
I sat outside and listened to a live band while she browsed.  Then at <br>
the wineries, we both tasted, then I found the box.  Even hiking at <br>
the parks worked for both of us since she could look for birds while <br>
I stamped into the boxes.  I highly recommend this area to everyone!<br>

<div><font face="Arial" size="2">Hey Silver Eagle,</font></div>
<div><font face="Arial" size="2">I agree that Fredericksburg is a great place to 
celebrate an anniversary.  We celebrated our 1st anniversary there and 
stayed in the Frederickburg's Bakery B&amp;B.  My DH's fave part was waking 
up at 4am and having the smell of fresh homemade bread baking in the 
ovens.  We just celebrated our 17th anniversary.  Now that I know 
there are boxes there, I'll have to go back.  I always like the restaurants 
there and finding some peaches to pick or buy in the summer.  Now I've got 
some other reasons to go back.</font></div>
