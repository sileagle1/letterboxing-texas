                    <div class="plaintext-content">There was some discussion recently about catpawz2004 Passport Series. Box #5 is in Florence. I adopted it a few years ago, and just went out today to check on it. It is alive and well. Clues were bad, though. When I updated  in '09 I didn't know my left from my right. But all good now, clues updated, and that historic box is still good. Enjoy!<br/>
