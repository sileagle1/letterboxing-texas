                    <div class="plaintext-content">I guess its time to introduce myself.  I join the Texas group over a <br>
month ago and have been reading your chats.  I must say, yall have <br>
kept me very entertained and occasionally I have learn more about <br>
letterboxing. You all seem like a great bunch of folks.<br>
<br>
Anyway, my name is Martha aka Tejas Angel.  Our family's trail name <br>
is the 4Anglers.  I have two children, girl 9 and a boy 6: and one <br>
heck of a husband.  I luckily have gotten to be a stay at mom for <br>
the last several years, but the end of that is nearing.  My family <br>
enjoys the outdoors mostly fishing and camping.(that's were the <br>
family trail name comes in, mostly saltwater)<br>
<br>
We have been Letterboxing since the beginning of April.  I found out <br>
about LB though a Girl Scout training and have been hooked ever <br>
since.  We are from Crosby, but spend a lot time in other parts of <br>
Texas. (mainly the coast and hill country)  We have found several <br>
Lbs and just started placing a few.  I really enjoy getting to go to <br>
other people's favorite places and learning a little history, while <br>
trying to find a LB.  Anyway, I am really enjoying letterboxing and <br>
see myself doing it for a long while. <br>
 <br>
So Howdy! - Tejas Angel <br>
