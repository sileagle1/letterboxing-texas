Anyway, my name is Martha aka Tejas Angel.  Our family's trail name <br/>
is the 4Anglers.  I have two children, girl 9 and a boy 6: and one <br/>
heck of a husband.  I luckily have gotten to be a stay at mom for <br/>
the last several years, but the end of that is nearing.  My family <br/>
enjoys the outdoors mostly fishing and camping.(that's were the <br/>
family trail name comes in, mostly saltwater)<br/>
<br/>
We have been Letterboxing since the beginning of April.  I found out <br/>
about LB though a Girl Scout training and have been hooked ever <br/>
since.  We are from Crosby, but spend a lot time in other parts of <br/>
Texas. (mainly the coast and hill country)  We have found several <br/>
Lbs and just started placing a few.  I really enjoy getting to go to <br/>
other people's favorite places and learning a little history, while <br/>
trying to find a LB.  Anyway, I am really enjoying letterboxing and <br/>
see myself doing it for a long while. <br/>
