<div><font size="2">I'm working on improving my technique also! I used to sit at my worktable and keep my carving material flat on my table while carving it. I used a magnifying glass which hung around my neck to see better. However, just recently I bought a table mounted lighted magnifying glass, and I've found that if I stand up and hold the carving material in one hand while carving it with the other (under the magnifying glass), I have a lot more control and can do a lot better job on the details. Strange how little things can make a difference, but that seems to work for me. (Recognizing that I still have a lot of room for improvement!)</font></div>
