town, 'bout that shack outside La Grange - you know what I'm talkin' 
about.<br/>Just let me know if you wanna go, to that home out on the 
range.<br/>They gotta lotta nice girls. ...<br/>Well, I hear it's fine if you got 
the time, and the ten to get yourself in.<br/>And I hear it's tight most ev'ry 
night, but now I might be mistaken.</i><br/><i>Have 
mercy."</i></p></div>
<div>If you can guess who's hit song this is then you 
have a clue as to who the newest passenger is!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Directions: La 
Grange is west of Houston and can be reached by travelling I-10 to the La Grange 
exit, Hwy 77 and turning north. <br/><br/>Once in La Grange you will want to get 
on Business 71 aka Travis street. You will take this through downtown, passing 
the courthouse (on the corner of Main and Travis). Just past Main, but before 
the bridge you will see Boss' House of Steaks on the right and River Park Car 
Wash on the left. Also on the Left there is a sign for river access. Take the 
road towards the river. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Park in the 
parking lot (do not go down towards the boat ramp).  Go away from the river 
to the cement support beam for the bridge.  Facing the beam look to your 
left and you will see a row of wooden posts.  Follow the posts counting 19 
posts.  Now continue around to the left and count 11 more.  You should 
be in fromt of a large tree with vines wrapped around it.  Box is wedge up 
in the hole in the base of the tree.  It is wedged up and to the 
left.</div>

<div>Good 
luck!!</div>
