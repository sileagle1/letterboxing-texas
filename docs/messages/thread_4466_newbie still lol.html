Where are you located and all that fun stuff... <br/>I started with an art sketchbook and a black ink pad at first but quickly realized I like to color in the images with Marvey markers. I keep my clues in a three ring binder too! Once in a while I will stamp the clue page with the image just to get excess ink off the stamp before I pack it back into its box, and this helps when Dreamwalker forgets to bring his logbook along and he wants the image but isn't going to go back for the box alone. lol ;) <br/>~Dawns Glory~<br/>Manor, TX<br/><div><br/></div><div><br/><div><hr size="1"/><b><span>From:</span></b> Kim &lt;kimamayfield@gmail.com&gt;<br/><b><span>To:</span></b> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com<br/><b><span>Sent:</span></b> Mon, March 29, 2010 4:17:52 PM<br/><b><span>Subject:</span></b> [letterboxingtexas] newbie still lol<br/><br/>

                    <html><body><p>Kim,<br/><br/>Keep it simple. Go with what you have as far as logook, stamp, ink. The finding is the fun. The rest of this stuff is moofah and you can change, update, modify as you go. You aren't stuck with what you started with. In fact, you will probably never have the "perfect" setup - you'll always look for the perfect logbook, work on carving a better stamp, finding the best carving tool, want a little different color ink, better markers, ideal carving material... That's another part of the fun of it, but until you actually get out and go hunting, you won't know what you like and dislike. <br/>
<br/>It's really easy to get bogged down in the details, but the big thing is - go and seek - and HAVE FUN! Worry about all that other stuff later...<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Mon, Mar 29, 2010 at 8:47 PM, Kim <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:kimamayfield@gmail.com">kimamayfield@gmail.com</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/>
