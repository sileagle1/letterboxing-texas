I had nine boxes on my list, from Ingram to Hamilton.  My mate and I agreed that I could find one box for every horseshoe he bought.  (He's a strong-man, and they bend horseshoes for fun.)  He bought eight.  I had nine on the list.  <br/>

I was stamping in the second box on my list, in Ingram, while DH was reading the information sign.

I did find a few including some of the ones that you found. I agree I think its him too (Hamilton). For any of you that don't know what we are talking about, you need to take a trip to Hamilton and find out. But that was actually a fun trip but I would have loved to have done more boxes. Some men just don't have patience!!!!!<br/>

I loved reading about your letterboxing adventures, frustration and all.  I often get impatient (my normal operating mode: impatient) and just skim or skip these kinds of reports altogether, but you hooked me first with the story about the deer and the cottontail and then intrigued me further with the oblique references to those boxes along your Fredericksburg trail.  I'm just wondering how those little wild animals can relate to a black widow, but maybe you have superpowers or something, who knows!  Anyway, I'm very impressed -- thanks for the interesting stories!<br/>

<div>Thanks, Viewfinder.  I don't usually share 
letterboxing stories, but these were just so bizarre, I couldn't help 
myself.  To steal a phrase from my son, nature has been "all up in my 
face."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I realized that the photo link of the 
gregarious deer was a duplicate, so here's the close-up.  Not shy at 
all!</div>
