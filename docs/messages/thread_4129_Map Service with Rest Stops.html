<br/>Yeah, that's where I found them one fast.  And that IS a very nice website - I managed to google it, click it, and get them what they needed within about 30 seconds, which if you ask me, that's a pretty good website if you can navigate it that fast without ever having visited it before.
<br/>
<br/>But what I was wondering is - is there a map website that has little portapotties or something to indicate rest areas along the route?  I've looked at Yahoo Maps and Mapquest and haven't spotted any, but wouldn't that be a nice feature?  For one thing, they'll be out of Texas eventually, so that site won't do 'em any good!
<br/>
<br/>It just occurred to me, Janet, that they should be calling YOU instead of me!  You're sitting there at the ready - like the New York Public Library help desk.  What if I have to be working or something when they need something???  I've always thought that would be a cool job - dispensing information.  Not like - "Information Pleeuz" information, but "What kind of dog has been known to be born with two heads?" sorts of information...</p></body></html>

I'll want to stop on the way for a coke, then probably about 30 minutes later for a rest area. If there are any letterboxes along the way... that's good too. Oh, and please let me know if there are any of those fun little roadside shopping adventures (handmade birdhouses, homemade jams, folk art, etc); since my LSS won't be with me I can definitely do that too. Also, I'm in search of the best slice of pie in Texas - if you have any recommendations..... I need to be back in Frisco by 5:30 for my grandson's T-Ball game. (I may not have time to stay at the reunion for more than 20 minutes, but that's okay too.) Seriously, good to hear your crazy sense of humor is at work. Make it your mission to drive the nurses insane.<br/>

You're going to have to stop in Ft Worth and go to the Swiss Bakery, 3936 W Vickery Blvd, off Montgomery street. If you decide to eat breakfast, their omelettes are good. They have awesome chocolate pie and other sweets. You can grab a sweet for the morning and save a slice of pie for the afternoon.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Continue on 30 towards Decatur. I'm still researching which boxes you have found. There are actually some boxes you have yet to find that way. So, I've still got to get you a coke, toilet and boxes.
