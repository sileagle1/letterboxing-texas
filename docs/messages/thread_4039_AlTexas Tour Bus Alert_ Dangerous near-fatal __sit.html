 suddenly veered off the path to the left toward a small cluster of cedar trees, with a small oak right in front of the center cedar tree.<span> </span>Amazingly, that bus veered around the little oak and came to rest just beneath the center cedar, with small rocks, bark and leaves flying up and then settling back down to cover it.<span> </span>Seeing that the noisy passengers all appeared to be OK (probably because they are all packed in there so tightly and, we suspect, some of them might possibly be engaging in unprescribed medications as well), PuddleSplasher and I quickly turned around and headed back to the car to make our escape, glad to be free of that out-of-control group  but not before PuddleSplasher managed to slip a little Bonus Box under the bus to reward not only the bus finder, but also an other<span> </span>finders who get there a little too late and miss the bus.<span> </span>(Please do NOT take the Bonus Box if you are the finder of the bus; it will be posted as a permanent letterbox by PuddleSplasher).<span> </span></font></font></span></div>
<div><span lang="EN" style="color: black;"><font face="Calibri" size="3">Warning:<span> </span>Use caution in approaching this site 
 we think some of those passengers are armed and dangerous, not to mention the heavy purple haze of sweet-smelling smoke mingled with the pungent scent of a bear and far too many passengers above the bus capacity all crammed together for far too long without showers!<span> </span>-- Best wishes, Viewfinder</font></span></div>
