                    <html><body><p>I had a very stressful day at work and was looking at<br/>a stressful evening too.  I've got less than two weeks<br/>until a district campout for 300 folks - give or take<br/>100 - I am organizing goes off, and I feel like I am
<br/>about a month behind getting it together.  By the end<br/>of the work day, I had a major headache and could only<br/>look forward to going home to work on the campout. <br/>About 3 p.m. I emailed my husband and suggested we leave
<br/>directly from work and head to Fairchild State Forest<br/>and Rusk for the evening.  I guess he was a little<br/>stressed too because he jumped on that idea and had<br/>everything packed and ready to go, right down to<br/>
clothes for me to change in to, when I got off work.<br/><br/>We headed on to Fairchild and first off we found Lucy<br/>Locket's new box there in the forest.  Cool stamp! <br/>Besides Blue Butterfly (who I think was actually with
<br/>Lucy Locket when she planted the box), we were the<br/>FF's on this one!  We went on down the trail and<br/>checked on my Red-Cockaded Woodpecker and it was safe<br/>and sound and tucked nicely away in its hiding place.<br/>
<br/>We drove on into Rusk and took a walk to find Baby<br/>Bear's Lion King box - we still have several boxes<br/>from the gathering we haven't found!  Lion King had<br/>lots of stamps and was hidden pretty well - some trail
<br/>to get there!  <br/><br/>We were tentatively planning on getting the other<br/>boxes there in Rusk State Park that we haven't yet<br/>gotten, but our stomachs got the best of us and we<br/>headed back to Maydelle to Big Bertha's for a burger. 
<br/>She makes good burgers too!  By then it was getting a<br/>little dark, so we took the back roads home and just<br/>got in.  What a difference a couple of hours on the<br/>trail makes - I'm ready to settle in and work on my
<br/>campout now and the rude customer I had to spend most<br/>of the day dealing with is a vague memory.  Headache<br/>is mostly gone too!<br/><br/>I do have to say - I think poison ivy must thrive on<br/>drought.  It looks as if it is going to be worse than
<br/>usual this year.  I've had a case of it for 10 days<br/>now, and after today's outing, I don't see being rid<br/>of it for a week or two still.  It was pretty much<br/>unavoidable!  When SJZ lived at home, I kept the pre-
<br/>and post-exposure treatments on hand, but I let her<br/>take it all with her since she has the worst allergy<br/>of any of us to PI.  Guess I'm going to have to<br/>re-invest in it now!<br/><br/>Thanks to Baby Bear and to Lucy Locket for the great
<br/>boxes today.  We're planning on hitting the trails<br/>again pretty soon to find the other Rusk boxes, and I<br/>have a longer trip planned for the last week of the<br/>month - after my campout is a done deal!<br/>-- <br/>

<div>Oh Lucy, the thought of ya'll sitting there at Big Bertha's makes me so happy! Hope you don't mind that I imposed myself in my mental picture along with you!</div>
<div>I too am suffering from a horrible case poison ivy. Unfortunately, that's part is not my imagination! It seems like every outing recently I get exposed and it gets worse. My legs look like they've been dipped in scalding water! With this perfect letterboxing weather, it's going to take a lot to keep me from romping in the woods though.</div>

<div>Yikes to all of the Poison Ivy out there!  I have seen lots of it on 
the running trails, too.  Not good!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>One way to box without fear of poison ivy is to do so in another 
state!  M-Dot and I were in Tempe, Arizona this past weekend for the 
Ironman Arizona.  M-Dot was a participant and did an awesome job at his 
second Ironman competition! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>While there, I actually planted a box along Tempe Town Lake which was the 
running trail for the Ironman.  It is called Ironman Arizona ( I 
know...real original!)  Anyway, we were able to box some in the area and 
found seven letterboxes:  Papago Park Box #1 and Box #2,  Sun Devil 
Letterbox #1, Sun Devil Letterbox #2, ASU Memories #2 ( #1 was on top of a 
mountain near radio towers but the whole area around the trails were under some 
serious construction and we weren't able to get up the mountain), ASU Memories 
#3-4 were missing.  In Scottsdale, we found Happy Gecko at a really cute 
park with metal desert statues and then found On the Pond at another park in 
Scottsdale.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Back to the poison ivy- we didn't see ANY in Arizona!  :)  Maybe 
we could all take a road trip and letterbox in a PI free area.  Of course 
there are snakes and cactus and scorpions etc...</div>

<div>I don't think I'll ever be able to go back to Big Bertha's without thinking about what a great time we all had there the night before the gathering, so your virtual presence would have been more than welcome at our table last night!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>It's funny how memories are associated with places, isn't it?  Lightning and I have a particular cafe we stop at on our way home from a weekend at scout camp and we wouldn't dream of not stopping there.  Big Bertha's is now a letterboxing joint to us....

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I'm glad you enjoyed the "CAMP OUT" box while you are working on <br>
your actual camp out!  <br>
<br>
Blue Butterfly and I were together on our outing last Saturday when <br>
we checked in with the woodpecker.  However, we split up while I hid <br>
my box, then BB followed my clues to the Camp Out LB.  We enjoy <br>
doing this...especially when we both hide a box at the same time.  <br>
The first time BB saw the stamp/box/location was when she found the <br>
box herself and stamped in.  <br>
<br>
We're going to have to go back out there soon so we can stamp into <br>
the Loblolly Pine box.  <br>
<br>
We also went to Rusk SP the same day to clean up over there from <br>
boxes we missed at gathering time.  Unfortunately, we'd forgotten to <br>
print out the clues to the GENERAL SHERMAN box.  Luckily, we'd read <br>
the clue over and over again previously and just happened to <br>
remember where the box was hidden.  We found the general tucked away <br>
in his hiding place with very little trouble.  <br>
<br>
Hoping to do some boxing on this three day weekend! <br>
