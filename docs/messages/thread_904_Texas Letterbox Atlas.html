                    <div class="plaintext-content">I mentioned in a post last night that one resource we<br>
in Texas have is the Texas Letterbox Atlas, a<br>
volunteer project maintained by Jeff of Birds of a<br>
Feather.<br>
<br>
I realized there hasn't been much discussion of this<br>
really cool site in quite some time, so possibly our<br>
newer members aren't aware of it.<br>
<br>
First of all, here's the link:<br>
<br>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi?<br>
<br>
Spend a little time navigating it and getting to know<br>
how it operates - occasionally it is a little slow so<br>
patience is in order, but this morning it was clicking<br>
right along and www.letterboxing.org was dragging<br>
horribly.  Even on slow days, it is well worth the<br>
wait because you are very quickly able to see what<br>
types, how many, and which boxes are in an area.  You<br>
can also recenter and zoom, so you can easily move<br>
around an area to see what boxes you can go for.  <br>
<br>
You say "You mean I have to send my clues to yet<br>
ANOTHER site now?"  NO!  The TLA site isn't intended<br>
to be a logging site, or to store clues, it is<br>
strictly an interactive letterboxing map.  It's great<br>
for people (like me) who don't easily take different<br>
boxes and relate their proximity to each other.  It's<br>
definitely different from either AtlasQuest or LBNA,<br>
which overlap quite a lot in function.  Instead, TLA<br>
is a complement to either of those sites.<br>
<br>
It looks like most placers have given permission to<br>
post their boxes since the LBNA site has 637 boxes<br>
listed in the state and TLA has 573.  Jeff doesn't<br>
list boxes if he doesn't have permission by the<br>
placer, but he stays on top of it pretty closely if<br>
you've given him permission.  I know, though, that<br>
Birds of a Feather is a really busy family, so if, by<br>
chance, your boxes don't get listed as quickly as you<br>
would hope, cut him a little slack because he's<br>
probably tending to one of the many irons he has in<br>
the fire.<br>
<br>
You can add your own boxes by using the "add a new<br>
feature" found at the bottom of a map page, so you can<br>
add your own boxes.  I did this quite awhile back, and<br>
it seems like I was able to enter everything about it<br>
and it went into a queue for Jeff to post.  <br>
<br>
So anyway, I just wanted to throw out a little<br>
something for you new folks to chew on and try out!<br>
