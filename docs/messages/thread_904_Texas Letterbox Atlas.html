in Texas have is the Texas Letterbox Atlas, a<br/>
volunteer project maintained by Jeff of Birds of a<br/>
Feather.<br/>
<br/>
I realized there hasn't been much discussion of this<br/>
really cool site in quite some time, so possibly our<br/>
newer members aren't aware of it.<br/>
<br/>
First of all, here's the link:<br/>
<br/>
http://birdsofafeather.netfirms.com/cgi-bin/lbatlas.cgi?<br/>
<br/>
Spend a little time navigating it and getting to know<br/>
how it operates - occasionally it is a little slow so<br/>
patience is in order, but this morning it was clicking<br/>
right along and www.letterboxing.org was dragging<br/>
horribly.  Even on slow days, it is well worth the<br/>
wait because you are very quickly able to see what<br/>
types, how many, and which boxes are in an area.  You<br/>
can also recenter and zoom, so you can easily move<br/>
around an area to see what boxes you can go for.  <br/>
<br/>
You say "You mean I have to send my clues to yet<br/>
ANOTHER site now?"  NO!  The TLA site isn't intended<br/>
to be a logging site, or to store clues, it is<br/>
strictly an interactive letterboxing map.  It's great<br/>
for people (like me) who don't easily take different<br/>
boxes and relate their proximity to each other.  It's<br/>
definitely different from either AtlasQuest or LBNA,<br/>
which overlap quite a lot in function.  Instead, TLA<br/>
is a complement to either of those sites.<br/>
<br/>
It looks like most placers have given permission to<br/>
post their boxes since the LBNA site has 637 boxes<br/>
listed in the state and TLA has 573.  Jeff doesn't<br/>
list boxes if he doesn't have permission by the<br/>
placer, but he stays on top of it pretty closely if<br/>
you've given him permission.  I know, though, that<br/>
Birds of a Feather is a really busy family, so if, by<br/>
chance, your boxes don't get listed as quickly as you<br/>
would hope, cut him a little slack because he's<br/>
probably tending to one of the many irons he has in<br/>
the fire.<br/>
<br/>
You can add your own boxes by using the "add a new<br/>
feature" found at the bottom of a map page, so you can<br/>
add your own boxes.  I did this quite awhile back, and<br/>
it seems like I was able to enter everything about it<br/>
and it went into a queue for Jeff to post.  <br/>
<br/>
So anyway, I just wanted to throw out a little<br/>
something for you new folks to chew on and try out!<br/>

<div>Thanks for the info. I guess I am going to go
