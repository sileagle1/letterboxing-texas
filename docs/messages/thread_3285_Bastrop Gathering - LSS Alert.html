                    <html><body><div>My LSS, Fearless Fox, is usually pretty blase` about gatherings.  He ditches them if he possibly can.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Last night I was putting together my gathering notebook and was going over the park maps.  They caught his eye and he suddenly realized - there is a long hiking trail at Bastrop State Park.  He is now fully on-board and has started planning his (and Lightning's) hike.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now I am not guaranteeing that something won't come along that catches his eye and causes him to bale out, but this hike sure has his interest.  If anyone else would like to join him on a six mile (maybe 8) hike, he would be glad to have company.  The tentative plan is that he will hike it Saturday morning to return by noon or very early afternoon (he hikes roughly 3 miles an hour and there are some extra trails that he might decide to throw in if it's up to him).  While I would imagine that mostly LSS's would be interested in missing the early part of the gathering, possibly boxers would too, since I'm fairly sure there are boxes along the trail as well (Lost Pines Hiking Trail).  He would probably be willing to stop for boxes, although his own primary purpose would be hiking.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, if anyone is interested themselves, or perhaps a member of their contingency is interested, let me know and I'll put him together with y'all to coordinate it.  </div>
