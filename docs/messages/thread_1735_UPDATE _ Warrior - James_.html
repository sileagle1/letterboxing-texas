Howdy Y-all.<br>
<br>
	This will be just a quick update.  We are still doing well out her<br>
in El Paso.  Wish we could join you-all, but we have been on the road a lot<br>
these last months to dog shows and to welcome James home from Iraq.  I am<br>
working 10 to 12 hour days, and I needed a 3 hour nap today just to keep<br>
going.  We have a ham-radio related picnic/camping outing in Abilene in May,<br>
so it isn't like we don't have stuff going on.<br>
<br>
	The real news is that James (still in Ft. Carson/Colorado Springs)<br>
is really taking to Letterboxing.  He is making the most of the months he<br>
has left in Colorado.  But he is already looking forward to coming to Ft.<br>
Hood/Killeen Texas.  And he will be Letterboxing down there too.<br>
<br>
	What does this mean?  Well, it is likely that many of you will meet<br>
him.  And it is also likely that next year we ALL will make the gathering.<br>
Wish we could do it this year.<br>
<br>
	Last - just wanted to wish you-all a VERY GOOD TIME at the up-coming<br>
event.  Hope everything goes off without a hitch, and everyone has a really<br>
fantastic time.  I am sure I will hear of it here on the list, and regret<br>
all the more not being there.<br>
<br>
GOOD LUCK - HAVE FUN!<br>
<br>
Oh - Mr Silver Eagle Sir, looks like my son and I will do the peak together<br>
in the next few weeks - will keep you posted.  Haven't forgotten about Hueco<br>
Tanks either, still working that.<br>

Hood area.  And speaking of boxes to find, don't forget<br>
to look for my Buffalo Gap Microbox while in Abilene.<br>
Hope you are successful hiking the peak and with Hueco<br>
Tanks boxes.  We will be thinking of you at the Event<br>
and look forward to seeing you and James at next year's.<br>
