Actually got a letterbox in Las Cruces this weekend as well as a geocache hybrid. Today I got a neat book called It's a Treasure Hunt...explains geocaching and letterboxing....figure it will help when I meet new cachers that are interested in LBing...this fall there will be an event in Las Cruces that is all letterbox hybrids....and wouldn't you know our car run is that same Saturday?  Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaa.<br>
