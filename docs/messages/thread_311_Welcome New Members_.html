our group in the last few weeks.  It would be great to<br/>
hear from each of you as to what part of Texas you reside<br/>
in and how you learned of letterboxing.  I would also<br/>
like to hear how you found out about this Talklist.  I<br/>
include a link to this Talklist on my email responses to<br/>
letterboxers that email me, but I never know if that works<br/>
or not.  It would be great if all Texas Letterboxers were<br/>
in this group so nobody would be left out of things going<br/>
on in Texas Letterboxing.  Speaking of things going on, be <br/>
sure to look at past messages about the Texas Event and <br/>
ordering Texas Letterboxing T-Shirts.<br/>
