<div> </div>
<div>Down thru San Jacinto County, down around Polk and but slowed down due to a heavy rainfall in Angelina County.  As the bus pulled into Nacogdoches County, the sun was going down.  Time to park for the night.  The group decided to try an 'EXPERIMENTAL' campsite.  They did pick up another passenger hanging out at the entrance.  He and Davy had lots of history to talk about.

<div>Park.  Go down the trails to the right.    Past trail maker L.  Past the Mockernut Hickory on the left.    On past the bench, bridge and the Fire sign on the left.  The bus past a Black Cherry tree on the left and went to a great overnight stop 12 steps past there.  It is parked behiind the tree on the right that has a fallen tree behind it.  Covered with sticks, branches and the likes.   Just don't pass the Sam or the Cave by the Bear.  That is way too far.
