<br>
<br>
Can't believe it's almost time for us to fly out to Texas, and we're <br>
hardly prepared at all!  Got totally burned out on letterboxing <br>
after the Cape Cod gathering (Wanda pushed herself too hard to reach <br>
F12,000), so now we're just planning a couple of days hiking and <br>
camping in the piney woods of Texas before the Great Book Gathering <br>
in Tomball, then some boxing in Memorial Park, and perhaps whatever <br>
else you folks out there might recommend.  Looking forward to seeing <br>
you all.  We'll be wearing our honorary "Texas togs" (courtesy of <br>
BoxDN and Celtic Lions) from our last visit to Texas, and we'll be <br>
bringing along our "doggie" from "Monster Mash Days" in memory of <br>
Sherlock Holmes, if anyone cares to make that literary reference to <br>
us in order to see him and give him a pat (just watch your fingers)!<br>
<br>
Looks like there's some great fun brewing out there in Texas, so see <br>
you all soon,<br>
<br>
Wanda and Pete<br>
Charlestown, RI<br>
