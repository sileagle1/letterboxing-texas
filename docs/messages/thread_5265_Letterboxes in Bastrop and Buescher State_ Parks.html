<div>I contacted Robert, who promptly sent me this nice,
                  supportive letter, including an attached Permit
                  Request.  I filled it out and scanned it three times,
                  changing the name of the box for each box/series that
                  I have in Bastrop and Buescher State Parks.  I crossed
                  out the word geocache and replaced  it with
                  letterbox.  I sent each request along with the
                  corresponding directions.    I have a feeling they
                  will want to pull my “Pining for the Lost Pines”
                  letterbox because they may consider its location to be
                  a sensitive area.  </div>

<div>I’ll let you know what happens.  By the way, in
                  sending this information to Robert, I may be
                  compromising any of your boxes that you may have
                  planted in these parks.  If that happens, I am truly
                  sorry.</div>

       Thanks for letting us know of your dealings with Robert and the
    State Park system. I have both geocaches and letterboxes placed in
    various Texas state parks. I have gotten my geocaches permitted
    because the state park system seems to have "discovered" and, for
    the most part, embraced geocaching a couple years ago now. <br/>
<br/>
       Well, it seems that they have now "discovered" letterboxing as
    well and so far it seems they are treating us as just an extension
    of geocaching.  I think it is time for me to come out of the closet
    and get my state park letterboxes permitted. Perhaps if a few of us
    were to voluntarily get our letterboxes permitted it will bolster
    the current good feelings the park system seems to have for 'caching
    and 'boxing.<br/>
