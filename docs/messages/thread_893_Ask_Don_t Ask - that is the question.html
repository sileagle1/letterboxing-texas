                    <div class="plaintext-content">This is all based on my understanding - you'll<br>
probably get a wide range of responses to your<br>
question...<br>
<br>
National Parks state that they are off limits to<br>
letterboxes and geocaches, but if you have also been<br>
reading the big list, you know that Choi received<br>
permission to place a box in a National Park last<br>
week.  That's no small feat!  National Parks, then,<br>
are an "always ask" place, and go in with a rational<br>
explanation of letterboxing and your specific<br>
response.  and why you want to plant on their park, do<br>
a little research, and hope for the best.  There ARE<br>
clandestine boxes in National Parks, but there are<br>
also lots of them that get confiscated.  If the Park<br>
finds them and confiscates, it's my understanding they<br>
aren't very kind about it.<br>
<br>
National Forests, on the other hand, are more<br>
amenable, although I noticed someone recently<br>
mentioned that they tend to frown on LB'ing too.  I<br>
think that's probably more a regional thing.  I<br>
wouldn't ask in a National Forest in Texas, I would<br>
just plant.<br>
<br>
State Parks in Texas are very friendly to letterboxes<br>
and I wouldn't worry about asking permission in them. <br>
Local parks - same.  <br>
<br>
I've never heard anything about State Forests, but I<br>
would imagine they would follow along with National<br>
Forests.  I've got a state forest adjacent to my town,<br>
so maybe I'll try it out here soon.<br>
<br>
Cemeteries are a judgment call.  Some folks feel<br>
strongly that boxes shouldn't be placed in cemeteries<br>
at all.  Others feel that if the box pays proper<br>
reverance to the site and isn't invasive of the burial<br>
area, it's okay.  Personally, I think it's okay to<br>
place certain boxes in certain cemeteries, but I<br>
wouldn't just go plop a cute little teddy bear box in<br>
a cemetery because that's the one I had on me when I<br>
got the urge to plant one - it would be specifically<br>
carved for the location and the site thoughtfully<br>
selected.  As far as asking, that would be a judgment<br>
call also.<br>
<br>
Private property is an "always ask" thing.  <br>
<br>
And I think you've been reading the thread about zoos<br>
- the reason it's a good idea to ask in zoos is<br>
because many zoos are operated by private foundations,<br>
hence private property.  Even still, zoos (regardless<br>
of who owns them) are usually kept pretty clean, so a<br>
letterbox placed in any zoo would be at high risk of<br>
discovery, so if you ask and have permission, staff at<br>
the zoo knows it's there and is more likely to return<br>
it to its hiding spot instead of throwing it away or,<br>
heaven forbid, make a federal issue out of it.  <br>
<br>
That list should cover the basics, and as I said,<br>
let's see what everyone else can add to it!<br>

<br>
Exactly.  Our zoo is privately owned and the grounds are very well <br>
maintained.  It's also pretty small so the employees are more likely <br>
to spot one of us snooping around.  It's just better to get them on <br>
board.  If they say no, I'm still going to hide one, but not on zoo <br>
property.  <br>
<br>
Celtic Lions- I recently got permission from our library to hide a <br>
box.  They didn't want it inside, but they gave me the okay to place <br>
it outside, which I would have done anyway if they had said no. To <br>
help convince them, I donated a new copy of the Letterboxing <br>
Companion. Maybe that would help sweeten the deal with your <br>
librarians.<br>
