<div> </div>
<div>What's up? I have some huge news. Are you ready for this? I carved a new stamp. Well actually, two stamps. Can you believe it? The first new stamp is for my first LTC. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I know, I wasn't going to get into them. But, then, someone started a ring about premium hats. And, I couldn't resist. It was stressful at first, but with some encouragement from Batty Girl and KMBaker, I did it. And, it wasn't so bad. Now I'm signed up for 3 or 4. And I signed up for another postal. Yikes!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>While doing the Premium hat ring, I was looking for my sig stamp and couldn't find it. The last place I remember seeing it was McAllister Park in San Antonio. So, I figured I left it with Peanuts and Lone Star Beer. What's peanuts and beer without some flowers, right?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Well, I carved a new sig stamp. I asked Cassie to pull it out of my bag to show Carrie, my middle daughter. I was proud of it. It's a good carve (for me). Well, what does Cassie pull out? My sig stamp. I swear, I looked for that thing 3 times. Gary, my LSS even looked for it. I think the fairies had it. They were having a party with my flowers. Sneaky little things.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So, I've decided to go out on a limb and make it my PT. How's that. Is that getting into the game, or what? I'm going to debut it at the luncheon event in Grapevine. I can't wait.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now, I just have to find a spot to plant a 'real' box. It's so hard to find a spot in the DFW area. I need to get out and explore, but when I do that, I'm usually looking for a box that's already there, lol.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Hope y'all are having a great week. Mine's about over and I am ready for the weekend. Woohoo, bring it on!</div>
