The correct way to leave the top of a mountain is indeed to go down, but which way down?  Normally the way you came up so you end up at your car, not miles away on the other side of the mountain.  However it is not as easy as it sounds.  Mt. Elbert (where this box is hidden), like many of the 14ers in Colorado, has several trails to choose from for ascent and at the top where they converge it can be confusing to pick the right one to go down.  Add the fact that the day I went it was foggy and I couldn't see more than 10 feet in front of me and maybe you will cut me some slack.  Also, since the top is so steep, all trails look the same due to switchbacks and no trees.  I ended up hiking about 2 miles down before I "felt" something was wrong and verified with hikers coming up that I was on the wrong trail.  That meant I had to hike back up the 2 miles to summit again, then hike down the correct trail, all without getting the awesome view that is usually the reward for such an endeavor.<br>
<br>
Now as for the poor directions to the box, all I can say is that the summit is nothing but rocks, so it is hard to identify which rock the box is under.  Also it was very cold, wet and windy that day so I did not spend much time placing it.  So, if you decide to climb the highest point in Colorado, do it for the experience, not just to find this box, so you won't be disappointed.  Also, be sure to look behind you every once in a while while going up so you will recognize the correct trail when it is time to go down.  Good luck!<br>
