</p><div>You know, after I wrote it, I thought the same thing. But, once you send the message there is no way to retrack it. That is one feature of AQ that I adore. I hope everyone else reads the posts in order too. Then, if anyone just searches for TTB, they will still be able to find it.

<div>Oh, my, I don't think I would have done that. The fun for me (and <br/>obviously for you) was reading about this disaster at the park, then <br/>realizing about halfway through that this was the TEXAS TOUR BUS! <br/>I'm glad I didn't know what it was about before reading it.

<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; OMG, that is hilarious, I was sitting here reading this <br/>thinking, "Gosh, I hope no one got hurt. It took me a few lines to <br/>realize what was going on. Clever, clever! <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I hope you don't mind, I changed the subject line in my post. I 
<br/>think one of the things about the TTB is to put that in the subject <br/>so that people could search for it and find all the posts regarding <br/>it. Also, they can see it's out and about and go rushing for it.<br/>&gt; 
<br/>&gt; I bet I know who's going to go searching. It'll be interesting <br/>to see if I'm right.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Janet, Blooming Flowers<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; queenbeelovedx3 &lt;queenbeelovedx3@...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; I just dodged a crazy bus at South Lakes Park in Denton!
