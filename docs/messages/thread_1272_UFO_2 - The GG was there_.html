After some real thinking about this mystery location, PuddleSplasher <br/>
and I drove straight to THE PLACE and followed those clues to THE SPOT<br/>
and bam! Found it cool as anything!  Excited that we might be FF, I <br/>
jumped back into the Jeep and opened the box and the log and -- <br/>
Grizzled Gryphon had signed in first!  And he left this note:  Takes a<br/>
UFO to Find a UFO.  We burst into laughter - better even than BEING FF <br/>
this time!  Thanks Ruby Tuesday and Celtic Lions for another great LB <br/>
mystery - OK, we're ready for the nextone! -- Viewfinder and <br/>
