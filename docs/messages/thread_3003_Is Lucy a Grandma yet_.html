<div>LOL!!! Being a grandmother has its similarities! I just kept my ten month old granddaughter for four days and nights last week. After she left, I turned to my husband and asked, "how am I supposed to sleep now without a baby monitor by the bed?" Befuddled, he answered, "we won't be hearing baby sounds all night long, what the problem?" I told him "It's NOT hearing the baby sounds all night long that will keep me awake." I'm not sure he gets it.</div>

little Jonah. Baby's are so much fun and I know you will be the <br/>
perfect Grandma. Hope you can take him boxing soon. Loved to meet you <br/>
all on the trails. Maybe we can plan a mini meet to meet Jonah, the <br/>
new letterboxer. Lois--- In letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com, janet <br/>

morning after arriving back home about 1 a.m. this morning!<br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   Jonah (how easy is THAT to make a sig stamp???) was born Friday <br/>
evening at 7:50.  He was 8 lb 8 oz, and 20" long.  Lots of dark <br/>
hair.  He seems to be very serene, which is not surprising given that <br/>
both his mama and his daddy are very laid back.  <br/>
&gt;    <br/>
&gt;   The family went home from the hospital yesterday about Noon.  <br/>
Fearless Fox and I , along with Uncle Lightning, spent much of the <br/>
weekend cleaning and washing clothes and making food so they could <br/>
enjoy their first days at home without worrying about home drudgery.  <br/>
In the midst of all that, we spent lots of time at the hospital <br/>
holding Baby Jonah.  Lightning I think was the proudest of us all! <br/>
