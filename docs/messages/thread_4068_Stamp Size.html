                    <div class="plaintext-content">Can you carve an image on that brayer?  That might be an idea.  I guess you're talking about those stamps that are carved with a negative image, leaving a large area uncarved?  I have at times used a marker and just put enough ink around the carved image to get an impression and then put pressure only on that area.  Sometimes it works.  I try to use only as much carving material as I need for my image, no matter what its size.  That way, I can get more stamps out of a block of material.  Sometimes I'll even use my irregular-shaped scraps for a stamp if I can make the image fit, then cut away the rest. You could always carry an xacto knife and ....  just kidding!  <br/>

<div>Duh... there you go! Why didn't you point out the obvious to me a long time ago, Boots? I'll do that from now on. (See, that's why I'm in your fan club, but don't mention fan club to the inspector or he'll go off on us!) I usually do the same thing you suggested about using an x-acto (yes, only on my OWN stamps), to cut off the extra before mounting it. Good stamping material is too hard to come by to waste it, isn't it? I've also cut away areas that didn't turn out like I had envisioned them. Of course if I did that too much, my stamps would end up the size of a dime.</div>

<div>Dear Inspector Bacon,</div>
<div>If you're the bright bulb I think you might be, I'm sure you've already discovered that I am actually not even a member of any of the fan clubs I've claimed. That fact, unfortunately, is NOT my fault. My application for membership was rejected for various reasons from each club. How, dare I ask, can I not even be accepted for membership in a fan club for a <em>CLOWN?</em> However, undaunted I am the president, founder and membership committee chairman of the Ceiling Fan Club as well as the Oscillating Fan Club of Texas. My solitary membership in these two clubs insure that I will not be cast out by a sudden coup d'etat.</div>
<div>This is indeed a painful confession, but I felt it might be necessary in order to insure that you not disparage my humble name, Puddle Splasher, in the future when discussing the possible shady goings-on of the members of those Texas Letterboxers' fan clubs from which I was rejected.</div>
<div>Most sincerely,</div>
<div>Puddle Splasher</div>

I am afraid that none of the above are the actual reasons for your denial. The real reason has to do with the puddles. Yes, Puddle Splasher, in case you are unaware of this fact, letterboxers have a fear of water. Especially if they are using water soluble ink. <br/>

&gt; Ah HA! Now the real reason for my rejection has surfaced! I thought the rejection letter from the Mo5 Fan Club seems a bit shady when the reason given was because I had mispelled my name on my application. Oh and the IRA Boxer rejection? Anyone could have made the same mistake as I did on my application when I stated my reason for joining was because I wanted to "see dead people".<br/>

<div>Has my last name been ignored? By definition, to <em>splash</em> in a puddle would mean to disperse the water. Therefore, I should be a friend to letterboxers, rather than being feared. Have I not recently been preaching the virtues of using waterproof baggies and Lock n Lock boxes?</div>

<p>Dear Puddle Splasher, <br/><br/>I am afraid that none of the above are the actual reasons for your denial. The real reason has to do with the puddles. Yes, Puddle Splasher, in case you are unaware of this fact, letterboxers have a fear of water. Especially if they are using water soluble ink. <br/><br/>Sincerely, <br/><br/>Investigator Francis Bacon<br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr/>yahoogroups.<wbr/>com</a>, "Puddle Splasher" &lt;cjagger405@<wbr/>...&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt;<br/>&gt; Ah HA!

The initial P. did not fool anyone. Once a puddle, always a puddle. Have you not seen what happens when one splashes in a puddle? No matter how you color it, still comes out WET. <br/>

Sincerely, <br/>
