Perhaps it's  not actually the size that confounds me as much as the large areas of uncarved medium. Try as I may, and careful as I may be, I just can't seem to get a good image of large stamps with lots of uncarved areas and it ends up being a "blob" in my logbook. Maybe I need to add a brayer to my backpack supplies so I can roll the back of the stamp and get a better image transfer into my logbook, but then we'd have to be super careful not to crack or damage large stamps. I try to ink the largest areas last on a stamp so they don't have time to dry out. I replaced my markers and stamp pads often, I make sure to use plenty of ink, I huff, I carefully place the stamp on my page with the logbook on a flat surface, I press evenly all over the area, paying special attention to large uncarved areas, and I still come up with missing areas.<br>
Sooooo... just for the sake of discussion, assuming we all appreciate the effort all letterboxers make when placing a box, what would be the IDEAL size or style of stamp.<br>
A few years ago, I found a stamp carved by Beneficus Rex which was mounted on a small wheel. It was too cool! Celticlions also had one like that at the Moose Meet. I do love an original idea!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Can you carve an image on that brayer?  That might be an idea.  I guess you're talking about those stamps that are carved with a negative image, leaving a large area uncarved?  I have at times used a marker and just put enough ink around the carved image to get an impression and then put pressure only on that area.  Sometimes it works.  I try to use only as much carving material as I need for my image, no matter what its size.  That way, I can get more stamps out of a block of material.  Sometimes I'll even use my irregular-shaped scraps for a stamp if I can make the image fit, then cut away the rest. You could always carry an xacto knife and ....  just kidding!  <br>

<div><font size="2">Duh... there you go! Why didn't you point out the obvious to me a long time ago, Boots? I'll do that from now on. (See, that's why I'm in your fan club, but don't mention fan club to the inspector or he'll go off on us!) I usually do the same thing you suggested about using an x-acto (yes, only on my OWN stamps), to cut off the extra before mounting it. Good stamping material is too hard to come by to waste it, isn't it? I've also cut away areas that didn't turn out like I had envisioned them. Of course if I did that too much, my stamps would end up the size of a dime.</font></div>

I am afraid that none of the above are the actual reasons for your denial. The real reason has to do with the puddles. Yes, Puddle Splasher, in case you are unaware of this fact, letterboxers have a fear of water. Especially if they are using water soluble ink. <br>

I thought the rejection letter from the Mo5 Fan Club seems a bit shady when the reason given was because I had mispelled my name on my application. Oh and the IRA Boxer rejection? Anyone could have made the same mistake as I did on my application when I stated my reason for joining was because I wanted to "see dead people".<br>

The initial P. did not fool anyone. Once a puddle, always a puddle. Have you not seen what happens when one splashes in a puddle? No matter how you color it, still comes out WET. <br>
