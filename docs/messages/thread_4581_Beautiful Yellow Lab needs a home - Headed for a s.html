<td width="100%">Joanne,<br/>Would you please send to our group. Carol is 
            out until July 6. Thank you!<br/>An extremely sweet lab guy, who we've been 
            calling Buddy, literally walked up to my son in our driveway 2 weeks 
            ago. We did everything to find his owner, to no avail. I've 
            contacted a bunch of rescues and shelters up here in Dallas, and 
            everyone says they're full, some don't respond at all. Lab Rescue of 
            North Texas actually responded that they would help, then never got 
            back in touch with us, and won't return my emails. So now I'm 
            reaching out for help outside of our area.<br/><br/>The problem is 
            this, poor Buddy is having to live in my garage because I have 4 
            dogs, and 2 of them do NOT get along with new dogs. It's not fair to 
            Buddy to continue keeping him in the garage, especially when all he 
            wants to do is be with people. I feel so terrible, but it's the best 
            I can do for him here.<br/><br/>I've sent out countless emails over 
            the last 2 weeks. I had 2 people that were interested, but they both 
            bailed before they even met him. One woke up the morning she was 
            supposed to meet him, and decided the timing wasn't right for her. 
            The other decided to take one of his mother's dogs instead. I had a 
            third person meet him, and actually took him home, but Buddy, an 
            intact male, was WAY too interested in his wife's chihuahua, and 
            climbed over their 6' fence. I tried explaining that getting him 
            fixed should take care of those problems, but he claims his wife had 
            a fit and would NOT let Buddy stay.<br/><br/>My husband keeps asking 
            why we can't just take him to the county shelter, which I obviously 
            have no interest in doing. But I can't help thinking maybe he would 
            have a better chance there than with me. In my garage.<br/><br/>I'm at 
            my wits end. Buddy is a fantastic dog, and we would keep him if our 
            dogs would permit. He's extremely friendly, playful and good with 
            kids. He is very well-behaved, does great on a leash. My son was 
            actually able to skateboard with Buddy trotting along perfectly 
            beside him. Never pulled him off once! So he would be a great 
            jogging partner. And even though he's a large dog, both of my kids 
            (10 and 8 years old) can handle him easily and walk him by 
            themselves. He sits on command, and responds very well to 
            correction, so I think he'll be easily trained. He has a small 
            football that he likes to play with, and when he wants to play, we 
            will go get it and bring it to you in hopes you will play fetch with 
            him.<br/><br/>This is a great dog who deserves so much better than my 
            garage. Ideally I would like him to be taken in by a rescue, where I 
            know he will be neutered (which will hopefully take care of those 
            certain instincts and fencing climbing), given shots and just 
            overall cared for. And rescues do a good job screening potential 
            adopters. This guy has been through enough waiting for a chance at a 
            forever home, and I want him to have the best shot at finding one. I 
            don't know what else to do myself, so if you could send this on to 
            anyone you think may be able to help, I would so appreciate 
            it.<br/><br/>We live north of Dallas, but we're traveling to Austin 
            Thursday night, so we could potentially bring Buddy with us. Either 
            way, he needs to have somewhere to go by then.<br/><br/>Thanks again 
            for any help, or even advice at this point,<br/><br/>Jami <br/><b><br/>Jami Cagle</b> | <b>Copywriter</b> • <b>JCPenney Internet Advertising</b><br/>6501 Legacy Drive MS 5318 Plano, TX 75024

<div>Bell Motel -</div>
<div>The SPCA in McKinney on McKinney Ranch Road/Stacy Blvd. (close to Alma Rd) is very large with lots of volunteers (many of whom are friends or neighbors of ours in McKinney). They accept most dogs and is the place where orphaned dogs from Katrina and Rita were sent. They have a very large adoption rate. Ask your brother to contact them, as I'm sure they'll be able to help. Also, I would suggest, if he hasn't already, take it by a local vet or the SPCA and have the dog scanned for a chip. Many dogs and cats (mine included) have chips which will identify/locate the owner. This sounds like a beautiful dog who has been loved and cared for and surely the owner is looking for him. My husband takes our dog to the Allen Dog park (on Stacy Rd and North Central Expressway just north of Plano in Allen) everyday, and I think there is a large bulletin board in the park where he could post the dog's pictures and description to see if anyone would be interested in adopting him. I know at the SPCA in McKinney, they would find a wonderful home for him very quickly.</div>

<td width="100%">Joanne,<br/>Would 
              you please send to our group. Carol is out until July 6. Thank 
              you!<br/>An extremely sweet lab 
              guy, who we've been calling Buddy, literally walked up to my son 
              in our driveway 2 weeks ago. We did everything to find his owner, 
              to no avail. I've contacted a bunch of rescues and shelters up 
              here in Dallas, and everyone says they're full, some don't respond 
              at all. Lab Rescue of North Texas actually responded that they 
              would help, then never got back in touch with us, and won't return 
              my emails. So now I'm reaching out for help outside of our 
              area.<br/><br/>The problem is this, poor Buddy is having to live in 
              my garage because I have 4 dogs, and 2 of them do NOT get along 
              with new dogs. It's not fair to Buddy to continue keeping him in 
              the garage, especially when all he wants to do is be with people. 
              I feel so terrible, but it's the best I can do for him 
              here.<br/><br/>I've sent out countless emails over the last 2 weeks. 
              I had 2 people that were interested, but they both bailed before 
              they even met him. One woke up the morning she was supposed to 
              meet him, and decided the timing wasn't right for her. The other 
              decided to take one of his mother's dogs instead. I had a third 
              person meet him, and actually took him home, but Buddy, an intact 
              male, was WAY too interested in his wife's chihuahua, and climbed 
              over their 6' fence. I tried explaining that getting him fixed 
              should take care of those problems, but he claims his wife had a 
              fit and would NOT let Buddy stay.<br/><br/>My husband keeps asking 
              why we can't just take him to the county shelter, which I 
              obviously have no interest in doing. But I can't help thinking 
              maybe he would have a better chance there than with me. In my 
              garage.<br/><br/>I'm at my wits end. Buddy is a fantastic dog, and 
              we would keep him if our dogs would permit. He's extremely 
              friendly, playful and good with kids. He is very well-behaved, 
              does great on a leash. My son was actually able to skateboard with 
              Buddy trotting along perfectly beside him. Never pulled him off 
              once! So he would be a great jogging partner. And even though he's 
              a large dog, both of my kids (10 and 8 years old) can handle him 
              easily and walk him by themselves. He sits on command, and 
              responds very well to correction, so I think he'll be easily 
              trained. He has a small football that he likes to play with, and 
              when he wants to play, we will go get it and bring it to you in 
              hopes you will play fetch with him.<br/><br/>This is a great dog who 
              deserves so much better than my garage. Ideally I would like him 
              to be taken in by a rescue, where I know he will be neutered 
              (which will hopefully take care of those certain instincts and 
              fencing climbing), given shots and just overall cared for. And 
              rescues do a good job screening potential adopters. This guy has 
              been through enough waiting for a chance at a forever home, and I 
              want him to have the best shot at finding one. I don't know what 
              else to do myself, so if you could send this on to anyone you 
              think may be able to help, I would so appreciate it.<br/><br/>We 
              live north of Dallas, but we're traveling to Austin Thursday 
              night, so we could potentially bring Buddy with us. Either way, he 
              needs to have somewhere to go by then.<br/><br/>Thanks again for any 
              help, or even advice at this point,<br/><br/>Jami <br/><b><br/>Jami Cagle</b> | <b>Copywriter</b> b" <b>JCPenney Internet

<div>The SPCA in McKinney on McKinney Ranch Road/Stacy 
Blvd. (close to Alma Rd) is very large with lots of volunteers 
(many of whom are friends or neighbors of ours in McKinney). They accept 
most dogs and is the place where orphaned dogs from Katrina and Rita were sent. 
They have a very large adoption rate. Ask your brother to contact them, as 
I'm sure they'll be able to help. Also, I would suggest, if he hasn't already, 
take it by a local vet or the SPCA and have the dog scanned for a chip. Many 
dogs and cats (mine included) have chips which will identify/locate the 
owner. This sounds like a beautiful dog who has been loved and cared for and 
surely the owner is looking for him. My husband takes our dog to the Allen Dog 
park (on Stacy Rd and North Central Expressway just north of Plano in Allen) 
everyday, and I think there is a large bulletin board in the park where he could 
post the dog's pictures and description to see if anyone would be interested 
in adopting him. I know at the SPCA in McKinney, they would find a 
wonderful home for him very quickly.</div>

Ideally I would like him to be taken in by a rescue, where I know he will be neutered (which will hopefully take care of those certain instincts and fencing climbing), given shots and just overall cared for. And rescues do a good job screening potential adopters. This guy has been through enough waiting for a chance at a forever home, and I want him to have the best shot at finding one. I don't know what else to do myself, so if you could send this on to anyone you think may be able to help, I would so appreciate it.<br/><br/>We live north of Dallas, but we're traveling to Austin Thursday night, so we could potentially bring Buddy with us. Either way, he needs to have somewhere to go by then.<br/><br/>Thanks again for any help, or even advice at this point,<br/><br/>Jami <br/><b><br/>Jami Cagle</b> | <b>Copywriter</b> • <b>JCPenney Internet Advertising</b><br/>6501 Legacy Drive MS 5318 Plano, TX 75024 PH 972.431.9214</td></tr></tbody></table></div>
