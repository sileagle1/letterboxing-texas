boxes and went to tiger creek refuge in red springs to try to locate <br/>
one of barefoot lucy's boxes (it has been eaten by a shaggy green <br/>
monster that it was near).  first of all let me say that if you have <br/>
never been to tiger creek, you really need to go...see lucy's box for <br/>
more detail...when i went into the gift shop, there was an 8 week old <br/>
white tiger laying on the floor.  needless to say i quickly asked if i <br/>
could take a picture of her..and being the animal person that i am, i <br/>
then asked if i could pet her, and they said ok.  so i actually got to <br/>
pet an 8 week old white tiger with beautiful blue eyes.  this was <br/>
