Can't wait to hear about adventures. . .with Paul's knee and the <br>
accompanying crutches, we're living vicariously through others for a <br>
while.  I'm wondering if you were boxing through that horrific rain <br>
storm, though?  If so, you have waaaay more fortitude than we would <br>
even if healthy.<br>
<br>
We enjoyed meeting everyone, although we didn't stay as long as we <br>
would have liked, and didn't get a chance to chat with nearly enough <br>
of you (or exchange enough stamps).  Looking forward to future <br>
opportunities.<br>

To all those that made this weekend such a hoot, a hearty thankyou <br>
and round of applause to all you wonderful boxers.  Mr. Howdy had an <br>
easy trip of it back to las casa, as he slept in the back of the <br>
truck all the way home.  He told me that y'all tired him out by <br>
keeping him up all hours of the night (Boxdn, AntMan, Wanda, Silver <br>
Eagle, Hummer Lady, Barney Rubble, Grits, and Baby Bear) and his <br>
waggin' was draggin' this morning, what with the storm and all.  <br>
Can't wait till next year. <br>
<br>
Stay tuned for more details on where Mr. Howdy might be in your area <br>
next time.  Gracie already bought him some new Easter duds for <br>
Galveston State Park next weekend.  Come on by.<br>
<br>

long trip home after a looonnnnggg night, but well<br>
worth the drive!<br>
<br>
We, or I should say our tent, suffered some<br>
misadventure last night during the storm and we<br>
decided to leave it to its woes and opted for the car<br>
for a nice dry night.  We got up bright and early and<br>
hit the trails for a few boxes before we headed back<br>
up to East Texas.  Unbelievable how nice a morning we<br>
woke up to after such a tempestuous night - and I<br>
can't wait to hear the tales of those late night<br>
letterboxers, bound to be a good story or two in<br>
there.<br>
<br>
We had a really good time yesterday and it was so good<br>
to see everyone - those we met last year and those we<br>
met for the first time yesterday - it seemed like old<br>
home week from the first moment.  <br>
<br>
Thank you, thank you to Silver Eagle for putting the<br>
event together, to Baby Bear for the classic event<br>
stamp, and to both of them for great chili.  <br>
<br>
Thanks to Celtic Lions for the very cool game - you<br>
guys really went above and beyond with it.  And thanks<br>
to all the carvers who made the game so rich with<br>
their creativity.<br>
<br>
Thanks to Steve (boxdn) for coffee and beignets - it<br>
was a really nice way to start a great day.  I meant<br>
to get a t-shirt for Alex, so if you still have some,<br>
I'd like to get one if you don't mind shipping it.<br>
Just let me know...<br>
<br>
I just love our group - it's just so darned much fun!<br>
<br>
See y'all next year, if not on the trails...<br>

We, too are home safe and sound, and finally dry. WOW! What a wild <br>
night of sleeping (??) in a tent. It took us 4 hours to unpack and <br>
dry out all our gear... but it was all worth it! We had so much fun <br>
this weekend, thanks to all! Can't wait to hear about the "Storm <br>
Chasers" boxing adventures on Saturday night. You all are crazy!<br>
<br>
Happy Homeschoolers - who finally was a 'First Finder' of a Lb this <br>
weekend! <br>
