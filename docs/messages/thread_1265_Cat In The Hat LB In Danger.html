Subject:  Letterbox Placement <br/>
<br/>
To Whom It May Concern:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
It's come to my attention that you have placed a Letterbox (Cat In <br/>
The Hat) within the Fort Worth Nature Center and I wanted to make you <br/>
aware of our protocols.  Below I've copied and pasted the document <br/>
for you.  The location you picked has caused some damage to the area <br/>
and must be moved.  Please remove the cache by September 12th and <br/>
contact the staff prior to placing your cache in a new location.  <br/>
After reading the info below if you have any questions please don't <br/>
hesitate to contact me!<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Happy Letterboxing,<br/>

GEOCACHING AND LETTERBOXING PROTOCOLS<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
            The staff at the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge <br/>
recognizes that the sports of GeoCaching and Letterboxing are growing <br/>
in popularity, and that the Refuge seems an obvious fit for these <br/>
activities.  However, we do have concerns about preserving the feel <br/>
of wilderness and conserving our natural resources, and so have drawn <br/>
up this list of stipulations for placing and maintaining caches on <br/>
the property:<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
1)                 All persons wishing to place a cache on the Nature <br/>
Center must contact a senior staff member (Director, Nature Center <br/>
Supervisor, Natural Resource Manager) for approval of the requested <br/>
placement site.<br/>
<br/>
2)                 Caches must be located no farther than 5 feet from <br/>
an official trail.<br/>
<br/>
3)                 Caches will remain in place no longer than 12 <br/>
months.<br/>
<br/>
4)                 No more than 5 caches will be allowed on the <br/>
property at any one time, this includes both Geocaching and <br/>
Letterboxing.  Any additional caches will be removed.<br/>
<br/>
5)                 Persons seeking caches are required to stay on <br/>
official trails until closely approaching the cache site.  Please no <br/>
orienteering.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Nature Center staff will monitor both the GeoCaching and Letterboxing <br/>
web sites as well as the caches on the ground.  At the first sign of <br/>
damage to the resources such as the appearance of an unapproved <br/>
trail, soil compaction, vegetation damage, etc., staff will pull the <br/>
cache and notify its owner to come pick it up.  Staff will also pull <br/>
any approved caches that remain after their time limit is up.  Caches <br/>
that are placed without authorization will be removed immediately.<br/>

<div>Silver Eagle: I just talked to my sister (Viewfinder) and she said she had found that box earlier this year, and would be happy to go with me out to the Nature Center tomorrow to move it or get it or whatever needs to be done. She wondered about the other two boxes in the area - are they in danger also?</div>

<div>I just read the protocols listed by the Ft Worth Nature Center, and Viewfinder and I will go out tomorrow and see if we can find a "approved and suitable" location to re-hide the box, register it with the park and make the necessary clue changes. I am a bit stumped by the "no orienteering" rule (no use of a compass?)</div>

to the finish line on a convoluted route, along the way picking up <br/>
numbered flags at points B, C, D, etc. to prove that you haven't <br/>
cheated and taken a short cut.<br/>
<br/>
Sort of like going on a hike with my ex-husband, who always wanted <br/>
to see how fast we could cover ground instead of enjoying the <br/>
scenery!<br/>

&gt; I just got the following email from somebody at the<br/>
&gt; Fort Worth Nature Center telling me I have to move<br/>
&gt; my box to comply with their rules.  I did not even<br/>
&gt; know they had procedures for boxes when I placed it<br/>
&gt; and since I won't be anywhere close in time to move<br/>
&gt; it I guess they will confiscate it.  I hesitate<br/>
&gt; to ask anyone to try and move it for me since it<br/>
&gt; will involve talking with the park officials, but<br/>
&gt; if anyone in Dallas/Ft. Worth area is willing, please<br/>
&gt; let me know.  Thanks.<br/>

&gt; It's come to my attention that you have placed a Letterbox (Cat In <br/>
&gt; The Hat) within the Fort Worth Nature Center and I wanted to make <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; aware of our protocols.  Below I've copied and pasted the document <br/>
&gt; for you.  The location you picked has caused some damage to the <br/>
area <br/>
&gt; and must be moved.  Please remove the cache by September 12th and <br/>
&gt; contact the staff prior to placing your cache in a new location.  <br/>
&gt; After reading the info below if you have any questions please <br/>
don't <br/>
&gt; hesitate to contact me!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Happy Letterboxing,<br/>

&gt; GEOCACHING AND LETTERBOXING PROTOCOLS<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;             The staff at the Fort Worth Nature Center and Refuge <br/>
&gt; recognizes that the sports of GeoCaching and Letterboxing are <br/>
growing <br/>
&gt; in popularity, and that the Refuge seems an obvious fit for these <br/>
&gt; activities.  However, we do have concerns about preserving the <br/>
feel <br/>
&gt; of wilderness and conserving our natural resources, and so have <br/>
drawn <br/>
&gt; up this list of stipulations for placing and maintaining caches on <br/>
&gt; the property:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 1)                 All persons wishing to place a cache on the <br/>
Nature <br/>
&gt; Center must contact a senior staff member (Director, Nature Center <br/>
&gt; Supervisor, Natural Resource Manager) for approval of the <br/>
requested <br/>
&gt; placement site.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 2)                 Caches must be located no farther than 5 feet <br/>
from <br/>
&gt; an official trail.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 3)                 Caches will remain in place no longer than 12 <br/>
&gt; months.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 4)                 No more than 5 caches will be allowed on the <br/>
&gt; property at any one time, this includes both Geocaching and <br/>
&gt; Letterboxing.  Any additional caches will be removed.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; 5)                 Persons seeking caches are required to stay on <br/>
&gt; official trails until closely approaching the cache site.  Please <br/>
no <br/>
&gt; orienteering.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Nature Center staff will monitor both the GeoCaching and <br/>
Letterboxing <br/>
&gt; web sites as well as the caches on the ground.  At the first sign <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; damage to the resources such as the appearance of an unapproved <br/>
&gt; trail, soil compaction, vegetation damage, etc., staff will pull <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; cache and notify its owner to come pick it up.  Staff will also <br/>
pull <br/>
&gt; any approved caches that remain after their time limit is up.  <br/>
Caches <br/>
&gt; that are placed without authorization will be removed immediately.<br/>
