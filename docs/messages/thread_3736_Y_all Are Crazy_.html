getting to read the posts.  Looks like some of you were busy avoiding <br>
clowns, braving haunted Telge Park in the wee hours, and doing some <br>
midnight fishing on the Brazos.  Glad to hear both the TTC and TTB2 are <br>
in safe hands, and I'm sure everyone is anxious to see where they turn <br>
up next.  Y'all are crazy, and that's why I luv ya!<br>

<div>But first - TTB2 stands for Texas Tour Bus 2 and TTC should probably be TCT - Texas Circus Train.<br/></div>
<div>About three or four years ago, TeamKing (who have since moved to England) started a box that traveled - the Texas Tour Bus.  She hid it and posted clues about it here and boxers could go and grab it and remove it, with the condition that they carve and place a person of Texas origins on the bus as a passenger and then hide the box elsewhere, posting the clues here, and the process started all over again.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>The rules of the box were that the clues were to be posted only on this list, that as soon as you found the box you were to post that you found it, that it couldn't leave the state, that you carve and place a stamp representing a Texas personality as a passenger.  The result was that as soon as the clues were posted, members of this list made a mad dash to gather up the box and steal it away from everyone else.  Sadly, the box was passed off to some new boxers met on the trail, and they apparently didn't understand exactly what to do with it, and it has been long gone.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Not to be so easily put off, TeamKing started up another bus, leaving us a legacy before moving away.  That bus has now travelled about (although it has yet to make it to West Texas), and is full as well.  Discussion was had last week that a new "something" should be started, similar to the TTB.  SO - somewhere in all the Bear/Bozo/ghost/Eagle/pie/Telge/moonlit walk fiasco of the last week, a Circus Train has emerged - the TCT.</div>

Cold Front found the box when I hid it last, and he took it to West<br>
Texas.  So, I know it's been out there and worked its way back. <br>
<br>
BTW, congratulations to Cold and Warm Front who are engaged.  I told<br>
them that if they could make it back to Houston, I'd throw them a<br>
Letterboxing Engagement Party.  The wedding's a ways off, so I hope<br>
that they'll be able to take me up on it.<br>

worth some clues).  <br>

But I think you need some.  I think it's low-sodium and I know it's<br>
low-fat, perfect for Mr. Sandibox. <br>
<br>
I'll have to check my notes as to where I had that dish. <br>
