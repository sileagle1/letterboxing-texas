getting to read the posts.  Looks like some of you were busy avoiding <br/>
clowns, braving haunted Telge Park in the wee hours, and doing some <br/>
midnight fishing on the Brazos.  Glad to hear both the TTC and TTB2 are <br/>
in safe hands, and I'm sure everyone is anxious to see where they turn <br/>
up next.  Y'all are crazy, and that's why I luv ya!<br/>

Cold Front found the box when I hid it last, and he took it to West<br/>
Texas.  So, I know it's been out there and worked its way back. <br/>
<br/>
BTW, congratulations to Cold and Warm Front who are engaged.  I told<br/>
them that if they could make it back to Houston, I'd throw them a<br/>
Letterboxing Engagement Party.  The wedding's a ways off, so I hope<br/>
that they'll be able to take me up on it.<br/>

to <br/>
&gt; &gt; England)<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; started a box that traveled - the Texas Tour Bus.  She hid it <br/>
and <br/>
&gt; &gt; posted<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; clues about it here and boxers could go and grab it and remove <br/>
it, <br/>
&gt; &gt; with the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; condition that they carve and place a person of Texas origins <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; the bus as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; a passenger and then hide the box elsewhere, posting the clues <br/>
&gt; &gt; here, and the<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; process started all over again.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; The rules of the box were that the clues were to be posted only <br/>
on <br/>
&gt; &gt; this<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; list, that as soon as you found the box you were to post that <br/>
you <br/>
&gt; &gt; found it,<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; that it couldn't leave the state, that you carve and place a <br/>
stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; representing a Texas personality as a passenger.  The result <br/>
was <br/>
&gt; &gt; that as<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; soon as the clues were posted, members of this list made a mad <br/>
dash <br/>
&gt; &gt; to<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; gather up the box and steal it away from everyone else.  Sadly, <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; box was<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; passed off to some new boxers met on the trail, and they <br/>
apparently <br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; understand exactly what to do with it, and it has been long <br/>
gone.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; Not to be so easily put off, TeamKing started up another bus, <br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving us a<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; legacy before moving away.  That bus has now travelled about <br/>
&gt; &gt; (although it<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; has yet to make it to West Texas), and is full as well.  <br/>
Discussion <br/>
&gt; &gt; was had<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; last week that a new "something" should be started, similar to <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; &gt; TTB.  SO<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; - somewhere in all the Bear/Bozo/ghost/Eagle/pie/Telge/moonlit <br/>
walk <br/>
&gt; &gt; fiasco<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; of the last week, a Circus Train has emerged - the TCT.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; So there you have it...clear as mud?<br/>
