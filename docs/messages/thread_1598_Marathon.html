around the downtown, Galleria, Memorial Park area on Sunday!  It is <br>
the Houston Marathon ( www.houstonmarathon.com) and lots of runners, <br>
including myself, will be out running the streets. WooHoo!! You can <br>
go to the marathon website for a course map and see where the <br>
streets will be closed.  Additionally, spectators are always welcome <br>
along the course route.  If you have never been to a marathon, it <br>
can be very entertaining!  Feel free to come out and cheer the <br>
runners on.  You never know when words of encouragement may be <br>
exactly what a runner needs.  Many runners write their name on their <br>
arms, legs, shirt etc...so that you can cheer specifically for them!<br>
