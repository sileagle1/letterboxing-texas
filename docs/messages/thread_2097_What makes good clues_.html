<div>I'll go ahead and kick off:  Good clues that use paces use small numbers of paces, define the pace, and set a test pace.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And here's why I say that:</div>
<div> </div>
<div>1) Using small numbers of paces if at all possible, or breaking large pace counts down into smaller segments from landmark to landmark.  The more paces you use, the more critical the pace length (of which everyone's is different) becomes and the farther the finder will be from the intended location.
</div>
<div>2) Set a test pace (i.e. the first bench is 15 paces before the second bench) so the finder can know how their pace compares to yours.</div>
<div>3) Define your pace.  Is it one footfall or two?  Standard definition of a pace is one pace=one left+one right, but you can choose to call one footfall a pace if you define it.<br clear="all"/>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>

<br>
Ohhhhh yes!<br>
<br>
I'd like to get in on this topic!  I think vague clues are those <br>
that say things like "head northwest from the big flat rock".  Now <br>
that may not be a problem if you're in a forest-type area and there <br>
is only ONE big flat rock that you might be standing on.  BUT...if <br>
you live in Central Texas and there are big flat LIMESTONE rocks <br>
everywhere underfoot...that's a problem!<br>
<br>
Also, I think landmarks in clues need to be somewhat PERMANENT.  I <br>
mean, who can know if Hurricane Katrina will come and knock down a <br>
tree that's been standing there for over 100 years?!?  But...it's <br>
probably not a good idea to use "a y-shaped cactus" in your clues.  <br>
Cactus are pretty fragile and also subject to being foraged upon by <br>
animals.<br>
<br>
Can you tell I've had the opportunity to have been wandering around <br>
aimlessly in a very large park trying to follow clues that were most <br>
decidedly vague and not well-written?!?<br>
<br>
The most frustrating thing about vague clues is that they SEEM to be <br>
pretty straight-forward until you get to the actual location and <br>
find "landmarks" around every corner.  Or are they?<br>
<br>
Clever clues, on the other hand, I KNOW are going to be difficult to <br>
follow and I adopt a different mindset when I go searching for those <br>
boxes.  I don't mind clever clues...as long as I know that's what <br>
I'm getting myself into!<br>
<br>
I especially enjoy clever clues that use poetry or a short story to <br>
lead me to a place.  I even enjoy those "code"-type clues...even <br>
though they take me FOREVER to work out!  (BTW...I'm still working <br>
on GG's WOM clues!!!  Someday...that box will be mine!)  <br>
<br>
I guess I just need to be aware when I'm looking at LbNA or <br>
AtlasQuest that I'm going to have to figure something out BEFORE I <br>
leave my house...and not while I'm out in the woods wandering around <br>
for hours with kiddos and LSS in tow!  By then...it's usually over <br>
100 degrees, dusk is approaching and EVERYBODY is starving!  <br>
<br>
I'm out there alone at that point, wondering "How long is this <br>
placer's pace? Could it be THIS flat rock?  Is my compass working <br>
around all of these rocks?  I wonder if this flattened, knocked down <br>
cactus could've ever been y-shaped?  What if I skip this part of the <br>
clue and look for a different landmark?  There are NO mesquite trees <br>
out here...maybe they meant all of these cedar trees? Maybe if I <br>
just keep looking for 5 more minutes....I'll find it?).<br>

<body style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffffff">
<div>
<div><font size="2">I LOVE good cleverly written clues - ones that are not really bona fide mystery boxes, but ones where you may not understand what the author is describing until you find the landmark! One box I was seeking in Connecticut told me the box was hidden in a mini cavern just behind the Robert's motorcycle fish rock. Robert's motorcycle fish rock? It wasn't until I arrived at described location that I realized this was a large boulder with a plaque mounted on it honoring a man named Harley Fish Roberts for helping acquire the land this trail was located on.</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">For other boxes, I had to do a little research or carry my tree identification book with me in my backpack. One of my all time favorites was on Mt Mohawk in NE Connecticut. I had to drive up to the top of the mountain peak, find a giant compass painted on the asphalt, go SE to find the trail behind the rangers lookout and descend the trail for approximately 1,140 feet to a "flatter area with few rocks and a patch of Mt Laurel on your right. Just past the Laurel is a small vernal pool on the right. If it is later in the summer, the pool may be dried up so look for the lowest point in the flat area with matted leaves that looked like they were pressed from the submersion of water." I was looking for this box in July and to my untrained eye, I came upon several areas that looked like that could have been the dried up vernal pool! Luckily they gave a catch clue: "If you reach a fire road, you have gone too far so return up the trail approximately 120 paces".  Then I was instructed to get off the trail and walk past the pool and look for the double beech trees with smooth gray bark at the end of the pool. Then stand at the opposite side of the beech and take a compass reading of N55W or azimuth of 305. Then follow this direction for 28 paces which should take me to a location between a small white oak and a large red oak. Then standing between the two trees I was to look for a long, narrow boulder with a V shaped roof and look under the far end of the boulder. This was my seventh letterbox, and I wasn't all that familiar with the flora of CT at that time, so I spent a good part of that day exploring Mt Mohawk before I actually located the box. That has always been one of my favorites though, because it was physically and mentally very challenging. Finding the right beech, (white or gray), birch, elm, sugar maple, red maple, white oak, red oak, tulip tree, white pine, red pine, red cedar, etc etc etc in the middle of a forest or the correct rock where there were millions in CT was a real education for me and I LOVED the experience!</font></div>
<div><font size="2"></font> </div>
<div><font size="2">I think writing good clues doesn't mean you need to provide a tour guide or valet service to the box, because finding a challenging box is very rewarding, but rather to be very accurate in your descriptions and directions (especially compass readings and paces, etc). So far my clues have been pretty straight forward, but I have been thinking about making some of them a bit more fun (challenging) in the future.</font></div>

<div>I agree with this, and in fact, it's what has led to letterbox limits on 
the part of my spouse on more than one occasion!  I love clever clues that 
suggest something that, when I find the spot, will suddenly make sense, but not 
just vague clues that leave me wandering around poking behind every tree or 
under every stickery bush and I still don't know if I'm in the right place or 
not (can't be too good for the environment or my temperament, either!) I 
also appreciate a "backup" landmark, just in case something has changed, so I 
can figure out whether or not I'm at least on the right trail!  </div>

                    <html><body><div>In contemplating some of this this evening, I realized I like clues that are sort of like ripples in the water.  The larger outer rings aren't as well defined, but they become more clear and more definitive as they get closer to the epicenter.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Clues should be like that too - I don't mind vague or fuzzy clues as I begin to search, but as I am homing in, the clues should become increasingly clearer so that when I'm on the mark, I'll know it.  This keeps me from having to bushwhack, which I basically won't do.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Now this isn't to say that you should assume your finder isn't very intelligent or lacks common sense, so you have to give painstakingly detailed directions.  It just means that your directions should be crisp and clear and accurate, especially at the end.  You can assume your finder can look up a certain tree variety if needed, but make sure that if you say the box is hidden behind the blackjack oak that is five feet from the lakeshore, that the tree it is behind really IS a blackjack oak, and that there aren't 40 blackjack oaks five feet from shore to search.

the 9 from one side to the other.  When I pull the 9th one, I walk another 
112 paces, and then pull one of the 4 over.  This is 1000 meters, ot 1 
KM.  If I go 112 paces, and pull the first of the 9 again, at 
this point I have traveled 1100 meters.  It is really easier than it 
sounds.  A set of beads will carry you 5000 meters (5km) before you start

1 hour marching.  Time for a break to check on your troopers.

                    <html><body><div>Hehe...funny you say that - Wisconsin Hiker, who lurks on this list, and I were having this same discussion off the list.  She pointed out that the dictionary defines a pace as one step, and she pointed out that military is one step too.  Silent Doug calls one pace two footfalls on his site.  Scouting uses 2/1.  Many clues in Texas (older ones anyway) use the 2/1 definition.  Of course, all of this proves up the point I was trying to make, if you are going to use pace - DEFINE IT!  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My dad, who was quite an orienteer due to his experience in scouting and in the army, knew (as you said) exactly how long a stride he had and he could pace an area to precision each and every time.  He taught me how to measure rise and run without any type of measuring device using that skill.  I was in awe of him anyway, but this was one of those magical skills he had.  Amazing.  I was never quite as tight on my pace count as he was, but I was aware.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like you, though, I tend to avoid using pace because of the potential ambiguity.  I use steps and reference the height of the stepper, or I use landmarks.  Rarely do I use feet because I'm terrible at estimating feet.  I used paces early on, and probably still have a couple of boxes that have paces, and I have some paces in my scout series because those boxes were intended to train scouts in navigational skills.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Maybe this has already been covered, but a lot of clues use <br>
bearings, or compass readings, so you need to get a good compass and <br>
learn to use it.  This is especially important if you are the <br>
placer.  Experienced finders are going to trust that you know what <br>
you're talking about, so you need to be accurate.  Also, degree of <br>
difficulty may make a difference, so indicate that in your clues.  <br>
If you know that you're going on a 3 mile, 2 hour hike, you are more <br>
likely to be prepared, or you can even choose to mark that box off <br>
your list if you're not up to it.  Ask yourself, what would I like <br>
to know if I were hunting this letterbox?  Also, if you're not sure <br>
you're clues are workable, it may be a good idea to have a friend <br>
take your clues and find the box as a test before you post them.  <br>
And, don't use non-permanent landmarks, like trash cans, in your <br>
clues.  They can be moved or removed.<br>

<div>one of my more frustrating searches involved something just like 
that.  It said something like "from the tree at the edge of the woods, then 
...etc.  -- but how to decide WHICH tree was THE tree at the edge of the 
woods?  So I wound up searching just about every tree, from there to the 
next clues, and poking around in a lot of very stickery trees until I'd decided 
it just wasn't there or I wasn't even near the right spot, until I accidentally 
spotted the letterbox.  Even after I'd found it, I still couldn't tell why 
THAT tree was THE tree. I do like "mysterious" clues that become clear only 
after you see the place and can figure out what they mean then, but maybe can't 
really antcipate exactly what something will be until you do see it, 
but I like it to be clear when I'm there so, like Lucy, I'm not left to beat the 
bushes and hope to happen on the letterbox.  --

                    <html><body><div>I have a clue that refers to a woodpecker cafe.  I know that when a finder goes and looks for that box, they will have no idea what I mean by that, nor will they know what to look for.  It's one of those things where you round the corner and see the landmark and you say "Why yes, that IS a woodpecker cafe!" - I hope anyway.  When I used that phrase, I looked around to make sure there weren't any other similar landmarks that (in my mind at least) indicated a hungry woodpecker.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I think one key ingredient of good clues is in realizing the connotation of the language you use, not just the literal meaning.  When you use words like pace or feet or names like blackjack oak, you are implying precision. I think most finders rely on precise words, even while realizing that your 5 feet may actually be 6 feet - they know for sure it isn't 10 feet.  However, if you were to tell me in clues that the next landmark would be 10 shakes of a bunny's tail down the trail, I would have to stop and think - how far could I walk in the time it takes a bunny to shake his tail ten times?  I realize I have to be on my toes and thinking, instead of relying on the thinking the placer did already.  I can deal with bunny tail measurements, but I really get frustrated by cedars that are really pines, or 5 feets that are more like 12 feet.

<p>
</p><div>Hehe...funny you say that - Wisconsin Hiker, who lurks on this list, and 
  I were having this same discussion off the list.  She pointed out that 
  the dictionary defines a pace as one step, and she pointed out that military 
  is one step too.  Silent Doug calls one pace two footfalls on his 
  site.  Scouting uses 2/1.  Many clues in Texas (older ones anyway) 
  use the 2/1 definition.  Of course, all of this proves up the point I was 
  trying to make, if you are going to use pace - DEFINE IT!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>My dad, who was quite an orienteer due to his experience in scouting and 
  in the army, knew (as you said) exactly how long a stride he had and he could 
  pace an area to precision each and every time.  He taught me how to 
  measure rise and run without any type of measuring device using that 
  skill.  I was in awe of him anyway, but this was one of those magical 
  skills he had.  Amazing.  I was never quite as tight on my pace 
  count as he was, but I was aware. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like you, though, I tend to avoid using pace because of the potential 
  ambiguity.  I use steps and reference the height of the stepper, or I use 
  landmarks.  Rarely do I use feet because I'm terrible at estimating 
  feet.  I used paces early on, and probably still have a couple of boxes 
  that have paces, and I have some paces in my scout series because those 
  boxes were intended to train scouts in navigational skills. </div>

<div>The overriding theme of it is - be consistent!<br/><br/> </div>

    you could get a lot of argument here.  In the army a pace-count is 
    every time a foot touches the ground.  And it varies over different 
    terrain.  It is something you train at till you know your pace 
    count.  Mine was 112 before I retired.  GPS has made me lazy!

    typical maneuver unit had a compass man, a map man, and two pace men.  
    The pace-men carried a set of ranger beads.  Ranger beads is (are)

    I go 112 paces, and pull the first of the 9 again, at this point I have 
    traveled 1100 meters.  It is really easier than it sounds.  A set 
    of beads will carry you 5000 meters (5km) before you start over.  Over 
    average to rough terrain with a full combat load, this is about 1 hour

<div><span class="q">
<div>1) Using small numbers of paces if at all possible, or breaking 
      large pace counts down into smaller segments from landmark to 
      landmark.  The more paces you use, the more critical the pace length 
      (of which everyone's is different) becomes and the farther the finder will 
      be from the intended location. </div>
<div>2) Set a test pace (i.e. the first bench is 15 paces before the 
      second bench) so the finder can know how their pace compares to 
      yours.</div>
<div>3) Define your pace.  Is it one footfall or two?  Standard 
      definition of a pace is one pace=one left+one right, but you can choose to 
      call one footfall a pace if you define it.</div></span></div>
