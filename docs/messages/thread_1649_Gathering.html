are there badges for 'scouting locations' in letterboxing too?? I  <br/>
think by the end of it all, you will deserve a bunch! Thanks so much  <br/>
for all your effort in being the person on the spot. (you may regret  <br/>
that! LOL :)) By the time you've answered tons of questions about the  <br/>
area, scouted locations, planted boxes, etc., you'll be voting for a  <br/>
gathering in west Texas next year!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks!<br/>

of your hard work, expressions of creativity and resourcefulness, and<br/>
longsuffering leadership.  I am glad you guys got to slip away to box<br/>
a little.  :-)<br/>
<br/>
I, too, loved the storybook walk.  Unfortunately, I didn't get to do<br/>
too much of it with my kids - I ran out of paper in my book and had to<br/>
take a trip to the store in the middle of it!!  For those of you who<br/>
weren't able to make it, that is how many ... and how GREAT ... stamps<br/>
there were!  I just couldn't run out of paper ...... noooooooo!  :-) <br/>
I will know better next time.<br/>
<br/>
So, those of you in North Texas (and others willing to travel), are<br/>
you still interested in a DFW mini, maybe in November (that is when<br/>
Silver Eagle requested it, to coincide with his trip)?  If so, I am<br/>
willing to work on it.  Would anyone like to help?<br/>
