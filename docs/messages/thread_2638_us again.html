                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks for the warm welcome everyone.  That is really neat that you <br>
can do both the Geocaching and LBing Stormie, especially with the <br>
combo thing.  We had some friends spot some Geocachers once and they <br>
told them there is a box somewhere with like a billion dollars in <br>
it, but that you have to be helicoptered in to find it.  It made me <br>
laugh b/c anyone who can afford to be helicoptered in doesn't need a <br>
billion dollars!  I'm sure it's urban legend, but I think they were <br>
serious. Anyway, I think these hobbies are a great way to spend <br>
quality time with your kids and I'm glad Sky is joining you.  <br>
<br>
Also, we were just curious if any of you have encountered in <br>
negative response from any park staff, officials, etc.  Of course we <br>
always are discreet, but we thought about how we placed a box at <br>
Lost Maples after the fact.  We put it off a trail, but up a hill <br>
and then after leaving consider it might cause erosion having LBxers <br>
trek up there. Maybe there is certain etiquette we should know?  <br>
Anything we are missing?  Are good intention it to place a box at <br>
each campsite we visit.  We are so bad though about placing a box <br>
and not posting directions!!!  How crazy is that! We have one now at <br>
Colorado Bend SP from Thanksgiving and one at Mercer Gardens from <br>
Christmas.  We are going camping Wed. at Lake Mineral Wells and I <br>
told my husband we have to post our other two before we plant one <br>
there. After we learned about LBing we reflected on how many times <br>
we passed by boxes that we didn't even know were there, but to pass <br>
by boxes b/c people like us never give the clues is ridiculous... we <br>
need to post!<br>
<br>
Also, just this past weekend we were in Coldspring and checked out <br>
Double Lake for a possible site for a group camp.  What a nice area <br>
and so close by!  BT, We found your grandaughters box and my son <br>
couldn't believe she made it!<br>

<div><font size="2">I guess if you never post the clues, there will not be a problem with erosion or park officials - hee hee.</font></div>
<div><font size="2">Actually park officials work very diligently to prevent people from creating "social trails" and will usually confiscate your box if found, and could even attempt to fine you for littering. I've worked with park officials before in finding appropriate spots to hide my boxes, and it really depends on the park and the policy (or person in charge). I think the main thing boxers strive for is to follow the Leave No Trace (LNT) policy, and try to find an appropriate hiding place that won't have a negative impact on the environment.</font></div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's our responcibility to keep the environment healthy and happy! Our <br>
hobby should, in no way, effect the environment negatively. I fully <br>
agree with Puddle Splashers comment bellow... In addition, I have the <br>
state approval forms and could share them on here if someone could tell <br>
me how to add the file. It's the state of Texas permission to plant a <br>
geocache -which the rangers tell me goes for letterboxes as well. In it <br>
are guidelines and a form to fill out if your box is on state land. <br>
They are available at all the information desks at the entrances to the <br>
parks. <br>
