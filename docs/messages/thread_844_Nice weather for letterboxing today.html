the lunch crowd in the plaza)to find Man With Briefcase.  Actually, I'd <br/>
found it on Sunday, Mother's Day, but without my logbook or stamp, so I <br/>
went back to do it right!  No one else was there, perfect!  Even took <br/>
some really good pictures of the giant aluminum man, very impressive. <br/>
Kantexan, that is a great place for a letterbox!  Then we went out to <br/>
Lake Benbrook SW of Ft. Worth to find the 4 Element-al letterboxes <br/>
there and found all 4 in good shape, although the stamp for AIR is <br/>
missing (but taking the suggestion of a previous stamper in that <br/>
logbook, I traced it from the cover).  Those are great hiding places, <br/>
lots of fossils in the rocks along the lakeshore near FIRE, thick <br/>
wildflowers near WATER (so thick, in fact, that one is really tricky to <br/>
find right now.  Have to really pay attention to the clues!). <br/>
