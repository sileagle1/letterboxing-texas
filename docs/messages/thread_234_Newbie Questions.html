<div>Did you find the carving supplies at Michaels?  They may be located near the calligraphy and etching sections. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have been using a Speedball cutter set from Michaels. I have carved a couple erasers and also from a sheet of the pink stuff from Michaels. I did mount the pink stuff on a thin piece of wood.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Baby Bear likes the erasers at the Big Lots store.  He cuts them in half for microboxes.  I have bought a couple but have not tried carving them yet.</div>

<div><em>I would think that you would want a microbox to make it easier to hide if you are going to hide it in the immediate vicinity.  It may be better to find a spot farther away.  Just say visit the boardwalk and when you are ready to look for the box.....</em></div>

<div>Yes. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Also, I have also created a Texas Letterboxing Atlas which shows the general locations of letterboxes in an area.  If you would like your letterbox to be shown just send a letter to the Texas talklist.</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi Sherry! <br>
I buy most of my supplies at Hobby Lobby. The rubberstamp carving <br>
supplies are in the area with the calligraphy supplies. I have the <br>
very small, two nib, Speedball set, but use an exacto knife more. I <br>
did buy an extra nib - the very small point one, and like it too. <br>
For carving medium I have only used the pink stuff and then <br>
Staedtler MasterCarve 'Cuts Like Butter'....it really does. ;) That <br>
is my favorite, but has gotten almost impossible to find in Corpus <br>
Christi. <br>
<br>
I have never been to the Kemah Boardwalk, but our son and his family <br>
went last year and really liked it. Good luck with a letterbox <br>
there. It sounds like a great idea. <br>
<br>
You wrote, "And once we are ready to plant it, we just register at <br>
the LBNA website  and enter the clues, right?". Actually, you should <br>
hide the letterbox first and then post the clues. This allows for <br>
last minute changes in details. Also my experience has been that a <br>
couple of times I have been all ready to plant a box in a certain <br>
place, gone there, and then found that there is absolutely no place <br>
where I can put the box in the area I intended.  <br>
