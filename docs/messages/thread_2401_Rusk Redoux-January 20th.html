<div>Work is well underway to get this event going.  The site is reserved, clue books are ready and waiting for box checking, which I hope to go do next week.  I understand from different placers that some of the boxes out there need to be either verified or have a little TLC, and that Celtic Lions' have retired their Cherokee Nation box.  If you were not ever able to get that stamp, you missed a great treat!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>We've got a nice little group signed up for the event, with others who have said they'll be there.  I've had a couple of requests for a carving demo, so hopefully those who consider themselves to be good carvers, or who enjoy carving, or both, will bring tools and be willing to show how they carve.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm trying to keep this event very casual - emphasis on box finding - but hope to have a couple of mixer type activities for those who want to stay close to the fire (and hopefully we'll be needing one!).</div>
