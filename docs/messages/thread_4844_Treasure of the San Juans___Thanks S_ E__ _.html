<div id="ecxygrp-text"> Hello Silver Eagle. We
                    recently returned from our vist to Durango Co. <br/>
                    and found your box Treasure of the San Juans...it
                    was quite an exciting <br/>
                    find as i had my Mom and Husband with me, neither of
                    them box but i <br/>
                    think they are a little more interested in it since
                    we had such a great <br/>
                    time finding your box. The scenery was absolutely
                    amazing, the <br/>
                    "treasure" is still there and you have quite a few
                    treasures left. My <br/>
                    only compliant was the mosquitoes...LOL they were
                    big and thirsty! We <br/>
                    really didn't notice the mosquitoes until we got off
                    the main trail and <br/>
                    boy did they come out! I was glad i brought my
                    hoodie with me to cover <br/>
                    up during the stamping and re-hiding...<br/>
<br/>
                    Thanks Silver Eagle for such a great box, great
                    hike, and an <br/>
                    introduction to a new, beautiful place to visit
                    while in Durango.<br/>
