<p>I would like to join everyone else in welcoming y'all, and to make a suggestion.</p>
<div>In the last month (probably more like 2 weeks), we had a big discussion called something like "10 Suggestions to becoming a Successful Letterboxer".  Would you go to the archives on the list and read through those great suggestions?  I think they will really help y'all get a feel for the game!
