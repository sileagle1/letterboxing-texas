                    <div class="plaintext-content">Every couple of months I find myself on a quick road trip-you know the kind-get straight to your destination to pick someone up/drop someone off, etc-which means I am never in town any significant length of time, but while there, I do try to get at least 1 letterbox.  Some towns have tons of letterboxes, and others not so many.<br>
<br>
I must say, though-I am proud to be a part of letterboxing in Texas!  There are so many good quality plants to choose from here at home that I don't think I'll ever find them all.<br>
<br>
So, Texas planters:  thank you for your hard work!<br>
