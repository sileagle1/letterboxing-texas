I wanted to tell you how much I loved your little girl<br>
- she was just adorable and very polite!  She very<br>
diligently made sure that I signed her and your<br>
logbook, and was only a little put off when she<br>
couldn't find her name tag that spelled armadillo for<br>
her.  She finally said "well, would you just spell it<br>
for me please?"  <br>
<br>
I also had the pleasure of dining with FourFitzs<br>
Friday night and sitting next to their lovely little<br>
girl, Reagan.  She was a pleasure too!<br>
<br>
And Graham and Patrick, Stinky Monkey and Roarin' Lion<br>
(didn't get their real names), Kendall and Tyler,<br>
Compass Points' daughter...I would've taken any of<br>
them home with me!  And then the ones I didn't meet<br>
personally, but saw running around...<br>
<br>
Really, I thought all the kids were great.  Manners<br>
are a really big thing with me, and at the end of the<br>
day I realized there wasn't a single kid there that I<br>
thought was rude or unruly - truly, they all get tired<br>
and have their moments, but don't we all.  <br>
<br>
Rarely do you put a whole bunch of kids together and<br>
have so many that are lively yet polite and enjoyable<br>
to be around.  I wonder why it is that we had such a<br>
high proportion of good kids?<br>

happened to be at the park and did not know about the event!).  Keep <br>
up the carving, planting and searching, and I can't wait to see you <br>
all again next year!<br>

<div>I want to echo all of the above!  This was so much fun, beginning to 
end, and meeting all of you was the best part, even better than the great chili, 
warm fire, cool rain, beautiful setting, and wonderful stamps!  Thanks, 
Silver Eagle, Barefoot Lucy, and Dewberry, and also everyone else who took 
part in any way in this fun weekend!  --

<div>I also have to echo this observation of Lucy's.  I told my husband 
today that one of the things that made the event so much fun was all those kids 
who were so well-behaved, comfortable with adults, fun and having fun and 
absolutely delightful!  I also appreciated their parents who are obviously 
responsible for their kids' good behavior and ablity to converse!  Thanks 
to all.-- Viewfinder</div></font></body></html>
