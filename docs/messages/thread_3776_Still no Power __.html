                    <html><body><p>We are still without power, too, and word is that we may be without for a while.  There are two power grids that feed The Woodlands/Conroe area ( Lewis Creek and the Sabine substations) and they were hit pretty hard and suffered some flooding during Ike and apparently were still trying to recover from the storms that hit around Labor Day.  Anyway, other than a bunch of down tree branches and limbs, we are okay.  Our hot tub looks like a swamp because of all of the debris in it, but without power, we can't do anything about it.  We have had post hurricane parties every night to grill all of our meat and last night we had a camp fire with our fire pit and made s'mores. Nothing like marshmallows, chocolate and graham crackers to take the sting out of no power!  What a great way to get to know the neighbors!  <br/>
<br/>
Fortunately, I was able to run yesterday ( after two days of being told to stay put by the husband) and saw the amount of damage all around The Woodlands.  Lots of downed trees- like entire trees just fell over, tons of limbs littering the roadways etc...The Waterway had trees that were leaning over into the water and the Pavillion had it's cloth roof pretty much shredded due to the winds.  I went downtown with some friends a couple of days ago and took pictures of the buildings that lost their windows.  We weren't able to get into downtown because of the bayous flooding the streets that lead into downtown but from the freeways, it was incredible to see the number of windows that were blown out because of the storm.<br/>

Runs for Chocolate  :)<br/>

<div>I sometimes shock myself by how good a job I can do of planning, and something silly like cell phones slips my mind.  Fearless Fox is a consummate planner, but he's been out of commission the past 10 days, floating around on a cloud of vicodin until getting a piece of metal unstuck from his hand today. <br/>

    you might consider an alternate power source.  A few batteries on a 
    solar panel will last a few days.  Choose the DEEP-CYCLE

<div>I was a little bummed when our power came back on today 
      because we had already gotten permission from the city to burn and we 
      were going to have a nice fire out of our downed limbs, dutch oven dinner, 
      maybe a cobbler with it, and a grand ol' time.  As it has worked out, 
      we strung the hammocks up in the front yard (no trees for them in the 
      back) and have slept in them the last couple of nights, complete with 
      gas lantern and camp clothes and a barrier of Cutter's.  SJZ, 
      RXKaffee, and Trail Whale came over one evening to visit and Trail Whale 
      had a great time playing outside in the dark, swinging in the hammock 
      (after his mama showed him it was okay), and sneaking up on his Papa 
      (Fearless Fox).  I went and worked a shift at the shelter and came 
      back four hours later to find them still hard at it!  Some of our 
      neighbors have ventured by to say hello and - I'm sure - make sure we 
      weren't having any thoughts of making the campout situation more 
      permanent.  I think Fearless Fox may be, but I think I prefer to camp 
      in the woods away from civilization.  Last night alone, some guy 
      thought it was funny to honk his horn in front of our house at 1 a.m. - 
      scared the daylights out of us!   We kept hearing sirens and 
      trains all night long - apparently our little town is a lot busier than we 
      ever knew!  Still though - hammock sleeping just can't be beat!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - it was sure nice to come home this afternoon to a well-lit 
      kitchen and whirring ceiling fans.  Electricity is really loud!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I wound up working nights at the shelter, where we had power and 
      A/C.  Until this time, I saw staying at the shelter more of an 
      endurance than a nicety.  Not that I don't enjoy the work, I just 
      can't say much for the creature comforts.  I can only imagine now how 
      the evacuees must think when they walk into the shelter.  I know it 
      gets old for them, but it would be so much older if they were stuck in 
      their homes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like Blue Butterfly, I've been going to my husband's office and 
      wherever else I could steal a little juice or some internet to take care 
      of business.  It has been very odd having to work at finding out 
      whether we have school or whether my office was working or whether 
      Fearless Fox's doctor was open yesterday.  It's also been strange 
      having to conserve cell phone battery since the only place to plug in our 
      phones has been in the car, and our car requires that the key be on to 
      charge the phones and that didn't seem like a good plan.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can say I have a new appreciation for those of you who weather 
      hurricanes all the time.  I don't care to have to do all the work of 
      preparing, and I sure don't care for the work of cleaning up.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I sure hope everyone else gets back on track really quickly and most 
      of all, I hope this is the LAST big storm of the season!</div></div>--

<div> </div>
<div>Since you are so smart about batteries - we have a honking heavy bettery pack we keep plugged in in our garage to occasionally charge the car battery or to use when running an extension cord is impractical.  I've noticed that thing has a bunch of different kinds of connectors on its side, and now I'm thinking we probably could've used it to charge our phones.  Anyway, I'm guessing that's the same sort of thing you are talking about, except that the solar cell takes the place of the electrical plug.  Right?  What I don't get about that thing is that Fearless Fox insists it has to be plugged in under my feet at my work bench, which is elevated on a wood slat platform.  He says it can't sit on a concrete floor because the concrete kills the battery pack's charge?  Is that really the case?  And why?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sleeping bags?  Now that IS a topic of conversation!  I was making a list of suggested gifts for Cub Scouts the other day and was trying to break sleeping bags down simply enough to let parents know how much they needed to spend without spending too much until the boy gets a little older.  I've listened to enough conversations by scouters about buying the perfect sleeping bag, so that I finally gave up trying to write it all down - just gave a couple of models and moved on.  Fearless Fox has a whole row of sleeping bags on our camping shelf - all for different applications.  Yeesh!</div>

<div></div>
<div>
<p>
</p><div dir="ltr">
<div>I was a little bummed when our power came back on today because we had already gotten permission from the city to burn and we were going to have a nice fire out of our downed limbs, dutch oven dinner, maybe a cobbler with it, and a grand ol' time.  As it has worked out, we strung the hammocks up in the front yard (no trees for them in the back) and have slept in them the last couple of nights, complete with gas lantern and camp clothes and a barrier of Cutter's.  SJZ, RXKaffee, and Trail Whale came over one evening to visit and Trail Whale had a great time playing outside in the dark, swinging in the hammock (after his mama showed him it was okay), and sneaking up on his Papa (Fearless Fox).  I went and worked a shift at the shelter and came back four hours later to find them still hard at it!  Some of our neighbors have ventured by to say hello and - I'm sure - make sure we weren't having any thoughts of making the campout situation more permanent.  I think Fearless Fox may be, but I think I prefer to camp in the woods away from civilization.  Last night alone, some guy thought it was funny to honk his horn in front of our house at 1 a.m. - scared the daylights out of us!   We kept hearing sirens and trains all night long - apparently our little town is a lot busier than we ever knew!  Still though - hammock sleeping just can't be beat!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - it was sure nice to come home this afternoon to a well-lit kitchen and whirring ceiling fans.  Electricity is really loud!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I wound up working nights at the shelter, where we had power and A/C.  Until this time, I saw staying at the shelter more of an endurance than a nicety.  Not that I don't enjoy the work, I just can't say much for the creature comforts.  I can only imagine now how the evacuees must think when they walk into the shelter.  I know it gets old for them, but it would be so much older if they were stuck in their homes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like Blue Butterfly, I've been going to my husband's office and wherever else I could steal a little juice or some internet to take care of business.  It has been very odd having to work at finding out whether we have school or whether my office was working or whether Fearless Fox's doctor was open yesterday.  It's also been strange having to conserve cell phone battery since the only place to plug in our phones has been in the car, and our car requires that the key be on to charge the phones and that didn't seem like a good plan.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can say I have a new appreciation for those of you who weather hurricanes all the time.  I don't care to have to do all the work of preparing, and I sure don't care for the work of cleaning up.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I sure hope everyone else gets back on track really quickly and most of all, I hope this is the LAST big storm of the season!</div></div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"<br/>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="376541302-17092008">If you think about it, batteries do not work well when they 
are cold.  the chemical action with the lead-zinc-acid slows in the 
cold.  A battery stored on a cold damp floor will have a reduced capacity 
until it warms again.  Setting the battery in a place where it can stay 
warm (NOT HOT) is a good idea.  Keeping it off the floor can only help - 
but not hurt it.</span></div>

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span class="376541302-17092008">Yes - you could probably have used that as a charger.  
Does it have a built-in inverter?  It will have the standard 110 v 
wall-outlet plugs that you can plug things into it if it does.  Otherwise, 
it is 12v only.  But a small inverter would have given you AC power.  
Likely, you could also charge this device from the car motor is

<div>Okay, gotcha.  Kind of a battery's battery.  I think I hung on 
  there by a thread - I'm thinking there's a merit badge in there somewhere and 
  it might just be a worthy winter project, not to mention very 
  interesting!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Since you are so smart about batteries - we have a honking heavy bettery 
  pack we keep plugged in in our garage to occasionally charge the car battery 
  or to use when running an extension cord is impractical.  I've noticed 
  that thing has a bunch of different kinds of connectors on its side, 
  and now I'm thinking we probably could've used it to charge our 
  phones.  Anyway, I'm guessing that's the same sort of thing you are 
  talking about, except that the solar cell takes the place of the electrical 
  plug.  Right?  What I don't get about that thing is that Fearless 
  Fox insists it has to be plugged in under my feet at my work bench, which is 
  elevated on a wood slat platform.  He says it can't sit on a concrete 
  floor because the concrete kills the battery pack's charge?  Is that 
  really the case?  And why?</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Sleeping bags?  Now that IS a topic of conversation!  I was 
  making a list of suggested gifts for Cub Scouts the other day and was trying 
  to break sleeping bags down simply enough to let parents know how much they 
  needed to spend without spending too much until the boy gets a little 
  older.  I've listened to enough conversations by scouters about buying 
  the perfect sleeping bag, so that I finally gave up trying to write it all 
  down - just gave a couple of models and moved on.  Fearless Fox has a 
  whole row of sleeping bags on our camping shelf - all for different 
  applications.  Yeesh!</div>

    capacity = more $$$$$.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>The

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>Depending on how you use it, the battery will eventually go

    cell.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>If the 
    battery were totally dead it would take the 5 amp solar cell 200 hours to 
    produce 1000 amps.  Considering that you can usually expect about 10 
    hours of good charge, that would be 20 days.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>BUT - 
    rechargeable batteries need about 125% input to get 100% output.  (this 
    is one of the inefficiencies the hybrid-car dealers don't tell you).  
    That would mean you need to charge 1250 amps, or about 25 
    days.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>IF you 
    are CAREFUL, you do not use more battery every night than you can charge 
    every day.  But that can get expensive.  The other side of that 
    coin is the 10% rule.  Every time you discharge a rechargeable battery 
    more than 10%, you slightly damage the battery.  Over time, it loses 
    capacity.  Everyone has had AA batteries for their camera that just 
    don't hold a charge any more.  That is why.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>Most 
    people I know go with the bigger battery for about $100, smaller solar panel 
    for about $100, accept the fact that they will be slowly destroying the 
    battery, but it is economical.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>BTW - 
    I have about 110 amps of solar cells in the bunk house.  That would 
    fully charge that 1000 amp battery in about 14 hours.  But remember, I 
    can only use about 100 amps of the battery before it starts to take 
    damage.  But I can charge that 100 amps back in about 1:15.  Or, 
    MORE BATTERIES...<wbr/>....</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>I put 
    a 400 watt inverter in the Dog Show Van.  It runs on 12VDC, and powers 
    our laptop or other light-load items while we are on the road.  It cost 
    about $40 for the inverter.  Inverters go about $1 for 10 watts - for 
    GOOD units.</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>I have 
    a 1200 watt inverter new in the box - home I never need it - like someone's

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>OH - 
    some of the best deals for disasters is the Bay-Gen series of radios and

<div>I was a little bummed when our power came back on today 
          because we had already gotten permission from the city to burn 
          and we were going to have a nice fire out of our downed limbs, dutch 
          oven dinner, maybe a cobbler with it, and a grand ol' time.  As 
          it has worked out, we strung the hammocks up in the front yard (no 
          trees for them in the back) and have slept in them the last 
          couple of nights, complete with gas lantern and camp clothes and a 
          barrier of Cutter's.  SJZ, RXKaffee, and Trail Whale came over 
          one evening to visit and Trail Whale had a great time playing outside 
          in the dark, swinging in the hammock (after his mama showed him it was 
          okay), and sneaking up on his Papa (Fearless Fox).  I went and 
          worked a shift at the shelter and came back four hours later to find 
          them still hard at it!  Some of our neighbors have ventured by to 
          say hello and - I'm sure - make sure we weren't having any thoughts of 
          making the campout situation more permanent.  I think Fearless 
          Fox may be, but I think I prefer to camp in the woods away from 
          civilization.  Last night alone, some guy thought it was funny to 
          honk his horn in front of our house at 1 a.m. - scared the daylights 
          out of us!   We kept hearing sirens and trains all night 
          long - apparently our little town is a lot busier than we ever 
          knew!  Still though - hammock sleeping just can't be beat!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>BUT - it was sure nice to come home this afternoon to a well-lit 
          kitchen and whirring ceiling fans.  Electricity is really 
          loud!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>
<div>I wound up working nights at the shelter, where we had power and 
          A/C.  Until this time, I saw staying at the shelter more of an 
          endurance than a nicety.  Not that I don't enjoy the work, I just 
          can't say much for the creature comforts.  I can only imagine now 
          how the evacuees must think when they walk into the shelter.  I 
          know it gets old for them, but it would be so much older if they were 
          stuck in their homes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Like Blue Butterfly, I've been going to my husband's office and 
          wherever else I could steal a little juice or some internet to take 
          care of business.  It has been very odd having to work at finding 
          out whether we have school or whether my office was working or whether 
          Fearless Fox's doctor was open yesterday.  It's also been strange 
          having to conserve cell phone battery since the only place to plug in 
          our phones has been in the car, and our car requires that the key be 
          on to charge the phones and that didn't seem like a good plan.  
          </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I can say I have a new appreciation for those of you who weather 
          hurricanes all the time.  I don't care to have to do all the work 
          of preparing, and I sure don't care for the work of cleaning up.  
          </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I sure hope everyone else gets back on track really quickly and 
          most of all, I hope this is the LAST big storm of the 
          season!</div></div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear,
