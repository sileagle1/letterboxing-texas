the letterboxing sport they have lots of stamps and ink pads.  Also <br/>
some suitable Rubbermaid containers are to be found.<br/>
<br/>
If you are using or exploring microboxes with an ink pad...<br/>
<br/>
"ink it" acid free, pigment based ink pads are on sale.  Currently 25 <br/>
cents. <br/>
<br/>
The ink surface is 1 in. by 1 in. pad surface stands higher than <br/>
surrounding holder so it could mark bigger stamps than surface.  They <br/>
have some colors not usually available.  I like the Lime and teal <br/>
colors. Good color saturation.  Total case size is: 1.25" X 1.25" <br/>
X .75" height<br/>
<br/>
The Houston 7801 S. Main at Kirby Dr. store had about 100 of the <br/>
small size ones tonight.  Because I don't get my employee discount at <br/>
Hobby Lobby, I'm pushing Garden Ridge (from the inside) to get <br/>
speedball carving items and the Pink and cream stuff, and <br/>
Mastercarve.    <br/>
<br/>
NOTE:<br/>
Avoid this area on Super Bowl Sunday - Because this is so close to <br/>
Reliant Park, Garden Ridge is leasing out the parking lot for Car Bus <br/>
and RV parking. They will have very limited parking for customers on <br/>
Sunday Feb 01, 2004.<br/>

The 4 most important things in letterboxing: <br/>
Avoid the poison ivy, pick up any hitchhikers (stamping variety), and <br/>
don't forget to stamp in.  Enjoy the hunt! <br/>
