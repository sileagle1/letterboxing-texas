Hello Everyone,<br/>
<br/>
Dropping a quick note to let yall know that I am fine ten fingers and<br/>
ten toes. I was sheltered just north of Pearl River Louisiana with my<br/>
brother at his store. We have been doing far better than the 1,000's<br/>
that were stuck in New Orleans and the Gulf Coast. The neighbors have<br/>
all come together to help one another out and to watch each others<br/>
back.JamesDillon ( n0wka ) lives just up the road from here and I <br/>
would<br/>
tink he is ok too; maybe some tree damage. Wensday I plan to go back <br/>
to<br/>
my home to see what is left and retrieve anything that is salvagable. <br/>
I<br/>
know my Suburban was flooded but it has full coverage and as long as<br/>
the roof didn't blow off my apartment my things should be fine (unless<br/>
I was looted).<br/>
<br/>
I have read alot of the messages posted on the Lb talk lists and want<br/>
to thank everyone for their prayers and concerns. Please keep praying<br/>
for the rest of the other displaced people. If your local areas are<br/>
doing water, food, clothes, etc... drives please donate what you can,<br/>
every little bit helps when you have nothing, if you donate money make<br/>
sure it goes to the Katrina Huricane funds.<br/>
<br/>
I will post later when I have the time to tell more. Thank you all<br/>
again and God Bless.<br/>
<br/>

ATTENTION!!! Mark Pepe. Please post this message to Lb talklists. I<br/>
believe you are a member of all of them. I will take the blame for<br/>
cross posting ;o)<br/>
