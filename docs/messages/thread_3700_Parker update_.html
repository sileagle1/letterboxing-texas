      Most of you know about my hiking companion. A few of you have had 
      <br/>the<br/>&gt; opportunity to meet him. Someone on the list asked about 
      him - so <br/>I thought I<br/>&gt; would toss out an update.<br/>&gt; 
      <br/>&gt; Parker is shocking the vet - by still living. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; 
      We asked for a refill on a prescription last week . The vet was 
      <br/>SHOCKED that<br/>&gt; Parker was still alive. Moni (my wife) has done a 
      wonderful job <br/>of slowing or<br/>&gt; halting the bone cancer. So good 
      in fact that the vet asked her <br/>(Moni) if she<br/>&gt; (vet) runs into a 
      hopeless case of bone cancer if she (vet) can <br/>give her<br/>&gt; 
      (Moni's) contact info to the owners. Did that make any sense???<br/>&gt; 
      <br/>&gt; Parker still demands his food. He demands attention. And gets 
      <br/>it! Today Moni<br/>&gt; was yelling at him. She caught him chasing a 
      mouse across the yard!<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Our first goal was to get him to 
      his 8th birthday , June 1st . The <br/>second goal<br/>&gt; was to make it 
      past the Oklahoma trip, July 4th weekend. Both <br/>accomplished.<br/>&gt; 
      The next goal is to keep him around until James gets his mid-tour 
      <br/>leave in Oct.<br/>&gt; The vet thinks we are asking a lot. But this dog 
      has always amazed <br/>everyone<br/>&gt; with his ability to beat the odds. 
      He was dead twice and almost a <br/>third time<br/>&gt; before he was 6 
      months old. That is why he never got sold.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; He is doing 
      quite well.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Here is a photo of us at a puppy training 
      class last week. Parker <br/>doesn't train<br/>&gt; any more. But he enjoys 
      the environment. So we take him. You can <br/>plainly see<br/>&gt; the 
      bulging lump on his left fore-leg near the orange pillow. The 
      <br/>puppies<br/>&gt; graduated, and each got a little bag of cookies. 
      Parker is <br/>munching on one - he<br/>&gt; got his own bag as "BEST 
      SUPPORTING DOG" in the class.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I am 
      hiking tomorrow , updating a frail track-log for the state <br/>park 
      mapping<br/>&gt; program. Wish y-all could join me. I will need to sneak 
      out of <br/>the house -<br/>&gt; lest Parker catch me and demand to go 
      along. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; Mike - KD9KC.<br/>&gt; El Paso, Tx.<br/>&gt;

Well - I am shaken.  Some things fell into place today.<br>
<br>
Those of you who know me, or have had the honor to meet Parker - you know our<br>
situation.  Many of you have heard the Parker story, and how he came to be my<br>
dog.  And most of you  know he is dying of cancer.  He should have been gone<br>
last May.<br>
<br>
Here is Parker' page.<br>
http://www.vonbonehenge.com/parker.html<br>
<br>
I guess you all know my son James is home for a visit from Iraq.  He has 12 days<br>
left, then back to the war.<br>
<br>
My wife has been raising a batch of puppies.  They are cute.  All puppies are.<br>
Three are sold.  Two are staying.  I don't know why - I don't get involved in<br>
the dog showing stuff much.  I have my dog, that is all I want or need.  Except<br>
for the cancer taking him from me too soon.  Then again, 10 years from now would<br>
be too soon.<br>
<br>
Here are the puppies.  Notice the one with his tongue hanging out?  His name is<br>
River.  He is all white - except for the black you see in the photo.  He sorta<br>
likes me.  And strangely enough, Parker likes him too.  Usually Parker doesn't<br>
like the impetuous pups!  BTW - Daisy is the black pup.  She is a real fireball<br>
already!<br>
http://www.vonbonehenge.com/newlitterpage.htm<br>
<br>
When I got home today, a message was waiting for me in my E-mail.  This lady has<br>
a gift.  She also has Great Danes.  She has known my wife for years, and knows<br>
all of our dogs.  <br>
<br>
The message.<br>
<br>
====================================================<br>
<br>
Mike,<br>
 <br>
Last night I had one of my dreams. River knew all along he was staying and going<br>
to be your next great dog! He is waiting for you.<br>
 <br>
Parker knows he must leave but he wanted to make sure he saw James and that you<br>
accepted River first. He just wants to know that you will be ok without him?<br>
 <br>
Parker's time is just about here but not until James is gone. <br>
 <br>
My dream mainly revolved around River. He is one super extradinary dog....I<br>
didn't say puppy because he is an old soul. Mike there is something very special<br>
about you that brings these wonderful old souls to you. <br>
 <br>
Now Daisy is another story. LOL Have fun with her Monika! She is a very young<br>
soul and going to be your real challenge, but you like a challenge dog. LOL She<br>
popped into my dream for a fleeting moment like a whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Mike, I hope this gives you some peace with the pain you are going to be facing<br>
in the near future. Rest assure River is there to help you through it. He was<br>
sent to you by your spirit guides.<br>

We just had to put our beautiful, loyal special friend Otis (our 13 year old black lab) to sleep last Friday. I've always known it would hurt, but I didn't know it would hurt this much. It was positively the right thing to do, and it was obvious that the time was right, but that doesn't make it any easier. You and Parker will be in my thoughts and prayers. I like to think that Otis is up there chasing squirrels the way he did when he was young!<br>

  I can completely understand your torn feelings between the new pup 
  and<br/>Parker. But I really feel that Parker knows of his limitations in our 
  mortal<br/>time here....I'm probably making this up to some extent, but I 
  really feel that<br/>when I told Disney that I'd be okay and she could relax 
  and accept peace, it<br/>made *her* much more comfortable in allowing nature to 
  take her from me. Not<br/>that Parker is at this point yet, but I think he 
  knows there's a progression to<br/>his life that will not allow him to keep his 
  eye on you forever....and now<br/>Parker just needs to work with this puppy 
  (this can be a great project for the<br/>two of you together!) to show him the 
  ropes and how to be the kind of soul that<br/>will watch out for you once 
  Parker is unable to :) This is really a great thing<br/>for you and Parker to

                    <div class="plaintext-content">You have my fullest sympathy. I went through something similar with my 18-year old best catfriend a few years ago. I still hurt for her sometimes. At least you had a lot of good years with Parker and are having time to deal with his dying. This past July, my beloved Pat D. Bunny died suddenly with no warning. That was like having my heart put in a blender. I find it very hard to see rabbits, live or in pics without tearing up. Especially if its a Dutch Graylike he was. <br>
<br>
I believe that the spirits of our animal friends with be with us in heaven or it wouldn't be "heaven". That's not much comfort now but maybe in the future for both of us it will be.<br>
<br>
Parker sounds like he's more than a Great Dane, he's a Grand one. <br>

Those of you who know me, or have had the honor to meet Parker - you know our<br>
situation. Many of you have heard the Parker story, and how he came to be my<br>
dog. And most of you know he is dying of cancer. He should have been gone<br>
last May.<br>
<br>
Here is Parker' page.<br>

<br>
I guess you all know my son James is home for a visit from Iraq. He has 12 days<br>
left, then back to the war.<br>
<br>
My wife has been raising a batch of puppies. They are cute. All puppies are.<br>
Three are sold. Two are staying. I don't know why - I don't get involved in<br>
the dog showing stuff much. I have my dog, that is all I want or need. Except<br>
for the cancer taking him from me too soon. Then again, 10 years from now would<br>
be too soon.<br>
<br>
Here are the puppies. Notice the one with his tongue hanging out? His name is<br>
River. He is all white - except for the black you see in the photo. He sorta<br>
likes me. And strangely enough, Parker likes him too. Usually Parker doesn't<br>
like the impetuous pups! BTW - Daisy is the black pup. She is a real fireball<br>
already!<br>

When I got home today, a message was waiting for me in my E-mail. This lady has<br>
a gift. She also has Great Danes. She has known my wife for years, and knows<br>
all of our dogs. <br>
<br>
The message.<br>

<br>
Last night I had one of my dreams. River knew all along he was staying and going<br>
to be your next great dog! He is waiting for you.<br>
<br>
Parker knows he must leave but he wanted to make sure he saw James and that you<br>
accepted River first. He just wants to know that you will be ok without him?<br>
<br>
Parker's time is just about here but not until James is gone. <br>
<br>
My dream mainly revolved around River. He is one super extradinary dog....I<br>
didn't say puppy because he is an old soul. Mike there is something very special<br>
about you that brings these wonderful old souls to you. <br>
<br>
Now Daisy is another story. LOL Have fun with her Monika! She is a very young<br>
soul and going to be your real challenge, but you like a challenge dog. LOL She<br>
popped into my dream for a fleeting moment like a whirlwind.<br>
<br>
Mike, I hope this gives you some peace with the pain you are going to be facing<br>
in the near future. Rest assure River is there to help you through it. He was<br>
sent to you by your spirit guides.<br>
<br>
