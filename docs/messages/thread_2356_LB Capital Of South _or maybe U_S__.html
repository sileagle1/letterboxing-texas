                    <div class="plaintext-content">On the Big List, someone asked what was the LB Capital of the U.S., and <br>
the leading candidates were Manchester, CN (118 letterboxes) and <br>
Portland, OR (124 letterboxes).  I did some searches and found <br>
something quite surprising:  Houston appears to be the city with the <br>
most letterboxes with 183!  And that does not count Mystery boxes and <br>
ones using suburbs as city names.  Also, if you include all the cities <br>
comprising the Dallas Metroplex, it probably has the most anywhere.  I <br>
find this amazing considering just a few years ago the entire state did <br>
not have this many boxes.  TX Letterboxers, you should feel proud.<br>
