&gt;&gt;out of commission for awhile. Did he happen to<br/>
&gt;&gt;mention if he still lives in the area or not?<br/>
&gt;&gt;Just wondering how quickly he will return it, or if<br/>
&gt;&gt;he will.<br/>
<br/>
Sorry, but I don't know the answer to this one.  When<br/>
I left the box, it was still there and in good shape,<br/>
with a new logbook and the box there and everything. <br/>
But I do not know if Fugichip will leave it like that<br/>
or pull it or just put in a different book, or what. <br/>
Maybe they will let us know or update clues online or<br/>
something.  Have to wait and see.  Meanwhile, maybe<br/>
I'll ask, and get back to you. : )<br/>
