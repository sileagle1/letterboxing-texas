                    <div class="plaintext-content">There's a group or family of letterboxers called NLW that have been active around the Houston area for several months, sort of under the radar, and this past weekend they were in Burroughs Park in Tomball. They reported to me that most of the boxes that are in that park are wet, so if you have a box there you might be aware of it in case you're passing by.  They said they replaced a lot of baggies, but didn't have enough for all the wet boxes. They asked me to pass along that information.<br/>
