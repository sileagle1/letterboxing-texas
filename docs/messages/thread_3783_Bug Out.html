                    <div class="plaintext-content">How about creating a folder in the Files section of this List and <br>
posting a file within it containing your Bug-out list.  Others can <br>
add files or discuss.  That way it will be there for future use and <br>
can be added to or discussed as needed.<br>
<br>
Glad to hear Boots and others are safe.<br>
