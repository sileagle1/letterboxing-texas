<br/>
My trail name is b minor.  (I used to be Butterfly B of the busybeesfamily, but I outgrew that!)<br/>
<br/>
Now that I am in middle school and am a Cadette Girl Scout, I am starting to work on my Silver Award.  This project will take me most of 3 years to complete and will provide a community service and make me more of a leader in my community. For my project I have decided to create a Letterboxing Badge for Girl Scouts in my council and to permanently place boxes at one of our Girl Scout camps for them to find.<br/>
<br/>
My first step in my project will be to teach letterboxing to a group of Girl Scouts at our Spring Campout.  The theme of our campout is Alice in Wonderland and the campout will be the second weekend in April. For this project, I am hoping to plant some Alice in Wonderland themed boxes at the camp we will be staying at. I think it would be great for my fellow Girl Scouts to get to see letterboxes from different carvers, and so I'm asking my fellow Texas Letterboxers for help.<br/>
<br/>
Please consider contributing to my project and sending a complete letterbox with stamp and journal, ready to hide. I am looking for different sizes of boxes and different styles of carvings. All boxes should be Alice in Wonderland themed, please.<br/>
<br/>
I will return the boxes to you if you like, otherwise, I can plant them in my own community north of Austin. I will need to receive the boxes by March 26th, so that I can plant them at the camp and write/print clues.<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to help me with my Silver Award Project, please email me at b_minor@busybeesfamily.com. I will send you my mailing address.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you in advance for your support. I am excited to teach responsible letterboxing to Girl Scouts and improve our reputation in the letterboxing community.<br/>
<br/>
Yours in Girl Scouting, b minor<br/>
