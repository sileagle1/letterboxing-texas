Hi Barefoot Lucy,  Thanks for the reply and your digging..lol!  <br/>
Yes'mam, I had tried through AQ, I make sure to update the planters<br/>
every time we find and don't find boxes.  I will try on LBNA as well and<br/>
I will take your advice and give them a while to reply.  I wouldnt mind<br/>
"adopting"  but that is a wait and see for the next 9 months.   I was<br/>
really worried that someone would find the box after us and would think<br/>
that we had stolen the log book even though I left a note in the box.<br/>

<p>Barefoot Lucy, Thank you, I feel a less worried about taking it now  and saving what I could...hoping to eventually return it to the planter.  I have rally enjoyed looking a some of the stamps that are still legible.<br/>
<br/>
Yes, we're signed up for the Tomato Fest Challenge but I think it may be a little over our "newbie" heads ...lol.  I was planning on writing you for some of those resources you mentioned... We would like to meet some fellow letterboxers!<br/>
