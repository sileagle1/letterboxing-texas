<div>I think giving or 
getting hints all depends on the planter and the person looking for the 
box.  I love the tricky boxes (even when I lose sleep over them) and as 
many of you know one box in particular of Dewberry's nearly drove me off the 
deep end.  But there is nothing to compare to the feeling of finally 
"seeing" the answer to the puzzle.  Some people just want to find the 
stamp, and that is fine.  Some people HAVE to solve the puzzle, and that is 
fine too.  I know for me that had someone given me the solution to a puzzle 
that was making me crazy I wouldn't love looking at the stamp nearly as much as 
I do knowing I found it on my own.  Of course, I quit teaching almost 10 
years ago, and have since spent my time playing legos and play dough, so 
anything remotely challenging is a welcome change.</div>
<div>  Dewberry said 
once that part of solving a puzzle sometimes is just letting it "percolate" in 
your brain for awhile, good advice from the unchallenged Texas master of puzzles 
and all things tricky.  Hang in there Batty B, you'll get it!

<div>What you describe is exactly how my family plays games.  There is no honor in cheating, and there is no pleasure in a trophy won without a battle.  I find it very difficult to understand folks who are in it only for the prize and not for the process too.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I started working on Scarlet Pimpernel on New Year's Eve because another boxer asked me if I had figured it out.  I worked on it sometimes alone, sometimes in tandem with someone else, and sometimes I kept it hidden under paperwork at work so I could take it out and study it throughout the work day.  About three weeks ago I solved it (admittedly, with hints from Ruby Tuesday and after working together on some of it with another boxer - with the blessing of RT, the placer).  Let me tell you - I felt GOOD about it!  Now all I have to do is make the drive and claim the prize.  When I get that stamp, I'm gonna take my time inking it and it's going to take a page in my logbook all by itself.  Yep.  And once I claim that stamp, I'm going to turn my head south for one of Dewberry's infamous puzzles!  At the rate I finished SP, I figure I should solve that one in time for a Christmas visit to Houston...
