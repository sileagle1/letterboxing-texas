BTW, if you have kids with you it is worth them doing the Junior Ranger scavenger hunt.  They will learn a lot about the Fort while having fun.  My kids did it many years ago and still have their badges.  As you can tell I really like this area, exploring the rugged landscape by day and viewing the heavens under the darkest skies in TX at night.  I guess I need to plan another trip!<br>
