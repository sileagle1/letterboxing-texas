LBNA, so I emailed him about it.  I never got a reply, so I asked <br>
the Rocky Mt. Group (where he lives now) about it and got this reply <br>
from Eoghan himself.  Not sure when the clues will be available <br>
again, but at least the boxes have not been pulled.  Unfortunately, <br>
I can't even find the clues using the Wayback Machine, so we will <br>
just have to wait until he reposts.<br>

Most are still in place. Some are going to WOM clues. Others will<br>
eventually show up on a new website. Lost Pines, Mayfield Park,<br>
O-Knots are definitely still in place, just on sabbatical...<br>

(Sorry for not responding earlier, haven't been doing much<br>
letterboxing stuff for awhile.)<br>
