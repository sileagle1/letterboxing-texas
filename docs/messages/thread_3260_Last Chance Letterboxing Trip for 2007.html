                    <div class="plaintext-content">This morning Navigator and I set out for a "last chance" trip for the <br/>
year.  After replacing One Stoplight Town (pulled due to landscaping) <br/>
and Bear With Me (pulled due to excess moisture)we trekked to <br/>
Stockale to plant a new box "The Watermelon Patch".  This box is so <br/>
new the clues aren't even posted yet.  <br/>
<br/>
Then the real fun began when we made it to Yorktown and were first <br/>
finders of "Setting Sun in Woods Cemetery".  This is an excellent box <br/>
by a new placer, and I've invited her to join us here and introduce <br/>
herself. <br/>
<br/>
Next we headed the truck to Goliad to find Blue Butterfly's Mission <br/>
Espiritu Santo.  Despite what appear to be very clear, <br/>
straightforward clues, we didn't find it.  I hope it's still there <br/>
and we just missed it.  I can imagine what a beautiful stamp it would <br/>
be.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's time to post the clues for the box in Stockdale, then on <br/>
to my New Year's celebration.  I'm going to drink a couple of wine <br/>
coolers and let the TV do all the driving.  <br/>
<br/>
Happy New Year to everyone here!<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I have to say the box is missing. Only one person found it, which <br/>
I did not expect a lot of finders way down in Goliad. I have no idea <br/>
when we will be able to get back there. If anyone is planning a trip, <br/>
and would like to help me out, I will have PSGuru carve it again. It <br/>
was one of the best he has done in my opinion! We loved the park and <br/>
the history there and the memories of planting that box will be forever <br/>
sealed in my heart. Thanks Corazon for the update on the box.<br/>
