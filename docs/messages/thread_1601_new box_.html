</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I wonder though - it looked to me like the spring was pretty dry?  I hope it hasn't actually dried up.  How did it look Lucy?  I know most of the time when I pass there are folks there filling jugs for their household water and there was not a soul there any of the six times I went by, of course one of them was very late.  That would be a sad thing - that spring has been wet for as many years as I can remember.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have to say - Lucy's clues look much more lucid than did the clues for the previous box there.  Those clues were badly written from the very beginning and when I went for that box I wound up hunting behind every pine tree til I found the box.  I'm betting I could walk right to hers!

<div>I love that place ever since finding the original box there - one of those 
amazing places you'd never ever know about unless you were looking for it, with 
clues!  After the first box went missing, I made a second trip there just 
in case and to show the spring to my sister, but the box was indeed sadly gone, 
but the water from the rocks were still flowing freely and people stopping to 
fill water jugs.  Thanks for putting a new box there, Lucy Locket, so more 
explorers can discover this place (could this have been those famous Fountains 
of Youth waters that were supposed to be somewhere in Florida?  Based on 
the general age and description of some of the people we noticed there when we 
stopped, apparently not. But still, water from the rocks!  Cool!)
