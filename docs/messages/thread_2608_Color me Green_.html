two to be located there, so you can color Grimes County Green!  The <br>
boxes are "Sarah's Flag" by Lone Star Quilter and my "Fanthorp Inn". <br>
Hey, y'all need to visit Fanthorp Inn in Anderson.  It's an old <br>
stagecoach inn that has been restored to the period of 1850 and they <br>
have a beautiful stagecoach pulled by a pair of white Perheron draft <br>
horses named Willie and Waylon, who live at Barrington Farm at <br>
Washington-on-the-Brazos when they're not being used.  Check it out.  <br>
Speaking of Washington-on-the-Brazos, we placed two boxes there <br>
today.  LSQ's box is called "The Dodson Flag" and mine is "The Last <br>
President".  We've been sort of into early Texas history lately.  Next <br>
friday is March 2, you know.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, SE, that'll make the Southeast Region the first region in <br>
Texas to be all covered.  As you know, I have a box ready for Waller <br>
County as well, and went over there Saturday to find a place for it, <br>
without luck, so I probably won't get back down that way for a <br>
while.  We do have a couple planned for Madison County and I have <br>
one ready for Milam County, it's just a matter of getting there and <br>
finding a spot.<br>
