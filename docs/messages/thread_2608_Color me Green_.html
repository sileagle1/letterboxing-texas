boxes are "Sarah's Flag" by Lone Star Quilter and my "Fanthorp Inn". <br/>
Hey, y'all need to visit Fanthorp Inn in Anderson.  It's an old <br/>
stagecoach inn that has been restored to the period of 1850 and they <br/>
have a beautiful stagecoach pulled by a pair of white Perheron draft <br/>
horses named Willie and Waylon, who live at Barrington Farm at <br/>
Washington-on-the-Brazos when they're not being used.  Check it out.  <br/>
Speaking of Washington-on-the-Brazos, we placed two boxes there <br/>
today.  LSQ's box is called "The Dodson Flag" and mine is "The Last <br/>
President".  We've been sort of into early Texas history lately.  Next <br/>
friday is March 2, you know.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks, SE, that'll make the Southeast Region the first region in <br/>
Texas to be all covered.  As you know, I have a box ready for Waller <br/>
County as well, and went over there Saturday to find a place for it, <br/>
without luck, so I probably won't get back down that way for a <br/>
while.  We do have a couple planned for Madison County and I have <br/>
one ready for Milam County, it's just a matter of getting there and <br/>
finding a spot.<br/>
