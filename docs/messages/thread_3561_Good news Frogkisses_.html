<p>     Your Tree Climber is safe and sound! Just got home from Longview where I checked on both boxes. They are safe and  in good shape. There was a LOT of water and trees are down everywhere! I also had a chance to find Perky P's Build a Doll Series. Very nicely done. I loved the walk and the boxes were really nice. Mother of Five, your girls would love this series. Thanks to all who have planted boxes in Longview and vicinity! </p>
