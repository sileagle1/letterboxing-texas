                    <div class="plaintext-content">Well, I thought I was pretty slick yesterday when I went out to find <br>
letterboxes in Alto, Weches, Brushy Creek, and Palestine.  I was so <br>
careful to check and double check the clues on AQ.  While logging my <br>
finds together on AQ and Letterboxing.org today I found out that I <br>
missed 7 other letterboxes that are listed on Letterboxing.org. Not <br>
only did I miss these 7 letterboxes but 2 of them are planted in the <br>
same park I was searching for JBK's August Series AND 1 of the <br>
letterboxes is about 2-3 feet away from where I found JBK's box. UGH!!!<br>
<br>
Frogkisses and Texas Pokey have told me numerous times that I also need <br>
to check on Letterboxing.org as well. I think I've learned my lesson.<br>
<br>
Now I get to make another trip to Weches and maybe this time I'll be <br>
able to find Brushy Creek as it eluded me yesterday.<br>

<div> </div>
<div>To compound the problem, it isn't as easy as to say all the boxes on AQ are also on LBNA, because they aren't!  There are a few folks who only list on one or the other.  I tend to be one of those - I will always list my boxes on LBNA, but I'll list them on AQ if I get around to it.  </div>
