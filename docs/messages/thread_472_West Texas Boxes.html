Hello everyone,<br>
I was in El Paso the week before Thanksgiving. Wanted to look for <br>
the oldest Texas boxes out there from 2000. One in Franklin <br>
Mountains and 2 in Hueco Tanks. As luck would have it I didn't get <br>
to look for any of them. The weather did not co-operate at all. The <br>
2 days I had available to letterbox had winds of 30 miles per hour <br>
and heavy rain and cold temperatures. <br>
However, I did get to stop at Davis Mountain State Park on the way <br>
home and find 2 boxes and plant one of my own. Clues will be posted <br>
soon for the one I planted. <br>
I went to El Paso to visit my brother who is being sent to Iraq. <br>
Please pray for our military men and women. <br>
I will be going to Georgia on the 10th of Dec. Looking forward to <br>
finding some boxes there.<br>
<br>
DrooP<br>
