<div> </div>
<div>Any of you who has been to find my box there can probably testify to the garbage that collects and the fact that the stone plaque has been knocked over by vandals.  Because it is rumored to be haunted and because it is so remote, kids go there to party on the weekends and who knows what else may go on there.   The Killough family goes there once every other year and does a lot of maintenance and care, but that isn't enough.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>When I visit that box, I always carry a trash bag with me and pick up trash and take it away with me, and I guess I should note that in my clues to suggest others do the same.  ANYWAY, the news media has finally, finally, started devoting air time to the deplorable condition of the site and the county is starting to "do something".  I'm really glad they are doing that, but I'm a little worried about my box.  For one thing, I heard earlier this week that they are closing the road - whatever that means since people live out that road.  They are also doing extensive clean up, which may mean my box is in jeopardy.  I'll be checking on it this weekend hopefully, and hopefully it isn't too late to get to it.  Very likely I will be pulling the box until the hoopla is over.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>This is a neat site to visit and has a poignant air about it.  It's one of those historic sites that carries the weight of its events with it.  Many, many school children visit here to learn a bit of local history.  I had the privilege last summer of telling the story to a family from Houston who was doing a history tour - one site each weekend.  They happened out there as I was leaving after checking my box and enjoyed listening to the story as I've heard it for many years.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I doubt they will leave it closed forever, but hopefully it won't be closed for long.  In the meantime, if you decide to try to go out there, realize it may not be accessible, my box may not be there, and someone may approach you asking you what you are doing.

<div>Wouldn't it be nice if folks would respect places like this instead of abusing them?</div>

<div>Viewfinder and I located this letterbox in March when we were in the area for the gathering. It is a wonderful location, but like you said, it was heavily littered and was an obvious site of "youthful parties". I am glad to hear that the county has taken an interest in cleaning it up, but I agree... your box may be in jeopardy if they get too aggressive! I hope the site is accessible when you get there. Good luck; it's a great box!</div>
