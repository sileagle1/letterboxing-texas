Jeff has worked hard getting coordinates for all my boxes<br/>
along with Baby Bear's and his own to put in this atlas<br/>
and I have been pushing him to get this finished ever<br/>
since he suggested it to me.  I think it is a great idea<br/>
to visually see GENERAL locations of letterboxes (the <br/>
coordinates are not exact so they don't give away the<br/>
location of the letterbox using GPS) and I would love to see<br/>
this feature available in other states.  Unfortunately<br/>
it requires someone with programming skills and time<br/>
to compute coordinates of all boxes desired.  The other<br/>
issue is approval of the owners of the boxes.  After the<br/>
uproar over putting status of letterboxes in a database, I<br/>
would bet many people would object to this atlas.  That is<br/>
why Jeff is only putting boxes in that have given approval.<br/>
Please give it a try, and if you like it, give your approval<br/>
to have your boxes added.  Keeping it evergreen as new boxes<br/>
are placed will be tough for Jeff, but I plan to help if I can.<br/>
For you non-Texan programmers, I hope you bring it to your <br/>
state, too.  Thanks Jeff!<br/>

&gt; All,<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Texas Letterbox Atlas is a website for making and<br/>
&gt; viewing maps showing the general locations of<br/>
&gt; letterboxes in Texas.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I developed this out of the desire to be able to see<br/>
&gt; the relative closeness of various letterboxes so I<br/>
&gt; could more effectively plan letterboxing excursions. I<br/>
&gt; hope that you find it useful also. <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The only letterboxes that will be displayed are those<br/>
&gt; for which I have received approval from the<br/>
&gt; placer/maintainer or the letterbox is currently in the<br/>
&gt; letterbox basement (unclaimed).<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; *****************************************************<br/>
&gt; If you would like your letterboxes to be listed, send<br/>
&gt; a note. Just let me know if it is for all boxes or<br/>
&gt; just specific boxes.<br/>
&gt; *****************************************************<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Mystery boxes will be listed but will be placed in the<br/>
&gt; center of the city or county or if a complete unknown<br/>
&gt; will displayed over the waters of the Gulf.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; The Texas Letterbox Atlas currently has 138<br/>
&gt; letterboxes which include the Texas letterboxes for<br/>
&gt; Baby Bear, Silver Eagle, and Birds of a Feather<br/>
&gt; Family.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Texas LB Atlas supports:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - associating web pages with a letterbox. Where<br/>
&gt; possible, each letterbox has a link to it's clue page.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - searching for letterboxes containing a word or<br/>
&gt; phrase<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - pre-defined views - Choose from US, Texas, or a<br/>
&gt; specific Texas county.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - zooming and panning in or out on a map <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - mapping a GPS point (Note: Texas LB Atlas uses a<br/>
&gt; mapping engine that uses the "North American Datum<br/>
&gt; 1927" (NAD-27) system with decimal degrees and not<br/>
&gt; Degrees:Minutes:Seconds.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - requests for a new feature to be added. Anyone can<br/>
&gt; request a new feature be added by mapping the location<br/>
&gt; of the feature and then clicking on the "Add a New<br/>
&gt; Feature!" link<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - distinguishing between unclaimed, mystery,<br/>
&gt; unpublished, and normal letterboxes<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - grouping of features that are in close proximity<br/>
&gt; (varies based upon the scale of the map).  Zoom in to<br/>
&gt; see what is in the group.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; - quickly locating new features added within the last<br/>
&gt; 4 weeks by displaying a pin of a different color.<br/>
