Jeff has worked hard getting coordinates for all my boxes<br>
along with Baby Bear's and his own to put in this atlas<br>
and I have been pushing him to get this finished ever<br>
since he suggested it to me.  I think it is a great idea<br>
to visually see GENERAL locations of letterboxes (the <br>
coordinates are not exact so they don't give away the<br>
location of the letterbox using GPS) and I would love to see<br>
this feature available in other states.  Unfortunately<br>
it requires someone with programming skills and time<br>
to compute coordinates of all boxes desired.  The other<br>
issue is approval of the owners of the boxes.  After the<br>
uproar over putting status of letterboxes in a database, I<br>
would bet many people would object to this atlas.  That is<br>
why Jeff is only putting boxes in that have given approval.<br>
Please give it a try, and if you like it, give your approval<br>
to have your boxes added.  Keeping it evergreen as new boxes<br>
are placed will be tough for Jeff, but I plan to help if I can.<br>
For you non-Texan programmers, I hope you bring it to your <br>
state, too.  Thanks Jeff!<br>
