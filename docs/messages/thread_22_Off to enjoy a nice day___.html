<br/>
I was thrilled to see that others have been<br/>
letterboxing through our area!  YIPPEE!!!<br/>
<br/>
I guess I should've written down who had been there,<br/>
but I didn't.  I did take down the only email address<br/>
listed, for Mama Huey, and I'm going to email her to<br/>
tell her about this list and about the gathering.  The<br/>
chances are fairly good that she's from Texas.<br/>
<br/>
It actually looked like there had been three groups<br/>
through, the most recent in November.  It was one very<br/>
sweet little girl's 8th box to be found, the first for<br/>
one couple.  It was hidden very well - we walked right<br/>
up to it, and if I hadn't seen several of yours hidden<br/>
by now, I would've sworn there was no way there was a<br/>
box where your clues led us.  The couple, who was the<br/>
last to visit, did a very nice job of rehiding.<br/>
<br/>
As it turned out, what was supposed to be a sunny day<br/>
in the 60's turned out to be a cloudy day in the 40's.<br/>
 Our scouts didn't turn out, so we skipped Jim Hogg<br/>
and went on to Texas State RR.  We were just going to<br/>
roam a bit (although it isn't a real big park, so we<br/>
weren't going to roam much!), find your box and leave.<br/>
 WELL, it was Kid's Fish For Trout day there at the<br/>
park, so it was overrun with people.  We had to be<br/>
supersneaks to get to the box!  After we saw all the<br/>
stamps in it, I really wanted to run on over to Hogg<br/>
and see if there were more stamps there too, but we<br/>
ran out of time.  Since the RR is somewhat of a<br/>
tourist attraction (as much as we have in Cherokee<br/>
County - LOL), I wonder if it has more stamps because<br/>
of that, or if there are legitimately more people<br/>
making the rounds.  I really wish we could've gotten<br/>
over to Hogg to get an idea of the answer.  It isn't<br/>
that far from me, and I have to run down there soon<br/>
and talk to the ranger about a conservation project<br/>
for our scouts, so I'll check it when I go and let you<br/>
know.<br/>

&gt; I just scanned my and my kids' stamps and I put the<br/>
&gt; file in the files section of the yahoo group:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt;<br/>
http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterboxingtexas/files/<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I also write a saying with mine - "It's not about<br/>
&gt; footwear.  It's about philosophy" and sign it.  I<br/>
&gt; can't say this is the same stamp I'll be using even<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; year from now, but at the moment I like it pretty<br/>
&gt; well.  My daughter's stamp signifies her two great<br/>
&gt; loves - drill team and soccer.  My son's stamp was<br/>
&gt; drawn by him and carved by me - he's a wolf scout<br/>
&gt; (2nd<br/>
&gt; grader).  I was sorely tempted to clean it up, but I<br/>
&gt; had to remind myself that I wasn't designing his<br/>
&gt; stamp, but carving it so he could use his own<br/>
&gt; design. <br/>
&gt; I really like it!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We draw ours to paper and when we are happy with<br/>
&gt; them,<br/>
&gt; we trace over them with a very soft (almost<br/>
&gt; charcoal)<br/>
&gt; art pencil.  I then turn the design over to the<br/>
&gt; carving material and rub.  I then usually have to<br/>
&gt; touch it up with the pencil.  Doing this keeps us<br/>
&gt; from<br/>
&gt; having to draw words backward.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I keep the final drawings in a baggie and filed flat<br/>
&gt; so that if we ever have to carve them again, we can.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I'll delete my file off in a couple days so I'm not<br/>
&gt; taking up file space for the group, but I thought<br/>
&gt; that<br/>
&gt; since you asked about design, you might like to see<br/>
&gt; them.<br/>

&gt; &gt; Normally it would be better if you could find at<br/>
&gt; &gt; least one<br/>
&gt; &gt; box before you plant, but if none are close, don't<br/>
&gt; &gt; let that<br/>
&gt; &gt; stop you.  Either way, you will need to have a<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp first.  This can be store-bought for now but<br/>
&gt; &gt; you will<br/>
&gt; &gt; probably want to carve one eventually.  I started<br/>
&gt; &gt; with a<br/>
&gt; &gt; store-bought eagle until I got better at carving,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then <br/>
&gt; &gt; made my own.  Believe me, if I can carve a stamp,<br/>
&gt; &gt; anyone<br/>
&gt; &gt; can.  I have no artistic talent, though I can be<br/>
&gt; &gt; creative<br/>
&gt; &gt; as far as ideas for letterboxes go.  If only I<br/>
&gt; could<br/>
&gt; &gt; carve<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamps as well as the ones I visualize!  My<br/>
&gt; personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp<br/>
&gt; &gt; contains no words, but I have carved stamps with<br/>
&gt; &gt; letters<br/>
&gt; &gt; and words on them.  The easiest method is to carve<br/>
&gt; &gt; away<br/>
&gt; &gt; the letters so they end up white on the ink<br/>
&gt; &gt; background,<br/>
&gt; &gt; as opposed to carving away the area around the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letters<br/>
&gt; &gt; so they end up being inked.  However, you must<br/>
&gt; &gt; remember to<br/>
&gt; &gt; reverse the letters so they come out right when<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamped.<br/>
&gt; &gt; The easiest way to do this I have found is to<br/>
&gt; write<br/>
&gt; &gt; the<br/>
&gt; &gt; letters on the image I want to carve with a<br/>
&gt; pencil,<br/>
&gt; &gt; then <br/>
&gt; &gt; transferring it to the stamp medium by rubbing the<br/>
&gt; &gt; back <br/>
&gt; &gt; of it with something hard.  The letters are then<br/>
&gt; &gt; reversed.<br/>
&gt; &gt; As far as deciding on what image to carve, I<br/>
&gt; usually<br/>
&gt; &gt; think<br/>
&gt; &gt; of a place I want to hide a box, then try to<br/>
&gt; decide<br/>
&gt; &gt; what<br/>
&gt; &gt; image would make sense to be found there. <br/>
&gt; Examples<br/>
&gt; &gt; include<br/>
&gt; &gt; my Lost Loblolly in Bastrop and Steamboat Sam in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Huntsville.<br/>
&gt; &gt; Sometimes I think of a stamp I want to carve and<br/>
&gt; &gt; then find<br/>
&gt; &gt; the right place to put it.  Examples include my<br/>
&gt; &gt; Lewis &amp; Clark<br/>
&gt; &gt; series of stamps placed along their trail and Six<br/>
&gt; &gt; Flags Over<br/>
&gt; &gt; Texas, placed at appropriate places in Texas.  Or,<br/>
&gt; &gt; you can just<br/>
&gt; &gt; carve anything you want and place it anywhere you<br/>
&gt; &gt; want.  I<br/>
&gt; &gt; would start out carving more simple things without<br/>
&gt; a<br/>
&gt; &gt; lot of<br/>
&gt; &gt; detail (e.g. a heart for Valentines Day), then as<br/>
&gt; &gt; you get <br/>
&gt; &gt; better you can get more detailed and creative<br/>
&gt; (e.g.<br/>
&gt; &gt; a cupid<br/>
&gt; &gt; shooting an arrow).  Though bigger images are<br/>
&gt; &gt; usually easier<br/>
&gt; &gt; to carve, I wouldn't go much larger than 3" x 4"<br/>
&gt; &gt; since some<br/>
&gt; &gt; logbooks can't handle stamps bigger than that.  My<br/>
&gt; &gt; personal<br/>
&gt; &gt; stamp is about 2" x 2", and most of the stamps I<br/>
&gt; &gt; carve now<br/>
&gt; &gt; are for microboxes so they are really small (and<br/>
&gt; &gt; challenging).<br/>
&gt; &gt; You can see an example of one of my stamps at:<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; http://www.geocities.com/sileagle1/CA/SDsails/Stamp/<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It was placed in California but the box went<br/>
&gt; missing<br/>
&gt; &gt; so I<br/>
&gt; &gt; turned it into an "online" box.  If you visit the<br/>
&gt; &gt; place<br/>
&gt; &gt; where the box was hidden, you can download my<br/>
&gt; image,<br/>
&gt; &gt; print<br/>
&gt; &gt; it and paste into your logbook.  You can also<br/>
&gt; write<br/>
&gt; &gt; an entry<br/>
&gt; &gt; into my online logbook.  I figure it is better<br/>
&gt; than<br/>
&gt; &gt; just<br/>
&gt; &gt; retiring the box.  This stamp is nothing great so<br/>
&gt; it<br/>
&gt; &gt; should<br/>
&gt; &gt; give you confidence!  Hope this helps and will<br/>
&gt; look<br/>
&gt; &gt; forward to <br/>
&gt; &gt; finding your boxes in the future.<br/>
