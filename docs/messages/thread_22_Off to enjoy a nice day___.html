<br>
I was thrilled to see that others have been<br>
letterboxing through our area!  YIPPEE!!!<br>
<br>
I guess I should've written down who had been there,<br>
but I didn't.  I did take down the only email address<br>
listed, for Mama Huey, and I'm going to email her to<br>
tell her about this list and about the gathering.  The<br>
chances are fairly good that she's from Texas.<br>
<br>
It actually looked like there had been three groups<br>
through, the most recent in November.  It was one very<br>
sweet little girl's 8th box to be found, the first for<br>
one couple.  It was hidden very well - we walked right<br>
up to it, and if I hadn't seen several of yours hidden<br>
by now, I would've sworn there was no way there was a<br>
box where your clues led us.  The couple, who was the<br>
last to visit, did a very nice job of rehiding.<br>
<br>
As it turned out, what was supposed to be a sunny day<br>
in the 60's turned out to be a cloudy day in the 40's.<br>
 Our scouts didn't turn out, so we skipped Jim Hogg<br>
and went on to Texas State RR.  We were just going to<br>
roam a bit (although it isn't a real big park, so we<br>
weren't going to roam much!), find your box and leave.<br>
 WELL, it was Kid's Fish For Trout day there at the<br>
park, so it was overrun with people.  We had to be<br>
supersneaks to get to the box!  After we saw all the<br>
stamps in it, I really wanted to run on over to Hogg<br>
and see if there were more stamps there too, but we<br>
ran out of time.  Since the RR is somewhat of a<br>
tourist attraction (as much as we have in Cherokee<br>
County - LOL), I wonder if it has more stamps because<br>
of that, or if there are legitimately more people<br>
making the rounds.  I really wish we could've gotten<br>
over to Hogg to get an idea of the answer.  It isn't<br>
that far from me, and I have to run down there soon<br>
and talk to the ranger about a conservation project<br>
for our scouts, so I'll check it when I go and let you<br>
know.<br>
