I hope to post clues and a trip report in the next few days, but in <br/>
summary:  we placed boxes in all 8 remaining virgin counties in South <br/>
Region, the 1 remaining virgin county (Kinney) in Central Region, and <br/>
even managed to put one in virgin Schleicher county of West Region.  We <br/>
also placed several other boxes in other counties along the way, for a <br/>
total of over 40 boxes between us.  We had fun but are exhausted!<br/>
<br/>
It looks like I missed some fireworks on the Big List while I was <br/>
gone.  I should know better than to post a comment right before leaving <br/>
on a trip.  Glad it did not last too long, and I really appreciate all <br/>
the nice comments and support I received from my letterboxing friends.  <br/>
Actually letterboxing is way more fun than debating it!<br/>

Oh, and welcome home James!<br/>

by border patrol, or the guy that kept following us around Fort <br/>
Duncan.  I have never been in so many cemeteries in my life, or felt <br/>
out of place in my own state, until this trip.   Dios Mios!!   Fort <br/>
Clark Springs was the high point of the trip, and I will return there <br/>
later this year to enjoy more time running around the old fort.  We <br/>
will have to share some stories at the Event.....I think the Larado <br/>
Community College Police are still looking for the 2 strange men <br/>
lurking in the trees near the day care center............<br/>
