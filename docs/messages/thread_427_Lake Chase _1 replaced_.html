Hey all,<br/>
I finally got around to recarving and replacing Lake Chase #1.  A <br/>
six year old seems to have found the original and it was never put <br/>
back.  In a way, even though my box was taken, it is refreshing to <br/>
think of little eyes and minds being so curious and alert as to find <br/>
a box without deliberately looking for it.  <br/>
Have Fun!<br/>

Thankfully, the mom was able to provide guidance and<br/>
