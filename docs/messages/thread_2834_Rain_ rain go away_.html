<div>On a positive note, I've been enjoying studying up on Austin area boxes.  Doubt I'll get that way until the Spring, but I'm really looking forward to a possible gathering at McKinney Falls!<br clear="all"/>

<div>It is funny that you sent this e-mail because I am checking three 
different weather forecasts online to see what the weather is currently like in 
Navasota, Brenham and then for Austin later today. Today is Austin's Keep Austin 
Weird Music Festival and 5K run.  I am driving out there in a little while 
so that I can take part of the 5K with some of my running friends.  We are 
all going as Krispy Kreme donuts.  Having never run with a 30" lime green 
inner tube around my waist ( I am going to be a Frozen Margarita with Salt 
Krispy Kreme), this may be really interesting!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>As for checking out the weather in Brenham and Navasota, my husband decided 
to get in a long bike ride today (I am going to pick him up somewhere along 290 
on my way out to Austin) and left the house around 6:00 this morning.  He 
just called me from Navasota asking for a weather update and said he is about to 
get poured on!  So I guess in that sense, letterboxers and cyclists 
have something in common- yucky weather is not always good!!  </div>

When I finally crawled out of bed, I tried to take the dog for a walk, he saw the rain pouring down and (in his doggy voice) said, "I aint goin' out there, are you crazy? You better put down one of those dry plastic backed thingies for me to pee on." He's as spoiled as the girls are.</div> <div> </div> <div>So, we cancelled our boxin' trip today and I spent the day half listening to the Disney channel.
