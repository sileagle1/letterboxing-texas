Ever plant a box that you knew was doomed before you even walked <br/>
away?  We planted one today inside the zoo (Batty for the Zoo).  The <br/>
stamp was carved by my 8 year old who happens to be a bat fanatic.  I <br/>

I wasn't able to plant it exactly where I wanted to,<br/>

<div>We planted a new box today, "Austin ain't got 
nothin' on us now!" in downtown Houston.  No offense, all you Austinites 
out there, I think Austin is a perfectly wonderful place.  But in case you 
Houstonians haven't heard, we have our own colony of Mexican Freetail bats 
living in downtown Houston, and watching them emerge is a pretty spectacular 
sight!  Here is a link if you would like to read more about them <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/3460622.html">http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/3460622.html</a>.  
We have seen them before, and went again tonight, even in this windy, cold 
weather there were lots of bats to be seen!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the way, Silver Eagle, just reading everything 
you did in such a short amount of time made me tired!  Glad to hear you had 
such a great trip.  When I first came to Texas I was obsessed with seeing a 
javelina, and Choke Canyon was the first place I ever saw one, they walked right 
through our campsite!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Anyway, have fun!  -Mother of
