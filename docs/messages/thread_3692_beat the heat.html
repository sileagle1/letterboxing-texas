                    <html><body><div>Well I was able to beat the heat and find 2 boxes this morning before 10 AM.  I had to go to a meeting in Menard, so I stopped off and found "The Lost Jim Bowie.." and then afterwards headed for Eden and found the "Cow Patty Bingo" box.  It made my day so much more fun, and thankfully due to the tropical depression left over the skies were cloudy and only 79 degrees!  It looked like according to the logs on both of these boxes there were several of us the past few days circling by them.  Thanks for the fun.</div>
