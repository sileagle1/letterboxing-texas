                    <div class="plaintext-content">I went over to Double Lake yesterday and walked around the lake to <br>
check on letterboxes.  There are quite a few trees down, but the <br>
lakeshore trail has been cleared and the boxes near the lake are all <br>
okay.  I didn't venture out on the Lone Star Trail, but I intend to do <br>
that soon.  The trail is ankle deep in leaves, sticks, branches and <br>
pine cones and no clearing has been done yet.  I'll update in a few <br>
days.  On a different subject, my letterbox in Fredericksburg <br>
called "Nimitz" has apparently been lost due the construction of a new <br>
George Washington/Bush Building which resulted in the demolition of the <br>
fence next to which the box was hidden and the erection of a new chain-<br>
link construction fence.  This occurred between Sept. 28, when AnnaBee <br>
found the box and October 2, when patroln went to find it.  Thanks to <br>
patroln (California letterboxer) for letting me know.  Has anyone been <br>
to Mercer Arboretum since Hurricane Ike?<br>
