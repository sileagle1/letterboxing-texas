                    <div class="plaintext-content">As I was driving through downtown Coldspring this afternoon, which doesn't take long, I decided to detour through Old Town to check on a couple of letterboxes, The Old Jail and Courthouse Steps, Quilt Block Series, since neither have been reported found in well over a year.  Surprisingly, they were both there and both in excellent condition.  However, the huge sycamore tree where The Old Jail box was hiding had some serious damage.  Basically the entire top half of the tree had broken off and fallen down around the tree, probably courtesy of Ike.  Vines have grown all over the downed branches, making it very difficult to get to the base of the tree.  I made it to the box and retrieved it, but decided that I would not want anyone else to go through that (especially for this stamp), so I am retiring the box.  The stamp was one of my first attempts, about 3 1/2 years ago, and it is very crude.  The only reason I haven't pulled the box before is because it serves as a reminder to me or how far I have come as a carver! By the way, the box is a Lock and Lock box and, after washing it, it's still as good as new, so I can use it for another letterbox.  In contrast, I found a box this week that hasn't been out as long, one of those Glad boxes, and the bottom was cracked and brittle.  The bags saved the logbook, but I didn't have a new box with me, so I'm going back this week to replace the box since the planter lives too far away to do it in a timely manner and the box is too good to leave exposed.  <br>

Repairing boxes<br>
<br>
Mr. Adams Trails and Mrs. Adams Trails went out to check on and repair our<br>
boxes. I am reporting that some are missing and some have been repaired and some<br>
I have taken home to repair as they could not be repaired on the trail.<br>
<br>
Blue Daisy has been removed until I carve another stamp. I guess someone like it<br>
so much they took it. I am so proud of my carving that they would like it that<br>
much. It was no where around.<br>
<br>
Lions, Tigers and Frogs was out of place uncovered and the top was loose. Water<br>
was inside the box and the log book was not in its plastic bag and soaked beyond<br>
repair. Stamp was OK. We changed boxes with a newer lid and a new logbook in a<br>
new plastic bag. We put the stamp in its own plastic bag and replaced it in the<br>
proper place and recovered well.<br>
<br>
Swimming up stream is still there and in good shape.<br>
<br>
The Great Outdoors is there and safe now that I put it in a jar. The coon can't<br>
chew into it.<br>
<br>
An Apple for the teacher is still there and wanting someone to find it please.<br>
We did change the box as the other one was damaged by the sun.<br>
<br>
The Drifter is OK and so is Zach's box. They are in the same cemetery.<br>
<br>
The Eyes of Texas is gone and will not be replaced.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The other day I had a report from The Globetrotters that my box in Seymour, "Goodbye, Old Paint" had the lid on upside-down!  I didn't know you could do that to a Lock and Lock box until I tried it, but it can be done.  What The Globetrotters, from MacClesfield, UK, were doing in Seymour, Texas, I don't know, but I'm grateful to them for fixing the lid and placing the box back in its nest.  I'm glad we help each other.  Barefoot Lucy, Maydelle Queen Bee and JB Kokopelli are going out of their way this weekend to check on a couple of our boxes that have been reported missing.  Thanks, ladies.  If I can ever help by checking on or repairing a box for anyone, I'd be glad to do it.<br>
