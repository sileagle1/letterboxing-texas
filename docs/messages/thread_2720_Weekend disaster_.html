Howdy.<br/>
<br/>
	Went to a dog show in Casa Grande AZ this weekend.<br/>
<br/>
	Trip started out at 0730 Friday morning.  Horrible headwind most of<br/>
the way.  That big Ford E-350 doesn't get good fuel mileage to begin with.<br/>
Played ham radio on the road while the wife drove.  Set the GPS to get us to<br/>
Tucson, then split off the road at Oracle AZ to go after the first<br/>
letterbox, the Tom Mix microbox near Florence AZ.  Nice stop, nice box, nice<br/>
history.  We knew who Tom Mix was - in a general sort of way.  Now we will<br/>
be looking for some of his movies.  But....  When we got to the box my wife<br/>
noticed she didn't have a memory stick in her camera.  Fortunately - I had<br/>
my hiking camera along.  It is small, not as good as hers.... But it works!<br/>
Stamped up, read the history, walked the dogs, then on the road again.<br/>
<br/>
	Got to the motel in Casa Grande at 2pm.  Too early to call it a day.<br/>
I was supposed to meet a ham in Scottsdale to buy a special used radio from<br/>
him, we were to meet Saturday night.  This was Friday night.  Called him on<br/>
the phone.  Not home.  But we thought we would search for a letterbox out<br/>
that way, then call again.  We picked Tortilla Flat.  TOO COOL!  About a 60<br/>
mile drive one way.  And what a wonderful drive, really beautiful.  And the<br/>
prickly pear ice cream was great.  Even the dogs liked it.  But - problem.<br/>
The wife was on the last page of her logbook.  We needed a new one.<br/>
<br/>
	Near sundown we started back.  Called that ham a few times - not<br/>
home.  So we drove back towards the motel in Casa Grande - letting the GPS<br/>
find are stores and Michael's - hobby lobbys along the route.  NO LUCK!<br/>
Bummer.  Arrived back at the motel well after 9pm, fed dogs, then ourselves<br/>
- and bed.<br/>
<br/>
	Saturday morning.  Up early- check E-mail - and on to the<br/>
showgrounds.  Dogs ready.  Our turn comes - its going good.  But - - -OH-NO!<br/>
The judge only likes brown dogs.... We get 3rd place - not even a real look!<br/>
Oh-well - always tomorrow.  Back to the motel - feed the dogs, then out the<br/>
door.  Looking for an art store in Casa Grande for a sketch book/log book.<br/>
Moni grabs the log books from the pocket in the door where we keep the<br/>
letterboxing stuff and we carry them inside the store.  But..... NO LUCK!<br/>
We settle for something that will do - but not what we wanted.<br/>
<br/>
	Now we decided to go the other way.  On to Picacho Peak - there are<br/>
at least two and maybe 3 letterboxes there.  We are ready!  Drive 30 miles<br/>
to the park.  Pay the fee at the ranger booth.  Follow the clues to the<br/>
place where the hike starts.  Gear up, dogs out - water full, and grab the<br/>
letterboxing kit.  Where are the stamps.  GONE!  Must have fallen out of the<br/>
van at the art store.  In any event - GONE.  BUMMER.  No more letterboxing<br/>
this trip!<br/>
<br/>
	We headed back.  I asked the GPS for local attractions.  Casa Grande<br/>
Ruins Park.  Hmmmm - hit the GO TO button, and off we go.  What a NEAT piece<br/>
of history!  Visit it if you have the chance.  National Park - no<br/>
letterboxes.  Ask me, they don't belong there..... Delicate historical spot<br/>
- stay on the path.<br/>
<br/>
	About 5pm I call the ham.  He is home, come on out.  Punched his<br/>
address in the GPS and off we go!<br/>
<br/>
	Let me make a side-note here.  My vehicle GPS is a GARMIN NUVI-350.<br/>
It is WORTH EVERY PENNY I spent on it.  TALKING turn-by-turn directions<br/>
through a strange city is priceless.  At one point the traffic jammed up and<br/>
I just punched the DETOUR button.  It recalculated a new route in about 10<br/>
seconds and got us out of the jam.  Painless traveling...  Anyway...<br/>
<br/>
	Got to the ham's house.  What he was selling was worth about $1000<br/>
to me.  He was offering it for $650.  I asked him some technical questions<br/>
about it, and he didn't know how to check it.  I sent him a document.  After<br/>
reading it, he lowered his price to $500, partially because the radio had a<br/>
problem, and partially because I came to pick it up.  Well - I got there,<br/>
and there was about $300 is accessories (Ham radio can get expensive) that<br/>
he didn't mention.  No - the price was still $500.  What a DEAL....  So we<br/>
loaded up in the van and hit the road.  Wife decided the dogs needed to<br/>
stretch their legs.  NOT A PROBLEM!  Punched PARK into the GPS.  It found us<br/>
a BIG BEAUTIFUL park in Scottsdale.  The dogs had a great time.  It was near<br/>
a tennis court.  Did I mention that Great Danes love Tennis Balls?  No?<br/>
Great Danes love Tennis Balls!!!  And there were several.  Parker couldn't<br/>
decide to pee or chase tennis balls.  Finally he grabbed two tennis balls in<br/>
his mouth and then found a good tree.  At dark we loaded up and started<br/>
back.  Arrived back at the motel well after 9pm, fed dogs, then ourselves -<br/>
and bed.<br/>
<br/>
	Sunday morning.  Up early- check E-mail - and - OH-NO!!!  The laptop<br/>
display is out.  No computer!  Damn.  So - pack up, check out, and on to the<br/>
showgrounds.  Dogs ready.  Our turn comes - its going good.  But - - -OH-NO!<br/>
The judge only likes brown dogs.... At least we get 2nd place today - but it<br/>
might as well be last, only first place gets the point.<br/>
<br/>
	We lost - so we may as well hit the road.  No stamps, so no<br/>
letterboxing on the way home.  The wind is still blowing - but now it is a<br/>
right cross-wind off the rear quarter.  Much better mileage.  The wife is<br/>
driving- its her van.  I play radio most of the trip - talking to friends<br/>
all over the SW.  Even San Antonio!  We hit I-10, stopped for a short<br/>
breather-picnic in Texas Canyon, and home before 6pm.  Dinner was at Pizza<br/>
Hut - AFTER the dogs were fed!<br/>
<br/>
	I got a great deal on a special radio.  We lost our stamps.  We lost<br/>
the dog show both days.  And who knows WHAT it will cost to repair the<br/>
laptop....  Oh-well.... Its only money!  I'll make more.<br/>

<div> </div>
<div>I think it would be awesome to take a road trip with y'all - really.  You just never know what's gonna happen.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have one question though - how does someone come to judge dog shows and only like brown dogs?  That seems to me to say the judge is inherently unqualified because he can't see beyond his personal preferences, unless he's judging at a Brown Dog Show.  Maybe your not-a-brown-dog shoulda peed on his shoe...
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So now you've lost your stamps - maybe that was a sign to try to carve your own???</div>

<div>Did you know there is a letterbox right there at Texas Canyon?  And another at the Visitor Center that is near the NM and AZ border?  I found both back in early January.  Very nice stamps.  We stayed in Casa Grande for 2 weeks, but the weather was so bad that I didn't even attempt the ones you found.  Bummer!</div>

<div>I think it would be awesome to take a road trip with y'all - 
  really.  You just never know what's gonna happen.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I have one question though - how does someone come to judge dog shows and 
  only like brown dogs?  That seems to me to say the judge is inherently 
  unqualified because he can't see beyond his personal preferences, unless he's 
  judging at a Brown Dog Show.  Maybe your not-a-brown-<wbr/>dog shoulda 
  peed on his shoe... </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So now you've lost your stamps - maybe that was a sign to try to carve 
  your own???</div>

<p><br/>Howdy.<br/><br/>Went to a dog show in Casa Grande AZ this 
    weekend.<br/><br/>Trip started out at 0730 Friday morning. Horrible headwind 
    most of<br/>the way. That big Ford E-350 doesn't get good fuel mileage to 
    begin with. <br/>Played ham radio on the road while the wife drove. Set the 
    GPS to get us to<br/>Tucson, then split off the road at Oracle AZ to go after 
    the first<br/>letterbox, the Tom Mix microbox near Florence AZ. Nice stop, 
    nice box, nice <br/>history. We knew who Tom Mix was - in a general sort of 
    way. Now we will<br/>be looking for some of his movies. But.... When we got 
    to the box my wife<br/>noticed she didn't have a memory stick in her camera. 
    Fortunately - I had <br/>my hiking camera along. It is small, not as good as 
    hers.... But it works!<br/>Stamped up, read the history, walked the dogs, 
    then on the road again.<br/><br/>Got to the motel in Casa Grande at 2pm. Too 
    early to call it a day. <br/>I was supposed to meet a ham in Scottsdale to 
    buy a special used radio from<br/>him, we were to meet Saturday night. This 
    was Friday night. Called him on<br/>the phone. Not home. But we thought we 
    would search for a letterbox out <br/>that way, then call again. We picked 
    Tortilla Flat. TOO COOL! About a 60<br/>mile drive one way. And what a 
    wonderful drive, really beautiful. And the<br/>prickly pear ice cream was 
    great. Even the dogs liked it. But - problem. <br/>The wife was on the last 
    page of her logbook. We needed a new one.<br/><br/>Near sundown we started 
    back. Called that ham a few times - not<br/>home. So we drove back towards 
    the motel in Casa Grande - letting the GPS<br/>find are stores and Michael's 
    - hobby lobbys along the route. NO LUCK!<br/>Bummer. Arrived back at the 
    motel well after 9pm, fed dogs, then ourselves<br/>- and bed.<br/><br/>Saturday 
    morning. Up early- check E-mail - and on to the <br/>showgrounds. Dogs ready. 
    Our turn comes - its going good. But - - -OH-NO!<br/>The judge only likes 
    brown dogs.... We get 3rd place - not even a real look!<br/>Oh-well - always 
    tomorrow. Back to the motel - feed the dogs, then out the <br/>door. Looking 
    for an art store in Casa Grande for a sketch book/log book.<br/>Moni grabs 
    the log books from the pocket in the door where we keep the<br/>letterboxing 
    stuff and we carry them inside the store. But..... NO LUCK! <br/>We settle 
    for something that will do - but not what we wanted.<br/><br/>Now we decided 
    to go the other way. On to Picacho Peak - there are<br/>at least two and 
    maybe 3 letterboxes there. We are ready! Drive 30 miles<br/>to the park. Pay 
    the fee at the ranger booth. Follow the clues to the <br/>place where the 
    hike starts. Gear up, dogs out - water full, and grab the<br/>letterboxing 
    kit. Where are the stamps. GONE! Must have fallen out of the<br/>van at the 
    art store. In any event - GONE. BUMMER. No more letterboxing <br/>this 
    trip!<br/><br/>We headed back. I asked the GPS for local attractions. Casa 
    Grande<br/>Ruins Park. Hmmmm - hit the GO TO button, and off we go. What a 
    NEAT piece<br/>of history! Visit it if you have the chance. National Park - 
    no <br/>letterboxes. Ask me, they don't belong there..... Delicate historical 
    spot<br/>- stay on the path.<br/><br/>About 5pm I call the ham. He is home, 
    come on out. Punched his<br/>address in the GPS and off we go!<br/><br/>Let me 
    make a side-note here. My vehicle GPS is a GARMIN NUVI-350. <br/>It is WORTH 
    EVERY PENNY I spent on it. TALKING turn-by-turn directions<br/>through a 
    strange city is priceless. At one point the traffic jammed up and<br/>I just 
    punched the DETOUR button. It recalculated a new route in about 10 
    <br/>seconds and got us out of the jam. Painless traveling... 
    Anyway...<br/><br/>Got to the ham's house. What he was selling was worth about 
    $1000<br/>to me. He was offering it for $650. I asked him some technical 
    questions <br/>about it, and he didn't know how to check it. I sent him a 
    document. After<br/>reading it, he lowered his price to $500, partially 
    because the radio had a<br/>problem, and partially because I came to pick it 
    up. Well - I got there, <br/>and there was about $300 is accessories (Ham 
    radio can get expensive) that<br/>he didn't mention. No - the price was still 
    $500. What a DEAL.... So we<br/>loaded up in the van and hit the road. Wife 
    decided the dogs needed to <br/>stretch their legs. NOT A PROBLEM! Punched 
    PARK into the GPS. It found us<br/>a BIG BEAUTIFUL park in Scottsdale. The 
    dogs had a great time. It was near<br/>a tennis court. Did I mention that 
    Great Danes love Tennis Balls? No? <br/>Great Danes love Tennis Balls!!! And 
    there were several. Parker couldn't<br/>decide to pee or chase tennis balls. 
    Finally he grabbed two tennis balls in<br/>his mouth and then found a good 
    tree. At dark we loaded up and started <br/>back. Arrived back at the motel 
    well after 9pm, fed dogs, then ourselves -<br/>and bed.<br/><br/>Sunday 
    morning. Up early- check E-mail - and - OH-NO!!! The laptop<br/>display is 
    out. No computer! Damn. So - pack up, check out, and on to the 
    <br/>showgrounds. Dogs ready. Our turn comes - its going good. But - - 
    -OH-NO!<br/>The judge only likes brown dogs.... At least we get 2nd place 
    today - but it<br/>might as well be last, only first place gets the 
    point.<br/><br/>We lost - so we may as well hit the road. No stamps, so 
    no<br/>letterboxing on the way home. The wind is still blowing - but now it 
    is a<br/>right cross-wind off the rear quarter. Much better mileage. The wife 
    is<br/>driving- its her van. I play radio most of the trip - talking to 
    friends <br/>all over the SW. Even San Antonio! We hit I-10, stopped for a 
    short<br/>breather-picnic in Texas Canyon, and home before 6pm. Dinner was at 
    Pizza<br/>Hut - AFTER the dogs were fed!<br/><br/>I got a great deal on a 
    special radio. We lost our stamps. We lost <br/>the dog show both days. And 
    who knows WHAT it will cost to repair the<br/>laptop.... Oh-well.... Its only 
    money! I'll make more.<br/><br/>Mike - KD9KC.<br/>M.A.R.I.E.<br/>El Paso, Tx.

<div>Did you know there is a letterbox right there at Texas

<p> </p>
<p>Mike, I don't think anyone is now, or has in the past, suggested that you quit letterboxing because you don't have a hand-carved stamp.  But I will disagree with you on one point... I don't believe that carving is an art... rather it is a skill that can be learned.  I don't have an artistic bone in my body; heck I struggle to draw stick figures, but I can carve a decent stamp.  It seems to me that you have mastered so many other skills, that you would want to challenge yourself to master this one as well.  No hard feelings either way, just my 2 cents.</p>

<p>Mike, I don't think anyone is now, or has in the past, suggested that you 
  quit letterboxing because you don't have a hand-carved stamp.  But I will 
  disagree with you on one point... I don't believe that carving is an art... 
  rather it is a skill that can be learned.  I don't have an artistic bone 
  in my body; heck I struggle to draw stick figures, but I can carve a decent 
  stamp.  It seems to me that you have mastered so many other skills, that 
  you would want to challenge yourself to master this one as well.  No hard 
  feelings either way, just my 2 cents.</p>
