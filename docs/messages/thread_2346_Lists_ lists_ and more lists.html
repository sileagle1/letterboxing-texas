<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">This is a difficult 
question that our dear Lucy poses to us tonight.  I have just a couple 
thoughts on the matter, and although they won't be nearly as eloquent as Lucy's, 
I'll try to make them make sense.</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">When I found my very 
first letterbox 3 years ago (Brazos Bend, by Silver Eagle) I wrote him and told 
him about what fun we had, and thanked him for placing the box for us to 
find.  In his gentlemanly way he wrote back, and asked me to join the Texas 
boxing list.  I had never been a member of any sort of a list before, but I 
wanted to learn all I could about letterboxing, so I joined.  Through the 
list I learned things that I never would have learned otherwise, met some folks 
with kooky names that now feel like old friends, and on more than one occasion 
was given wonderful travel itinerates for planned boxing trips with the 
kids.  In short, without the list I would not have felt so welcome, learned 
so much, or felt like part of a community.</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">I understand the 
appeal, and even the need for regional lists.  I happily joined the 
metroboxers list, mostly because I was missing laughs from posts by Ruby, 
PuddleSplasher, Viewfinder, and those other crazies up in Dallas.  I know 
there are other letterboxers in the Houston area, but there are very few who 
ever participate on the Texas list, so maybe a Houston list would draw them 
in.  That all being said, I hate for the big list to be so quiet.  How 
else will we stay connected and feel like "Texas Letterboxers"?  I worry 
that if regional lists take the place of the Texas list, new boxers my miss 
out on all that can be gained from hearing from Silver Eagle, Baby Bear, 
Ruby, Lucy, Teamking, Dewberry, etc.etc...letterboxers who are in it for the 
"long haul", and who are wonderful, kind mentors. I don't know what the 
solution to all this is, but I know that at least for me it is difficult to keep 
track of several lists (remember, I live in total chaos 24 hours a day, there is 
a reason for my disabilities) and I miss the posts from all the personalities 
that make up Letterboxing Texas. A Houston list and a Texas list I could 
keep up with, as long as everyone keeps the Texas list as their main form of 
communication...If I have to join 8 lists just to keep up with what you all are 
doing I know for a fact I will end up in the nut house:)  -Mother of
