Locket up in my neck of the woods - and I'm sure<br>
TexasLuvBug feels the same!  <br>
<br>
Just so's ya know though - I'm a SLUG in the<br>
summertime!  I carve, but I don't venture out nearly<br>
as much as I should because I really hate our heat -<br>
you'd think after living here nearly all my life, I<br>
would've gotten used to it!  Anyway, I have about 8<br>
boxes or so to place (likely locations are Buffalo,<br>
Jefferson, Caddo Lake, Nacogdoches, and Mission Tejas,<br>
and some yet undecided), but they probably won't make<br>
it out until fall.  <br>
<br>
As most of y'all know, I split my time between cub<br>
scouting and letterboxing.  And as I mentioned on the<br>
big list, the topic of discussion last weekend on the<br>
national scout leader list I belong to was geocaching<br>
and letterboxing with scouts.  And as has been<br>
discussed in the past on various letterboxing lists<br>
(this one included), letterboxers are often a little<br>
leery about scouts and other groups heading out to<br>
letterbox because sometimes leaders aren't diligent to<br>
make sure that boxes are cared for and rehidden well. <br>
Because of the recent discussion, several local<br>
scouters have asked me to help them introduce<br>
letterboxing to their scouts.<br>
<br>
Soooo...I'm considering setting up a "training course"<br>
of sorts, several boxes in a single park, with clear<br>
solid directions so that a group (or an individual)<br>
can come out and find several boxes geared toward the<br>
beginner and get the hang of interpreting clues,<br>
practicing compass skills, using good outdoor skills,<br>
and being responsible boxers.  Although it would be<br>
geared toward scouts (and specifically cub scouts),<br>
anyone could try it out.  I'm thinking that instead of<br>
posting the clues on the website, I would list it on<br>
the website and direct those interested to email me<br>
for clues and information.  I realize that this would<br>
be a high risk series, so I'm thinking I'll plant it<br>
somewhere near to me, like Jim Hogg State Park, so I<br>
can check on it more easily.  I would like to place<br>
nice stamps, but nothing too intricate since I may<br>
well have to recarve from time to time.<br>
<br>
So what do y'all think?  Is this a lame idea? <br>
Thinking back to your newbie days (especially if you<br>
have kids), what would have been helpful to learn<br>
early on?  As planters, what would you like finders to<br>
know?<br>
