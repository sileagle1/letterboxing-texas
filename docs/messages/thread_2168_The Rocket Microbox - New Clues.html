the terrain had changed, so today while in Katy for a soccer game I <br>
checked it out.  Sure enough, several landmarks had changed and the <br>
box was out of its hiding place and buried so deep in the dirt I <br>
barely saw it.  It was undamaged, so I "re-covered well" and rewrote <br>
the clues.  Be sure to reprint them if you plan to go for this box.<br>
