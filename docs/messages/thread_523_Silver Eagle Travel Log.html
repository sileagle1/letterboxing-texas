I just got back late last night from our<br/>
South Texas trip, so I thought I would give<br/>
everyone a trip report.  We had to cut<br/>
the trip to 4 days so I was not able to<br/>
go to Corpus Christi area to replace my<br/>
2 missing boxes.  However, I did manage to<br/>
place 5 new ones and find several along<br/>
the way.  We left on Tuesday, 12/28, and<br/>
our first stop was victoria, where<br/>
I waded through the mud to find Monkey Toes'<br/>
Box Kite box.  I was surprised to see I<br/>
was only the second one to find it.  We<br/>
then went to Riverside Park and I found<br/>
both boxes there and realized I had just<br/>
missed Birds Of A Feather by 1 day!<br/>
Next, it was on to Goliad SP where I<br/>
checked on my box (damp but ok) and found<br/>
the other ones there alive and well.<br/>
After eating a picnic lunch on a beautiful<br/>
day, we drove on to Skidmore where I found<br/>
the Beehive HH Hostel.  There were 3 HH<br/>
that had been held hostage for over 6 months,<br/>
so I took all of them and left one.  I plan<br/>
to release them in the Houston HH Hostel<br/>
soon.  We finally got to a birding spot<br/>
south of Falfurrias where we spotted many<br/>
birds only found in South Texas, and I<br/>
placed my Falfurrias Finch box.  We spent<br/>
the night in Edinburg and got up early to<br/>
visit the Scenic Wetlands Birding Center.<br/>
We saw more birds and I was first finder<br/>
of WowMom's box.  Next it was on to the<br/>
World Birding Center at Bentsen-Rio Grande<br/>
State Park.  What a great park!  We rented<br/>
a 4-seat bike and rode all the trails, seeing<br/>
many new birds, finding WowMom's box and<br/>
placing my Green Jay box.  Even the kids<br/>
had fun at this place.  We headed east to<br/>
the Santa Anna NWR to look around.  No<br/>
boxes there, but a nice place.  Then it<br/>
was on to the Valley Nature Center in<br/>
Welasco where we found Birds Of A Feather's<br/>
box and enjoyed the peaceful oasis in that<br/>
town.  That night we stayed on Padre Island,<br/>
which was what the kids were waiting for.<br/>
I got up early the next morning to do more<br/>
letterboxing in Brownsville and promised<br/>
to meet up with the family at the beach<br/>
around noon.  I drove to Gladys Porter<br/>
zoo and tried to find WowMom's box but<br/>
did not find it, even though I'm pretty<br/>
sure I was at the right place.  Then it<br/>
was on to the Sabal Palm Audubon Center &amp;<br/>
Sanctuary, where I placed my Sabal Palm box and <br/>
enjoyed quiet trails with many birds.  Finally, <br/>
I drove the long Boca Chica road to look for<br/>
the only old box supposedly still alive in<br/>
the Brownsville area (Clarksville box).<br/>
Once again I came up empty, even though I<br/>
found the green sign buried under mud and<br/>
grass.  I think the box was swept away.<br/>
On the way back to Padre I stopped at<br/>
Port Isabel Ligthouse and found Birds Of<br/>
A Feather's box there.  There were several<br/>
visitors to the box, including many from<br/>
out of state.  The last day, as we headed<br/>
home, we stopped at Laguna Atascosa NWR<br/>
for more birding and I placed my Aplomado Falcon<br/>
box there.  Then we stopped in Kleberg Park<br/>
in Kingsville where I placed my last box, Kingsville<br/>
Kiskadee before heading to the King Ranch Visitor<br/>
Center.  After that it was just a long<br/>
drive home, happy but tired.<br/>
Thanks to all that hid boxes and I hope<br/>
you get a chance to find mine soon!<br/>
