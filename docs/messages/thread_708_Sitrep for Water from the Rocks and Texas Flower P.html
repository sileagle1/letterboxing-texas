around Cherokee County and my kids and I ventured out<br>
this evening to find her Water from the Rocks box. <br>
It's planted at a neat little roadside spring where<br>
people come to get a little drink or to collect water<br>
to use at home.  Parts of Cherokee County are still<br>
very, very rural and (ahem) backward, so there are<br>
even folks who gather water from this spring to use in<br>
place of running water in their homes!  The water is<br>
smooth and clean and COLD, and it tastes oh so good! <br>
It's flowed for a long, long time, winter or summer,<br>
rainy or dry.  I must confess, I have considered<br>
placing a box at this site for quite some time, but<br>
never got off the stick to do it, and now luvbug has<br>
jumped in and beat me to it!  You go girl!<br>
<br>
ANYWAY, we found Water from the Rocks in good<br>
condition, but a little crowded in the box.  Planted<br>
ourselves down with a good view of the spring, but no<br>
one noticed us spying on them while we stamped in.  It<br>
has seen two other boxers today, but they left behind<br>
a little rubber that needed to get out and stretch, so<br>
we relieved the overcrowding situation in the box by<br>
taking Texas Flower Power on a ride.  I see a three<br>
hour trip south in its very near future!<br>
<br>
Let me take a moment to mention to new boxers and old<br>
- to help this game thrive, it is really important to<br>
rehide boxes well.  Even a little corner peaking out<br>
can attract unwanted attention and result in a box<br>
being discovered by the uninitiated.  I saw the box<br>
from about six feet away as I approached.  There was<br>
just a very tiny corner showing, but I caught the<br>
glint and knew what I was seeing.  My crew and I<br>
usually play a little game - one person hides it back<br>
and the others of us try to spot it without using our<br>
hands.  I know, it's kind of an ignorant game, but it<br>
does the trick!  Nuff said - "Think boxing is swell? <br>
Rehide well!"<br>
<br>
Thanks for another box luvbug - very nice!  Look for a<br>
new one in our area tomorrow evening!<br>
