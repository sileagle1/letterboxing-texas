Lucy!  And you're right, it is "a lot more fun to just go than stand on
the trail wondering".  There are a couple of boxes that I passed on
that I fully intend to go back after.... I have beautiful pix of Mt.
Bonnell location in Austin, but never quite got that box.  Same with
the Barton Springs Salamander in Zilker Park, Austin.  While I was
trying to retrieve the box, I was being attacked by what seemed like
zillions of little black flying bugs and had visions of some horrible
scene on CSI.  I was afraid to dig around too much for fear of finding
something dead!  Will have to go after that one again and take a can of
bug spray with me.  <br/>
I'm getting used to getting dirty.  Last weekend, Jackie and I went to
Belton and Temple and by the time we got back, we had a pile of wet
wipes on the center floorboard of my truck.  Went to Gatesville and
Waco today with Jackie and zturtle, got 16 stamps, and didn't use a
single wet wipe!  I don't even think we washed our hands before lunch!
LOL.  What's a little dirt and ink, right??<br/>

<div class="gmail_quote"> I don't know how to explain the difference
between being bold and being foolhardy, but let me encourage you that
being bold makes letterboxing a whole lot more fun!</div>

<div class="gmail_quote">While I've never been one to sit around and
keep my fingernails clean, I haven't been one in my adult life to
really go out on a limb either.  I think the turning point for me was a
few years ago when I really wanted to go letterboxing in the summer (I
hate heat) and my husband said "well let's go".  I whined a bit about
the heat but he was tired of hearing about not being able to go
letterboxing so he didn't let up until I got my rear end up and went. 
I made a plan of attack and we headed out early one Saturday morning
and stayed out all day finding boxes.  We were standing in the middle
of some forest somewhere and I was drenched in sweat and stinky and I
finally realized it wasn't killing me to get hot because I was having
fun.  Being drenched just means cooling off and stinking of sweat was
no big deal where we were.  It was all a matter of perspective.</div>
<div class="gmail_quote"> </div>
<div class="gmail_quote">Somehow that was a change in my mentality
and I realized I could probably step out a little further on the limb
and push myself in other areas as well.  Steep hills, rough trails,
heavy brush, long walks, water - while I try to be smart about where I
go, I've realized I can go a lot more places than I originally
thought.  I've also learned that I bounce pretty well and I dry off
nicely and just about anything that might happen to me can be fixed. 
I've yet to have a serious injury, but bruises and scratches and sore
muscles are temporary souvenirs of the journey that I can handle.  It's
a lot more fun to just go than to stand on the trail wondering if I
should.  If I can do it, so can you!</div>
