<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    In any case, I am requesting that you talk to and consider working with the appointed (by us) representative of Texas Letterboxing to the mutual benefit of both parties.  I assure you sir, we are not interested in causing you trouble.  We are friends of the parks and friends of nature.  We use the parks.  We vote for the parks when on the ballot.  We practice LNT.  We would not wish to hurt or destroy that which we most enjoy - our hobby in the outdoors.
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    Some of the current rules are a little tough to deal with.  The "check it every quarter" rule is a bit tough when the owner isn't from the area.  I handle the majority of it myself in the El Paso area.  I am kinda the "GO-TO" guy for Geocaching and Letterboxing.  Please don't rat us out, but I have a sort of under the table agreement with the 3 rangers.  I watch over the stashes in El Paso and interface for them.  So far with the exception of one incident we have had nearly 6 years of trouble free fun.  I do not have current data on the impact I have had in visitors and $$$$, but I know it is quite positive.  If you call the rangers I am sure they will back up my claim.
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    I hope you will listen to and hear-out our Letterboxing representative.  We are all reasonable folks just looking to have fun in the end, just like everyone else.  I feel certain some agreement can be worked out.  It has certainly worked in El Paso, and in several other states - states that even put out letterboxes and geocaches themselves to draw visitors.  I am certain out representative would be happy to show you how to get started with that also.

<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    I started out just Geocaching.  When I learned of Letterboxing I was immediately interested in it.  I now actually enjoy it a bit more than Geocaching.  I quickly learned that the average Letterboxer was a little more responsible than the average Geocacher.  There are fewer Letterboxers and letterboxes are spread out, (we are working on that) so each boxer takes a bit of responsibility for every letterbox visited.  We kind of "watch over each other" so to speak.  Since the letterboxes are less frequently visited, and the average visiting letterboxer takes care of a letterbox problem if one is found, there is really less trouble here than with the average geocache that is visited frequently and deteriorates quickly because only the owner really watches out for it.  I could copy you several notes from our Texas forum (or you could subscribe - ??? Lucy?) to see for yourself.  When a damaged box is found, it is immediately taken care of by the visiting boxer and/or the owner notified and arrangements made.  I personally have rebuilt and replaced one letterbox in San Marcos TX, and recovered and replaced two in El Paso that were in danger after the July 2006 floods.  I suppose you did hear about Franklin Mountain State Park and the floods?  I was one of the first in, right after the dozer cleared a path for my jeep.  Yup - that bad!  They are STILL digging out some parts of the park. 
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    In any case, I am requesting that you talk to and consider working with the appointed (by us) representative of Texas Letterboxing to the mutual benefit of both parties.  I assure you sir, we are not interested in causing you trouble.  We are friends of the parks and friends of nature.  We use the parks.  We vote for the parks when on the ballot.  We practice LNT.  We would not wish to hurt or destroy that which we most enjoy - our hobby in the outdoors. 
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    Some of the current rules are a little tough to deal with.  The "check it every quarter" rule is a bit tough when the owner isn't from the area.  I handle the majority of it myself in the El Paso area.  I am kinda the "GO-TO" guy for Geocaching and Letterboxing.  Please don't rat us out, but I have a sort of under the table agreement with the 3 rangers.  I watch over the stashes in El Paso and interface for them.  So far with the exception of one incident we have had nearly 6 years of trouble free fun.  I do not have current data on the impact I have had in visitors and $$$$, but I know it is quite positive.  If you call the rangers I am sure they will back up my claim. 
</span></div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div>
<div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>    I hope you will listen to and hear-out our Letterboxing representative.  We are all reasonable folks just looking to have fun in the end, just like everyone else.  I feel certain some agreement can be worked out.  It has certainly worked in El Paso, and in several other states - states that even put out letterboxes and geocaches themselves to draw visitors.  I am certain out representative would be happy to show you how to get started with that also.

<div>That sounds great to me. Mr. Good already told me that he thought I <br/>was misinformed on the quarterly review, that he understood how that <br/>could be a problem, and that the point would be considered. Let's

 Texas.  I am a volunteer in Franklin Mountain State Park.  This park is 37 square miles of desert mountain range and has only 3 rangers patrolling.  Being retired from the Army and quite capable in the outdoors, the rangers appreciate having me patrol the places they cannot get to.  Ask them about Mike and Parker, my Great Dane hiking companion.  We are well known out in the high places. </span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span></span> </div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span><span>photo here - delete this text....</span></span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span><img align="baseline" alt="" border="0" hspace="0" src="cid:1653823902000001@web80613.mail.mud.yahoo.com"/>  </span></div> <div align="left" dir="ltr"><span>Mike &amp; Parker on the eastern

                    <div class="plaintext-content">The Midpenninsula Regional Open Space District near San Francisco has <br/>
set geocaching guidelines after a representative from the local caching <br/>
community met with them and conducted a PowerPoint presentation showing <br/>
how caching could benefit the district.  The MROSP then established <br/>
geocaching guidelines that are very reasonable.<br/>
<br/>
We could probably leverage some of their ideas, and perhaps even <br/>
contact their "District Geocache Liason" for information on how they <br/>
approached the district and made their case.<br/>
