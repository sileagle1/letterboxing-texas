                    <div class="plaintext-content">Having just caught up on the postings from everyone from this past <br>
weekend, I just wanted to share my little adventure with the group. <br>
First, PomPom Bear (my 12 y/o daughter) had just spent all last week <br>
down in San Antonio, with family and I went down on Friday to pick <br>
her up and bring her home with the intentions of finding a few boxes <br>
while I was down there. WEll....it didn't start out so well. I <br>
figured, I needed to pick up some Rx's and I needed to get the oil <br>
changed before I set out on the road so why not kill 2 birds with <br>
one stone and do both at Wal Mart. So when I pulled up the guy comes <br>
out to greet me and I asked how long it would take to get my oil <br>
changed. To which he promplty replies 30 - 45 minutes , an hour <br>
tops. There are 2 cars in front of you. Well, tell me a girl that <br>
can't kill an hour in Wal Mart so I tell him ok, go ahead, I have a <br>
few things to do anyways in here. So I go in and get my RX's and <br>
mull around, checking everything out, picked up a very unsatisfying <br>
lunch at McD's and without even realizing it, managed to kill 2HRS <br>
in there. As I hurried back to the automotive section, I tell the , <br>
couldn't be more than 18, gum chewing, smart alek, with a bad <br>
attitude, cashier that I needed to pick up my vehicle. To which she <br>
promptly tells me, its not ready and that they haven't even started <br>
on it! This wasn't what I wanted to hear as it was already quickly <br>
approaching 2:00 and I didn't want to get stuck in downtown Austin <br>
traffic on a friday afternoon. I told her I didn't have anymore time <br>
to wait and that I was told 1 hr. She told me there was nothing she <br>
could do and if I wanted to leave I had to go get my keys from one <br>
of the technicians. Not seeing a sole in sight, I walked over to my <br>
car to find it sitting there with the windows rolled down, the keys <br>
in the ignition, and all of my stuff in the backseat. This made me <br>
just a little on the mad side and so I jumped in my car (after <br>
making sure everything was still there) and took. I stopped at an <br>
oil change place and had my car done in 5 min. So finally on the <br>
road and after 2 hrs delay in traffic in downtown Austin (does I35 <br>
ever not have traffic?) I finally made it to SA. Saturday was much <br>
better and after getting lost several times in SA I was able to find <br>
some great lb. I wanted to do more, but ran out of time. A very <br>
interesting thing happened to me though. I had gone and done the <br>
Espada Aquaduct by Tall Texas (which is a very interesting place to <br>
visit) and then proceeded to the Mission Espada to find the next lb <br>
there. After having carefully followed the directions several times, <br>
there was no lb to be found. We searched behing every tree and I'm <br>
sure people thought we were crazy. But to no avail. Now, PomPom bear <br>
tends to get easily upset if she doesn't find what she is looking <br>
for. So as I accept defeat and tell her we have to go without <br>
finding it, she stomps off through the middle of the grassy area <br>
located inside the mission. After a prompt attitude check she <br>
returned and we were walking on the sidewalk around the mission to <br>
the info area and the parking lot. As we walked and talked about not <br>
being able to find this box, I felt something tell me to stop. I'm <br>
not sure why and I'm not sure why I chose that precise moment to <br>
turn and look to my right, but I did. As we walked, I looked over <br>
and what do I see but the lb that we had been searching for laying <br>
there in the grass next to a newly planted tree.  This was not where <br>
it should have been and I can only assume that someone found it and <br>
just threw it down there. Everything was in it and it was still in <br>
good condition. I guess its true that God can lead us and things <br>
happen for a reason. PomPom Bear was so excited and it this was a <br>
very small lb so I could have easily walked right by it but I <br>
honestly feel that he led me to this spot to recover this and <br>
although I couldn't replace it because there were too many people in <br>
the area it was to be hidden in and also because the park was <br>
closing in 5 min so I was forced to take it with me. I have notified <br>
Tall TExan and plan on mailing him back his lb as soon as he sends <br>
me his address. I felt bad in taking it with me, but I didn't want <br>
it to end up disappearing again and there were too many people to <br>
put it back where it should have been. Sunday, it was off to tackle <br>
the traffic back up I35. After a quick stop in Austin to drop off <br>
the TTB and to find a few LB in Barton Springs (great area) we <br>
decided that we needed to hit the road. From Round Rock to the I35 <br>
split at Hillsboro, the traffic just crawled...and crawled...and <br>
crawled. We didn't get home until 8 Sunday evening. The construction <br>
that was being done and then the extra traffic from people returning <br>
from Spring BREak made everything horribly slow. The one bright spot <br>
was a quick stop off in West to stretch our legs and to find <br>
Stargazer's beautiful stamp The Czech stop. Very detailed and would <br>
highly recommend anyone that doesn't have it to find it. I loved <br>
that I could sit at the gazebo and stamp in my book. Nothing like <br>
having a nice place to sit and stamp. So other than bad timing and <br>
traffic, it was a great weekend. Have to make another trip to do all <br>
the ones I wanted to do and didn't have time for. Sounds like <br>
Barefoot Lucy and Viewfinder as well as others had great weeks with <br>
successful finds as well. Good hunting to everyone.<br>
