                    <div class="plaintext-content">I just got home from a nice Valentine's Day dinner<br>
with my two favorite guys - Fearless Fox and<br>
Lightning.  SJZ was out of the picture for the day<br>
since she headed up to Denton to spend Valentine's<br>
with her valentine.  <br>
<br>
Valentine's Day has always been a "nice" holiday for<br>
us, but nothing much more special than any other day<br>
of the year.  I suspected a few days ago that FF had<br>
something up his sleeve because I wasn't allowed to go<br>
into Michael's with him when we went to Tyler.  I was<br>
pretty sure jewelry wasn't involved since I'm not a<br>
jewelry kind of girl, and the only thing that would've<br>
really surprised me would've been a new car - which we<br>
really need right now.  That seemed pretty unlikely<br>
though!<br>
<br>
He cancelled lunch on me today, and then called to say<br>
he would be a few minutes late picking me up from<br>
work.  I took the opportunity to plant a box near<br>
where I work, and he and Lightning finally showed up. <br>
Nothing glaringly obvious in the car, except that my<br>
LB backpack was in the backseat and I knew I had left<br>
it on the kitchen table, but he gave me a card and<br>
wished me Happy Valentine's Day.  I figured I must've<br>
been wrong about the surprise since he would've waited<br>
until he gave me the surprise to give me a card, so I<br>
figured it was a normal V-Day.  I opened the card - a<br>
kids' card, hardly for an adult - not even signed. <br>
But on the inside of the front of the card was a clue<br>
- handwritten.  I had to figure out the clue and tell<br>
him where to take me.  The clue began "go to the place<br>
we first met"...bear in mind, we grew up in this<br>
little town from the time I was 6 and he was 7, so we<br>
have 36 years of history springing from this little<br>
town.  I reached deep back into my brain to recall -<br>
did we meet first at school or at church?  He<br>
remembered though - it was at school!  We went to the<br>
school and walked around the campus as his clues<br>
directed me from one point to another, and finally<br>
ended right outside the window of the 3rd grade class<br>
we shared when he moved to town the year after I did. <br>
This, by the way, is the same school Lightning<br>
attends!  I dug around and found the box - with a pair<br>
of stamps (store-bought, but hey, he IS an LSS and<br>
only an avid LB'er because I am) and another set of<br>
clues.  I diligently stamped into my logbook, opening<br>
to a place where I had two clean face-to-face pages to<br>
allow me plenty of room to stamp for what would<br>
evidently be a very special occasion.  <br>
<br>
The next set of clues were to the place where we<br>
shared our first kiss - the home of a friend who had a<br>
party way back when we were freshmen in high school. <br>
We were basically parking in someone's driveway and<br>
jotting off into the woods nearby to get this one.  I<br>
said a quick hello to the residents of the home who<br>
were out in the yard (and although I know the woman<br>
who owns the home, it was her daughter-in-law and<br>
grandkids in the yard and they didn't know us!) and<br>
snagged the box - thinking to myself that it was a<br>
good thing we weren't worrying about replacing these<br>
boxes!  Again, there were a pair of stamps and another<br>
set of clues.  We left the driveway and went to a<br>
parking lot nearby for me to stamp in, then proceeded<br>
off as directed by the clues into the country to visit<br>
my childhood home.  When we were kids we spent<br>
countless hours on the 50 acres of so that my parents<br>
owned, rambling about and hunting bugs and conducting<br>
snipe hunts and riding horses and whatever else seemed<br>
to be the pasttime du jour.  When FF and Lightning<br>
planted the box, they introduced themselves to the<br>
current owner of the house and explained what they<br>
were doing, so they were able to place the box within<br>
the boundaries of the property.  I stamped in the new<br>
pair of stamps while we looked around and took in the<br>
changes that had been made - some good and some bad.  <br>
Finally, as we were leaving the owner and his dog came<br>
out to wave goodbye.  <br>
<br>
The next set of clues directed me to the church where<br>
we grew up and where we were married.  The church is<br>
now a private school and it's been many years since<br>
I've set foot on the property, but it is special in so<br>
many ways because FF and I actually helped build the<br>
building and grew up in that church, then had a unique<br>
marriage ceremony there.  Odd to find myself digging<br>
in the flower beds to find tupperware, but dig I did<br>
and found the final box, again with a pair of stamps! <br>
<br>
<br>
What makes this whole thing especially special is that<br>
he is an LSS - he boxes because I do.  He never<br>
complains about it, always enjoys it and has even been<br>
known to go on a mission to retrieve a box when I<br>
couldn't go.  But it's not what he would choose to do<br>
with his own time.  This was better than diamonds!<br>
<br>
He mentioned rehiding the boxes in permanent<br>
locations, and you never know - we may just do that!<br>

I just got home from a nice Valentine's Day dinner<br>
with my two favorite guys - Fearless Fox and<br>
Lightning.  SJZ was out of the picture for the day<br>
since she headed up to Denton to spend Valentine's<br>
