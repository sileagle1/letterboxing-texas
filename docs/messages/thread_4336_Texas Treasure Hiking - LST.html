                    <div class="plaintext-content">The LST is probably the longest trail in TX and has many access points.  I have hiked from Big Creek Scenic Area to Double Lake and it is great, but can be very wet.  Baby Bear and I did our first backpack trip on the LST, too.  Of course, all of this was before we knew about letterboxing.<br/>

Another incentive to hike the LST is provided by Wanda &amp; Pete and their Lone Star Surprise Letterbox.  The object is to move the box along the trail, trying to get it from one end to the other eventually.  Here is the link:<br/>

Unfortunately, most of the other long hikes I know about are in State Parks, and I live so far away from most of them that I would not have time to go through the long process of permitting the box.  I might place some anyway, and just hide the clues, like in my Games series, but I don't necessarily advocate everyone doing this.  <br/>

&gt; The Lone Star Trail that runs through the Sam Houston National Forest is about 125 miles lone, broken into smaller, 5 to 6 mile lengths when it crosses roads and highways.  There's a beautiful section of trail between Double Lake and Big Creek in San Jacinto County that's about 5 miles in length.  We've actually thought about placing a letterbox halfway into the trail which would make for a 5 mile hike round trip from either end.<br/>
