is also a yahoo group for hitchhikers for anyone who is interested. If<br/>
you could log him in, I would greatly appreciate it. As you will see, I<br/>
had to get him the He** out of Michigan ;-)!! I found him in the<br/>
letterbox closest to my old house and in keeping with the HeLL, Michigan<br/>
theme I brought him to the city that had "The Best Little Whorehouse in<br/>
Texas." <br/>
<br/>
BTW-we have been fortunate to have found a great many of these lovely<br/>
little hitchhiking treasures and we are always delighted. Ours have<br/>
logged a great many joyous miles with us!  I found "Faerie Dust" HH<br/>
today in Ziggy's Gifts and she will be flapping her little wings for a<br/>
mighty trip north soon. <br/>

finders and creators, do not post/log them in and it is a lower<br/>
percentage than the "regular" boxes, maybe they are not aware in am not<br/>
sure. Of all the ones we have found maybe a quarter of them are posted<br/>
on Atlas Quest or LNA. <br/>

                    <html><body><div>Someone eluded to, but did not give the link for, the hitchhikers yahoo group.  Considering the vast number of HH's out there, you would think it would be a high traffic group, but it's really not - I get maybe 3-5 messages a week from it reporting the travels of HH's (maximum volume is around 50/month).  It's kind of nice to belong to for the sake of reporting HH's and to watch and see if maybe someone reports one of yours and since it is low traffic, it's relatively painless:
</div>
<div> </div>
<div><a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/letterbox_travellers</a></div>
<div><br/>I've released something like 15 HH's and it's funny because some of them I hear from all the time and others I almost never hear from.  I wasn't very diligent with my early HH's (I still don't get real bent about them - I turn them out more for fun than anything) and often turned them out without email addresses.  They were released pre-AQ and before LBNA had HH capabilities, so they weren't originally listed.  I think some of them may have been on Wanda and Pete, but I've never been good about reporting releases on the yahoo group.  I didn't keep good records on the first ones, so I entered them into the sites from memory when that became a possibility.  Needless to say, you would expect that those would be the ones I haven't heard from, but you'd be surprised!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>My daughter and I were bored one summer day and hanging out at the lake watching the guys work on one of the boats.  We were slapping mosquitoes and swatting flies, and we started carving bugs.  We came up with a series of about six bugs that we eventually released as HH's.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I recently heard from one of these that we released on Christmas Day 2005 and had never heard from, until an email a few weeks ago - almost a year and a half without a report!  And the person who emailed me was a real sleuth - I released it in my daughter's name (she was the carver), and her OLD trail name at that, but didn't put an email address on it.  I later entered it on the sites, but not with the exact same name as the one in the book (was logging it months after releasing it and was going from memory).  So the person who reported it 1) connected her to me, and 2) found it listed under a similar name and made the jump that it was the same one.  They emailed me to confirm they were right before logging it.  They kindly helped me get it all synced up so the next finder won't have to go through hoops to log it.  
</div>
<div><br/>And then another bug that was released in the same basic timeframe as the one above, and I hear from it all the time!  It's traveled all over the eastern half of the country and been to gatherings and had at least one new logbook, if not two.  Ironically, it's a carving of a cockroach.  Figures, right?
