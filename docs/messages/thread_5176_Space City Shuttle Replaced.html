P.S.  Some of the clues to boxes in this park list Galveston as the county, but it really is barely in Harris, so look at both on LBNA.<br/>

Austin State Park.  The trailhead change for Copperhead trail and changing landmarks required an update for these newbie plants of mine, so be sure to print the new clues. I also recarved one of the series that went missing right away.  I will say that those cellphone boxes they sell in the camping stuff
 are fabulous for keeping out moisture, though they are expensive and don't have much room.  I'm pretty sure now that they also float!</span></div><div><br/></div> <div> <div> <div dir="ltr">  <div class="hr" contenteditable="false" readonly="true"></div> <b><span>From:</span></b> sileagle1 &lt;sileagle@windstream.net&gt;<br/> <b><span>To:</span></b> letterboxingtexas@yahoogroups.com <br/> <b><span>Sent:</span></b> Wednesday, April 3, 2013 3:09 PM<br/> <b><span>Subject:</span></b> [letterboxingtexas] Space City Shuttle Replaced<br/>
