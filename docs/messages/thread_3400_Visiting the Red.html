                    <div class="plaintext-content">I got up bright and early Saturday morning and jumped in my car to head<br>
toward Carthage for a meeting.  I took my boxing stuff because I expected it<br>
would take a half a day or a little more, but Fearless Fox and Lightning<br>
were at Camporee, meaning I was on my own until Sunday and I might just have<br>
enough time to dodge over to Shreveport for a couple boxes.<br>
Well I was not very far from home when I got a call that my meeting was a<br>
no-go, so what did I have in front of me but a whole found day!  I don't<br>
know about you, but a found day is the best kind of day of all - you had<br>
something planned and it fell through, so you can do whatever you want and<br>
no one expects anything else of you.  Now I could've gone home and cleaned<br>
house, but that is NOT how you use a found day.  Nope. You have to do<br>
something impractical and spur of the moment.  Sooo...off to Shreveport I<br>
went.  Thankfully I had been planning for a Shreveport day at some point in<br>
the near future and had clues and one of my crazy homemade maps all made up,<br>
so I had everything I needed to spend the whole day there.  The only two<br>
things I really regretted was that I had not  brought a box with me to plant<br>
and that I had not emailed JBanana ahead of time because I thought my<br>
timeframe would have been terribly limited.<br>
<br>
I was running on automatic between Henderson and Carthage when suddenly I<br>
noticed that there was tons of snow along the roadside, on the rooftops, in<br>
the trees - everywhere!  I was amazed - I had no idea that much snow was<br>
that close to where I live!  I debated jumping out and building a snowman in<br>
someone's yard, but it was already almost 9 a.m., so they were probably<br>
mostly already up and out of bed, so they would've seen me and it wouldn't<br>
have been a surprise.  That would've been cool though - making a snowman in<br>
someone's yard for them to find when they got up in the morning!<br>
<br>
So anyway, on to Shreveport with me, and I got there about 9:20.  I went<br>
straight on across the river and found My Favorite Animal by JBanana.  Right<br>
off the bat - a really cool location and a cute stamp!  I sat there in the<br>
little park in my sweatshirt and hooded jacket over a pair of capris pulled<br>
on over stirrup pants with my hiking shoes on and standard ponytail.  I was<br>
sure nice and toasty, but I noticed that in daylight I didn't look too<br>
pulled together.  Oh well.  Surely the day wouldn't call for any better than<br>
what I was.   If it did, I had my uniform still in the car.  Maybe the<br>
scouter look would be less conspicuous than the homeless look?<br>
Hmmm...questionable!<br>
<br>
Anyway - I spent a little time pulling a plan together with my homemade map<br>
of Shreveport.  If you've never seen one of my nifty little maps, I map the<br>
locations of all the boxes and then print them from Mapquest, cut them out<br>
and tape them together.  I wind up with a map of only the parts of a town<br>
where there are boxes, so that the map has several arms and flappy pieces<br>
all taped together.  It's a sight I know, but I get only what I need and I<br>
can print it in a readable size.  Fearless Fox rolls his eyes when I start<br>
making one of my maps.  I'm not making it for him though.  So anyway, I<br>
marked the boxes I could find on the map, figured out a plan of attack and<br>
set about my way.<br>

Shreveport. Those "found" days are truly wonderful, aren't they. <br>
Thank you for the nice compliments. It's great to hear someone <br>
enjoyed my boxes. <br>
It's a good thing you're coming back because there will be a few more <br>
boxes planted next week. And don't forget, the movie-watching birds <br>
change their movie selection weekly.<br>
Hopefully next time we can meet up for lunch, and I'll be glad to <br>
provide cover if you need it. <br>
That goes for ALL Texas boxers, too. Y'all come visit Shreveport. <br>
We'll be more than happy to see ya! <br>

<div> </div>
<div>Gosh, I hope you have as much fun going to Shreveport as I did!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I hope you don't mind me giving you a small piece of advice.  I have no idea what boxes you've found already, but most of the boxes in East Texas are not considered to be urban.  They can usually be located without too much worry of discovery and you can usually manage to avoid involving outsiders with them.  Even the ones in city parks are what I would consider to be relatively rural styled boxes.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>On the other hand, the boxes I found in Shreveport were almost all "urban" boxes - boxes that are planted in places that get lots of traffic.  It is a LOT harder to get those kinds of boxes and to get them back in place, all without discovery by non-boxers.  Just take care not to be seen retrieving or returning a box, but at the same time be careful to recover them especially well.  If you aren't sure you can get it without anyone notices, let it go!  It really helps to be on the ready with a "reason" why you're there, and hopefully not too far from the truth.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm not real used to urban boxing since most of the boxing I do is on trails and paths, or in smaller towns.  I do find it to be a lot of fun for a change, although sometimes very frustrating!<br/><br/>Good luck and do let us know how it goes!</div>

<div>I had to pass on that very same box when I visited Reno several months 
after you did, PS, because the streets were suddenly shut down because of a 
sniper shooting at a judge in an office building just down the block.  We 
drove right past that location and it was very frustrating knowing exactly where 
the box was and that I could have hopped out of the car and maybe grabbed it, 
but not without being seen by dozens of police and FBI, and even possibly the 
sniper himself, so that's one I definitely had to give up on.   Oh, 
the hazards of the Urban Boxer!</div>
