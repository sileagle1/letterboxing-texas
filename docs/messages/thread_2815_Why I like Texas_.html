Why I like Texas.  Especially since I was born in Chicago.  It is simple<br/>
really - Just 4 reasons.<br/>
<br/>
#1.  I retired from the Army in Texas - at Ft. Bliss.<br/>
#2.  I was offered a job that last year paid me a 6-figure income in a place<br/>
where that is a king's ransom.<br/>
#3.  Texas doesn't take a big bite of that 6-figure income as TAXES.<br/>
#4.  I am allowed to own and carry all the guns I want.  Don't get me<br/>
started about Chicago.  Or Illinois!<br/>
<br/>
I was not born in Texas.  But I got here as quick as I could!<br/>
