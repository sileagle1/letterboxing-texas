<div>My grandson spent the night with me last night, and we took a walk around eight p.m. As we returned home, we were surprised to look up and see a beautiful hot air balloon passing over our house. Then this morning at around 6:45 a.m. (he is FOUR), as we were going into McDonalds for our breakfast, we saw two more hot air balloons take off, and they gently floated right over us. He was thrilled (as was I) to be able to look right inside of them and see the flames. I'm not sure where they were going, but I certainly wished I were in one.</div>
