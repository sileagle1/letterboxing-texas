                    <html><body><div>Letterboxing week - it finally arrived!  I managed a fun trip to Coldspring earlier this week with Lightning and Nac Trail Cat, and on the day I got rained out I managed to get my workbench cleared off and ready to go again.  The only two other trips I really had my heart set to make was Shreveport and Palestine.  I kept Baby Jonah yesterday, so there wasn't much letterboxing to be done (how is it that one small infant can keep a grown-up so busy???), and Lightning and Fearless Fox had been threatening to do an overnighter this week, so I knew I needed to plan a little around their trip since I would probably have to go out and pick them up so they could go further.  I was beginning to wonder if I was going to get a solo outing since they never seemed to get in the truck and leave.  Now I do love hanging out with them, but sometimes I just want to get a little time on my own! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, yesterday, they decided tonight is the last opportunity for them to get it done, so they decided to go down to Davy Crockett National Forest and do a piece of the 4C trail.  I couldn't resist mentioning what a shame it was I didn't those National Forest maps for Christmas...  I also had decided today would be Palestine day, so as always seems to happen in our house, we wound up staging gear at the same time.  Our kitchen table, the one I cleaned to perfection a few short days ago, was covered in backpacking/hiking and letterboxing stuff.  While I was downloading clues and mapping them, Fearless Fox had to know where the GPS was (get up and get it for him), and he wanted to download some podcasts for them to listen to (so I had to hunt down some they would like and send them to his phone),  What's the weather look like? (So I had to look it up for him - by now I remembered that I had meant to ask for a second computer for Christmas.  Birthday in November, Anniversary in February - does a computer make a good 23rd anniversary gift?  It should, right?).  Lightning wanted to borrow my mess kit (get up and get it for him).  Fearless Fox couldn't find his camping cup (get up and help him look - to no avail, which was strange in itself since that cup is almost always close to the top of the heap - lesson learned - nothing good comes of cleaning).  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, we had to put our heads together and get three two-way radios talking to each other and go over our respective routes, rendezvous, and schedules, so it was a midnight night.  Now I am sure Fearless Fox didn't sleep even after being up so late because he rarely sleeps the night before they go backpacking.  His mind goes over every last detail over and over again until he's satisfied he has thought of everything.  From my side of the bed, it felt like he finally dozed off about 4 
a.m., so I didn't wake him up until around 9, when I was at the point I really wanted to get out of here, but didn't want to leave until I heard the morning status report.  Sure enough, he had thought of more things to be done and I in the meantime had thought of a box I wanted to plant and so had to pull it together on the spur of the moment.  We all finally got out of the house around noon.  It worked out fine for them since they were planning a short run today, but it was a shameful waste of half a letterboxing day, but oh well. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was within 10 miles of Palestine when my phone rang - you guessed it, Fearless Fox with something he forgot.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox: "Where are you?" </div>
<div>Me: "Ten miles from Palestine."  </div>
<div>FF: "Oh."  </div>
<div>Me (cringing and afraid of the answer): "Why?"</div>
<div>FF: "Never mind.  Just bring a full gas can tomorrow when you pick us up in case I don't have gas enough to get back to a station."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Easy enough.  Whew!  Dodged the bullet on that one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So in I head to Palestine and off to Davey Dogwood Park.  If you've never visited Davey Dogwood, you really have no idea what you're missing.  It is a unique sort of a park, built for the purpose of showing off Palestine's beautiful dogwoods for a few short weeks each year.  It's open all year round though, although if you didn't know the purpose of the park, you would wonder why this conglomeration of wind-y, curvy, uppy-downy roads that lead nowhere is called a park.  Still though, they have some pretty cool walking trails in addition to the roads.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I had already reviewed my clues and grouped them according to location.  I went to the first location and saw that there were several picnic sites taken near the boxes that were sort of close together.  I parked for a bit and tried to telepath to them to leave, but just as it didn't work on the guy at Java Jack's at the Nacogdoches gathering, it didn't work on these people either.  I decided to try the other location, but also found folks crawling around on the trail.  What was the deal with these people in this park during no-dogwood-season?  Didn't they know they were a few months early?  Didn't they know they shoulda been home playing with their Christmas presents?  Okay, maybe they were at Davey Dogwood playing with their Christmas presents since there were several bicycles and a couple of shiny four-wheelers.  I went back to the first site and decided I could probably work some angles and also make myself uninteresting enough so that I could inobtrusively tackle Baby Bear's Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking?  I started following his clues across a bridge and into the more wooded area, and sure enough, by the time I got anywhere near the box I could easily stay out of sight of the people.  I nonchalantly grabbed the box, then moved away from the hiding spot and found somewhere I could spread out a little to stamp in.  All was well and I could hear in the distance a woman managing several children.  My ears perked up when I heard her begin to call them together and issue orders.  For one thing, I was just sure I heard MO5, but for another, it sounded like she was mobilizing them!  Sure enough, she decided she wanted still pics and video of them playing near the bridge I had earlier crossed.  Now the place I was at was out of view of her picnic site, but it was in plain view of the bridge!  I tried to hurry up, but since I had just begun, I couldn't hurry much and since they quickly got to the bridge I didn't have time to move.  I decided the best thing for me to do was to keep on stamping in and appear to ignore them.  She started arranging them in various configurations (pictures of the girls, pictures of the boys, pictures of the cousins, blah blah blah).  From my standpoint, I couldn't tell if I was in the background or not, but she was having a horrible time keeping their attention and never seemed to notice that they kept turning around to stare at me.  When she started shooting video, I am sure I must have been in the background and I can only imagine when they will think when they look at their videos - "Who is that woman?"  "What is she doing?"  "Why is she just standing by that tree?"  "What does she have in her hand?"  I had long since buttoned the box back up and had about decided I was going to have to take it with me, when finally she marched them off somewhere else for some cute candid pictures of them playing in another picturesque location.  I finally got to take a good look at the stamp, and as you can guess from the title and the creator, this box epitomizes Baby Bear's twisted sense of humor perfectly!  Very cute.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So off I went to find Lucy Locket's Blueberry Scout box.  It was in the same general vicinity, but she leads the finder down a path away from the picnic area.  Now this time of year, path is a loosely defined word.  Because the undergrowth is controlled and the annual growth has died away, there are lots of wide areas we could call paths.  She specifies that the path to take runs alongside the stream the bridge crosses over.  That was well and good, but did it run right next to the stream, or say, 20 feet away?  It could've been either way today!  I took myself along, trusting LL to lead me where I needed to be.  I kept wondering if I had come to the "T" she mentioned, but it never seemed quite T-ish.  I finally realized I could look for another landmark she mentioned too, and that helped tremendously!  And finally, I came to what had to be the "T", BUT she said to turn right.  It seemed to me I would be going straight...Hmmm...I went ahead and went straight, straight being also straight up a hill.  I came to a road before I came to a "Y", so that couldn't be right.  I went back down the hill.  I went back a few yards and relooked at the "T", and I came up with the same answer.  Up the hill I went again, looking again for a "Y".  I went back down the hill again, and was about to write the box off until Spring, but I just couldn't make myself do it.  I repositioned myself and rethought the directions, but the only real way I could follow her directions was to blaze off into thicket.  That didn't seem right.  So up the hill I went again, this time to see if I could see anything from a little higher up.  As I looked down, I just wasn't getting inspired.  So down I went again.  Finally, as I stood in a very large clear area, it hit me.  Think like grass.  If I were grass, where would I grow in the Springtime?  I remember that when I planted my box there, there was tall grass over my head, so surely there was grass around this particular area too.  Think like grass.  And it worked!  I realized that the space she was referring to was in a much smaller area than I first thought, and that when I read the clues looking at particular areas as being grown up with grass, going up the hill made sense!  So up the hill I went again, and I worked the clues out and the box was right where Lucy said it would be!  I was well away from the picnicker commando woman and her army of children, so I wasn't so worried about being careful, but just as I opened the box, some people in a truck stopped at the foot of the trail I was on.  With dogs.  Big bouncy dogs.  And they were GLAD to be free!  They bounded up the path and were on me before I knew what hit me - licking me and stepping all over my feet.  Finally, their people came up the path to retrieve them (it strikes me as odd that the dogs were Golden Retrievers, and yet the people were the ones retrieving).  They looked at me oddly and I just looked back at them, and they corralled the dogs and went further up the path.  I knew it met a road shortly, so I waited for them to come back, which they did very quickly, looking at me oddly again.  They moved away, so I stamped into Lucy's Blueberry Scout box - classic LL - and I replaced the box and headed back to my car.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Geez, for a winter day it sure was a busy park!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went back to the other area and there were two young women taking turns taking pictures of each other.  When I pulled up and parked, they moved on, so I headed on up the trail.  This is the same trail my box is on, but it looks completely different in the winter time!  I was fairly certain I knew exactly where Silver Eagle's Go Dog Go was before I ever started looking for it, but I was completely thrown by the lack of vegetation!  I quickly oriented myself to it though, and dug around where I thought it should be, but came up empty-handed.  I dug some more and still no luck.  Finally I stood up straight and glanced across the log and there it was - upside down and in the open.  Thankfully it was in fine condition when I opened it, but if it was the last finder who left it that way, the box had been like that for a month.  Thankfully the trail is not that often used and folks who do walk it don't go off-trail.  I sat down on the log and broke out the colors and colored away, almost forgetting to watch for people.  I love Silver Eagle's Dr. Seuss series!  No people or dogs happened by, and I stayed a little longer just to enjoy the quiet.  I put the box back where I thought it was supposed to be and headed on.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>At this point, I had one more box in Palestine to find, but I switched gears to try to place a couple.  I've been emailing one of the scout dads that I met last spring at our big event, and I had asked him for suggestions where to place boxes in Palestine.  He gave me some ideas, but he didn't give me much as far as exact locations and it didn't occur to me to ask because, well, I'm a letterboxer.  I should be able to figure these things out!  I had done some research on one of them and had thought I had located it, but when it came to driving to it, I came up empty-handed.  I spent a little time driving around looking for it where I thought it should be, but never could quite put a finger on it.  I also have another box idea in that area, so I scoped out locations.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I eventually moved on and went and found the last box - BootsTex' Railroad Man box in his Governor Series.  Not a soul (or should I say, living soul) to be found in the cemetery.  As alwasy this was a very nice box.  I really like the style of this series.  And this cemetery is beautiful - it is tiered and spread out over a very large area, so that it is quite peaceful.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the time I found that last one, it was starting to get a little bit late.  I had one to hide at the Texas State Railroad Palestine Station and I'm hoping it won't go the way of Baby Bear's box that was there so long ago.  Again, I pulled into the park thinking it would not be crowded, but apparently they were doing some sort of twilight ride.  As I was parking I saw a family getting their kids out of the car in their pajamas.  I thought "What a good idea.  If they are going to fall asleep on the train at least they won't have to change their clothes when they get home."  Well - after I parked and got to looking around, I saw all sorts of kids and moms and even a few dads running around in their PJ's!  I was regretting not having any jammies of my own, or I might have just hopped that train!
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also wanted to plant one box at Old Pilgrim Historic Site in Elkhart, but I had forgotten to check in to where it was located and the sun was definitely getting lower by the minute.  As I was perusing my new map book for it, I heard an ad on the radio for BabyJ's BBQ in Elkhart.  I suddenly realized I hadn't eaten since this morning and I decided to hunt the Pilgrim place down the old-fashioned way - ask when I got to town.  I found BabyJ's place right off the bat and went in and ordered and asked about Pilgrim Church.  The two women in there didn't know where it was, but they went out to the pit and asked BabyJ.  He came in to the dining room about the time I was finishing a very good plate of barbecue and he filled me in on how to get there.  Nice guy and a good cook.  If you go look for my Pilgrim box, eat at BabyJ's.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I pulled in to the Pilgrim Church area just as the last streaks of sunlight were fading.  I had just enough light to check my stamp one more time, spot my hiding spot, and then put the box together.  I read the signs by the light of my headlamp and realized I really would have liked to linger there a little longer.  I stashed the box and will check it again in better light, but in the meantime I don't think it will be accidentally found.  I'll be posting the clues in the morning, and will include some of the really cool history of the location.  I never would've found this place if it hadn't been for Jim the Cub Scout dad.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now, I guess I have to run to Walmart for rodent bait - I have been hearing a mouse in the attic the whole time I've been writing this.  Gotta love living in an old house!</div>

<div>Ooh, that must have been their "Polar Express" train, after the film (which is based on a beautiful illustrated children's book).  We've ridden the TSRR before, and I found the Rusk station to be one of the prettiest buildings I've ever visited in East Texas.

<div>We were in ET at the start of this week, and started our drive home during that Wednesday morning storm.  That wasn't any fun at all!  The next time we visit, we'll definitely be doing some letterboxing.</div>

</p><div>Letterboxing week - it finally arrived!  I managed a fun trip to Coldspring earlier this week with Lightning and Nac Trail Cat, and on the day I got rained out I managed to get my workbench cleared off and ready to go again.  The only two other trips I really had my heart set to make was Shreveport and Palestine.  I kept Baby Jonah yesterday, so there wasn't much letterboxing to be done (how is it that one small infant can keep a grown-up so busy???), and Lightning and Fearless Fox had been threatening to do an overnighter this week, so I knew I needed to plan a little around their trip since I would probably have to go out and pick them up so they could go further.  I was beginning to wonder if I was going to get a solo outing since they never seemed to get in the truck and leave.  Now I do love hanging out with them, but sometimes I just want to get a little time on my own! </div>

<div>I had already reviewed my clues and grouped them according to location.  I went to the first location and saw that there were several picnic sites taken near the boxes that were sort of close together.  I parked for a bit and tried to telepath to them to leave, but just as it didn't work on the guy at Java Jack's at the Nacogdoches gathering, it didn't work on these people either.  I decided to try the other location, but also found folks crawling around on the trail.  What was the deal with these people in this park during no-dogwood-season?  Didn't they know they were a few months early?  Didn't they know they shoulda been home playing with their Christmas presents?  Okay, maybe they were at Davey Dogwood playing with their Christmas presents since there were several bicycles and a couple of shiny four-wheelers.  I went back to the first site and decided I could probably work some angles and also make myself uninteresting enough so that I could inobtrusively tackle Baby Bear's Are You Thinking What I'm Thinking?  I started following his clues across a bridge and into the more wooded area, and sure enough, by the time I got anywhere near the box I could easily stay out of sight of the people.  I nonchalantly grabbed the box, then moved away from the hiding spot and found somewhere I could spread out a little to stamp in.  All was well and I could hear in the distance a woman managing several children.  My ears perked up when I heard her begin to call them together and issue orders.  For one thing, I was just sure I heard MO5, but for another, it sounded like she was mobilizing them!  Sure enough, she decided she wanted still pics and video of them playing near the bridge I had earlier crossed.  Now the place I was at was out of view of her picnic site, but it was in plain view of the bridge!  I tried to hurry up, but since I had just begun, I couldn't hurry much and since they quickly got to the bridge I didn't have time to move.  I decided the best thing for me to do was to keep on stamping in and appear to ignore them.  She started arranging them in various configurations (pictures of the girls, pictures of the boys, pictures of the cousins, blah blah blah).  From my standpoint, I couldn't tell if I was in the background or not, but she was having a horrible time keeping their attention and never seemed to notice that they kept turning around to stare at me.  When she started shooting video, I am sure I must have been in the background and I can only imagine when they will think when they look at their videos - "Who is that woman?"  "What is she doing?"  "Why is she just standing by that tree?"  "What does she have in her hand?"  I had long since buttoned the box back up and had about decided I was going to have to take it with me, when finally she marched them off somewhere else for some cute candid pictures of them playing in another picturesque location.  I finally got to take a good look at the stamp, and as you can guess from the title and the creator, this box epitomizes Baby Bear's twisted sense of humor perfectly!  Very cute.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>So off I went to find Lucy Locket's Blueberry Scout box.  It was in the same general vicinity, but she leads the finder down a path away from the picnic area.  Now this time of year, path is a loosely defined word.  Because the undergrowth is controlled and the annual growth has died away, there are lots of wide areas we could call paths.  She specifies that the path to take runs alongside the stream the bridge crosses over.  That was well and good, but did it run right next to the stream, or say, 20 feet away?  It could've been either way today!  I took myself along, trusting LL to lead me where I needed to be.  I kept wondering if I had come to the "T" she mentioned, but it never seemed quite T-ish.  I finally realized I could look for another landmark she mentioned too, and that helped tremendously!  And finally, I came to what had to be the "T", BUT she said to turn right.  It seemed to me I would be going straight...Hmmm.<wbr>..I went ahead and went straight, straight being also straight up a hill.  I came to a road before I came to a "Y", so that couldn't be right.  I went back down the hill.  I went back a few yards and relooked at the "T", and I came up with the same answer.  Up the hill I went again, looking again for a "Y".  I went back down the hill again, and was about to write the box off until Spring, but I just couldn't make myself do it.  I repositioned myself and rethought the directions, but the only real way I could follow her directions was to blaze off into thicket.  That didn't seem right.  So up the hill I went again, this time to see if I could see anything from a little higher up.  As I looked down, I just wasn't getting inspired.  So down I went again.  Finally, as I stood in a very large clear area, it hit me.  Think like grass.  If I were grass, where would I grow in the Springtime?  I remember that when I planted my box there, there was tall grass over my head, so surely there was grass around this particular area too.  Think like grass.  And it worked!  I realized that the space she was referring to was in a much smaller area than I first thought, and that when I read the clues looking at particular areas as being grown up with grass, going up the hill made sense!  So up the hill I went again, and I worked the clues out and the box was right where Lucy said it would be!  I was well away from the picnicker commando woman and her army of children, so I wasn't so worried about being careful, but just as I opened the box, some people in a truck stopped at the foot of the trail I was on.  With dogs.  Big bouncy dogs.  And they were GLAD to be free!  They bounded up the path and were on me before I knew what hit me - licking me and stepping all over my feet.  Finally, their people came up the path to retrieve them (it strikes me as odd that the dogs were Golden Retrievers, and yet the people were the ones retrieving).  They looked at me oddly and I just looked back at them, and they corralled the dogs and went further up the path.  I knew it met a road shortly, so I waited for them to come back, which they did very quickly, looking at me oddly again.  They moved away, so I stamped into Lucy's Blueberry Scout box - classic LL - and I replaced the box and headed back to my car. </wbr></div>
<div> </div>
<div>Geez, for a winter day it sure was a busy park!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I went back to the other area and there were two young women taking turns taking pictures of each other.  When I pulled up and parked, they moved on, so I headed on up the trail.  This is the same trail my box is on, but it looks completely different in the winter time!  I was fairly certain I knew exactly where Silver Eagle's Go Dog Go was before I ever started looking for it, but I was completely thrown by the lack of vegetation!  I quickly oriented myself to it though, and dug around where I thought it should be, but came up empty-handed.  I dug some more and still no luck.  Finally I stood up straight and glanced across the log and there it was - upside down and in the open.  Thankfully it was in fine condition when I opened it, but if it was the last finder who left it that way, the box had been like that for a month.  Thankfully the trail is not that often used and folks who do walk it don't go off-trail.  I sat down on the log and broke out the colors and colored away, almost forgetting to watch for people.  I love Silver Eagle's Dr. Seuss series!  No people or dogs happened by, and I stayed a little longer just to enjoy the quiet.  I put the box back where I thought it was supposed to be and headed on.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>At this point, I had one more box in Palestine to find, but I switched gears to try to place a couple.  I've been emailing one of the scout dads that I met last spring at our big event, and I had asked him for suggestions where to place boxes in Palestine.  He gave me some ideas, but he didn't give me much as far as exact locations and it didn't occur to me to ask because, well, I'm a letterboxer.  I should be able to figure these things out!  I had done some research on one of them and had thought I had located it, but when it came to driving to it, I came up empty-handed.  I spent a little time driving around looking for it where I thought it should be, but never could quite put a finger on it.  I also have another box idea in that area, so I scoped out locations. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I eventually moved on and went and found the last box - BootsTex' Railroad Man box in his Governor Series.  Not a soul (or should I say, living soul) to be found in the cemetery.  As alwasy this was a very nice box.  I really like the style of this series.  And this cemetery is beautiful - it is tiered and spread out over a very large area, so that it is quite peaceful. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>By the time I found that last one, it was starting to get a little bit late.  I had one to hide at the Texas State Railroad Palestine Station and I'm hoping it won't go the way of Baby Bear's box that was there so long ago.  Again, I pulled into the park thinking it would not be crowded, but apparently they were doing some sort of twilight ride.  As I was parking I saw a family getting their kids out of the car in their pajamas.  I thought "What a good idea.  If they are going to fall asleep on the train at least they won't have to change their clothes when they get home."  Well - after I parked and got to looking around, I saw all sorts of kids and moms and even a few dads running around in their PJ's!  I was regretting not having any jammies of my own, or I might have just hopped that train! </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I also wanted to plant one box at Old Pilgrim Historic Site in Elkhart, but I had forgotten to check in to where it was located and the sun was definitely getting lower by the minute.  As I was perusing my new map book for it, I heard an ad on the radio for BabyJ's BBQ in Elkhart.  I suddenly realized I hadn't eaten since this morning and I decided to hunt the Pilgrim place down the old-fashioned way - ask when I got to town.  I found BabyJ's place right off the bat and went in and ordered and asked about Pilgrim Church.  The two women in there didn't know where it was, but they went out to the pit and asked BabyJ.  He came in to the dining room about the time I was finishing a very good plate of barbecue and he filled me in on how to get there.  Nice guy and a good cook.  If you go look for my Pilgrim box, eat at BabyJ's. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I pulled in to the Pilgrim Church area just as the last streaks of sunlight were fading.  I had just enough light to check my stamp one more time, spot my hiding spot, and then put the box together.  I read the signs by the light of my headlamp and realized I really would have liked to linger there a little longer.  I stashed the box and will check it again in better light, but in the meantime I don't think it will be accidentally found.  I'll be posting the clues in the morning, and will include some of the really cool history of the location.  I never would've found this place if it hadn't been for Jim the Cub Scout dad. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>And now, I guess I have to run to Walmart for rodent bait - I have been hearing a mouse in the attic the whole time I've been writing this.  Gotta love living in an old house!</div>

<div>
<p>
</p><div>Letterboxing week - it finally arrived!  I managed a fun trip to Coldspring earlier this week with Lightning and Nac Trail Cat, and on the day I got rained out I managed to get my workbench cleared off and ready to go again.  The only two other trips I really had my heart set to make was Shreveport and Palestine.  I kept Baby Jonah yesterday, so there wasn't much letterboxing to be done (how is it that one small infant can keep a grown-up so busy???), and Lightning and Fearless Fox had been threatening to do an overnighter this week, so I knew I needed to plan a little around their trip since I would probably have to go out and pick them up so they could go further.  I was beginning to wonder if I was going to get a solo outing since they never seemed to get in the truck and leave.  Now I do love hanging out with them, but sometimes I just want to get a little time on my own! 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, yesterday, they decided tonight is the last opportunity for them to get it done, so they decided to go down to Davy Crockett National Forest and do a piece of the 4C trail.  I couldn't resist mentioning what a shame it was I didn't those National Forest maps for Christmas...  I also had decided today would be Palestine day, so as always seems to happen in our house, we wound up staging gear at the same time.  Our kitchen table, the one I cleaned to perfection a few short days ago, was covered in backpacking/hiking and letterboxing stuff.  While I was downloading clues and mapping them, Fearless Fox had to know where the GPS was (get up and get it for him), and he wanted to download some podcasts for them to listen to (so I had to hunt down some they would like and send them to his phone),  What's the weather look like? (So I had to look it up for him - by now I remembered that I had meant to ask for a second computer for Christmas.  Birthday in November, Anniversary in February - does a computer make a good 23rd anniversary gift?  It should, right?).  Lightning wanted to borrow my mess kit (get up and get it for him).  Fearless Fox couldn't find his camping cup (get up and help him look - to no avail, which was strange in itself since that cup is almost always close to the top of the heap - lesson learned - nothing good comes of cleaning).  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, we had to put our heads together and get three two-way radios talking to each other and go over our respective routes, rendezvous, and schedules, so it was a midnight night.  Now I am sure Fearless Fox didn't sleep even after being up so late because he rarely sleeps the night before they go backpacking.  His mind goes over every last detail over and over again until he's satisfied he has thought of everything.  From my side of the bed, it felt like he finally dozed off about 4 
a.m., so I didn't wake him up until around 9, when I was at the point I really wanted to get out of here, but didn't want to leave until I heard the morning status report.  Sure enough, he had thought of more things to be done and I in the meantime had thought of a box I wanted to plant and so had to pull it together on the spur of the moment.  We all finally got out of the house around noon.  It worked out fine for them since they were planning a short run today, but it was a shameful waste of half a letterboxing day, but oh well. 
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I was within 10 miles of Palestine when my phone rang - you guessed it, Fearless Fox with something he forgot.  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Fearless Fox: "Where are you?" </div>
<div>Me: "Ten miles from Palestine."  </div>
<div>FF: "Oh."  </div>
<div>Me (cringing and afraid of the answer): "Why?"</div>
<div>FF: "Never mind.  Just bring a full gas can tomorrow when you pick us up in case I don't have gas enough to get back to a station."</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Easy enough.  Whew!  Dodged the bullet on that one!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>So in I head to Palestine and off to Davey Dogwood Park.  If you've never visited Davey Dogwood, you really have no idea what you're missing.  It is a unique sort of a park, built for the purpose of showing off Palestine's beautiful dogwoods for a few short weeks each year.  It's open all year round though, although if you didn't know the purpose of the park, you would wonder why this conglomeration of wind-y, curvy, uppy-downy roads that lead nowhere is called a park.  Still though, they have some pretty cool walking trails in addition to the roads.
