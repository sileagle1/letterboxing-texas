<br/>
My family and I started letterboxing this weekend and love it!  <br/>
Unfortunately, we are in the Shreveport area and there is very little <br/>
interest (or boxes) here.   We will be making lots of trips to east <br/>
Texas to search for boxes!  Which ones should we put at the top of our <br/>
list to find?<br/>

                    <html><body><div>Good Morning Munchkins!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I live in Northeast Texas, so I'm not that far from you!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>If I were venturing over the border to Texas, the first group I would hit are in Tatum, northeast of Henderson - that's the closest concentration to you.  Blue Butterfly has a seven box series in Martin Creek Lake State Park, Lucy Locket has one box, and I have another box, all in the same park.  Then, Blue Butterfly and Lucy Locket each have a box in another park in Tatum.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are a couple in Jefferson (north of Marshall) which I haven't yet found, but I understand are very good.  Blue Butterfly has one in Longview and it should be a good box (I haven't found that one either).  Sadly, the area north of I 20 is pretty sparse right now, but some of us have a plan to concentrate on that area soon.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Once you've hit Tatum, the next closest large concentration of boxes is in Cherokee County - my county - with over 50 boxes.   There are some that are missing in this area though, so if you head this way, contact me so I can tell you which ones aren't in place anymore.  
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Nacogdoches has quite a few and depending on where exactly you are in relationship to Shreveport, it may be close to you as well.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>There are quite a few others scattered around, and a few other smaller concentrations, so be sure to check the listings to see how they fit into your ventures.  As an example, there are two in Henderson which you could probably get with Tatum.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Unfortunately, you are going to have to make longer trips for awhile, but The Boxalots have family in the Shreveport area and so are committed to seeding it with boxes (they are the authors of some of the ones you've found, I'm sure).  And once you've found a few, you won't be able to resist planting.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Let me offer you a couple words of advice - as you find boxes, please take the time to rehide them well and take a moment to notify the owners of the boxes you find to tell them you found them and let them know the condition.  This will encourage placers to keep on keeping on, and may even encourage them into planting in your direction.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Best of luck to you.  Feel free to contact me on or off the list if you want some insight, and I'm sure you'll get similar offers from others in this area!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>See you on the trail,</div>-- <br/>Barefoot Lucy<br/>"It's not about footwear, it's about philosophy"

<div>Lucky you - East Texas has lots of wonderful letterboxes - enough for 
several trips!  Since we had a Texas Letterboxing gathering in Rusk State 
Park in March, there are several around that area and near Jacksonville, just to 
mention one possible destination!  Of coure, if you get over to Dallas/Ft. 
Worth/Arlington/the Mid-Cities (Grapevine, Colleyville, Southlake, Keller, 
Hurst, Euless, Bedford, Denton areas), there are many many more!  And south 
of Dallas, near Waco, there are many more.  And of course, Austin, San 
Antonio, and all over the Houston area are just thick with letterboxes!  
Come have a good time finding them.  BUT, as several recent postings have 
emphasized, please exercise a little stealth in busy areas and please please 
please recover the boxes well after rehiding them, so they don't 
disappear!  Happy boxing!  -- Viewfinder</div></body></html>
