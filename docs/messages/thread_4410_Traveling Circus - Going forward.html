                    <div class="plaintext-content">To late for this event (this weekend), but all future TALE events I would like whomever has the circus to bring it to the event (or if you are not going try to get to someone who is, or get back on the road before event so someone who is going can go get). BUT, the box should not be available at the TALE event to anyone whom has not found it already.  It should be brought to me (Baby Bear), and a specified time will be given for any pre-finders to come and get all the new stamps.  That way those who found before don't get the box when it is placed, giving others a chance to find it (and those who found early can catch up with all the new entertainers).   I will then return it to the person who found and they can then place it.   <br>
<br>
Some other guidelines I would like to add (and since I master minded this BOZO adventure I hope y'all will indulge me).  If you make the mad scramble to get the box when it is place, please have it on the road again within a month.  Believe me this last 6 months have been heck at work and home, so I understand Life getting in the way, but please try to honor this request.   If you get it, and find you don't have time to carve an entry, then don't, just hide in a good spot and let someone else go for it (you can add one later at next TALE event).  <br>
<br>
Can't wait to see everyone at the Event, and for those that can not make it we will see you next year (or on the trail)!<br>
