I told her there are a bunch of motorcycle only spaces up front. She says, "Oooh, let's go tip some over." Without missing a beat, I replied, "I don't think it's as easy as tipping cows, the biker's actually run after you." Where does this woman come up with these ideas?<br/></div> <div>I'm with the cows, I'm loving this weather. I just picked up a full pickup load of FREE oak firewood. I've joined <a href="http://www.freecycle.com">www.freecycle.com</a>. Way cool group. This lady ordered a load of wood and it was too much for her. Oh, so where was I? Oh, yes, I can't wait to have a fire in the fireplace. I never did real well with burning mesquite wood. One, it made me hungry for bbq and two, the fumes weren't good with my asthma. Bring on the cold and the marshmallows.</div> <div> </div> <div>Janet, BF</div>

<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>However, having hung out with bikers for a few months a few years ago, I know without a doubt that what you told your mom is right  bikers DO chase you.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>They can be some of the most laid-back, big-hearted folks, but they are a little sensitive about their bikes.</font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">We have a good friend who married a biker chick once.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was a die hard Harley woman and their marriage ceremony had two elements I have never heard before or since:
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>1) the use of the word a** in the sermon  the biker preacher said "and ________, if you don't take good care of her, we're all gonna come and kick your a** ".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>And I think they would've too.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The other was that she had an out clause in her vows  if he didn't buy her a Harley within six months of their wedding day, the marriage was over.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Thankfully we never had to find out if that was true  he got her the Harley almost right away.</font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">Shortly after they married, she was intent on introducing us to her friends, so off to an impromptu bike rally we went with them.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>We showed up at a big piece of land somewhere on a very windy road between Mabank and Canton with a huge party barn and a permanent outdoor stage and a track of sorts and about a hundred bikes  now remember, this was impromptu!
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Turns out someone from her bike club wanted to throw an off-the-books reception for them and we were lucky enough to be included as "close friends of the groom".<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">
  </span>I quickly got shuffled off into the women's circle where I met some really cool women!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>They welcomed me into their clique as though they had known me forever on the simple basis that I was a friend to their friend.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I have no idea how many women were there, but we moved around as a group and watched the bands play for awhile, then went and watched the men slow-racing and a few of the women jumped into the races.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>During all of this, large amounts of spicy, rich food and beer and liquor circulated.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Now I am not a huge drinker, but I figured with a little management and some food on my stomach, I could hold my own, so I only accepted about every third beer that was offered, until later in the evening when they started coming even faster and I could only take every fourth or fifth one.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And then at some point, the host of the party had a huge batch of  something  that he wanted to share with everyone as a toast to the newlyweds.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  
</span>I asked what was in it and never understood, finally just settled for asking if it was at least legal, to which I was assured it was.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>He passed around the cups and made a toast and everyone slugged away their  whatever  and I felt as though mine had turned me inside out because it was so powerful.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>I still have no idea what it was or what was in it, but it sure made an impression on me!<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was somewhere during the evening that I started feeling a little loopy and I suggested to my new friends that we skip over to the bikes and tip them over.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>All of a sudden, everyone got very sober and assured me that would NOT be a good idea.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>It was almost as if someone had done it before and had never been heard of again!
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">There were a few other such jaunts with our biker friends, but for the most part we had to swear off of them because they were too hard on us.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>The last time I saw them was at our friend's wife's funeral a couple of years ago and it was like old home week  they all remembered me like we had just seen each other yesterday and I remembered them, although I had to kind of squint my eyes to make them look blurry like they had when we were hanging out with them.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Oddly, there had not been a suit in the bunch at their wedding, but every biker that showed up for the funeral was dressed to the nines.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font>
</p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif"> </font></p>
<p class="MsoMessageHeader" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 2pt"><font face="arial,sans-serif">About two years after our friends had married, she developed a deadly strain of breast cancer that she fought off for about four years before she finally succumbed to it.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>She was a mean woman, tough as nails and mean to the core.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>But there was something about her that some folks seemed to see in her and those folks who found that "something" and loved her were fiercely loyal to her, even while acknowledging she was mean.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>After most of the mourners left her graveside, the bikers and a few others of us remained.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>Her husband, our friend, opened the remaining bottles of champagne that he had from their wedding  bottles he had hoped to drink on their anniversaries to come  and we passed the bottles around, everyone swigging from them, until they were empty.
<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span>And you know, even at the funeral, I had an almost irresistible urge to tip over the bikes.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">  </span></font></p><br/><br/>

<div>Today I was telling my mom about a billiard place near my house. I told her there are a bunch of motorcycle only spaces up front. She says, "Oooh, let's go tip some over." Without missing a beat, I replied, "I don't think it's as easy as tipping cows, the biker's actually run after you." Where does this woman come up with these ideas?

<div>I'm with the cows, I'm loving this weather. I just picked up a full pickup load of FREE oak firewood. I've joined <a href="http://www.freecycle.com/" onclick="return top.js.OpenExtLink(window,event,this)" target="_blank">
www.freecycle.com</a>. Way cool group. This lady ordered a load of wood and it was too much for her. Oh, so where was I? Oh, yes, I can't wait to have a fire in the fireplace. I never did real well with burning mesquite wood. One, it made me hungry for bbq and two, the fumes weren't good with my asthma. Bring on the cold and the marshmallows.

In fact most of the cows I encountered today were discussing how pleased they were that the cooler weather showed up. To be honest, I couldn't understand what the tumbleweeds were talking about but I think a couple of them were planning to suddenly roll across the pasture and see if they could spook the cows. Who says we don't know how to have fun in Texas?

<div>I was just telling my mom that I wanted to make a trip out there for the Fall (pumpkin patch). The only time I went to East Texas was the weekend after 4th of July (several years ago). We went to Gilmer for my DH's family reunion. I have never been so miserably hot in my entire life. I now what Hell is going to feel like. The only air conditioned place available was where all the older generations were hanging out. I used every excuse to go to the store that I could find.
</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I would love to see the country in better weather. I did love the drive there and home (the ac'd car helped). We stopped at several roadside stands on the way home. </div>
<div> </div>
<div>I do hope y'all realize that my comment about tumbleweeds and cows was tongue in cheek though. I believe in the old saying, "If you can't say something nice, then don't say anything at all." I loved all the photos chosen and would love to see the ones that were submitted. I think photography is a beautiful art form and enjoy viewing other people's pictures. It's like looking through someone elses eyes and seeing in a completely different way than I might see for myself.

 see a line of bikes in front of some establishment and I am sorely tempted to just push one  only one, but THE one that would send them all toppling. <span>  </span>However, having hung out with bikers for a few months a few years ago, I know without a doubt that what you told your mom is right  bikers DO chase you.<span>   </span>They can be some of the most laid-back, big-hearted folks, but they are a little sensitive about their bikes.</font></div> <div class="MsoMessageHeader"><font face="arial,sans-serif"></font> </div> <div class="MsoMessageHeader"><font face="arial,sans-serif">We have a good friend who married a biker chick once.<span>  </span>She was a die hard Harley woman and their marriage ceremony had two elements I have never heard before or since: <span>  </span>1) the use of the word a** in the sermon  the biker preacher said "and ________, if you don't take good care of her, we're all gonna come and kick your a** ".<span>  
 </span>And I think they would've too.<span>  </span>The other was that she had an out clause in her vows  if he didn't buy her a Harley within six months of their wedding day, the marriage was over. <span>  </span>Thankfully we never had to find out if that was true  he got her the Harley almost right away.</font></div> <div class="MsoMessageHeader"><font face="arial,sans-serif"></font> </div> <div class="MsoMessageHeader"><font face="arial,sans-serif">Shortly after they married, she was intent on introducing us to her friends, so off to an impromptu bike rally we went with them.<span>   </span>We showed up at a big piece of land somewhere on a very windy road between Mabank and Canton with a huge party barn and a permanent outdoor stage and a track of sorts and about a hundred bikes  now remember, this was impromptu! <span>  </span>Turns out someone from her bike club wanted to throw an off-the-books reception for them and we were lucky
 enough to be included as "close friends of the groom".<span>   </span>I quickly got shuffled off into the women's circle where I met some really cool women!<span>  </span>They welcomed me into their clique as though they had known me forever on the simple basis that I was a friend to their friend. <span>  </span>I have no idea how many women were there, but we moved around as a group and watched the bands play for awhile, then went and watched the men slow-racing and a few of the women jumped into the races. <span>  </span>During all of this, large amounts of spicy, rich food and beer and liquor circulated.<span>  </span>Now I am not a huge drinker, but I figured with a little management and some food on my stomach, I could hold my own, so I only accepted about every third beer that was offered, until later in the evening when they started coming even faster and I could only take every fourth or fifth one. <span>  </span>And then at some
 point, the host of the party had a huge batch of  something  that he wanted to share with everyone as a toast to the newlyweds.<span>  </span>I asked what was in it and never understood, finally just settled for asking if it was at least legal, to which I was assured it was.<span>  </span>He passed around the cups and made a toast and everyone slugged away their  whatever  and I felt as though mine had turned me inside out because it was so powerful. <span>  </span>I still have no idea what it was or what was in it, but it sure made an impression on me!<span>  </span>It was somewhere during the evening that I started feeling a little loopy and I suggested to my new friends that we skip over to the bikes and tip them over. <span>  </span>All of a sudden, everyone got very sober and assured me that would NOT be a good idea.<span>  </span>It was almost as if someone had done it before and had never been heard of again! <span>

                    <html><body><div>Funny, I actually thought of that today. I'm trying to get my mom to book a cruise that leaves out of Galveston (preferably) or at the furthest, New Orleans. If we have to fly, we usually fly non-revenue. For those of you that don't know what that is, it's hell on a plane. You get behind standby, behind luggage and animals, behind anyone that might want to fly that day. It took me a week to get back to Oregon from DFW one year. It was Memorial Day weekend, what was I thinking?</div> <div> </div> <div>The week went like this. Get dressed up (we had to dress for success to fly free back then), go to the airport (which is always so much fun, NOT!), wait for my name to not be called. Go back to my mother's, get back on the bathing suit. Go back out to the pool and swim and sun (it was still in style back then). Wait for the next flight to repeat the above. If I'm lying, I'm dying. That happened for an entire week.</div> <div> </div> <div>Wow, what got me
 started on that? Oh yeah, cruise vs WDW. I also love the drive to Galveston.

<div>Way off subject, I partied with his granddaughter when I was a kid (rich kids sure know how to party). I was super impressed with their bathroom, it was as large as my bedroom, but it wasn't impressive. They didn't have a couch or anything, just lots of room.

<div>Speaking of Africa (most of what you said was over my head, but I think I got the idea), my mom says she'll probably never make it to Africa, so she wants to go to the Florida WDW Animal Kingdom.

If this helps, I have been out of Galveston and New Orleans on <br>
Carnival Cruises.  The atmosphere on the boats is totally <br>
different.  The Galveston cruise has mostly Texans on it, and it <br>
much friendlier then the New Orleans cruise.  Not that the N.O. is <br>
bad and just felt more like home on the Gaveston boat. I thought the <br>
staff was nicer out of Gal. too.  As far the boats go, built wise, <br>
they are the same.  Anyway if you questions just email me, there was <br>
plenty of things I wish I knew before I went. <br>

I left my DH tonight to go to work, he <br/>was <br/>&gt; watching the Imo Jima movie with JW in it. <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Way off subject, I partied with his granddaughter when I was a <br/>&gt; kid (rich kids sure know how to party). I was super impressed with <br/>&gt; their bathroom, it was as large as my bedroom, but it wasn't <br/>&gt; impressive. They didn't have a couch or anything, just lots of <br/>room.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Speaking of Africa (most of what you said was over my head, but <br/>I <br/>&gt; think I got the idea), my mom says she'll probably never make it <br/>to <br/>&gt; Africa, so she wants to go to the Florida WDW Animal Kingdom. You <br/>can <br/>&gt; get a room that overlooks the animal park and then go on <br/>a 'safari'
 <br/>&gt; for feeding time, at like 4:30 in the morning. I want to go on a <br/>&gt; cruise.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Janet, BF<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Mike Olbrisch &lt;mike-2007@&gt; wrote:<br/>&gt; &gt; I think it was HONDO - with John Wayne. He had a <br/>&gt; really SUPER dog in that movie.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Off the subject - my favorite movie is HATARI with John Wayne. I <br/>&gt; have always wanted to visit the Momella Game Reserve. But it just <br/>&gt; isn't going to happen - the world is no longer the safe area it <br/>was <br/>&gt; back then - especially East Africa.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; One scene in that movie always sucks my breathe away. All the <br/>&gt; vehicles are on-line side by side and moving out across the <br/>Serengeti <br/>&gt; grasslands - hunting for animals. It makes me flash-back to the <br/>scout <br/>&gt; platoon - moving out ahead of the armor across Wadi-Al-Batin - <br/>&gt; looking for the Nebuctinezzer Division of the Republican
 Guard. We <br/>&gt; found them late that evening.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Anyway - Hondo was the one with the notes in the tumbleweeds <br/>from <br/>&gt; the lady with the boy, her husband was shot by John Wayne. A very <br/>&gt; good story.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; John Wayne can make you cry! &lt;grin&gt;<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Mike.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; ------------<wbr>---------<wbr>---------<wbr>---<br/>&gt; &gt; From: <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a> <br/>&gt; [mailto:<a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>] On Behalf Of janet clark<br/>&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, September 13, 2007 3:55 AM<br/>&gt; &gt; To: <a href="mailto:letterboxingtexas%40yahoogroups.com">letterboxingtexas@<wbr>yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a><br/>&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [letterboxingtexas] Re: Have you seen the gorgeous <br/>&gt; photos?<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt;
 &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; I never knew that. That is so cool. There was a western movie <br/>&gt; that was based on sticking letters (not letterboxes) on <br/>tumbleweeds. <br/>&gt; Can't remember what it was. I cried though.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Janet, BF<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; .<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; ------------<wbr>---------<wbr>---------<wbr>---<br/>&gt; &gt; Tonight's top picks.
