the State Park while you are at the gathering, so I<br/>
thought I would update you on what I learned today.<br/>
<br/>
Ironically, the proprietor is leaving Friday evening<br/>
to go to Spring for a festival there.  He will be at<br/>
the winery until closing Friday, which is 6:00 p.m.<br/>
and his assistant will be there the next day all day. <br/>
Although the assistant is capable, I'm sure, I would<br/>
urge y'all to go by there Friday evening if you<br/>
possibly can because the winemaker himself really<br/>
rounds out the experience.<br/>
<br/>
This little winery is a nod to the rural spirit of<br/>
East Texas.  Don't expect to compare Chardonnays or<br/>
discuss vintages - their wines are purely fun and<br/>
untraditional, yet tasty all the same.  Expect stories<br/>
galore as he pours for you.  He considers his winery<br/>
to be a family place - so he has root beer on tap for<br/>
the kiddos and has been known to slip a little<br/>
chocolate their way if he has it on hand.  <br/>
<br/>
His assistant also makes candles in wine glasses and<br/>
wine glass charms and she also has bath oils for sale.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
The building is humble, but you can detect the pride<br/>
they feel as they talk about their product.  I've been<br/>
there now a few times and I always feel good when I<br/>
leave (and that's even when I DON'T sample!).<br/>
