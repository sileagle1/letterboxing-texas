                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am fairly new to boxing and to this group but have managed to <br>
introduce this pasttime to a neighbor and coworker.  After losing my <br>
first planted box I was hesitant to try again.  But try again I did.  <br>
First I planted it and left it out for a week and checked back on it <br>
twice (once following a severe storm) to see if it would remain prior <br>
to posting the clues.  I finally post the clues and advised my <br>
neighbors and coworkers of the plant.  It seemed the race was on to <br>
see which of the new boxers could get to it before Grizzled Gryphon.  <br>
Of course the neighbors managed to get there first because the <br>
coworkers had to work.  I was off to Florence and Killeen to find <br>
those boxes with my frequent trail mates (Tx Dragonfly and Crazy bout <br>
dragons)with the plan that tx dragonfly would go find my new box on <br>
the way home.  The coworker is stuck at work and chomping at the bit <br>
to get out there.  So after work she sets out with another coworker <br>
to see if it can be located.  This same coworker was the one that <br>
notified me of my lost Heritage Park box via cell phone.  Well <br>
shortly after work she begins her trek and shortly after that I get a <br>
call from a cell phone saying that once again my box is missing.  I <br>
told her she was jinxing my boxes because it was there just a short <br>
time ago as Tx dragonfly had just found it.  About 15 minutes later <br>
the phone rings again and she informs me that upon returning to her <br>
vehicle there is a note posted stating "That which you seek will be <br>
returned to its location in 30 minutes".  Well I get excited because <br>
who else would it be but the legendary GG.  The coworker goes off to <br>
find a different box with the goal of coming back shortly.  I also <br>
cautioned them that they were not being secretive enough and needed <br>
to be much more discreet.  A short time later I get another phone <br>
call and all they could say was "It was Him!!, It was Him!!".  Now I <br>
am inspired to plant more boxes and see if we can lure the legendary <br>
GG out of his lair.<br>

I believe this one must use his wings to swoop down and pick up boxes because he seems to always be just a step ahead, but never quite caught in the act. Of course, he claims to have gotten his trailname from a vist from the Man on the Flaming Pie (John Lennon). More mystery.....</font></div>
