He rides a Recumbent Bicycle that rests him back rather than on his<br/>
arms forward.<br/>
<br/>
I think he will have his cousin's name written on his leg to be riding<br/>
for since you won't be able to see his shirt back where they normally<br/>
put it.<br/>
<br/>
If you see a big,handsome, smiling transplanted Texan say Hi Brian for<br/>
me will you?<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did this ride many years ago and it was a lot of fun, as long as <br/>
the wind was at my back.  The route goes through some very scenic <br/>
places, including Buescher &amp; Bastrop State Parks, so it helps take <br/>
your mind off the pain.  Not sure I could make it anymore; partly <br/>
because of my knees, but mainly because I would stop too much to <br/>
letterbox!  Tell him good luck.<br/>
