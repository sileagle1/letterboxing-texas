He rides a Recumbent Bicycle that rests him back rather than on his<br>
arms forward.<br>
<br>
I think he will have his cousin's name written on his leg to be riding<br>
for since you won't be able to see his shirt back where they normally<br>
put it.<br>

If you see a big,handsome, smiling transplanted Texan say Hi Brian for<br>
me will you?<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I did this ride many years ago and it was a lot of fun, as long as <br>
the wind was at my back.  The route goes through some very scenic <br>
places, including Buescher & Bastrop State Parks, so it helps take <br>
your mind off the pain.  Not sure I could make it anymore; partly <br>
because of my knees, but mainly because I would stop too much to <br>
letterbox!  Tell him good luck.<br>
