                    <div class="plaintext-content">I casually woke up this morning at about 8:15, ready to enjoy having a day with my 2 year old granddaughters playing at our house while their older brothers had an adventure with their moms. I stopped by my computer and immediately saw the message from GG, and I hopped into my jeans, grabbed my bag and left. The girls were coming at 10:30 so I had two hours to dash to the Greenbelt (exactly 25 miles from my front door) and try to get that box. I actually read the rest of the clues while sitting at a light on 380 and thought, "It's at the railroad trestle? That thing's a mile away from the parking lot!"<br/>
<br/>
I pulled into the lot at exactly 9:00 a.m. and noticed I had a police officer follow me into the lot, with his lights flashing. Uh oh. (Okay, 25 miles in 30 minutes, stopping at about ten lights on 380? Maybe I was going a tad too fast.) I just smiled and waved at the policeman and continued to put on my running shoes, and lo and behold, he waved and turned off his light and drove off. I guess he got a better call. I walked at a pretty brisk pace down that long trail to the RR trestle, and then panicked when I noticed how I was going to have to go under the tracks and through some weeds to get to the 3rd trestle. When I got between the 3rd and 4th trestle as stated in the clues, I found the weeds were about a foot high, and not knowing if the box was still even there, I had doubts about whether I would find it or not. Then I looked down and saw a couple of nice little logs laying on top of a pile of rocks and knew that must be it. When I pulled the box out and found it weighed 8 lbs. 1 1/4 oz. (I weighed it on my digital kitchen scale when I got home), I muttered a few words about how far GG had hidden it from the parking lot then began struggling to get it stuffed into my backpack. It almost  fit, but I couldn't get the zipper to completely close so the camouflage box was sticking out the top of my pack. I mused how I hoped not to be caught with a large camo-covered box under a RR track (especially with my near run-in with the police 15 minutes prior) when suddenly one of those one-man RR trolleys passed on the tracks right over my head. YIKES! Luckily he didn't see me.<br/>
<br/>
Then I began the one mile hike back, lugging that heavy box - did I say 8 lbs. 1 1/4 oz? Finally just before I got to the parking lot, I took my jacket and tied it over the end of my backpack so the box wouldn't show. There was some activity in the parking lot, so I casually tossed it in my car and started putting my top down for a much more leisurely drive home, hoping not to antagonize the law again. <br/>
<br/>
Here's the secret (I learned a few years ago): Don't stop for a cup of coffee. Get the box! And the lesson I learned today? Don't stop for the cops. Just wave and smile and keep on truckin.<br/>

<p>Yep. I couldn't drive my Jeep because it doesn't accelerate fast enough for the task at hand! After reading the emails, I was wondering if that was you! It's been over a year since I last saw you! So basically, I only beat you by about 30 minutes. (It took me 35 minutes to hike to the rr and back.) I got back to my car at 9:30, so you were actually there earlier than you thought! <br/>

&gt; Puddle Splasher, do you by any chance drive a Lexus?  I parked my minivan<br/>
&gt; next to a lady who tossed something into her car, got in, and put the top<br/>
&gt; down.  I almost asked that lady if she knew anything about a tour bus, but<br/>
&gt; didn't want to freak her out if she wasn't... well, you.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; If that WAS you, then it's killing me to know how close I was!!  I saw GG's<br/>
&gt; email this morning, packed up three tiny kids and myself all in a flurry (no<br/>
&gt; small feat), and drove an hour north up to Denton in the hopes of getting<br/>
&gt; that box.  We got to the parking lot sometime a little after 10, I think,<br/>
&gt; but I'm not positive.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; At least we all got some exercise, saw many interesting snails and<br/>
&gt; dandelions, and got to dig around under a railroad trestle!   :)<br/>

&gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt;   I casually woke up this morning at about 8:15, ready to enjoy having a<br/>
&gt; &gt; day with my 2 year old granddaughters playing at our house while their older<br/>
&gt; &gt; brothers had an adventure with their moms. I stopped by my computer and<br/>
&gt; &gt; immediately saw the message from GG, and I hopped into my jeans, grabbed my<br/>
&gt; &gt; bag and left. The girls were coming at 10:30 so I had two hours to dash to<br/>
&gt; &gt; the Greenbelt (exactly 25 miles from my front door) and try to get that box.<br/>
&gt; &gt; I actually read the rest of the clues while sitting at a light on 380 and<br/>
&gt; &gt; thought, "It's at the railroad trestle? That thing's a mile away from the<br/>
&gt; &gt; parking lot!"<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; I pulled into the lot at exactly 9:00 a.m. and noticed I had a police<br/>
&gt; &gt; officer follow me into the lot, with his lights flashing. Uh oh. (Okay, 25<br/>
&gt; &gt; miles in 30 minutes, stopping at about ten lights on 380? Maybe I was going<br/>
&gt; &gt; a tad too fast.) I just smiled and waved at the policeman and continued to<br/>
&gt; &gt; put on my running shoes, and lo and behold, he waved and turned off his<br/>
&gt; &gt; light and drove off. I guess he got a better call. I walked at a pretty<br/>
&gt; &gt; brisk pace down that long trail to the RR trestle, and then panicked when I<br/>
&gt; &gt; noticed how I was going to have to go under the tracks and through some<br/>
&gt; &gt; weeds to get to the 3rd trestle. When I got between the 3rd and 4th trestle<br/>
&gt; &gt; as stated in the clues, I found the weeds were about a foot high, and not<br/>
&gt; &gt; knowing if the box was still even there, I had doubts about whether I would<br/>
&gt; &gt; find it or not. Then I looked down and saw a couple of nice little logs<br/>
&gt; &gt; laying on top of a pile of rocks and knew that must be it. When I pulled the<br/>
&gt; &gt; box out and found it weighed 8 lbs. 1 1/4 oz. (I weighed it on my digital<br/>
&gt; &gt; kitchen scale when I got home), I muttered a few words about how far GG had<br/>
&gt; &gt; hidden it from the parking lot then began struggling to get it stuffed into<br/>
&gt; &gt; my backpack. It almost fit, but I couldn't get the zipper to completely<br/>
&gt; &gt; close so the camouflage box was sticking out the top of my pack. I mused how<br/>
&gt; &gt; I hoped not to be caught with a large camo-covered box under a RR track<br/>
&gt; &gt; (especially with my near run-in with the police 15 minutes prior) when<br/>
&gt; &gt; suddenly one of those one-man RR trolleys passed on the tracks right over my<br/>
&gt; &gt; head. YIKES! Luckily he didn't see me.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Then I began the one mile hike back, lugging that heavy box - did I say 8<br/>
&gt; &gt; lbs. 1 1/4 oz? Finally just before I got to the parking lot, I took my<br/>
&gt; &gt; jacket and tied it over the end of my backpack so the box wouldn't show.<br/>
&gt; &gt; There was some activity in the parking lot, so I casually tossed it in my<br/>
&gt; &gt; car and started putting my top down for a much more leisurely drive home,<br/>
&gt; &gt; hoping not to antagonize the law again.<br/>
&gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; Here's the secret (I learned a few years ago): Don't stop for a cup of<br/>
&gt; &gt; coffee. Get the box! And the lesson I learned today? Don't stop for the<br/>
&gt; &gt; cops. Just wave and smile and keep on truckin.<br/>

                    <html><body><p>Hi Heather,<br/><br/>You just happened in as the Texas Tour Bus was on the move! We have also a Traveling Circus, which is floating around too.<br/><br/>These two particular boxes are special because they are oversized and they move from place to place. The placer posts the clues on this list, and only on this list, and everyone races off to be the finder. The finder removes the box and reports back to this list when it is found, but usually not before several other folks have also made the mad dash and come up empty-handed! <br/>
<br/>The finder places a new member of the bus or circus (a carved stamp appropriate to the box), whichever the case may be, and then hides it somewhere new and starts the whole process over.<br/><br/>Key elements are that they cannot leave Texas, the clues have to be posted on this list, and the boxes can't be passed hand-to-hand so that a level playing field is maintained and so that all the players understand the game. Are there other elements I'm forgetting? The rules for the Circus are the same as those for the Bus, right?<br/>
<br/>The tour bus being discussed today is actually the second such bus, the first being MIA. The creator of the first bus is TeamKing, who has since moved to England. Team King came up with this great game which has proven to be very entertaining for all of us and the source of much banter all around. <br/>
<br/>And let it be known that this is NOT the first time Puddle Splasher has snagged the box out from under the noses of someone else.<br/><br/>Lucy<br/><br/><br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Fri, Mar 20, 2009 at 11:01 PM, Heather <span dir="ltr">&lt;<a href="mailto:heathercarnes@sbcglobal.net">heathercarnes@sbcglobal.net</a>&gt;</span> wrote:<br/>
