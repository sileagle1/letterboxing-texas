                        I may have missed it, but are there any plans for Friday night next week?

                        I just happened to check the TPWD website to see if any campsites had

Grab the last one QUICK if you still need one!

Thanks you to Silver 
Eagle and Baby Bear for a spectacular day, it was such fun to see everyone 
again, and to meet some new faces!  I am sorry we arrived late, it seems 
like we missed a lot...
