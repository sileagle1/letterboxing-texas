                        We found Great Texas Mosquito Festival.  A lovely stamp, gorgeous
logbook and a nice hiding spot overlooking Buffalo Bayou.  Overall, a
fantastic box I highly recommend.

                        We were able to make a quick trip to Lucy Locketts latest box in Lufkin today - Land of the Little Angel.

Great box and also a really nice trail.
