if you place any new ones before then, let me know.

Howdy, everyone!

I've been busy squirreling away some boxes around downtown Austin. 
We'll see how well they survive!  I got clues together for 3 of them

It's happening!  The first Letterboxing Event in Oklahoma (correct 
me if I'm wrong).  I'm trying to get a web page set up on Silent 
Doug's site, but in the meantime, here's a little info:

Hey Metroboxers,
Since our last post we made another box!  The Cupcake Kid made his 
first box and placed it in Arlington this evening.  Enjoy!

Sorry you did not find Texas Turtle.  I hope to get
back down that way around Thanksgiving, so will try
