                        We may all be hiders and seekers, but Geocachers and Letterboxers are not the same, and if you don't believe that then you are more of a Geocacher than Letterboxer.  Geocachers want the public to...

                        http://www.letterboxing.org/lbna/tpwpermit.htm Thought this was interesting.  The way I read it, the rules don't apply to us at all, being non-cachers and all. . .

                        I appreciate it if someone puts a note in their box listing on LBNA to contact them to obtain the clues.  This is MUCH better than a link to AQ where I get a message that basically says '"Sucks to be...
