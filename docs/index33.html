                        I replaced the log and moved the box, hopefully for the last time, and  clues have been updated.  Very sad to see all the dead trees at Edith Moore due to the drought, but still a nice place to...

                        I was noticing the folks that have signed up for Open Space's event at Stephen F. Austin State Park and was glad to see several new Houston letterboxers that we haven't met.  That's good for...

                        It does not look good for event next year, or any boxes surviving in the park.  But most of all this was a great park due to the trees, and that seems to be gone.  Here is the latest report I could...
