We placed a new microbox (Walk the Dog) yesterday at Ervan Chew Park 
in central Houston.  It's our typical punny nonsense (we just can't 
help ourselves).

We are going to Austin next weekend, and having never been to Austin, I 
have no idea which boxes will be near where we are staying, or easy to find for 
an out of towner.  
 
If anyone can tell...

the CelticLions crew – with everything from kitchen cabinets falling out
of the ceiling just in time for Thanksgiving guests, to cardboard...

Not sure about the official Groundhog, but no way

Wow!  I just went to update my Kemah Stingray microbox (it's 
definitely missing) on the webpage and decided to look and see if there are any 
new boxes in my area.
 
There are 11 new ones!!! ...

My Lone Star Hiker Microbox has been replaced, thanks to
Baby Bear.  It is in the same general area, but clues have
changed a little, so reprint them before going after it.
