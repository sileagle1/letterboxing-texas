  I have been 
thinking about Lucy's question about logbooks.  I think what I like best is 
to find a DRY logbook :)  When I make mine I try to make them with an

                        The one part of planting a box that I really don't enjoy is making the logbook.  Consequently, I have boring logbooks.  They get the job done, but it sure would be fun to have a little nicer book in...
