I had a ball at the gathering today!  It was 
great to see old friends and meet some new ones. I didn't even feel like looking

                        Now I am just an old Granny Butterfly from up North but I think that Baby Bear is way too cute for stew!!  Now dessert might be a consideration but not STEW!!!

                        It would definitely be a bad idea to use a baby bear for bear stew.   They are too sweet and you just can't have that much sugar In a stew!

                        Maybe you could cut your recipe and use a Baby Bear.  I know where you can find one and you could use the TX Traveling Circus as bait.
